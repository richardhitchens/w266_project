MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Accenture fourth quarter fiscal 2010 earnings
conference call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. We will take questions at the end of the conference.
[Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over
to our host, managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Richard Clark. Please go ahead, sir.
Richard Clark, Managing Director – Investor Relations
Thank you, Tammy. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2010 earnings
announcement.
As the operator just mentioned, I'm Richard Clark, managing Director of Investor Relations. With me this afternoon are
Bill Green, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've
had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.
Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Bill will begin with an overview of our results; Pam will take you
through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational
metrics for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Bill will then provide insights on what we're seeing in the market
and how we are positioning our business for future growth. Pam will then provide our business outlook for the first
quarter and full fiscal year 2011, and then we will take your questions.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenues.

Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking and you thank you should keep in mind that these
forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include but are not
limited to general economic conditions, and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the risk
factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K, and other SEC filings.
During our call today we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We provide reconciliations of those measures to GAAP in our news release or on the
Investor Relations section of our website, at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the
information presented on this conference call.
Now, let me turn the call over to Bill.
William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Richard and thanks everyone for joining us today. I am both pleased with and proud of our performance in
fiscal 2010, as we were able to deliver on the commitments we made earlier in the year. And I am particularly delighted
with our strong performance in the fourth quarter, which further demonstrates not only growth but momentum.
Through the disciplined management of our business we delivered on revenue, achieved strong profitability and
generated exceptionally strong cash flow.
Here are a few of the highlights from the quarter and the full year. Quarterly revenues were 5.4 billion at the high end
of our expected range, even after adjusting for the actual FX impact in the quarter, and annual revenues were 21.6
billion, also within our expected range.
We delivered strong new bookings of 6.5 billion for the quarter, including more than 3.5 billion in consulting bookings
and full year bookings of 25 billion were in the upper end of our guided range.
We expanded operating margin for both the quarter and the full year.
We generated free cash flow of 1.2 billion for the quarter, and 2.9 billion for the year, exceeding the top end of our
annual range by more than 350 million.
We continue to have an exceptionally strong balance sheet with a cash balance of nearly $5 billion and no debt.
We continued to return cash to shareholders, with more than 2 billion of share repurchases during the year, and we just
announced a semi-annual cash dividend of 45 cents, which represents a 20% increase over the semi-annual dividend we
paid earlier this year.
To meet increasing client demand for our services, we continued our focused and aggressive hiring of the absolute best
people in the market. This enabled us to reach an important milestone this quarter as our global head count passed the
200,000 mark.
So we delivered very strong results in the quarter, and have a great forward momentum going into fiscal 2011. More
importantly, looking at our business in the market, we are better positioned for the future than at any time in our
history.
With that, let me turn the call over to Pam who will provide some more detail on the numbers.
Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Bill. Thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased to tell you more about Accenture's fiscal year 2010

We delivered strong revenues and cash flow in the fourth quarter and built further on the positive growth that we posted
up in Q3. Despite the uncertainty we saw one year ago, we met or beat all of the elements included in the original
annual financial outlook we provided a year ago for our fiscal year 2010. As we look forward into our fiscal '11, we are
solidly positioned and well in line with the initial view we provided at our investor and analyst conference on April 8,
almost 6 months ago.
Unless I state otherwise, all figures are GAAP, except the items that are not part of the financial statements, or that are
calculations.
New bookings for the fourth quarter were 6.5 billion, and reflect a negative 1% foreign exchange impact compared
with new bookings in the fourth quarter last year. Consulting bookings were 3.5 billion, and outsourcing bookings were
3.0 billion.
New bookings for the full fiscal year were 25 billion, toward the upper end of our projected range of 23 to 26 billion.
They reflect a positive 3% foreign exchange impact compared with new bookings for fiscal '09. Consulting bookings
for fiscal '10 were 13.6 billion, and outsourcing bookings were 11.4 billion.
We were very pleased with our fourth quarter's consulting bookings, the highest level in seven quarters. In management
consulting our clients are hiring us to help them drive both operational excellence and growth in their businesses.
Demand continues to build around the world and across our operating groups and service lines. We see more projects in
areas such as M&A integration, supply chain and process optimization, risk management, and global operating model
design and demand is increasing in the growth areas of analytics, sales transformation, and new market entry.
In technology consulting, we continue to see very robust demand, with record bookings for the third quarter in a row.
Clients across industries and geographies are seeking sound, unbiased strategies, which they can implement to improve
their technology infrastructures, whether it be data center consolidation, virtualization, application modernization and
renewal, security, or IT governance. The emerging themes are innovation and flexibility, in order to drive down IT
costs, yet flexibly support growth through increased use of the cloud and virtualization.
In systems integration, bookings grew strongly in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal '09. SAP and Oracle
demand is notable, along with custom work on .net and OpenSource platforms. Projects with transformational
objectives are returning, but the work is more often being contracted by release rather than by the full program with a
tighter focus on business cases. As we have been expecting, the volume of work is growing very significantly, as we
continue to proactively and successfully manage and meet demand for the mix of work moving to lower cost locations
in our global delivery network.
Turning to outsourcing, bookings were solid. The duration of outsourcing contracts continues to be shorter, resulting in
smaller deals overall, while the revenue per contract year continues to hold steady.
In technology outsourcing, bookings reflect demand for next-generation infrastructure services as well as for the
consolidation and renewal of application platforms. Both cost optimization and vendor consolidation continue to be
demand drivers. Across the board in technology outsourcing, we are also seeing a sizable increase in the volume of
opportunities, which positions us well for the future.
Our BPO bookings ticked up, and reflect demand for both horizontal and vertical offerings, particularly in North
America and Europe. Client focus on cost takeout continues to drive demand, particularly for finance and accounting,
as well as for procurement and industry-specific processes.
I am pleased with the very solid bookings results, and our ability to achieve our book-to-bill targets for both the quarter
and fiscal year. This positions us well for the fiscal '11 growth we are projecting.
Now turning to revenues, net revenues for the fourth quarter were 5.42 billion, an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars and
8% in local currency from the same period last year. Q4 net revenues reflect a foreign exchange impact of negative 3%.
Our previously guided range of 5.15 to 5.35 billion, assumed an FX impact of negative 5%. If we adjust for the actual
FX impact, our guided range for the quarter would have been 5.25 to 5.45 billion. So our revenues of 5.42 billion were
right at the top of this range.

Consulting revenues for the quarter were 3.1 billion, an increase of 6% in U.S. dollars, and 9% in local currency.
Outsourcing revenues were 2.3 billion, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency. Net revenues for the
full fiscal year were 21.6 billion, flat in U.S. dollars and a decrease of 2% in local currency, above the expected bottom
end of our guided range of negative 3 to positive 1%. Consulting revenues were 12.4 billion, a decrease of 1% in U.S.
dollars and 4% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were 9.2 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars, and flat in
local currency.
I am extremely pleased with how our leaders have driven our business over our fiscal year 2010. As we laid out at our
investor and analyst conference in April, we've been expecting a continued shift of systems integration work, and to a
lesser extent, our application outsourcing work into the global delivery network as clients seek more value for money.
For fiscal '10, we grew head count in our global delivery network which 25%, and at the same time, we grew our
consulting workforce by 7%, to meet growing demand for industry, technology and process skills at the client space.
Turning to our operating groups, we saw growth momentum build nicely in four of our five operating groups. In
Products, growth continued to trend up, and was 16% in local currency in Q4, with strong consulting growth of 18%
and outsourcing growth of 14% in local currency. We saw double-digit growth across all three geographic regions, led
by consumer goods and services; automotive, industrial and transportation services; and retail. Demand continues to be
strong in both consulting and outsourcing for offerings designed to help our clients make their operations more efficient
and cost-competitive. We also see building demand for analytics in our consumer goods and retail practices.
In Financial Services, revenues grew 14% in local currency in Q4, the first quarter of double-digit growth in three
years. Momentum continued to build in consulting, with notable 21% growth, and outsourcing turned to positive
growth for the first time in 6 quarters. Determinations we saw in fiscal '09 have anniversaried. We saw significant
growth across all three geographic regions, particularly in banking and capital markets. As our clients continue to
grapple with the challenging environment, we are responding with services related to post-merger integration, core
banking re-platforming, risk and regulatory compliance, and business model transformation with an emerging demand
for analytics.
In Resources, revenue growth continued to trend up to 9% in local currency in Q4 with strong consulting growth in
energy and natural resources driven by demand for global operating model design, ERP, operational excellence, and
smart grid related projects. Outsourcing growth in Resources reflected client programs for cost takeout in IT, and
financial business processes.
Communications and High Tech has turned the corner to growth, the first in seven quarters. Revenues increased 7% in
local currency in Q4, led by strong growth in consulting. Consulting activity in C&HT was driven by globalization,
cost takeout, customer acquisition and retention, as well as by clients deploying new technologies in support of
increasing wireless product demand. Outsourcing revenues in C&HT were flat as we are just about through the
anniversary of the fiscal '09 cancellations.
In Health and Public Service revenues declined 8% in local currency in the fourth quarter, driven by a decline in
consulting revenues in public service, as uncertainty and challenges in the public sector remain, particularly in the U.S,
the U.K., and other parts of Europe. Outsourcing revenue grew in Q4 and was primarily driven by demand within
health and U.S. federal. We expect the revenues in public service will bottom out during fiscal '11 as we reposition that
business. I would add we saw strong bookings in Health and Public Service, the largest in 8 quarters, primarily driven
by health.
In summary, these revenue results put us on a growth trajectory which is in line with our fiscal '11 expectations.
Moving down the income statement, for the fourth quarter gross margin was 34%, compared with 32.3% in the same
period last year, a 170 basis point expansion. Gross margin for the full year was 33.6%, compared with 31.7% in fiscal
'09, a 190 basis point expansion. Sales and marketing costs for the fourth quarter were 698 million, or 12.9% of net
revenues, compared with 552 million, or 10.7% of net revenues in the same period last year, an increase of 220 basis
points. And sales and marketing costs for the full year were 2.7 billion, or 12.3% of net revenues compared with 2.2
billion or 10.0% of net revenues in fiscal '09, an increase of 230 basis points.

This increase in both quarterly and full year gross margin results, offset by a corresponding increase in sales and
marketing expense, was primarily due to the implementation of our sales effectiveness model put in place at the start of
fiscal '10. This had no overall impact on reported operating expense or operating margin. The additional increase in
sales and marketing costs of 50 and 40 basis points, in the fourth quarter and full year respectively, reflected our efforts
to invest in building our pipeline this fiscal year.
General and administrative costs for the fourth quarter were 433 million, or 8.0% of net revenues, flat with 433 million,
or 8.4% of net revenues in the same period last year, a decrease of 40 basis points. G&A costs for the full year were
1.67 billion, or 7.7% of net revenues, compared with 1.79 billion or 8.3% of net revenues in fiscal '09, a decrease of 60
basis points. Lower G&A costs for both the quarter and the year were primarily driven by our efforts to consolidate
office space and lower technology costs. In addition, the full fiscal year comparison reflects a 30 basis point impact
from the fiscal year '09 bad debt provision.
Turning now to operating income, as a reminder, we reported a $253 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter
last year. We are therefore providing a comparison of fiscal '10 results to both the fiscal '09 GAAP results and to the
adjusted fiscal '09 results, adjusted to remove the restructuring charge for operating income and operating margin.
Operating income for the fourth quarter was 714 million, reflecting a 13.2% operating margin. This compares with 420
million or 8.2% operating margin for the same period last year. Without the restructuring charge, operating income for
the fourth quarter last year would have been 672 million, or 13.1% of net revenues.
Full year operating income of 2.9 billion, reflected a 13.5% operating margin, compared with 2.6 billion or a 12.3%
operating margin for fiscal '09. Without the restructuring charge, full year operating income for fiscal '09 would have
been 2.9 billion, or 13.4% of net revenues. Although we originally planned to have no operating margin expansion in
fiscal '10, these results reflect 10 basis points of expansion when compared to last year's adjusted results for both the
fourth quarter and the full year.
Four of our operating groups delivered strong results in operating income and margin in the fourth quarter. The
operating income in Health and Public Service was negatively impacted by higher selling costs and lower contract
profitability in parts of the public service portfolio.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.8%, the year to date effective tax rate was 29.3%, in line with our
annual guided range of 29 to 30%.
Net income for the fourth quarter was 510 million, compared with 306 million in the same period last year which was
reduced by 189 million related to the after-tax impact of the restructuring charge. For the full year, net income was 2.06
billion, compared with 1.94 billion in the previous fiscal year.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were 66 cents, compared with fourth quarter fiscal '09 EPS of 39 cents. This
increase in EPS breaks down as follows: a 24-cent increase reflecting the impact of last year's restructuring charge; a
6-cent increase from higher revenue and operating income in local currency; and a 1 cent increase from a lower share
count; offset by a 2-cent decrease from unfavorable foreign exchange rates; and a 2-cent decrease from a higher
effective income tax rate.
For the full fiscal year, diluted earnings per share were $2.66, compared with fiscal '09 EPS of $2.44 and were above
where we expected to be within our guided range of 2.61 to 2.69. The year-over-year increase in EPS breaks down as
follows: a 24-cent increase reflecting the impact of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter last year; a
7-cent increase from a lower share count; and a 6-cent increase from favorable foreign exchange rates; offset by a
4-cent decrease from lower revenue and operating income in local currency; a 1-cent decrease from lower
reorganization benefits; a 3-cent decrease from lower non-operating items; and a 7-cent decrease from a higher
effective income tax rate.
Now let's turn to some key parts of our cash flow and balance sheet. Free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong
1.15 billion, an increase of 179 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal '09, resulting from cash from operating
activities of 1.25 billion, net of property and equipment additions of 102 million.

For the full fiscal year, flee cash flow was 2.85 billion. This was $350 million above the top end of our previously
guided range, resulting from cash from operating activities of 3.09 billion, net of property and equipment additions of
238 million. This strong free cash flow continued to be primarily driven by lower than expected days services
outstanding or DSOs of 30 days. Which were slightly higher than the 28 days in Q3 and at the end of August last year.
Our cash balance at August 31st was 4.8 billion, compared with 4.5 billion at August 31st last year.
Turning to some key operational metrics, we ended the year with global head count of approximately 204,000 people.
Our global delivery network grew from 93,000 people at the beginning of the fiscal year and ended with over 116,000
people. In Q4, our utilization was 86%, down 200 basis points from Q3, and more in line with our targeted level.
Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 17%, flat with Q3, but up from 10% in Q4 last year.
Let me turn now to how we are returning cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed about
19 million shares for 738 million at an average price of $39.03 per share including about 17 million shares repurchased
in the open market. This was the highest dollar volume of quarterly share repurchases in over 3 years.
For the full year, we repurchased or redeemed 52 million shares, for about 2.1 billion, at an average price of $40.01 per
share including about 25 million shares repurchased in the open market. At August 31st, we had 2.9 billion of share
repurchase authority remaining.
Earlier today we announced that our board of directors has declared a semi-annual cash dividend of 45 cents per share.
This dividend will be paid on November 15th, 2010. This represents a 7.5 cents per share, or 20%, increase over the
previous semi-annual dividend we declared in March.
As a reminder of our dividend policies, the board has established this year's annual dividend target now that fiscal year
'10 results are known. The board has declared the first half today. This year's second semi-annual dividend will be
declared at our Q2 earnings call.
In summary, we had a strong quarter, ending the year where we expected, with clear momentum as we enter into fiscal
'11. I am very proud of Accenture people and their tremendous ability to drive our business in a way that serves our
clients and shareholders as well.
Now Bill will give you a sense of what we see on the horizon and then I will finish up with our business outlook for
fiscal 2011.
William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you. Pam. I just wanted to take a moment to update you on what we see out there and what we're doing to drive
our business forward.
First, I feel very positive about our business. The competence and depth of our leadership team, our global coverage,
our unique industry skills and know-how and our great clients are second to none. FY 10 was a challenging year with
strong and shifting headwinds. We navigated through it exceptionally well and we executed with confidence and with
discipline. Delivering these results with the challenges we faced in the market, you have to ask yourself, what can we
do when the wind is at our backs? And if you combine that with the fact that we are better positioned than ever in our
history, I think we'll be taking Accenture to the next level. And it won't be because it just happens, it will be because
we make it happen. So although there's still economic uncertainty in some markets around the world, our strong results
in Q4 on top of Q3 show that we're on the move as we predicted we would be earlier in the year. We have great
opportunity ahead of us.
As you'll recall, we're driving growth on three dimensions. First, our core business, this includes the vast majority of
our consulting, technology, and outsourcing services. Our leading management consulting capability truly sets us apart.
We continue to broaden our services and are tackling our clients' most important and critical challenges. In technology,
we are uniquely well positioned and we are actively bringing the rapidly building technology wave to life at clients

around the world. And in BPO, we continue to invest in our core business as well as new offerings that combine our
management consulting and BPO capabilities together for powerful outcomes for our clients.
The second dimension is our new initiatives in businesses, which include analytics, digital marketing, mobility, smart
grid and many other products and services we're building within and on top of our core. We have great traction in these
areas.
And finally, our third dimension of growth, geographic expansion where we have a two-pronged focus on emerging
fast-growing markets, as well as on capturing increased growth and profit in our most developed and mature markets.
Our growth agenda is exciting, but just as important is the position that we're starting from. In a challenging economic
environment, we set a plan and delivered on it. We have consistent growing momentum across the board. Our clients
include 93 of the Fortune Global 100 companies, and we're serving them in more than 120 countries. We now have 100
Diamond Clients across the globe. We passed the 200,000 employee mark and are getting the absolute best people.
We're harvesting the substantial investments we've made in training, offerings and assets over the past few years. So all
of that should give you a good sense of how well positioned for the future we believe we are.
Now Pam will provide our business outlook for fiscal 2011.
Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Bill. Before I go into our fiscal year 2011 business outlook, I'd like to share with you some thoughts on
how we are looking forward to this fiscal year.
The economic picture is still quite uncertain with a mix of positive and negative news that continues to change around
the world. This is not lost on us. We know we need to stay very close to what generates value for money for our clients,
and to manage our business tightly.
As we've done in previous fiscal years, we plan to provide annual guidance in the areas we have in the past and we will
update you on these measures quarterly. We will continue to provide quarterly guidance for revenues so that you have a
basis for understanding our level of business by quarter as we progress throughout year.
Turning first to our assumptions for the impact of foreign exchange, at this point we expect the impact of foreign
exchange, based on how rates have fluctuated over the last couple of weeks, to be a negative 1% on our results in U.S.
dollars for fiscal '11, compared with fiscal '10. As we have done in the past, we will update the foreign exchange
assumption each quarter based on how the rates are trending compared to fiscal '10.
For the full fiscal year '11, we are targeting new bookings to be in the range of 25 to 28 billion. We are expecting
outsourcing bookings, which are lumpy, as you know, to be relatively lighter in the first quarter and for bookings
overall to grow throughout the year.
Turning to revenue, as we stated last quarter, and at our investor and analyst conference on April 8, we continue to
expect net revenue for the full fiscal year '11 to grow in a range of 7 to 10% in local currency over fiscal '10. In fiscal
year '11 we expect operating margin to be in a range of 13.6 to 13.7%, a 10 to 20 basis point expansion. We will
continue to balance profitability with making investments to position our business for the future. You should expect
some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as you've seen in the past.
We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 28 to 29%. For earnings per share, we expect full year
diluted EPS for fiscal '11 to be in the range of $3.00 to $3.08. This represents 13 to 16% growth which is a tick up from
the 12 to 15% growth target that we provided at our investor and analyst conference in April.
Now let's turn to cash flow. For the full fiscal year, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of 2.7 to 2.9
billion, property and equipment additions to be 340 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of 2.4 to 2.6 billion.

To update you on our thinking for uses of cash, first, we will continue pursuing tactical acquisitions in support of the
growth strategy Bill outlined. In addition, we remain committed to return cash to shareholders. We now expect to
reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by at least 3% in fiscal '11 and to return to shareholders at least
2.6 billion through share repurchases and dividends. This may change as we continue to evaluate our uses of cash
during the year.
Finally, turning to the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of 5.6 to 5.8 billion. This assumes a foreign
exchange impact of negative 3%, compared to the first quarter in fiscal '10.
As we begin fiscal year '11, we are focused on driving profitable revenue growth, building share in the addressable
market for our services around the world, developing talent across the globe, maintaining a strong balance sheet and, as
always, generating significant free cash flow.
With that, let's open it up so that Bill and I can take your questions. Richard?
Richard Clark, Managing Director – Investor Relations
Thanks, Pam. I would ask that you each keep your questions limited to one question and one follow-up to allow as
many participants as possible to ask questions. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?

[Operator Instructions]. We'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Hi. Thanks so much, great quarter. I wanted to ask about the consolidated bookings first.
That was up a lot sequentially in the fourth quarter and Pam you gave a lot of good reasons. But I'm curious, typically
we see a decline in the fourth quarter and it was actually up quite a bit sequentially here in the fourth quarter. Any pull
forward or anything unusual that we need to consider here in terms of the run rate of bookings that we saw in the fourth
quarter?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: There's nothing that unusual about it. I think it's a strong bookings
number, as you said, in consulting, tried to give the color, clearly momentum there. I think they were like – certainly
the best we have in recent memory, at least seven quarters, I think.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Yeah, good, nothing unusual. So just on the margin side, as my follow-up, the margin
expansion for fiscal '11, the 10 to 20, can you discuss the dynamics of the gross margin versus SG&A line and how that
might map out for the year?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, as you know, we manage the business to operating margin,
and we'll continue to do so, and so it's really all the levers, Tien-Tsin. I mean, it's what we do with pricing, what we do
with cost to serve. We're going to be continuing to drive G&A down; we have initiatives to do that. And we're also
looking to make our selling costs more efficient this year.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Okay, good stuff, thanks a lot.

<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Yes, Rod Bourgeois here with Bernstein. Hey guys, a big milestone to be over 200,000 people
now at Accenture, congratulations on that. I wanted to look at the demand environment. It's nice to see the guidance
that you set in April being left intact, despite all the macro worries that are out there. Can you give us some more
specifics on your bookings outlook? So your bookings guidance for fiscal '11 calls for zero to 12% bookings growth.
Can you give us an idea of what assumptions are tied to the bottom and the upper end of that range? Can you tell us
what assumptions would be required to get to the low end versus the high end?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I mean I'll just try to give you a little color here, Rod. I think
it's about 1% at the bottom in local currency. And I think the first thing is that we of course are coming into the year
strong, with Q4 bookings being strong. We also have 14% more actually contracted already in local currency than we
had as we started this year. And there's also all these factors around duration that we mentioned in terms of contract
durations getting shorter in outsourcing and also just the system integration, the way that's booking more in chunks,
release chunks versus full programs. I think there's a bunch of those dynamics that are in there. And we did test this
with a book-to-bill in terms of meeting, you know, the low end to the high end of the revenue range that we gave you.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: But to get to the upper end of the bookings range, would duration in consulting and outsourcing
need to rise over the next year in order to get to that level?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: We didn't really take that into account. I think it's more just what we
see in the pipeline and then just kind of risk adjusting that in terms of the range. As you know, we usually do give a $3
billion range in bookings when we start the year.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Okay, great. And then Bill, I wonder if you could comment on the demand environment in
Europe versus the U.S. It seems that some decision making in Europe may be a little slower, but it seems also that the
big companies in Europe seem to be continuing to invest after being on a hiatus last year. But can you give us any
specificity on how confident you are in demand in Europe holding up compared to in the U.S, which has been very
strong?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we've been pleasantly surprised by the
demand in Europe, because every day you read in the paper you see something and you start to worry. But frankly, the
big companies operate on a pan-European or on a global stage. Elements of their business are doing exceptionally well
and people are, you know, if you look – people might be a little slow on their hiring, but they're not slow on the capital
expenditures, either. I mean, people are investing in their business, and you know, frankly, they're going to pick two or
three things that are going to be fundamentally important and they're going to do those and that's what we're trying to
be aligned with. So we're – we feel a lot better about Europe than what you read in the newspaper.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: All right. And on that note, Bill, Pam mentioned something about 14% more is booked heading
into the upcoming fiscal year. Is that part of what gives you confidence in Europe, that you've already got a strong
backlog that ensures some growth in Europe even if things in the macro environment sort of deteriorate over the next
year?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think it's everything, Rod. It's the
bookings, but it's also the pipeline and the level of activity. It's sort of the whole food chain from idea to getting a piece
of business. And the activity is strong, of course we've got great penetration and a great brand there. And so we just
continue to see momentum in that market, even though each country has its own set of challenges.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: All right, thanks, guys.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you, Rod.

<Q - Adam Frisch>: Thanks, good afternoon, guys. So it's good that demand is really kicking in for you guys and in
areas of higher margin businesses. I'm wondering if this momentum is allowing you to accelerate investments or maybe
get more aggressive in some of the growth platforms and initiatives that you spoke to at the analyst day and continue to
speak to on your earnings calls?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I guess first I'd say, we're working hard for
the business, Adam. I mean, demand kicking in, just sounds...
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: It sounds easy.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It sounds easier than it is. I think importantly we
refreshed and renewed our core business in terms of the assets and the offerings, and the stuff that we're driving in the
market with is right on point with what people are needing today and whether it's on the talent side of their business,
whether it's on the supply chain side of their business, whether it's on the global operating model side of the business.
The things we're looking to add, you know, fuel to that fire are some of those initiatives, which we now have had
whether it's mobility or analytics, smart grid we've had underway for 12 to 24 months now. So we see those things start
to get up to altitude. There's about 22 specific initiatives there that we're driving across the business. And each of those
have traction and not only have it in the developed markets but we're seeing demand in the developing markets as well.
So I think we've got that pretty much in our sights and we feel good about our plan for FY 11 in terms of what we
continue to invest. Not only in money, but in talent, in driving those things in the market.
<Q - Adam Frisch>: Great, that's a good segue to my follow-up question and it goes to hiring and what areas are you
hiring most aggressively whether it be skill set or geography?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, you know, it's hard to say. I mean, we're
frankly, if you look across the board, I mean we're bringing people in in most of the geographies we have around the
world.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Obviously, we're hiring people in our consulting
business, and we're able to get, you know, the absolute best people in the management consulting space. We're able to
bring those in. In fact, we just had a big group in St. Charles this week that are very seasoned and experienced people
from the market who have just joined Accenture. And then of course Pam mentioned the numbers for the global
delivery network. But the ramping there, you know, that's on fire down there in terms of bringing people in and again,
we're able to get really good talent.
So our recruiting engine, which we had on idle for a year, you know, is back at sort of full throttle at this point. And the
good news there's some great people in the market that we're able to bring on board.
<Q - Adam Frisch>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Good job.

<Q - Bryan Keane>: Yeah, hi. I guess, Bill, I was just curious to know if you had any kind of long-term top line

about, well, the economy is still a little bit slower but they are going over easier come. If you could just help us think
about the longer term for Accenture?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I mean we look at the 7 to 10, our mental
model is more over a business cycle. What stakes we put in the ground, that's stuff we all decide as we go. But the first

thing to us is we're getting momentum back and that's the thing we feel good about. We are now on a trajectory which
we thought we would be, and in honesty hoped we would be as we move into this fiscal year. 10% of a big number is a
big number, as I say to our guys, and to grow the business 10% a year is a lot of work, it's a lot of people. You think
about the recruiting, you think about the coverage. But I would say this, you know, the opportunities are out there and I
think we can grow in a high quality way, you know, within our 7 to 10 band, and that's the mission that we're going to
stay on.
<Q - Bryan Keane>: And why is Accenture able to grow almost double than the industry average?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You know, it's not about the industry growth rate.
It's not about GDP growth rates. It's not about all those things. It's about having offerings that deliver business results,
and if there's one thing everyone should have learned from the downturn, it's value for money has become the premium.
And having ideas and assets, having offerings that deliver business results, and do it in the near term, as opposed to 3 or
4 or 5 years out, has been where the clients are drifting, and so as we refreshed our consulting offerings, they're all
about delivering real value, and a lot of our technology work now, we sell it based on the business outcome we deliver
as opposed to just the service we provide. And I think that gives us an incredible differentiator in the market where our
clients are not willing to go.
<Q - Bryan Keane>: Okay, and just a quick one for Pam. The operating margins in the Health and Public Service
obviously are lower. What is that outlook going forward for that business?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, as I said, I think it will bottom out this year, and we're looking
for it to be back on track by next fiscal year.
<Q - Bryan Keane>: Okay. All right, great. Well, terrific quarter, and great guidance.

Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Julio.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Julio.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Hey, Pam; hey, Bill, how are you guys? Real quickly, just to go back to the demand
comments, just trying to sort of balance between – find a balance between sort of normal strength and seasonality and
spending into the end of the year versus your ability to sustain the growth as you go into 2011, and I guess to some
extent, if you could also add some comments in there about what you guys might be seeing on 2011 budgets, any
visibility there? I guess what I'm trying to do is make sure we're not mistaking just normal strength and seasonality to
the end of this year versus the ability to sustain the growth rate into next year.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, you know, I guess I have a hard time
relating to the seasonality thing, necessarily. Because the nature of the work we're doing, especially the consulting side,
you know, are things people do once every 5 years, right, as opposed to something that comes along. And so when you
stand back from it, I think the quality and nature of the work are stuff that deliver real business outcomes, and we think
a lot of this demand we went and created. And we created it by having very specific offerings that deal with specific
problems and specific industries. And so as part of realigning our sales agenda and refocusing on the market, and as a
part of looking at clients as markets, not just clients, where we can bring all of Accenture to them, I think you see some
of that in the fact that even in this downturn, we continue to add Diamond Clients to the firm, which says a lot about
our ability to be a full service provider across their needs, and that's what we've been focused on.

<Q - Julio Quinteros>: That's fair. And then just as a quick follow-up -
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Just on the budget thing -
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Yeah, sure.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You know, budgets aren't soup for next year. But
I would tell you this, if you look at confidence of executives in their business, you know, people have pretty much, you
know, run as long as they can without making major investments. Because the thing is, if the economy does come back,
right, as we've talked about before on this call, it's coming back looking different. And that's what's driving the demand
and business model changes and delivery channel changes and things like that.
And so I think we're going to see consistent budgets for the traditional work, but we're going to see budgets that don't
necessarily come out of IT, but come out of marketing or engineering or manufacturing, to do the new things, you
know, sort of reinvent delivery models, production models and operating models. And so we think that, you know,
2011 is going to be fairly robust in terms of business spending on important initiatives.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Great, thank you. And then just Pam on a quick follow-up, what were the head count targets or
the hiring plan targets for fiscal 2011? I might have missed that.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, no. I didn't give it to you. We hired roughly about 64,000
people this past year, and we see '11 shaping up to be similar.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: And that's a gross number or a net number? Sorry.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: That's the gross, as you guys like to call it.

Karl Keirstead from Kaufman Brothers.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hey, Karl.
<Q - Karl Keirstead>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a question for you, Pam, just about the top line
constant currency guide. It looks like the November quarter constant currency midpoint is about 9% and the comps get
increasingly tougher throughout fiscal '11, so that to get to the 10%, the high end of the full year guide, it feels like
we're going to need some other, you know, boost to the business, and I'm wondering what you can identify what that
could be? Perhaps it's anniversarying some of the outsourcing renegotiation, stuff like that? Maybe a little color just
given that the seasonality may not get us there?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I mean the guidance for the first quarter in local currency is 7
to 11%, as you said. And certainly, we're pushing as hard as we can in that range. So look for that. And then I think as
you look forward, there are some of the anniversary things kind of finishing up, so that's in the mix. And I think that we
just have more visibility into the year, as I mentioned before, in terms of 14% more contracted. So we've looked at the
pipeline and sort of how that's expected to shape up over the year, and as the stuff starts, and – we're very comfortable
at this point with the trajectory.
<Q - Karl Keirstead>: Good. And if I could ask a quick follow-up again, Pam. You called out the fact that
outsourcing bookings could be a little light in the November quarter. I notice that they're usually light in the November
quarter, and I'm wondering, were you just calling out normal seasonality, or is there something else going on that's
worth addressing?

Tim Fox from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Tim Fox>: Hi, thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hey, Tim.
<Q - Tim Fox>: I guess, Bill, first question, in looking at Financial Services, it's obviously been a very strong vertical
for you and the industry broadly. And if you could just comment on the pipeline there, we've seen a lot of post-M&A
integration work, and that may be tailing off for the industry in general. But talk about what's driving the business in
fiscal '11 with Financial Services, and is there any risk at all to that tailing off?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I mean, I don't see the M&A thing tailing
off. In fact, it may accelerate as time goes on as some of the financial services institutions that are still somewhat
challenged, you know, 600 banks, or however they put it, you know, get redistributed, if you will. The regulatory and
risk stuff is very high. I mean, you can't get enough talent, you can't get enough coverage. There's just huge demand on
that dimension.
And then I think the other thing that we knew was coming, was, the operating models are changing, right? And as the
banks sort of get their game back and decide how they're going to differentiate, they really start to think about new
delivery mechanisms for products and services, and enhanced ability to reach consumers, and so it drives things in
marketing and it drives things in customer service and things in distribution, and it drives really the demand for whole
new platforms that are able to sort of operate in a more modern way than some of the architecture under the hood of
these big financial services institutions is 20 years old, and what they do with it, they're pretty much at the end of its
useful life.
<Q - Tim Fox>: Great, that's helpful. And Pam, on the follow-up, could you talk a little about the pricing environment,
and within your guidance, are you embedding any pricing power at all in fiscal '11, or is it still too early to start pulling
that lever?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I mean the pricing environment remains competitive. I would
say it's also consistent. And in terms of how we look at it is, we did give salary increases this year. Last year was sort of
a down year for that, as it was probably everywhere. And so in our pricing, we're looking to make sure that we cover
those salary increases and get it in the pricing.

<Q - Moshe Katri>: Hey, thanks, nice quarter. Pam, you said that you've seen a notable increase in demand for SAP
and Oracle during the quarter. Can you kind of elaborate a bit on that? What's incremental, what's different than what
you've seen in the past few years, maybe in the past few quarters? Thanks.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Moshe let me wade into that, because I
spend a lot of time on and around that. You know, I think as we always keep saying, you know, everyone must have
one of these, but it turns out they don't. There's till companies, you know, engaging in big enterprise transformations.
We still have a few R2s that we're replacing with sort of the latest versions of software. We're seeing more activity
around sort of the business user piece of SAP, for instance, so a lot of the pieces around the fringe as it relates to
analytics, as it relates to mobility, as it relates to getting insight instead of just information. And I think everybody has
tried to leverage the investments they've made historically, getting better business results.
So there's two kinds of things. There's the traditional business, which is putting in the big industrial-strength global
systems, and we've got a lot of those going on. But there's also how do you leverage and get more out of what you've
invested in, where people are taking advantage of other features and new features of the certain software. And then
frankly, there's some amount of them that swap, you know, one for another, depending on mergers and acquisitions,
and things that happen in the marketplace as they move to standardize on one platform from two different ones, you
know, given two companies that are now one. There's a lot of demand to just help them through that journey. You
know, most of these are multi-year journeys as well, so it continues to – even though the work doesn't come all at once,
it has a lot of staying power over time.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: And is that – does that also embed any sort of new license sales, which is something that we
haven't seen for quite some time, or not yet?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, no, I've seen new license sales across the
board, both in terms of the whole enterprise, all-you-can-eat purchases, as well as people selling additional software
capabilities and upgrades around the edge. So, you know, I see some demand for that. I see people making investments
to upgrade their capability, which does include some amount of new license sales.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: That's helpful. Then the follow-up, Pam, the 64,000 in new gross addition for fiscal year 2011,
should we assume that the majority of these will be actually hired in some of your offshore locations, which is what I
think you've done in fiscal year 2010?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I think you're right, Moshe, that the majority were there, but
we did hire pretty nearly everywhere, including a lot in the U.S. But yeah, I believe it is the majority that did go into the
global delivery network.

maybe should have fell into May fell into August? Because then obviously you start to think ahead to November, when
we typically see a quarter-over-quarter uptick in bookings on the consulting front and not sure if that's going to be
plausible this year, again depending upon how pent-up demand actually played out here in August.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: I don't think there's anything structural, Jason. I really don't. It is
true that we did have a very strong end of August in the sense that a lot came in that might have come in in September.
So there might be a little bit of that on the margin, but there isn't – there is not anything structural.
<Q - Jason Kupferberg>: Okay. So in fiscal '11, you would expect sort of traditional seasonality to prevail?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, such that it is.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Jason Kupferberg>: Right. Well, I mean, Q4 has always been a down quarter in consulting bookings, right,
sequentially?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Just the nature of it, but I think the other word
you used is 'funky'. And there's no question, right, that this has been a peculiar year in terms of predictability and
patterns, right? There's different people are getting – you know, becoming profiles in courage at different times in the
client base. But you know, directionally, it's moving in the right direction.
<Q - Jason Kupferberg>: Okay. And then just on the constant currency revenue growth, I know you don't guide
explicitly by geographic region, but can you give us some directional sense of how you see the 7 to 10 playing out
among the three geographies at least in terms of relative contribution to that overall growth rate?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: As you saw, all 3 regions grew in the fourth quarter, and so we
expect the trajectory to continue, I'm sure there will be some variation and I think that we are also expecting the mix of
consulting and outsourcing to be roughly the same as it was this year.
<Q - Jason Kupferberg>: Okay, understood. Thank you.

Ed Caso from Wells Fargo.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Ed.
<Q - Edward Caso>: Hi, Ed Caso. Thanks for taking my question. Are you seeing any vendor consolidation in the
various markets, and is that helping you or hurting you, or is it contributing to any of your success of late?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think Pam mentioned somewhere in the
50 pages of her script, I think she mentioned the words 'vendor consolidation'. And in fact, it is. I mean, it has really for
the past three quarters, probably. You know, first we had people that were looking outside and you know, we talked
about framework agreements, a few quarters ago. And those, you know, are things that many times are from a vendor
consolidation initiative, and then, you know, since that time people continue to embark on that journey when they
finally have 50 or 60 or 70 providers, some places, you know many more than that in terms of local body shops. And
people are just trying to get, you know, more focus on a few strategically important relationships where they make an
investment in the supplier, and the supplier makes an investment in them. And those things usually at the end of the
day, you know, many of those go our way.
<Q - Edward Caso>: You mentioned body shops and not chop shops. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit on
the political front. Are your clients nervous about using you or going to you because they're nervous about all the
anti-offshoring rhetoric at the moment?

<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It certainly has heated up in the last, you know,
few weeks until the Senate put a plug in it, you know, yesterday, I guess. But frankly, no. I mean, you know, everyone's
been to this movie before. I was with 82 CEOs of U.S. companies two weeks ago. These people are just solving for
being competitive. Frankly, they're going to do what they need to do to compete on the global stage. And I think that
this outsourcing broadly and leveraging offshore capabilities is a business practice that is here to stay and I think
everybody is pretty much focused on it. So I know there's a lot of noise around that. But you know, frankly, I think
what businesses is more concerned about is trade policies and they're concerned about regulatory things that challenge
their ability to compete as a company on the global stage. And this outsourcing, offshoring, what have you, doesn't
seem to be anything that registers on their radar at all.
<Q - Edward Caso>: Thank you.
<A - Richard Clark, Managing Director – Investor Relations>: Operator, we have time for one more question.

It will come from Joseph Foresi, Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Hello. I'm going to try to still squeeze two in here. My first one, I know you talked about this
14% contracted already for this year. Maybe you could just give us some context on how that compares to what you
normally get historically? Obviously, you know, last year was a little bit different. Just on a historical basis if you could
frame that for us?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, it was 14% more...
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Okay.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: ...contracted than we had last year. So it's a delta over a base of
business, which you know, we have a substantial part contracted when we begin any year. It just was that much over
what we had last year in terms of the revenue projection.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Okay. So how would you describe your visibility this year maybe versus what you typically
have historically?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: It's better.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Much better, okay. And then just the last one here, I know you gave those financial objectives
back in April. Obviously the guidance has moved up on the EPS side. But maybe you could talk about, has anything
changed over the last 6 months that you've seen in the demand environment side of things?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I think the demand environment, as you can see by the fourth
quarter, we came in stronger than the midpoint. And the bookings were strong, the consulting bookings were strong. So
there's even a little more momentum even than we hoped we'd have at this point. So I think that is good in that sense. I
mean, it's always in the context of what continues to be an unpredictable environment in a lot of ways, and the news
has got all these swings in it. But just in terms of our pipeline and how our business is shaping up, it's a little better.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Thanks. Congratulations.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks. Let me just say a couple can things in
closing. First, I'm just delighted with our Q4 performance and our year overall. I think it shows both superior execution,
which is what we were really focused on, and it also shows growing momentum. We're incredibly positive about the
future, but we know we're going to have to work very hard for it.
Before I wrap up, I do want to take a moment and mention just a few changes we're making in our IR, and finance
teams. Richard Clark, who has been sitting here next to me for four years now, and is head of Investor Relations is
going to be moving into the role of Controller after we file our 10-K. Tony Colon, who has been our Controller and
