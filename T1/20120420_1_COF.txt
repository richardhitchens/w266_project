Now I will turn the call over to Mr Perlin. Gary?
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Jeff. And good afternoon to everyone listening to the call. I will start by providing a few highlights from the
quarter on slide three. Capital One earned $1.4 billion or $2.72 per share in the first quarter of 2012. Without impacted
bargain purchase gain related to ING Direct acquisitions, first quarter net income would have been $809 million or
$1.56 per share.
Earnings from continuing operations excluding the bargain purchase gaain would have been $911 million or $1.76 per
share. Beside from the ING Direct bargain purchase gain, the increase in winter quarter earnings was primarily driven
by higher revenue and lower non-interest and provision expenses in our legacy businesses.
Higher legacy revenue was driven in part by increased average loan balances and favorable net interest margin. First
quarter revenue also includes a $160 million benefit related to our sale of Visa stock and subsequent reserve
adjustments and the absence of about $150 million of unique contra-revenue items recorded in the fourth quarter. These
benefits were partially offset by a $75 million accrual for upcoming refunds we expect to provide customers in our
Domestic Card business, which you'll hear more about from Rich in a moment.
Overall non-interest expenses inclusive of ING Direct related expenses, decreased $114 million quarter-over-quarter.
The decrease was due to about a $100 million in seasonally lower marketing spend and a modest decrease in legacy
operating expenses.
Although, run rate legacy operating expenses fell to just over $2.0 billion and a there were no significant one-time
expenses in Q1 as there were in the fourth quarter. We recorded mortgage Rep & Warranty expense of a $169 million
in the quarter of which a $153 million was booked in discontinued operations. A majority of this expense relates to a
settlement one of our subsidiaries made with a government sponsored enterprise to resolve present and future Rep &
Warranty repurchase claims.
Although we had already reserved in prior quarters for most of this outcome, we increased our reserve by $95 million
to account in the final settlement amount. This settlement amount has now been paid to the GSE. So you will see the
impact of that payment in the second quarter reserve calculation.
This settlement resolves the bulk of our GSE Rep & Warranty exposure. Strong credit performance lead to a $288
million decrease in provision expense in the quarter driven by both a lower level of charge-offs and a larger allowance
release.
I'll address these specific impacts of ING Direct on our first quarter earnings which are listed on slide three, by looking
at the table on slide four.
Looking at slide four, we expect to provide a similar view for the impact of HSBC's US card business in the second
quarter. With the operations of the two businesses quickly become integrated, we will no longer be able to split ING
Direct or HSBC out from the rest of our financials beyond the quarter in which each acquisition is closed.
Q1 revenue was impacted by the close of the ING Direct acquisition in mid February and by half quarter of ING Direct
operations. The impact was largest in non-interest income where we recognized the bargain purchase gain of $594
million at close. The gain was driven largely by the substantial decline in long-term interest rates which began shortly
after we announced the acquisition of ING Direct last June.

As you know we put on a swap position early last August designed to protect the positive impact of those lower rates
and the fair value of ING Direct's assets. The mark-to-market loss on that partial hedge from inception to close was
$355 million of which $78 million was realized in the first quarter.
The non-interest expense attributed to ING Direct includes both normal operating expenses poor about at half quarter
along with ING Direct transaction and merger related expenses recorded in the quarter.
Now if we turn to slide five, you will see the significant impact of ING Direct on Capital One's balance sheet. As you
can see, the acquisition of of ING Direct on February 17th added about $20 billion in cash. Together with Capital One's
stand alone cash position in parts generated by the sale of Capital One investment securities over the last couple of
quarters.
This cash represents a significant portion of the funding being accumulated for the U.S. credit card assets we are about
to acquire from HSBC. The other assets which came with the acquisition of ING Direct is fair value include about $40
billion in mortgage hold on and some $30 billion in the investment securities.
ING Direct's $85 billion of liabilities are almost entirely consumer deposits. For the segment reporting purposes
effective on the close date, ING Direct's loans and deposits are included in our consumer banking segment. Cash and
securities acquired from ING Direct are reported in the other category.
The table on slide five provides balance sheet data as of close date and quarter-end. Now let's take a moment to discuss
the impacts to average balances and yields for the quarter on slide six.
The average loan balances increased in the quarter by almost $21 billion driven largely by the acquisition of ING
Direct mid quarter. In our legacy businesses, average balances is grew by about $2 billion as the modest decline we
experienced in our Domestic Card business due to expected seasonal pay downs which more than offset by growth in
our commercial lending and other finance businesses.
As expected, the on-boarding of ING Direct's lower margin business and our temporarily high cash balances closed to
102 basis point decline in net interest margin this quarter to 6.20%. The intended deployment of cash to fund HSBC's
US card assets in the second quarter will allow us to recapture a significant percentage of the NIM reduction from Q1.
And over the following few quarters, we expect NIM to be back at pre-acquisition levels.
Moving to slide seven. Strong retained earnings growth and capital actions related to
the financing of our two acquisitions lead to a 220 basis point increase in our Tier 1 common ratio in the quarter.
Capital actions in the quarter included settlement of the $2 billion equity forward we executed last July. $2.6 billion of
equity issued to ING Group. And the $140 billion equity raise in March shortly after our planned capital action was
approved by the FED as it's - process. As of March 31, our Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.9%. We
continue to be comfortable with our strong capital levels and our capacity to generate healthy amounts of capital going
forward. We expect the addition of ING Direct and HSBC's U.S.
card portfolio to quickly enhance our earnings trajectory and capital generation.
Now before turning the call over to Rich, I'd like to highlight on slide eight. The significant impacts that we expect the
closing of HSBC's card business will have on our company's financial results in the second quarter, including a
substantial negative effect on both earnings and capital in the quarter.
Since purchase accounting and other material financial statement impacts can only be calculated after closing. We
expect to be able to provide you with detailed information at the end of Q2. For now I can offer a quick overview of the
types of impacts you should expect.
The largest earnings impact from acquiring HSBC's U.S. card business in Q2 almost likely be a significant build in our
allowance for loan losses associated with HSBC's current loans.

Delinquent loans which have lossed revolving privileges will be accounted for under SOPO3-3 and life time credit
mark will be taken against those loans. The fair value of the current loans which we expect to represent the majority of
the acquired HSBC card portfolio will be subject to a FAS 91 mark which in term will come in to revenue overtime.
Starting in the second quarter and extending over several years we expect card expenses and earnings will be affected
by the amortization of PCCR the amount of which will be determined as part of the purchase accounting to be
completed after close. Earnings in the second quarter and beyond will also be affected by transaction and
merger-related expenses and the amortization of other assets and intangibles. We will do our best at the end of the
second quarter to lay out for you not just the upfront impacts of the HSBC close as we've done for ING Direct but also
the on going effect which those impacts will have on subsequent quarter's earnings.
Of course the addition of HSBC's U.S. card assets will add to Capital One's risk weighted assets and together with the
negative impacts of purchase accounting on Q2 income will cause our Tier 1 common ratio to decline in the second
quarter. There are considerable uncertainties surrounding purchase accounting makes it difficult to project exactly
where our Tier 1 common ratio will be at the end of the second quarter, but our current estimate continues to be that the
ratio will be in the mid 9% range.
To the extent that there are any large unanticipated impacts from purchase accounting, their capital impacts are likely to
resolve quickly in the second quarter or in the quarters eagerly following close.
More importantly, we remain fully confident that the HSBC transaction will contribute significantly to the strong
capital generation we expect to realize as a company going forward. With that I'll hand the call over to Rich. Rich?
Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Gary. I'll begin tonight on slide nine. In the first quarter our domestic card business delivered strong profits
improving credit and solid year-over-year growth in loans and purchase volumes. Loans declined seasonally in the
quarter compared to the first quarter of last year loans grew about 5% purchase volumes increased about 15% and our
domestic card business continue to grow and gain market share in new accounts booked. Revenues in revenue margin
declined in the first quarter driven by a one-time reserve addition related to cross-selling. The reserves is for expected
customer refunds associated with instances in which phone sales people didn't adhere to our scripts and sales policies
when cross-selling products to our credit card customers.
The $75 million accrual drove about 50 basis points in the margin reduction in the quarter. Non-interest expense for the
quarter declined as both marketing and operating expenses were lower than in the fourth quarter.
Lower marketing in the first quarter reflects normal quarterly variability and the timing of direct mail and brand
marketing. Credit performance improved in the quarter. First quarter delinquency improvements outpaced industry
trends but it's important to recognize that our first quarter improvement is consistent with the fact that our seasonality is
more pronounced than the industries. The mirror image of last quarter's worsening delinquency trends. Looking
through this seasonality we observed modest underlying delinquency improvements which drove an allowance released
in the quarter. All told the domestic card business delivered $515 million in net income in the quarter.
We're on track to complete the HSBC U.S. card business acquisition in the second quarter and we expect
merger-related impacts to have a significant effect on domestic card results in the remaining quarters of 2012. We
expect second quarter results to reflect a significant bills and allowance and finance charge and fee reserve as we build
excuse me... as we bring the HSBC domestic card loans on to our balance sheet. We also expect to take a credit mark to
cover expected losses on delinquent loans
that no longer carry revolving privileges. We anticipate the credit mark will absorb most of the HSBC credit losses for
the next couple of quarters artificially lowering the overall charge-off rate at the domestic card segment during that
time. We expect that the domestic card charge-off rate will increase in the fourth quarter of 2012.
In addition to these expected short-term impacts we expect the addition of HSBC loans will affect quarterly trends
across the business. We expect that the continuing run-off of parts of the HSBC portfolio will offset the underlying

growth trajectory of the combined domestic card business resulting in modest overall loan growth rates for this
segment. We expect the domestic... that combined domestic card quarterly revenue margin will decline in the quarters
following the competition of the HSBC acquisition. With the majority of the decline resulting from planned actions to
bring HSBC's customer practices inline with our own.
We expect the phased implementation of these actions to reduce our quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin by about
30 basis point to 35 basis point by the first half of 2013. This actions were planned and included in the expected deal
economic when we announced the acquisition.
Additional factors expected to pressure Domestic Card revenue margin include run-off of higher yielding loan balances
and purchase accounting impact. We expect PCCR amortization will increase Domestic Card non-interest expenses for
several years. And after the short-term moves I described a moment ago playout.
We expect the charge-off rate on the combined card business to reach a level that's around 75 basis points higher than
the standalone charge-off rate for Capital One's Domestic Card business. Despite the noise associated with these
short-term and medium-term impact, we expect that the synergies an ongoing operations of the HSBC US card business
will drive a significant and sustainable increase in Domestic Card earnings.
Turning to slide 10. First quarter results in our consumer banking business reflect the addition of ING Direct as well as
continued to strong other finance performance. The significant increases in loan and deposit volumes, revenue and
non-interest expense were all driven by the addition of ING Direct in the quarter.
We added about $40 billion in ING Direct home loans in the quarter and auto loans grew by about $1.8 billion. Growth
in auto loans resulted from continued traction in geographic expansion and our strategy to deep in relationship with the
most valued auto dealers.
Auto loan originations grew 19% from the prior quarter. We're pleased that we've achieved this growth from
maintaining tight underwriting standards and much of the growth in the first quarter within prime loan. While the pace
of originations growth is likely to moderate, we expect that loans will continue to grow throughout to 2012.
Loan yield decreased with the partial quarter effect of the ING Direct loan portfolio and they're expected to decrease
again in the second quarter with the fourth quarter effect of adding ING loans.
We expect relatively stable consumer banking loan yields after the second quarter. We expect yield increases from the
expected mortgage run-off to be set by yield decreases from our higher massive prime loans in our auto lending
business. We expect that sizable run-off of the ING mortgage portfolio and the continuing run-off of our legacy
mortgage portfolio will more than offset the growth in auto loans driving a declining trend in consumer banking loan
balances for several years. We added just under $85 billion in deposits when we completed the ING Direct acquisition
weighted average deposit interest expense decreased 11 basis points in the quarter the result of disciplined pricing
across our combined deposit franchise and the current rate environment. Provision expense declined with lower
charge-off in both the home loans portfolio and the auto landing business partially offset by an allowance bill driven by
the increase in auto loan balances. The consumer banking business posted net income of $224 million in the quarter
driven by strong auto profitability and a partial quarter of ING Direct run rate profitability partially offset by
amortization of purchase accounting impact.
With continuing growth and profitability in auto lending strong positions in great local banking markets and the
powerful ING Direct deposit franchise with national banking reach the consumer banking business is poised deliver
solid loan-term results.
As you can see on slide 11 our commercial banking business continues to deliver strong and steady performance. Loan
volumes increased about 2% in the quarter year-over-year loans increased by about 15% growth in loan commitments
was even stronger. For several quarters we've targeted and achieved the strongest growth in areas in which we built
specialized expertise and capabilities including rent control, multifamily real estate in metro New York city and
selected the C&I industry segment such as energy and commercial finance. Commercial deposits grew 5% in the
quarter and 15% year-over-year with improvements in deposit interest expenses.

Revenues were relatively flat in the quarter but up about 15% from the first quarter of 2011. Non-interest expense
increased in the quarter as we continue to higher bankers and invest in our infrastructure to attract and serve primary
banking relationships. Strong commercial credit performance continued in the quarter. The charge-off rate for the
commercial banking segment was 19 basis points, down 43 basis points in the quarter and 61 basis points from the first
quarter of 2011. The charge-off rate in our commercial lending businesses, which exclude the run-off small ticket CRE
portfolio was actually zero with charge-off rates improving across all of our commercial businesses except small ticket
CRE.
The non-performing asset rate for the commercial banking segment was 1.23% up 6 basis points from the fourth
quarter, but down significantly from the first quarter of 2011. The modest increase in the quarter was driven by a small
handful of CRE loans. We expect continuing strength in commercial credit with some quarterly choppiness in
commercial charge-offs in non-performers.
Net income for the quarter improved significantly to $210 million as the commercial banking business continues to
deliver a meaningful and increasingly important contribution to Capital One's overall results. Turning to slide 12. We
expect that significant run-off portfolios will mute the optics of reported loan growth for Capital One despite strong
underlying growth in our key business.
As I have just discussed, we are delivering strong growth in several key businesses across Capital One. Our auto
finance business continues to gain traction with our strategy to build deep relationships with our most valued auto
dealers and our expansion of this relationship approach to new geographies. In our commercial banking business, our
focused approach to commercial real estate and our deep industry specialization in C&I continues to generate strong
growth in loans and loan commitments.
Capital markets funding for commercial businesses has declined in many foreign banks and non-banks and pull back
from commercial lending. And in our domestic card business, we are gaining gaining share on the level playing field
created by the Card Act in the great recession. Our new products like Venture, Cash and Spark are winning in the
market place. And we are adding customer relationships loans in platforms for future growth with new private label
partnerships like Kohl's and Sony. We expect a completion of the HSBC U.S. card business acquisition will catafalque
us to a leading scale position in the private label partnerships space.
These growth trends have long been partially offset by the impacts of run-off portfolios like installment loans in the
domestic card business. The home loans back book that inherited through our North Fork and Chevy Chase Bank
acquisitions in consumer backing and the small ticket commercial real estate portfolio in commercial banking.
With the acquisition of ING Direct we are adding a significant run-off portfolio of ING mortgages and we expect
portions of the HSBC card portfolio to continue to run-off as well. Over the 12 months beginning with the third quarter
of 2012 we expect around $8.5 billion of mortgage run-off in our consumer banking business and about $1.8 billion of
run-off in portions of our domestic card business. All told, we expect that the run-off portfolios will decline by about
$10.5 billion from the third quarter of this year to the third quarter of the 2013 and will decline by a further $8 billion
through the third quarter of 2014.
Because of this significant run-off, we expect modest overall loan growth for the total company despite strong
underlying loan growth in our auto finance commercial banking and domestic card businesses.
I'll close tonight on slide 13. Capital One continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter of 2012. The most
newsworthy event of the quarter of course was the completion of the ING Direct acquisition. We are thrilled to
welcome the customers and associates of ING Direct to Capital One. We now look forward to completing the
acquisition of the HSBC card business in the second quarter. We continue to believe that both transactions are
financially and strategically compelling and we are as excited about them today as when we announced the deal.
We still have a lot of work to do to integrate them, but as we have got in closer to both ING Direct and the HSBC US
card business, we've been able to affirm that the drivers of financial and strategic value remain very compelling and
inline with our expectations.

The run-rate of the businesses are performing as we expected. And at ING Direct, customers continue to build deposit
balances and there have been no meaningful changes in attrition or customer loyalty measures. We haven't changed our
view of expected synergies and we have been impressed with the talent and culture outfit of both institutions.
By 2013, we expect that deal synergies and the strong underlying earnings power that combine Capital One ING Direct
and HSBC businesses will deliver attractive financial results and EPS accretion. We'll continue to provide purchase
accounting and merger related impact to help bring these underlying trends into view in the second half of 2012.
With the ING Direct integration well underway and the HSBC US card acquisition on track to close in the second
quarter, we're focusing on delivering the financial and strategic upside of these combined company. Because the
acquisitions is such a key source of shareholder value, we're committing all the necessary management time and talent
to executing surefooted and effective integrations.
We're also building a great customer franchise. Capital One is already one of the handful of banks that's building a very
large and loyal customer base. ING Direct brings 7 million loyal early digital adopters with attractive demographics
and HSBC have 27 million active U.S. credit card accounts.
So the acquisitions will strengthen and expand our combined customer base. Overtime, these customer relationships are
a tremendous source of value as we can expand and deepen customer relationships with new products and services. We
have made great strives in delivering a franchise, enhancing customer experience, and we expect to preserve and
leverage the simple compelling ING customer experiences as we continue to build the great customer franchise across
all our business.
The combination of Capital One ING Direct and the HSBC US card business puts us in an even stronger position to
create sustained shareholder value through growth potential, strong return and strong capital generation.
We are focused on delivering that value, including distributing capital to shareholders through a meaningful dividend
and share buyback, consistent with our long standing commitment to maintaining a strong and resilient capital base.
With that Gary and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Norris. [Operator Instructions]. We will take your first question from David Hochstim from
Buckingham Research Group.
David Hochstim
Yeah. Hi. I am wondering could you just clarify what you said about the domestic card revenue margin declining by
then expecting higher charge-offs as well it seems, do you think and then just on the $75 million reserve could you just
explain what happened in terms of product sale?

Okay. So David with respect to the revenue margin, what we are saying is of course if we have a strong revenue margin
at Capital One we are buying a company that also has a kind of comparable strong revenue margin. What we are saying
is that when we... as we plan from the time of the announcement of the deals, when we bring on HSBC that as you can
imagine thinking of all the work that we have done over the years with respect to our own policies and customer
practices. Bringing HSBC inline with those will hit a run rate of revenue margin reduction on our portfolio of about 30
to 35 basis points. There is a phasing of those effects.
But over the course of the first half of 2013, we will hit that run rate and that's a sustainable effect from the transition of
HSBC in the Capital One.
David Hochstim
Then their charge-offs are higher for their margins lower?
Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So as you remember with the various data that that's come out as part of the deal and if you looked on at HSBC,
HSBC just has essentially always had a charge-off rate that is a fair amount higher than Capital One. And so when it
comes into Capital One just a math of the weighted average of those will take over. Our point is that you won't see that
for a couple of quarters after HSBC comes on because of the mark that will pretty much takeout those charge-offs for a
couple of quarters. But what we're saying is after that mark runs its course, there will be a sustainable delta of around
75 basis points effective combined higher charge-offs that comes from just the math of pulling these two institutions
together. Oh.
I'm sorry, what answered there is about 75.
Okay. And I'm so sorry. So the 75, you want to ask about the accrual related to the cross-sell. David, yes, so we have
policies and scripts in place to make sure that our sales practices meet our standards. And unfortunately, this didn't
happen in some cases with respect to the sale of some cross-sell products at Capital One, so what we are doing is we
are reaching out to all the customers who have purchased these products over the past couple of years and offering a
refund to those customers and this is a one-time $75 million hit that we are taking for that effect. But it's very important

Thank you. I have couple of questions on just numbers. First I want to make sure I had all the one-time items in terms
of the impact continuing up on legacy Capital One. Are they the 150 million these again the 75 million hit to kind of
reserve build, 19 million hit to Rep & Warranty and 25 million and higher expenses related to the HSBC integration?

Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
All of those items came through continuing ops. Sanjay that's correct. The only thing I'll mention because the way we
have shown them because of the bargain purchase gain, the hedge loss that was recorded in the quarter of 77 million
which previously were showing up in continuing ops but wasn't called out as an ING expense although we told you
what it was for is showing up in the column that says ING impact. So I just want to make sure that one-time impact is
there but it's showing up in the INGD column.
Sanjay Sakjrani
Okay, perfect. And then just as far as the impact on ING on a go forward basis when looking at slide three, are there
two ongoing impact kind of loan premium amortization as well as the CDI amortization I know that's perhaps the
quarter but just on a ongoing basis, is that what we have kind of come back out what the core earnings power of ING
is? And could you just talk about how that core earnings power by ING compares today relative to the numbers you
guys provided when you close the deal at 630 million? Thanks.
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
Sure Sanjay. With respect to your that the question about what is an ongoing source of expense or impact to what
revenue, you are correct. The loan premium amortization will continue for several years. It's being recognized on
accelerated schedule.
So at this stage, we're running at $40 million, $45 million of full quarter and that will start to come down, the CDI
obviously will continue for a substantial period of time. There will be no more transaction related expenses for ING
Direct having to do with the deal itself, but certainly there will be integration and other merger related expenses that we
will be heading for a period of time and we will call those out for you.
So certainly the bargain purchase gain and the mark-to-market loss or mark-to-market position in the hedge which is
related to that will not recur. So you go that correct.
Certainly in terms of the view of ING Direct's ongoing impact, what we really try to do for you this quarter Sanjay is
not to suggest what you should think about in terms of ING's ongoing impact. What we really try to do, was to give you
a clean view of our first quarter performance net of ING Direct. So that you could compare it to our fourth quarter
performance which was obviously before the acquisition.
What we try to do in terms of an impact of ING Direct in this quarter is to reflect it as it would have operated as a
standalone company. In other words, we took into account their securities portfolio before we combine it with our own.
We simply looked at the yields on their assets and their deposits.
So its a good representation of what ING Direct would have done as a standalone company which isn't materially
different from that which we had assumed at the time of deal, you just reminded us that. So that's sort of $630 million
number.
But I wouldn't say its necessarily a good representation of the value of ING Direct going forward because Capital One
will value as the deposits of ING Direct more highly than it would have been. And so that obviously will be reflected in
the consumer banking segment, the securities portfolio and the cash position of ING Direct is showing up in our other
category.
We're just going to optimize our balance sheet as a whole. So I think the information, we've given you should allow
you to understand what short-term impact ING Direct has had. And then in order to understand the long-term impact,
you really have to kind of go back to our assumptions around the deals and as Rich said we feel good about them today
as we did when we announced them.

John Stilmar with SunTrust has your next question.
John Stilmar
Thank you. Good evening. Rich just a quick highlights for some of the legacy Capital One business. Top-line yield
continues to actually move up and define what other banks are showing at least in top-line yield in terms of the U.S.
card business. What is the real driver there? Is it net card customer profitability in your legacy Capital One business
getting better or it is just a migration of installment loans becoming less important part of the business and if that's the
case can you help us kind of understand what that dynamic might be on the legacy business going forward?
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
Well the... we just had a lot of strength on the revenue side and I've embarrassed myself on you should be cautious
asking me this question because if you remember when I kept predicting this revenue margin to come down and that
suddenly kind of refused to do that. So, it demonstrates though the power of several things that are going on I mean
some of the revenue margin strength has been related to credit that is continue becoming a little bit better than expected
and of course that's not a sustainable point. And we would expect not to get too much more of those credit effects. But
the marketing we are doing over the last few years has been really live in terms of -- oriented balanced transfer
products I mean we're just not really active participants in that particular segment.
We have -- our highest yielding parts of our portfolio had significantly less attrition than we expected also, which has
contributed and funding costs are down also which helps the card revenue margin. So, we feel very good about this and
of course now we bring on HSBC and I think the earnings power of that enterprise really comes from revenue margin
strength. And what excites us is the fact that there we see a lot of opportunities in the way we can manage accounts and
hit the ground running with that business that I think will show continuous strength in revenue margin.
I do want to say though that of course no, we're pointing downward with respect to revenue margin and we really mean
it here relative to this known impact of taking a little bit of the air out with respect to some of the HSBC's practices.
So that is a very real effect. I think also we should expect the competitive environment which is gradually heating up I
think that impact will clearly kind of take things down a little bit and I do want to also say that is as we continue to get
traction in partnerships which I'm really bullish about the continued opportunity we have there. That will be great in
terms of value creation but that's a thing that pulls down margin as well.

Christopher Brendler
Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick clarifications if I could, Rich the discussion around HSBC and the
practices and the changing around those practices and the 75 basis points I believe oh sorry, 30 basis points of revenue
margin pressure it doesn't, I think you would also benefit as the HSBC loans come on the revenue margin should go up
first, and then start to come down as you maintain those practices, is that the case?
Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I think less so than you might think I mean relative to attrition and other things I think that we are not really seeing an
updraft before the downdraft, I think that we think, things are mostly going to be coming in around where we are and
then from there, you have the phased downdraft effect of our implementation of these things we have been planning to
do for a long time.
Christopher Brendler
Okay, if I could ask the second question?
Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yes.
Christopher Brendler
Another clarification. The bargain purchase gain I believe is not taxable, if I am calculating correctly? And then I just
ask my real question would be, on interchange you have had quite a bit of success in the U.S. card business in growing
the purchase volume another good quarter this quarter 27% growth to 25% growth whatever the number is, but
interchange revenue seems to be relatively flat, is that a reflection of the rewards price you're pushing out today or are
there other true ups in the rewards redemption rate that's causing the depressed growth in interchange just help me how
to think about that? Thanks.
Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Gary want to bargain purchase, I'll do interchange.
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
You're right Chris the bargain purchase is not... that carries no taxable.
Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Chris the yeah, purchase volume at Capital One has been growing pretty dramatically I mean obviously we have also
brought in partnerships and that's added to this effect but even without the partnerships, we have tended to be leading
the lead tables of industry growth in the last couple of years with respect to purchase volume growth. Let me talk about
interchange here for a minute. The first about just a comment about the Q1 interchange numbers. The Q1 interchange
numbers were relatively weak due to seasonality, that's in fact.

Page 12 of 19
It was very pretty consistent for Capital One. So quarter-over-quarter, our purchase volume was down 9% and our
interchange was down 7%, but pulling way up on the observation that you talked about that the while purchase volume
is very strong, the interchange is not growing at a stronger rate.
It's important to note that the net interchange disclosures in that press release tables are for the total company and they
include payments from some of our partners and some impacts from other lines of business. So, it's difficult to derive
truly what's going on with respect to net interchange income from these disclosures. If you were to look at just our
Domestic Card business which will take out the impact of other business lines and the effect of the partnership
payments.
Net interchange has solid growth throughout 2011 and in the first quarter of 2012. Now, that said our Domestic Card
net interchange is not increasing at the same rate as our purchase volume as we continue to shift our portfolio towards
rewards customers and move away from some of the balance intensive revolver segment which has limited rewards
cost but lower margin and greater resiliency challenges.
So, but we feel great about the rewards customers we're attracting and we think that interchange although it's growing
less quickly than purchase volume, I think is going to be a continuingly strong contributor to the revenue growth of the
company.

We'll move next to Brian Foran with Nomura.
Brian Foran
Hi. My first question on the deal accretions. I guess at the time of the mergers you had said mid single-digit accretion to
2013 from ING and at the time of HSBC you said high teensGAAP and operating EPS accretion to 2013 and consensus
was around six bucks at the time for both.
So with all the kind of things you're talking about, the proactive changes in HSBC et cetera is the mid single-digit and
high single-digits of consensus at that time, still a good benchmark to work of in terms of the top down accretion or
have any other things you've now outlined changes in your contemplation and how accretive these deals might be?
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
Brian it's Gary here. I'll happy to take that and certainly what you might call a base line, three acquisitions trajectory
obviously. We will have changed for no other reason than the interest rate environment but as far as the deals
themselves go with ING Direct of course, we've had a beneficial improvement to the upfront capital impact of that
transaction, which will cause a bit of amortization of that capital over the next year or so which obviously will affect
reported earnings but by a relatively a small amount which I identified.
So that might have a small impact in terms of reported results over the next couple of years. With HSBC obviously we
haven't closed the transaction. There will be, I wouldn't be surprised to say we're most significant purchase accounting
impacts upfront and therefore an income over the next year or so but looking aside from the accounting the
fundamentals of what we see in the HSBC business, look good and very much inline with what we saw before we
announced the deal and what we put into those numbers including some of the moves that trip which describes.

So I think if you put this two deals together as we can see them right now I think we are still on the same ballpark for
accretion but we'll certainly give you a running commentary as it plays out. So you understand what the moving parts
and pieces are.
Brian Foran
And then my follow-up is slide seven. Can you explain how this disallowed DTA works? I guess, first, why it's
increased the past two quarters? Second, when you gave the mid nines capital guidance for the deal close, would that
mid nines include something in the same ball part of this 900 million disallowed DTA? And then third, I really
disallowed DTA recapture can depend on actual earnings, your forecast as you turn the calender year every January 1st.
But is there any reason to expect that this 900 million wouldn't be recaptured over some near to medium-term amount
time?
Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Certainly, one of my favorite topics Brian. DTA, as you suggested has gone up. Although, we have not closed on the
HSBC transaction. We do contemplate the close of the transaction. It is going to have an upfront negative impact on
earnings and that among other things can contribute to an increase in the DTA, in this quarter.
Obviously, as time plays out, the likelihood of recapture is quite high. With respect to the previously stated expectation
of the mid-9% range for Tier 1 common at the end of next quarter. As I said, it's more likely to be affected by purchase
accounting, than it is by our forecast of DTA, but we certainly feel as of today that we are in that right ball part could
be helped and could go the other way in a very, very short run because of purchase accounting but if so, that's likely to
resolve within a quarter or so.

Up next is Craig Maurer from CLSA.
Craig Maurer
Yes, good evening. Following up on the earlier question regarding your growth of purchase sales, want to ask you a
question about competition. Bank of America is shared roughly 90 billion in card assets. Since mid '08, it seems that
there are few real winners in this segment. When do you expect the industry itself to start growing again or we still are
going to see the shifts in assets going on for quite a long time, I was just curious?
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
Greg, I think the industry is just sort of getting back to where if you look at the revolving credit numbers, so they are
really just they have been now just a few months of where this thing is essentially flat. So, my feel for the industry is
that its big days of shrinking are over, but it's going to sort of gradually come back to a modest level of growth.
I think the real story is kind of to your earlier point, the opportunity or some of the share change dynamics that go on
with different players. And we are finding - and I think the striking thing is, different players are staking out different

positions. And we are finding in all of the segments that we are investing in and that's very similar to where the ones
we were focusing on before the great recession by the way.
We are finding that we are steadily gaining share in those segments. We're also finding that the -- as we project the net
present value of the - of our originations, it kind of added all up, we do sort of the metric of the NPV and everything
we're originating in a year, how does that compare with NPV in prior years.
The sort of overall value creation from these things is consistent with some of the strong years in the middle of the
decade. So, we feel very good about this. But I think the story for card -- for Capital One is going to be not so much a
story about growth. Although, I think it will be a story of share gain, but most importantly it's going to be a share - a
story of earnings power and consistency and as such I think that it's going to be an important driver of a shareholder
value going forward.
I want to also say that, in terms of competitive levels and pricing, I think the industry is at a kind of stable point, not
really going up, not really going down, but I think there is a rationality to it at least, even though the competition is
fierce, there is a rationality to it that adds to my confidence, that this can be a powerful driver of value.
Craig Maurer
Just a follow-up, do you think that rationality applies to reward spending as well as we've seen those increased
dramatically as everybody seems to be targeting the same group.
Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well I think we have to catch everyone's attention that everywhere you turn there is another big investment going on by
somebody particularly IMAX, Chase and ourselves are going very hard right at that heavy spender and part of the
marketplace.
Look, it is fiercely competitive the... and these are by far the most expensive accounts to book of anything that we
originate. The nice thing is with these are wonderful annuities that have low attrition and fabulous return dynamics and
it's really all about therefore the cost to require. But what that also means Craig is this is something where one can see...
we can watch it at the time of origination and really understand the investment that we're making right there on the spot
and while it's very competitive, we like the success that we're getting and we're going to continue doing what we're
doing and I think real values getting created there.

Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
Sure Don. And let me answer the second part of that question first, no we don't have specific estimates for you at this
point in time. Remember that we're only going to become a Basel II bank at the end of this year as result of our
acquisition of ING Direct that makes better certainty therefore we'll have a two year preparation process prior to going
parallel in 2015 and obviously not actually entering Basel II fully until at least 2016. So it's way early to really try and
identify what those numbers might be. Obviously as we assess our own capital trajectory we need to make some
internal views about what the impact is going to be. Certainly it should all else being equal cause our risk weighted
assets to rise but as we asses our capital trajectory knowing that Basel II and of course Basel III are in our future we
also take into account the fact that our own robust internal economic capital models at least are on the same...
along the same principles as Basel II obviously there are a lot of individual parts and pieces that may affect that.
And also running stress tests as we now do also gives us a sense of what we might expect out of the various kinds of
assets that we have. So this is going to be an ongoing journey for us, we will certainly give you insight when we are
able to generate it, it will take quite a bit of time let me set your expectations there. But even including the expected
increase in risk weighted assets from Basel II, we take that at least general knowledge of what's ahead when we say that
we're going to be on the strong capital generation trajectory even between here and there.
Donald Fandetti
Got you. That's helpful. And then lastly if you could, has there been any more movement in terms of potential
nomination of an ING and over to your Board and if you could just talk a little bit about the lock up of those share what
your thoughts are?
Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So the -- as you know under ING's ownership stake they have the right to nominate one member to join our
Board of Directors. And we're working through the appointment process now with ING Direct.
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
As the lock up itself Don goes just remind you what you probably already know which is that lock up is in effect until
19 days after closing which is going beyond or around May 17.

basis point to 120 basis point lower yielding than your portfolio and losses kind of 200 and some odd basis points
higher, is that correct?
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
Just in terms of the math notion, it's Gary. Certainly your estimate on the charge-off is about right when we trust the
math on the revenue side as well. So just math wise you have got it.
Moshe Orenbuch
Okay. Great. And just a follow up. The sale the proforma as mentioned that you are planning in to sale 17 billion of
securities from ING, when does or did that happen until that include the sub investment credit currently as securities?
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
As far as that goes, Moshe, Gary again. And what came over from ING Direct by and large, we have not sold anything,
any material amount of the ING securities portfolio. We did sell several billion between $5 billion and $10 billion
worth of securities out of Capital One's portfolio, you'll remember starting back in Q3 of 2011.
And so we haven't really needed to sell any more securities in order to achieve the necessary liquidity for HSBC. As
you can see on the slides, we are already about $32 billion in cash at the end of Q1. And with respect to our future
expectations, with respect to balance sheet repositioning. We're integrating the investment, we have integrated the
investment portfolios as of day one between ING Direct and Capital One.
We've integrated our overall balance sheet management. And from hereon now, we will be optimizing to get kind of
the best risk return position consistent with our historically proven credit and market risk guidelines.
With respect to the very specific question, the sub-investment grade, private mortgage debt securities that we're in the
ING Direct portfolio as identified when we announced the deal. Obviously those have paid down somewhat, but by and
large, those did come along with the acquisition itself.
We have not made any moves with respect to that, but as with all of the assets that came over over from ING Direct
those were marked to the fair value when they came over.

bringing calls on added actually materially more outstanding seasonality between Q4 and Q1. I have go study the
seasonality of the other of the HSBC partnerships but we will find out about. Gary do you have the installment loan
number?
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
Not of the top my head, it was 700 million but we can certainly get back with a more specific number.
Ryan M. Nash
Okay. I have a follow-up. And just one other clarification just in terms of the loan run-off - and didn't whether that
going to 10 billion for up to 2Q '13 and then 8 billion after that, was that the amount?
Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, we'd, it will kind of awkward the way I was describing it it. We were trying to be precise on things that
started. So when basically for the year following, when we fully have this both of these deals on board, which would be
there for Q3 through Q2 of the following year. And I think what was confusing is, I said that Q3, through Q3, but
anyway. So for the year starting Q3 of 2012, the expected run-off would be 10.5 billion and then for the year following
that mid year to mid year again year following that it would be the 8 billion number that I had.
Ryan M. Nash
All right.
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
Let me just give you some real-time updates there. So -- inflation was about right, but we had about 360 million of

the near-term?
Gary L. Perlin, Chief Financial Officer
Dan the items that were in the fourth quarter that did not recur in the first quarter the largest of them was a reserve for
the UK PPI business we told you that was about $80 million in the fourth quarter that was a contra-revenue. We also
had close to $40 million worth of Rep & Warranty expense in the fourth quarter that hit continuing operations a lot of it
of course goes and to be discussed but your question is of course is specifically around that. And then there was a very
small movement in the ING hedge in the fourth quarter and the few other nits and nats that kind of ended up to be about
150.
By enlarge the only one of those that repeated this quarter was small amount of Rep & Warranty in disc ops but not
large enough to talk about.
With respect to the potential for those to shop again in the future, again the UK PPI reserve has grown a couple of times
over the last year. That's based on an assumption about consumer behavior over there, we think we obviously have
fully reserved for the experience we've seen and we expect it's conceivable there could be a change but we have no
reason to believe that right now.
