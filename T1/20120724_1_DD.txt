Ellen Jamison Kullman
Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone.
DuPont executed well in the quarter and delivered strong results despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continued our
momentum, with particularly robust volume growth in agriculture, food and enzyme markets. Company sales were up
7% despite a 3% currency headwind. Excluding currency, sales were up in all regions.
Sales to developing markets grew 11% versus a very strong comp. While volumes were down in Europe and Asia, we
continue to see sequential improvement on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Volumes were up 5% and 3% in China and
India, respectively, versus the second quarter of 2011, which is another measure of good momentum in the regions.
Underlying earnings grew 8%, to $1.48 per share. At a segment level, pre-tax operating income was up 13%, excluding
pharmaceuticals.
I'd like to highlight some of the important milestones from the quarter. First, we passed the one-year anniversary of the
Danisco acquisition in May. The contributions and benefits from the acquisition have exceeded our expectations. We
added two very attractive businesses to our portfolio and identified significant opportunities for cost and revenue
synergies. This newly created reporting segments of Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences delivered strong
performance this quarter, and are expected to combine for over $4.5 billion in sales this year with a pre-tax operating
margin in the 10% to 14% range. We will deliver $130 million of cost synergies by year-end and expect additional
productivity and margin expansion in 2013 and beyond.
Another important milestone in the quarter was the conclusion of the northern hemisphere planting season. For the first
half, Ag segment results were up 15% and pre-tax operating income up 16%, driven by new products, strong
relationships with our growers and an ever-expanding global footprint. In addition to a strong foundation in North
America, we have built solid businesses in Eastern Europe, Latin America and China, which offer additional attractive
growth. Earlier this quarter we announced government approval of the acquisition of PANNAR SEED Company, a
leader in Africa, as yet another example of our global build out.
Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't highlight innovation milestones. We're tracking well versus our target of having
30% of sales from new products introduced within the last four years. I'd like to give just one new product example
from the quarter. Our Performance Polymers business responded quickly to address the global shortage of PA12, a
critical polymer for automotive applications. We accelerated the introduction of new grades of our Zytel product to
allow the automotive industry to continue to produce parts with alternative materials. The contribution to business
results is small on the quarter but, importantly, we demonstrated again DuPont to be a valued partner in helping the
auto industry respond to a critical shortage.
Now I'll turn the call over to Nick and Karen to review the quarter in more detail, then I'll come back and close out the
call with our views on the outlook. So, Nick?
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on slide 3.
Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased $185 million, or 9%, overcoming headwinds relating to currency,
a decrease in pharmaceutical income and higher pension cost. This outstanding performance demonstrates the diversity

and strength of our portfolio and, moreover, the outstanding execution by our teams.
Underlying earnings of $1.48 per share increased $0.11 compared to the $1.37 in the prior year, as the strong operating
results were partially offset by $0.06 of headwinds relating to exchange losses and taxes. Consolidated net sales of $11
billion were up 7% versus the prior year. Local selling prices increased 6%, with gains in all regions and most
segments, reflecting the benefits from new product introductions coupled with our continued strong discipline to price
for value.
Portfolio changes, principally the Danisco acquisition, added 5% to sales. Volume was down 1% from the near peak
level in the second quarter 2011. On a sequential basis when you exclude Ag and adjust for seasonality, volumes
improved 3% led by Asia-Pacific. We expect this momentum to continue as we head into the second half of the year,
particularly in the Photovoltaic, Consumer Electronics and TiO2 markets.
Now let's turn to a corporate view of the second quarter, looking at EPS variance analysis on slide 4. Higher local
selling prices resulted in a $0.49 per share benefit. Variable costs were a $0.03 headwind, as raw material, energy and
freight costs were up about 1% over the prior year. Input costs have moderated from the first quarter, and for the full
year we now expect an increase of about 1% versus our previous assumption of 3%.
The 2 percentage point improvement is primarily due to lower crude oil and ethane costs, as well as more advantageous
mixes of ores in our titanium dioxide business. The improvement also includes lower silver costs which are passed
through to the customer, so there's no associated earnings impact. Excluding the impact of portfolio changes, volume
declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.06 per share.
Let's move to fixed costs, which reduced earnings by $0.15 per share when you exclude currency, volume and portfolio
changes. This change reflects growth investments, including increased R&D and marketing initiatives in the Ag
segment, and costs associated with operating the new Kevlar and Tevlar plants. I would also like to note that the fixed
cost increase includes a $0.04 of higher noncash pension costs over prior year. Concurrent with taking actions to
support growth, we've delivered approximately $190 million of fixed cost productivity year-to-date. We're well on our
way toward exceeding our commitment of $300 million for the full year.
Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.06 variance in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect a $0.30 to
$0.35 headwind for the full year, compared to our previous guidance of $0.20 to $0.25. For third quarter alone, the
stronger dollar would result in about a $0.12 to $0.14 headwind versus prior year. Next on the waterfall is portfolio
changes, which is a net $0.06 benefit, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Danisco.
Moving on, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. As is typical, the detailed
reconciliation on Schedule D in the earnings news release can be found. It shows the exact impact our hedging program
had on earnings as well as the effective tax rate.
Income tax was a $0.02 headwind. This represents a difference between the base tax rates of 24.1% this quarter versus
23% last year. The higher base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in higher tax rate
jurisdictions as well as the absence of the R&D and other tax credits, which expired at the end of 2011. We now expect
full-year 2012 base tax rate to be about 24%, 1 percentage point higher than our previous guidance, which equates to an
additional $0.05 per share headwind for the full year. This revision reflects our latest view on the earnings mix.
Lastly, reduced pharmaceutical royalties were a $0.05 hurt. We are now estimating full-year 2012 pharma pre-tax
income to be approximately $65 million, an increase of $15 million versus our original guidance. With that change, we
expect pharma to be $225 million less than it was in 2011.
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on slide 5. You can see we delivered strong performance in
developing markets, with sales up 11% in the second quarter, led by growth in Agriculture.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide 6. Second quarter free cash flow was $0.4 billion, essentially flat
versus the prior year. At the end of the second quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis versus second quarter 2011, we
were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 4% when you exclude the Danisco impact, thus reducing
our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of working capital productivity this

year.
Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A/A2 credit rating and work to maintain the
associated metrics to support that. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess
cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
In April, we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, and we paid our 431st consecutive quarterly dividend
last month. Additionally, we completed the repurchase of $400 million of shares in the month of May.
In summary, for the second quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one. Global volume for the company
declined slightly on a year-over-year basis but improved sequentially, excluding Agriculture. As a result of our strong
execution and portfolio diversity, we delivered a double-digit increase in the underlying total segment PTOI, excluding
pharma, in spite of this very challenging market conditions that we're facing.
Turning now to the third quarter. We expect sequential volume growth to continue, particularly in PV, Consumer
Electronics and TiO2 markets. Additionally, we expect volume growth on a year-over-year basis, albeit off of a easier
comp. Karen will provide more details when she covers the individual segments.
For the full year, there are several items that we see as either headwinds or tailwinds. Weaker macros, a stronger dollar
and a higher tax rate are some of the headwinds. On the other hand, lower import costs will certainly be a tailwind.
Taking these items into consideration, we expect full year earnings to be toward the lower end of our existing range of
$4.20 to $4.40 per share, excluding significant items. Additionally, we expect earnings in the second half of the year to
be split about evenly between quarters three and quarters four.
Some of our businesses are impacted more from the changing macros than other businesses. However, each of our
businesses has meaningful externally benchmarked performance targets. These businesses that are not executing
against their targets are being required to provide even more productivity gains. These businesses are taking actions in
a variety of ways, including reducing expenditures and tightly managing their cash. They are also shifting resources as
new opportunities are identified.
All of our businesses are staying close to their customers to adapt to the changing demand signals and to continue to
serve our customers' needs. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute
against those plans.
Lastly, I would like to remind investors that although we are taking actions to react to today's dynamic market
conditions, we also remain focused on our long-term strategy of growing the top line 7% and earnings 12%. We
continue to drive a disciplined process around innovation, productivity and differential management. We're committed
to build on successes in developing markets, and we continue to exercise good financial discipline and make decisions
in support of continuing to have a strong balance sheet. Our focus on these areas and our strong execution are the key
enablers to our success.
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen, who will review the segments. Karen?
Karen A. Fletcher
Okay. Thanks, Nick.
Turning to slide 7, our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first quarter, underpinned by
strong northern hemisphere execution in a robust Ag market. Sales of $3.4 billion grew 13%, with roughly equal
contributions from volume and price. Earnings grew 12%, to $926 million. First half sales of $7.5 billion grew 15%,
with earnings up 16% to $2.2 billion.
Reviewing the individual businesses, starting with Seeds. Second quarter sales grew to $2.5 billion, up 12%, with first
half sales growing to $5.7 billion, up 16%. While first half growth reflects increased corn and soybean acres and strong

price performance in North America, each region contributed positive price and volume growth. As a result, the
business is expected to be at the top end of our goal to deliver 5% to 10% net price gains this year.
North American growers have recognized the value of our Optimum AcreMax family of reduced and integrated refuse
solutions. This is only the second commercial season for these technologies, and adoption rates continue to exceed our
expectations. Over 70% of above and below-ground sales and about 10% of above-ground only sales were in AcreMax
technology, which is at the high end of our expected range. Additionally, growers planted over two million acres of our
Optimum AQUAmax hybrid, developed to deliver a yield advantage in water-limited environments.
In Soybeans, we grew sales through pricing gains and volume growth in North America. Our focus has been on
optimizing the financial contribution of the breeding investment we made in soybeans. Through outstanding execution,
we continue to lead the market, based on the confidence customers have in our disease packages and all-around product
performance.
Moving to Europe, corn sales in the quarter were down year-over-year, as expected, following an early start to the
season which favored the first quarter. For the first half, pricing and volume contributed positively to sales growth.
In Crop Protection, second quarter sales grew to $879 million, up 15%, with first half sales of $1.8 billion, up 11%, led
by volume growth in North America and Latin America. The results reflect growth across all product categories, with
notable strengths in Insect Control's product sales, as Rynaxypyr continues to penetrate markets around the world. The
broad success of Rynaxypyr supports our aggressive investment effort to rapidly expand the franchise, bringing
Cyazypyr products and Dermacor seed treatment to the market. We received our first registration of Cyazypyr in
Argentina on July 13, and we expect to launch in the second half. We expect this franchise of insect control products
derived from the same novel chemistry will grow to over $1 billion in the next few years.
Looking ahead to the second half for the Agriculture segment, our outlook remains unchanged, as we expect
high-single digit percentage sales growth and larger seasonal losses as compared to same period previous year. Second
half sales anticipate strong business performance in both Seeds and Crop Protection in Latin America, partially offset
by significant currency headwinds, primarily due to the real, and lower corn plantings as growers in Argentina and
Brazil are expected to move strongly to soybeans. Sales growth is offset by continued investment in our Right Product,
Right Acre strategy, new product launches and long-term R&D build out.
Moving to slide 8, for Electronics & Communications; sales of $795 million were down 11%, primarily due to soft
Photovoltaic volume and lower silver price pass-throughs. On a sequential view, growth in Photovoltaic materials was
enhanced by our industry-leading products, like our latest [ph] Telemet paste (21:22) gaining traction with customers,
coupled with recovery from the inventory correction that began late last year.
In Consumer Electronics, demand was up for our market-leading materials, driven by ongoing growth in smartphones
and tablets. PTOI was down 27% on lower volume and plant utilization. Additionally, in the prior year PTOI was
reduced $20 million due to extreme metals volatility. For third quarter, we expect sales down slightly, due to
pass-through of lower metal prices, and PTOI up slightly on higher volume. Sequentially, the story is even stronger
with earnings up substantially due to continued momentum in PV and Consumer Electronics.
Photovoltaics remained a very dynamic market. We see installations continuing strong in the U.S. and China, with new
positive feed-in tariffs in Japan, even as industry macros are weighing on the module makers. For the full year, we
reaffirm our view of 10% growth in global installs and our Advanced Materials will play an essential part in that. On
the Consumer Electronics side, launches of new mobile devices are expected to pull through our industry-leading
materials, like Kapton Black.
Now on to Slide 9, Industrial Biosciences. They delivered sales of $300 million, with growth predominantly from
acquisitions. In biomaterials, our Sorona polymer continues to gain market adoption, thanks to our highly-differentiated
value proposition. PTOI of $44 million grew primarily because of acquisition, but also from cost synergies which are
performing in line with expectations.

Turning to third quarter, we see sales up modestly and PTOI up substantially, with realization of additional cost
synergies. As in previous quarters, the generally good market fundamentals for enzymes are expected to remain
favorable, albeit with some slowing of enzymes for ethanol, given higher corn prices.
Turning now to Slide 10 for Nutrition & Health; the teams delivered a very strong performance in the quarter, posting
sales of $885 million with earnings of $112 million. The quarter reflects a two-month acquisition benefit in addition to
growth in Solae. Our global teams have maintained the business momentum from our businesses, delivering pro forma
sales growth in health and protection and enablers, with both price and volume gains that more than offset currency
headwinds.
For Solae, a key growth objective is to enhance product mix and earnings by growing the Solae Specialty segment
while optimizing the Commodity segment. Towards that goal, Solae Specialty posted mid-teen sales growth, as our
new products continue to penetrate the Nutrition Solutions and Improved Health segment of the food ingredient market.
Pre-tax operating margins of 13% reflect the progress we're making on cost synergies, with meaningful impact from
timing lag on raw material cost inflation.
Moving to the outlook for third quarter, we expect moderate sales growth with substantial earnings growth.
Year-over-year pre-tax operating margins will be up substantially, reflecting business mix and cost synergies, but will
be tempered sequentially due to raw material inflation.
Moving to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales were essentially flat as higher prices offset lower volume. Versus
a sold out environment last year, TiO2 demand was down particularly in Europe and, to a lesser extent, Asia, while
North America showed strength. Within the quarter, we saw growing momentum, particularly in Asia. As an example,
China's June sales were our strongest year-to-date for TiO2. Strong demand in industrial chemicals like Cyanide also
provided an uplift to the quarter's result. PTOI of $538 million was up 7% despite higher ore costs, reflecting our
technologically-advantaged process and consistent gains in productivity.
In third quarter, we expect sales down modestly and PTOI down substantially versus a very strong comp of tight TiO2
and robust Fluoroproduct demand a year ago. In spite of the uncertain global macro environment, segment outlook is
for sequential improvement. Additionally, we reiterate our view of flat segment margins year-over-year for
Performance Chemicals on slightly lower volume.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Higher OEM volume tied to a 10% increase in auto builds helped
the quarter. These increases were more than offset by weaker refinish and powder coatings volumes, primarily in
Europe, resulting from weak macro conditions. PTOI increased 26%, with 180 basis point margin expansion which
resulted from pricing and mix enrichment actions plus productivity gains partially offset by unfavorable currency. For
the third quarter, we expect segment sales to be essentially flat in spite of unfavorable currency. PTOI is expected to be
up substantially, with continued margin expansion versus prior year.
Now turning to Performance Materials on Slide 13; automotive-related demand continued to improve, particularly in
North America. This was offset by continued softness in Industrial and Electronics markets, especially in Europe and
Asia-Pacific. However, we did see sequential growth in Electronics in Asia. Additionally, Packaging markets improved
modestly. PTOI increased 25% primarily due to lower feedstock costs, higher volume, improved mix, partially offset
by unfavorable currency. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be down modestly, as
stronger volume will be offset by lower U.S. dollar selling prices, primarily due to currency headwinds. PTOI is
expected to be up substantially on a stronger mix.
On Slide 14 we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales decreased 4%, primarily due to lower public sector
demand and continued softness in Industrial markets. PTOI was down 11% on weaker mix, unfavorable currency and
higher costs associated with operating the new Kevlar plant, partially offset by value-based pricing action.
For the third quarter, sales are expected to be up slightly, with higher demand, principally in North America and
Asia-Pacific, partially offset by unfavorable currency. We see demand improvement for Kevlar, as some of our newer
products utilizing the latest technology installed at our new Cooper River plant are being very well received in the

market. Additionally, we expect sequential demand improvement for Nomex from higher infrastructure spend and
Tyvek in worker protection markets. PTOI is expected to be up modestly on stronger volume and improved fixed cost
leverage, partially offset by unfavorable currency.
That concludes our review of the segments, and now I'll turn the call back over to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Great. Thank you, Karen.
As Nick already stated, we expect full-year earnings excluding significant items to be toward the lower end of our
existing range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share due to the uncertainties of the global macro conditions, currency and
anticipated higher tax rate due to earnings mix. Year-to-date, you've seen the strength and resiliency of our portfolio
plus disciplined execution combine for earnings that were better than expected, and we intend to finish the year with
the same discipline and focus.
We remain committed to differentially managing our portfolio and invest in markets where growth remains attractive.
Our Innovation Centers are an important tool in this effort and they're places where we can focus resource and leverage
the power of DuPont innovation in order to pursue growth opportunities in developing markets.
As the result of the series of very purposeful actions, investment in innovation, selective capacity expansion,
acquisitions such as Danisco and PANNAR, just to name a few, our portfolio is less cyclical than it was just five years
ago, and we continue to drive productivity and benefits from the restructuring actions we implemented in 2009.
Our business teams remain close to the markets and customers, ensuring that they are ready – reading underlying
demand signals from downstream markets and able to meet whatever changing customer needs they see. They're also
focusing on innovation that truly adds value to our customers and creates opportunity for growth in new areas.
Now, I'd like to walk through some of the markets that are the most important to DuPont. Our Agriculture and
Nutrition & Health segments will contribute about a third of the company's sales and earnings this year. Agriculture
and Specialty Food ingredient markets are expanding, based on population growth and the demand for healthier food
choices. Our businesses drive solutions to improve productivity and deliver more nutritious foods. Success is
contingent on our ability to continue to deliver products with improved performance for our customers year in and year
out. And we have tremendous momentum with how customers have responded to our latest offerings.
TiO2, it's received a lot of attention lately. The market became soft in the second half of 2011, and we've seen slow
sequential recovery since then. We believe that recent comments in the press regarding demand outlook overstated the
softness of the market, so much so in fact, that we publicly affirmed our confidence in the demand outlook. We expect
sequential recovery to continue.
We expect segment margin for 2012 to be comparable to 2011, which is among the highest in our portfolio right now.
Keep in mind that overall fundamentals in this market are robust. Demand historically tracks GDP growth and we
anticipate only modest capacity additions to this market over the next four years. We expect favorable market
conditions to remain during that timeframe.
Moving to Automotive. Our expectation of global builds is still about 5% growth this year, and although that outlook
varies from a 6% decline in Europe to 14% growth in North America with the rest of the world somewhere in between.
And, finally, electronic markets are improving. Consumer Electronics is bolstered by continued strong demand for
smartphones and tablets. Demand for Photovoltaic materials has shown good sequential improvement since the
downturn in the second half of 2011, and we continue to expect PV installations to be up 10% over last year. Overall,
with DuPont's mix of products sold into electronic markets, we expect sequential recovery to continue in the second
half.
So to summarize, second quarter came in about as expected against a backdrop of very dynamic market conditions. The
company demonstrated strong execution and resiliency. The comments we've made about our performance and our

outlook are very consistent with what we've been saying for the past couple of years. Innovation is the backbone of the
company and we differentiate ourselves through our offerings. We are prioritizing resources and aligning with secular

Coatings, as you saw, had good performance this year. But as you know, we evaluate our portfolio each and every
quarter. And if we have anything to announce about any of our businesses or product lines, we'll make sure we include
you in the call.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay. And then as my follow up, were titanium dioxide prices up sequentially in the
second quarter? And do you expect them to be up sequentially in the third quarter?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Nick, why don't you take that one?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Jeff, why don't I take that? When you look at TiO2 pricing in the second quarter, it
was flattish versus being up. And expectation is that it's going to be flattish as you continue through the rest of the year.

Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes, good morning. Your Asian volumes were off 1% in the quarter. Do you see volumes
there stabilizing?
When I look at it in the context of minus-two last quarter and minus-ten in the fourth quarter. You called out
improvement in China and India. Wondering if you think Asia may have bottomed here?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Kevin, thanks for the question. Asia is still a tale of two cities when you think about
the developing areas versus the developed areas.
Although our volume was down 1% in the quarter, in the developing Asia, it was up about 3% – developing Asia was
up 3% with developed Asia down 4%. And you've got China and Hong Kong, I mentioned in my remarks, were up 5%.
And then India was up 3%.

And if you look at it sequentially, it's been a hard one to call this year because it just was moving all over the place
coming off of the Chinese New Year. But we have seen – continue to see sequential improvement, and as we take a
look at the underlying markets, we expect that to continue.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Just as a follow up, Ellen, you mentioned that June was the strongest month for TiO2 in
China. I think in the past, you've talked about pigment as being a leading indicator. And so my question is to what
extent does that activity in June in China reflect restocking, given some price declines in the region? Or rather would
you attribute it to an increase in underlying demand there?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I think that it's a hard one to call because you've got to kind of look at it over
time, but we see both happening. I mean, we see that there's movement and some restocking.
And I think that the Chinese government has really tried to create and have done some stimulus. In the last month or so,
they've had two cuts in their benchmark lending rate. They put in consumption incentives for some consumer goods,
and they've been working to accelerate project approvals on infrastructure. And we see all of that as starting to move
that market, and I think TiO2 is a beneficiary of that.

Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sabina Chatterjee>: Hey, good morning. This is Sabina Chatterjee in for Frank Mitsch.
Just to continue on the topic of TiO2, obviously DuPont has been a lot more confident than its peers in your outlook.
Can you just give us maybe some metrics to support that view? You just spoke about Asia, but maybe utilization rates
and inventory levels here in the U.S. and even globally, if you could?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Nick, why don't you help -
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Sure. Why don't I take that one? So let's talk about the larger picture of where we are
with the TiO2 business.
The fundamentals haven't really changed here. We're still very bullish on the mid long-term prospects for TiO2. When
you look at the growth that it has, relation to GDP, over the next five years, the only significant new capacity being
announced is DuPont's. And there just isn't enough capacity announced to keep up with the demand at that sort of GDP
growth rates. So we're seeing the basic fundamentals still intact moving forward, even if there is a short-term period of
demand contraction.
We're also seeing our strong position, based on the decades of innovation that we have – our number one position
around production capacity, as well as our advantaged position from a manufacturing technology standpoint.
You couple all of those macros with some of the specifics that are going on right now, and you look at – even with this
volume being somewhat depressed, you look at the earnings of this business in the year and you look at the margins of
this business, and you're still in line with what was – performance was in last year's results. So you're seeing margins
very much in line and earnings overall are very much in line.
So I think the overall macro picture is still very positive and strong in the TiO2 business.
<Q - Sabina Chatterjee>: Okay. Maybe then as a follow up, switching gears to Photovoltaic, it sounds today that you
might be a little more constructive than you've been maybe in recent weeks. So have module inventories been worked
down? And is it reasonable to say that maybe the H2 recovery is set to unfold a little better than you expected earlier?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I think that the module inventories continue to be worked off with the installs.
The first half installs were at a 10% rate. So they're – this isn't a back-end loaded from an install standpoint, so that has
really helped.

Our next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike J. Ritzenthaler>: Good morning, everyone. On the seed production side, can you give us a sense for
availability of seed next year, given the kind of the adverse growing conditions here in North America? And I guess
more particularly, about how much of Pioneer's seed production is irrigated?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, thanks. I know everybody's concerned based on the weather and the drought
that's going on.
We're looking at good availability for the 2013 season. We have very strong risk management practices, not only in
what – carry-over seed – but even our production locations are very geographically diverse, which helps with
two-thirds being irrigated. So that actually is very helpful, especially with the weather. And then we always have winter
production capability that we can come into play to fill in.
So we are working that through, as you speak, and we think we're going to have great availability for the 2013 season.
<Q - Mike J. Ritzenthaler>: Okay, outstanding. And then with the recent ethanol plant rationalizations, or expected
rationalizations, does that make any sort of meaningful impact on the Industrial Biosciences division?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: No. I think that commodity prices are going to come and go, and with the renewable
fuel standards, there's kind of a base that is there in that marketplace. We're still looking at cellulosic ethanol ultimately
as being the answer and making great headway on that one.
But as we said and Karen said in her comments, we think that enzyme sales in that market will come off a little bit
based on commodity prices. We still believe that that market will continue to progress.

Our next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you. As we look at your consolidated sales, how much of the local market price is
being driven by raw materials and tight markets versus new product introductions?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, I think a rough rule of thumb you can use when you look at our pricing in the
marketplace, about two-thirds to 75% is driven through the innovation, and a small percentage is driven – in that 25%
range – is driven by pass-throughs of raws up or down.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And just one follow-through. What kind of macro or micro
conditions does DuPont need to see to get Safety & Protection to actually hit its PTOI targets?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I think we see that there's some things that are working in our favor, so
sequentially, we think that continues – it will continue to improve.
First of all, the acceptance of the new materials out of the Cooper River line. We're seeing great progress there. And
even you've seen progress in the quarter, second quarter, with the margin expansion you've seen in the second quarter,
which is commensurate with improved products and improved utilization of those.
Asia, we see it's improving sequentially. North America continues to be solid. Europe is a challenge there. But even
construction's given a little bit of a boost, with residential being up 21%. Now commercial's on its back, but we're more

heavily in residential than not.
So there are some of those fundamentals that are coming into play that show an improving picture. But we're going to
make sure that regardless of the external environment, we're going to be driving through either innovation and
productivity to get to those targets.

Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you and good morning. Just a question on seeds. Could you talk a little bit about how
you're thinking about pricing going into next year?
And I guess I'm just trying to be sensitive to the potential, because you mentioned in the release that there were some
higher seed production costs this year. Presumably you passed those through, and you would do the same if there was
anything incremental next year, but it just might impact the mathematical margin you generate. So, if you could just
comment on that, that'd be helpful.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, obviously with the commodity – with volatile commodity prices, that continues
to be looked at. Net farm income remains high – it is high and is expected to remain high, so that's a positive. And
probably will remain high for a little while because the stocks are not where – it looks like with the volumes that are
expected to come through from this season, stocks are supposed to remain high – or stocks are expected to remain low.
Therefore, commodity price is high.
It's really early to talk about the details, but we are consistent with our pricing philosophy to the value of the new
products, and I think you've seen that this year. I think you've seen that this year with our pricing being up at the high
end of the range that we've talked about, 5% to 10%. I think you've seen it with the penetration of our new products.
And it really is Optimum AcreMax and now for next year Optimum AcreMax XTreme. They're going to continue to
make progress. AQUAmax, the new water-tolerant – or drought-tolerant products – I'll get the words right yet – we're
seeing great performance there in the 2 million acres there.
So we tend to focus on product and performance to really drive our strategy with our pricing in North America. So, I
mean, we're positive on price, but we'll bring out those new details as the year progresses.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay. And maybe just as a follow up, given that you're going to have greater penetration in
mix from the new products again next year, plus the higher feed costs, should we be – is it, just back of the envelope,
reasonable to assume that, if pricing was in the high end of 5% to 10% this year, it might be higher than that next year,
or is it too early to tell?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: We're not going to go there yet. There's a lot that has to play out this year before we'll
put that out there.

Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Ian Begleiter>: Thank you. Ellen, can you comment on final U.S. corn and soybean market share
numbers?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, David. I mean, so we've had great performance in North America. The
denominators changed on us. The USDA added about, I don't know, a million acres to the number last month.
And so with that, I think, and with our – the numbers that we're looking at, I'd say we feel – we've held share in both
crops after multiple years of share gains. I mean, if you think about it, between 2008 and 2012, we gained about 6

points in corn and more than 10 points in soy. So with the change in denominator, I'm going to back off a little bit and
say we held share, but ultimately we'll see where it ends up.
<Q - David Ian Begleiter>: And, Nick, just on TiO2 pricing, per buyers and per some consultants who are seeing
prices move lower in Asia, lower in Europe and there are reports of prices moving lower in the U.S. as we speak, are
you expecting U.S. prices not to be down from current levels? Or do you see some erosion over the next few months
here?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Well, in aggregate, David, I see pricing being flattish as we close out the year.
As I say, I think that's reflected not only in the margins that we've shown year-to-date, but also in our projections for
the rest of the year. When we look at the total year, we're saying that our margin for the segment is going to be about
equal to last year, which was about 25% PTOI margin.
Operator
Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning. First question on the Ag business. Every year, there's a bit of a kerfuffle
when the yield data comes out. This is an unusual year with the amount of drought concerns.
Do you expect – can you give us some sense of what you think – how you think people should be thinking about either
the performance of your [ph] treated (49:53) products in drought conditions or the newer hybrids versus the older
hybrids? Were you breeding hybrids for drought tolerance? Or is there some disconnects that will show up in the data
that shouldn't be read-through to a more normalized year?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So if you think about it, we launched AQUAmax and we have it on two million acres.
The anecdotes I'm get back from talking to farmers and talking to Paul Schickler, I was up there with him two weeks
ago, are that it's performing well and it's still green in some very stressed environments, And you know, AQUAmax is a
native trait, and I think this year as we show the performance of that, we're going to get a lot more interest in that
product in the coming season. But I think that's where we have to go as an industry; we have to go to be able to breed
and to have traits that are very resilient under a wide range of environmental conditions. And I think that's the focus for
the future.
Operator
Our next question is from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Yeah, thank you. First question on Ag. We came into this season expecting a tremendous year.
When you looked at the inventory channels, a lot of people were building inventory expecting a lot of input. Now with
the drought, my guess is farmers would back off on the amount of inputs, pesticides they would use in the back half of
the year. Is there a chance that we end up with too much inventory in the system on the Ag Chem side in North
America in particular, and that could be a little bit of a headwind in the back half of the year?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so crop protection chemicals is really a regional story. And so while there may
be some backing off on what's required based on the conditions in North America, it's raining in Latin America, and we
see the season shaping up there to be probably a pretty strong one for crop protection chemicals. And I think the two,
when you add it all up it will be a fine year for the business.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Great, thanks. And then on Nick's comment, when you were talking about some of the costs for
your inputs going from 3%, your old expectations, going to 1%, I think you mentioned TiO2 ore. Is that just the fact
that your operating rates are running a little bit below where you would have expected, so you don't have to buy that
very expensive marginal ton of ore, so your mix is better on that side?

<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, essentially, that's it, Duffy. As you know, we have the unique capability of
consuming both the low and the high grade and still producing the high-grade TiO2. And it's a matter of how we
regulate that mix of high grade and low grade which has the ability to impact that pricing, just as you recapped.
Operator
Our next question comes from John McNulty from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - John McNulty>: Yeah, good morning. On the TiO2 front, given what seems to be a little slackening in demand,
is there any thought as to the timing of your ramp-up on the big Mexico expansion on the Brownfield and maybe
delaying that out at all?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: I mean, when I look at the overall market conditions and the GDP growth that it has
shown over extended periods of time, it tells me that even with our planned expansions over this next five-year period,
it's going to be tight market conditions and there won't be the ability when you look three, four years out.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, and you couple that with when it could come on line.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Right.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: And it's three to four years out, and so by then, GDP will do what it does.
<Q - John McNulty>: Okay, fair enough. And then just one other question. On the pension side of things, there was a
recent change in Congress in terms of pension funding. Given the size of your pension, can you walk us through what
the implications could be for DuPont? I think it probably should, if it starts to impact things, hit in 2013 for you in
terms of cash flows.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, so you're all well aware of the pension change, the ability to aggregate it over a
25-year period of discount. And of course, that deals with the cash contribution fees; it doesn't deal with the GAAP
accounting or balance sheet item on it. And so what we're talking about here is this change in law will appreciably
reduce the cash funding requirements that DuPont would have to make, specifically in that next two-year period, that
2013, 2014 sort of time period. When you look at the impact, it's about a percentage point in discount rate change,
increase in discount rate, which will have that sort of rather large impact around future funding requirements.

Your next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit – in your TiO2 business, we see it with
the chemical solutions in fluoropolymer and chemicals, so it's a little bit tough to look at your particular margins, but
I'm sure you benchmark against your competition. I'm just curious, has your competitive margin or advantage expanded
as we've ore prices go up? And can you give us some order of magnitude?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Well, I think when you look at our margins, and we don't talk about individual
businesses, we keep it at the segment level, we do see, as I mentioned, the margins staying about equal to last year. For
competitive reasons, I'm not going to get into specifics around my margin as it relates to others in the industry. I think
you'd understand that.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: And can you just give a little more detail on what's happening in Fluoroproducts that causes
the profit pressure in the second half?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: We had very strong comps in 2011. They were really – they were sold out last year
and Fluoroproduct solutions into a wide variety of markets, like wire and cable and places like that, so those volumes
have come off a little bit and that's really basically the change.

margin expansion, with the productivity programs coming through. You know, they're benefited from stronger volumes
in OEMs, but coming off a little bit in the other segments, so they had some mix and opportunities there as well. So
they continue to make progress on their goals of attaining their margin that we've laid out for you guys.

And our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes, just a question on the overall guidance. Ellen, what would have to happen to hit the upper
end of your guidance? And it seems like you don't think there's much of a probability of that, so I'm just wondering
why you wouldn't adjust your guidance downward?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, and I'll let Nick give you the details. Let me give you the high level, Don. We're
seeing sequential improvement in many markets that have been very sketchy in the first half of the year. And that gives
us – and our ability to forecast out is not as great as we used to think it was back in the last decade. So we see some
positive momentum from the sequential numbers in several of our businesses. We have the positive momentum of raws
and that is offset by tax and currency. But, Nick, I don't know if you want to comment any more than that. I guess I've
covered it for him.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Well, yeah, you covered the main variables here. I mean, as Ellen mentioned, you
know, when the headwinds, you talk about the weaker macro conditions, the stronger dollar, the higher tax rate, those
are the types of things that are impacting us in a negative way.
But on the flip side, on the tailwind side, we do have the lower import costs and, as Ellen mentioned, the sequential
improvement in some of our key markets and regions. For example, we already talked about China specifically and the
increases that are occurring there on a sequential basis. I think you've got to look at the overall breadth and strength of
our portfolio. And we see opportunities where we can implement growth contingency plans and/or additional
productivity gains in our businesses or our regions that can compensate for where there are weaker outlooks elsewhere.
And we still have five to six months ahead of us to deliver against the commitments. And taking all of this into
consideration, we now believe and expect our earnings to be towards the lower end of the existing range.
