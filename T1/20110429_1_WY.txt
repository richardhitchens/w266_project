MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Nicole and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Weyerhaeuser First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn
the conference over to Kathryn McAuley, Vice President-Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.
Kathryn F. McAuley
Thank you, Nicole. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's First Quarter 2011 Earnings
Conference Call. I am Kathy McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at
www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release and material for this call can be found at our website or by contacting
April Meier at 253-924-2937. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides
concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during
this conference call. Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Patty Bedient,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning Weyerhaeuser reported Q1 2011 net earnings of $99 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, on net sales of
$1.6 billion. First quarter earnings include an after-tax gain of $96 million on the previously announced sale of 82,000
acres of non-strategic Timberlands in Southwest Washington state. Excluding this special item, the company reported
net earnings of $3 million, breakeven on a per-share basis. Please turn to the earnings information package available on
our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation of special items. In our discussions of business segments,
we will refer to charts 4 through 10.
Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business
segment from fourth quarter 2010 to first quarter 2011.

We begin our business segment discussion of the first quarter with Timberlands, charts 5 and 6. In the first quarter,
Timberlands contributed $89 million to pre-tax earnings before special items, $33 million more than in Q4 2010.
Third-party sales volumes rose 4% from Q4. This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Japan remains
our largest export market, accounting for approximately 70% of export volume. Third-party average log price
realizations increased 5% in the West and declined 2% in the South. The fee harvest increased 11% from the fourth
quarter. Most of the increase occurred in the West and was driven by export demand. Higher volumes resulted in lower
costs in the West. Costs in the South were lower due to less silviculture spending. Some of the cost improvement was
offset by rising diesel prices.
Wood Products, charts 7 and 8. Excluding special items, Wood Products narrowed its loss from $85 million to a loss of
$36 million, an improvement of $49 million. Lumber and OSB sales realizations increased 8%. Lumber volumes were
flat. OSB volumes increased 9%. Operating rates for lumber and OSB were higher in first quarter. Log costs rose in the
West. Solid section volumes were flat and prices declined slightly due to mix. TJI volumes fell 10%; prices modestly
increased.
Cellulose Fibers, chart 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $86 million to pre-tax earnings in Q1, $52 million less than in
Q4. Maintenance costs increased and productivity was lower due to two scheduled annual outages in the quarter. In
addition, we also had $7 million of spending in first quarter preparing for the annual maintenance outages scheduled for
the second quarter.
Fiber costs were higher in the West and chemical costs increased. Pulp price realizations declined $14 per ton. The
majority of our pulp production is fluff and fluff pulp prices were slightly lower. Pulp volumes were flat.
Real Estate, chart 10. RECO lost $1 million in the first quarter. First quarter is the seasonally weakest of the year.
Single-family closings were down 40% from Q4 and 8% from the first quarter a year ago. The average closing price
declined $20,000 to $419,000 due to mix. The gross margin was 22%, down from 26% in Q4, also due to mix. The
backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed increased to 611 homes.
And finally, Corporate and Other. Before special items, Corporate and Other contributed $43 million less to earnings in
first quarter. Pension and post-retirement expense held in Corporate was a non-cash charge of $12 million in Q1. In Q4,
it was a credit of $19 million. Share-based compensation expense rose $8 million in first quarter, primarily due to the
increase in our stock price.
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Kathy. And good morning, everyone. Over the last several earnings calls, I've been reporting on how we're
doing as we battle this dismal housing market. I'm glad to report that we continued to make progress during the first
quarter.
Our top line grew year over year, as well as our bottom line, and I remind you that this occurred while U.S. housing
softened. While margins and returns are still not where we want them to be, we continue to act on the items that we
control and take advantage of every opportunity.
In my remarks this morning, I will comment on three subjects. First, I want to talk about general economic conditions,
with a particular focus on the U.S. housing market, since new home construction has such a critical impact on our
company's overall performance. Second, I'll discuss the performance of our businesses during the first quarter, adding
some color to the information that's already included in our quarterly analyst package and to the summary that Kathy
just provided.
And finally, I want to discuss the effect of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami on our business. Although I'll address
the importance of the Japanese market to us, I want to emphasize that this tragic event had no material impact on our
first quarter financial results. We do expect that rebuilding needs in Japan will likely lead to opportunities for increased

log and lumber exports over the midterm, but it's too early to tell if there will be any material impact this year.
I'll start with general economic conditions and their effect on our first quarter performance. With respect to the U.S.
economy, GDP growth has been trending up slowly, but downward revisions of projected growth in 2011 announced
earlier this week by the Fed indicate that the recovery may be stalling. Additional comments by Fed Chairman
Bernanke further confirmed that there continues to be an abundance of caution. Increasing oil prices are a major
concern for us because of the impact on our manufacturing costs as well as how they affect disposable income and
consumer confidence. In Timberlands, for example, increases in diesel prices result in higher harvesting and hauling
costs. In our other businesses, higher oil prices result in increased costs for raw materials and energy.
At the consumer level, increases in oil prices translate quickly to rising gasoline prices, which directly affect the
pocketbook of potential homebuyers who may have been ready to re-enter the housing market.
As contrasted to GDP growth in the U.S., global growth is increasing at a faster pace, especially in emerging
economies. This faster-paced growth has had a positive impact on our Cellulose Fibers business, which supplies global
customers, and our Timberlands business, which leverages the geographic advantage of our Western forests as well as
our long-term trading relationships in key Asian markets.
Turning to the state of the U.S. housing market, the Fed this week described conditions in the housing sector as
depressed. In our press release this morning, we used the medical term "anemic" to describe current conditions, and the
medical analogy seems appropriate. The U.S. housing market has been in intensive care for the last couple of years. We
moved to the recovery room last year, boosted by both federal as well as some state housing tax credits, but then the
market suffered a relapse in the second half of 2010. As we entered 2011, we were planning on single-family starts
recovering to an annual level of approximately 525,000, certainly not an aggressive number at the time, but March data
shows starts at a seasonally adjusted rate of only 422,000, 21% lower than one year ago.
On the positive side, housing affordability is at an all-time high, and we did see a slight improvement nationally in new
home sales in March, up from the February level, which was the lowest since World War II. Perhaps the worst is
behind us, but our experience from the last several years causes us to be cautious, and we're focusing on being
profitable at today's level of starts while maintaining our ability to respond to improved demand signals.
To get housing back on track for a slow, steady recovery, our economy still needs to work through the challenges of
continued foreclosures as well as see clear direction from Congress on resolution of the still uncertain future of Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac. Despite the continued drag on our company by the slow recovery in housing, I'm pleased with
the progress that we continue to make in improving performance at today's level of starts in our Timberlands, Wood
Products and RECO businesses while taking advantage of continued strength in global demand for our Cellulose
Fibers.
In Timberlands, the big story this quarter is the Chinese demand for logs. One year ago, China represented 6% of our
total export volume, and in the first quarter the Chinese share of our exports increased to 24%. The location of our
Pacific Northwest timberlands, our extensive logistic systems, our strategically located port facilities and our long-term
trading relationships uniquely allow us to take full advantage of the Asian market, helping us to offset the continued
softness in U.S. housing. Though Chinese demand is relatively small in the context of our overall volume, this
increased demand has led to rising log prices in the West for both export as well as domestic logs, resulting in higher
log realizations for the quarter that Kathy highlighted.
Turning to our Wood Products business, mill productivity increased as operating rates for lumber, OSB and engineered
solid sections all improved as a result of steps taken in 2010 to further rationalize production capacity. The net result of
ongoing improvements across the business, including customer selection, pricing improvement and the lower cost
structure, was an increase in our gross margin and positive cash flow before seasonal build-up in working capital.
We're still not where we want to be, but we are seeing noticeable improvement.
In our RECO business, as expected earnings were approximately breakeven despite very weak demand. We did,
however, see evidence of improvement in some market indicators. Though year-over-year traffic levels are down, our
conversion rate of turning shoppers into buyers increased significantly and our cancellation rates dropped to levels we

have not seen since 2003. Comparing market conditions across RECO, the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of
Washington, D.C. showed the greatest improvement, followed by Phoenix and the Puget Sound region. Houston sales
remain stable and California and Nevada activity declined year-over-year, in part because last year's first quarter
included several new project openings which generally boost sales activity.
Shifting to our Cellulose Fibers business, the softwood pulp market remains tight, driven by increased demand for
dissolving pulp. For the quarter, earnings were up significantly year-over-year but fell from our record fourth quarter
levels, primarily due to increased expense and down time related to scheduled maintenance at our mills in Flint River
and Longview. We are seeing opportunities in Cellulose Fibers for new products that are the outcome of our strategy of
continuous innovation to serve the needs of our growing global customers, and we expect that the percentage of
revenues from these new products will increase over time.
Let me close with a discussion of Japan, a trading partner dating back to 1923 when we first entered the market to
supply lumber for rebuilding following the great Kanto earthquake which devastated the cities of Tokyo and
Yokohama. Since 1923, our relationship has grown to the point where sales to customers in Japan represented
approximately 10% of our total revenue last year. While we do not have any manufacturing facilities in Japan,
Weyerhaeuser products sold to Japan include pulp, liquid packaging board, newsprint, logs and lumber, and Japan is
the primary market for our Westwood Shipping Line. While Japan is an important market for us, we've seen only a
small impact from the March 11th earthquake. Our sales to customers in the impacted zone are roughly 2% of our total
revenues and most of these customers were able to shift production to other parts of the country.
Immediately following the earthquake, our attention turned to the safety and welfare of our employees and our ships'
crews, and thankfully everyone is safe. We have focused on our ongoing efforts to meet the needs of our customers,
redirecting supply lines to address shortages and adjustments in operating posture. Mid to longer-term, once essential
infrastructure needs are met, there should be an increase in demand for logs and wood products which will be used to
build permanent housing to replace the housing that was lost, and we are well positioned to work with our long-term
customers and trading partners to provide materials for rebuilding, just as we did in 1923 and again in 1995 following
the Kobe earthquake.
And now Patty will discuss our outlook, and then I'll provide a quick recap before we invite your questions. Patty?
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the second quarter by business segment is summarized on
Chart 11. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands. Export log demand in Asia is anticipated to remain strong. In the
West, sales realizations and volumes are expected to increase somewhat, but this will likely be offset by rising prices
for diesel fuel and seasonal increases in road and civil cultural costs. In the South, we anticipate slightly higher sales
volumes and flat sales realizations. Earnings in the South will also be negatively affected by rising fuel. Overall, not
including the effect of any non-strategic land sales, we expect Timberland earnings to increase somewhat in the second
quarter compared to the first.
Market conditions in Wood Products for the second quarter are very uncertain. We have yet to experience normal signs
of the spring building season. However, our forecast does include somewhat higher sales volumes for all products.
Sales realizations for most product lines are expected to be flat.
Higher productivity as a result of increased production volume should lead to more favorable manufacturing
efficiencies, partially offset by increased log costs. We expect the loss in the second quarter to narrow compared to the
first quarter and we should be cash positive.
Global demand in our Cellulose Fiber segment continues to be robust. We expect sales realizations to improve in the
second quarter compared to the first. Sales volumes are anticipated to also increase slightly.
Freight costs will likely be higher during the quarter. Additional planned maintenance outages will lead to higher
maintenance costs and additional lost productivity for the second quarter as compared to the first.

After the second quarter, our planned outages will be complete for the year. Despite these increased costs, we expect
that overall earnings in our Cellulose Fiber segment will increase compared to the first quarter.
In our Real Estate segment, we expect our single-family homebuilding business to improve seasonally during the
second quarter. Homes closed are anticipated to increase to approximately 500 closings compared to 363 closings in
Q1. The average closing price will likely decline slightly due to mix. However, we anticipate margins to continue to be
strong at around 20% to 22%.
We remain focused on actions within our control despite the continued headwinds of weak consumer confidence, only
modest job growth and buyers challenged by mortgage qualification issues. We expect to earn a small profit in the
second quarter in our single-family homebuilding business.
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. Our cash balance as of the end of the quarter was just under
$1.5 billion. Capital spending during the first quarter was approximately $47 million. For the full year, we expect to
spend between $250 million to $270 million. We anticipate receiving approximately $15 million in credit from the
Canadian government for projects at our Grande Prairie, Alberta pulp mill.
Our current bank credit facility of $1 billion expires at the end of this year. No borrowings are outstanding under the
agreement and we anticipate replacing this facility by the end of the second quarter. We have $30 million of debt
payments due in the second quarter, which completes our scheduled debt maturities for the year.
Our non-cash pension expense and post-retirement expense in the first quarter was a charge of about $24 million. This
was slightly higher than what we anticipate on a quarterly basis for the remainder of the year. Based on updated
estimates of the funded status of our U.S. qualified pension plan, we will not be required to make a contribution for
2011. At year end, we had estimated that the U.S. plan contribution could have been as much as $20 million. We still
do expect to fund approximately $80 million into our Canadian plans later this year.
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Patty. In summary, despite challenging conditions in the U.S. housing market, which are worse than one year
ago, we continued to make progress during the first quarter to improve our financial performance. We're expecting
improvement in all businesses in the second quarter based upon actions that we've taken and improvements that we
have made in order to increase our competitiveness. We're focused on making the most of existing market conditions,
and we're prepared to leverage our scale to take full advantage of any market improvement.
As we now get ready to turn to questions, I want to make one final comment in anticipation of perhaps questions about
weather events this week in the South. We've all heard and seen on TV stories of tornadoes throughout the South. It's
affected some of our operations in both our Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers and Wood Products business. First of all, I
want to say that all of our employees and their families are safe. We are assessing damage as we speak. We suffered
some limited power outage at our Columbus Modified Fiber facility, but our pulp mill is operating. We've had some
limited damage of timberlands, but we won't have any full assessment until we are able to get up in the air and survey
damage. We've had some property damage at some of our Wood Products facilities and some minor power outages, but
at this point it's likely that there will be no material impact on our activities in the second quarter, and we'll have further
reports as our people are able to get back out into the field. But I just wanted to provide an initial assessment of how
we've come through this past week.
So with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Patty and invite your questions.
Patricia M. Bedient
Nicole, we'd like to open the floor for questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman CFA>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning, Gail.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman CFA>: I want to start with a few questions on the Wood Products operations. Your volumes
were up reasonably year-on-year and I'm just wondering do you think you took some market share or do you think
customers were building inventories, because that seems a little out of line with the underlying demand?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I think, Gail, in the first quarter there is some build in inventory in anticipation of a building
season. We talked on the last call about waiting until after the Super Bowl to see if there's a spring selling season.
Based upon what we reported this morning and what we see certainly reported nationally, the market is still very soft,
but we, as you noted, did have some increase in activity and, more importantly, for our Wood Products business we've
seen increase in margins which is related to the focus that we've had on focusing on our pricing as well as cost
management. But as I noted in my comments, and I spent a fair amount of time talking about it, we are concerned about
U.S. housing recovery. First quarter numbers are not healthy, and so we're managing our business based upon the
volume that's available today and positioning ourselves to grow with the recovery.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman CFA>: Okay. And just following on that, your second quarter guidance for fairly flat
realizations in Wood Products, have you – was there a lag in pricing that would give you confidence in that, because
current prices would suggest a reasonable decline?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, there's a bit of a lag. We're already one month into the quarter, and so the guidance that
we provided is the best information that we've got.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman CFA>: Okay. And just something – can you give a little bit more color on what you're seeing
in the West Coast in terms of the trends in Chinese demand? Has it continued to grow? Is there any sign of slowing,
either kind of the U.S. Northwest or British Columbia? And also, you kind of referenced log costs being up in the West
and how you see that impacting domestically-oriented saw mills in the West?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: So to answer the questions sequentially, talking about general Chinese demand, Gail, we've
been watching the build in demand over the last 18 months. Lumber demand has primarily impacted Canadian lumber
producers in the West. In Timberlands business, the logs – log demand from China has occurred primarily in operations
in Washington and Oregon. As we noted, we've had a steady increase in the amount of export that we've been shipping
to China.
In the lumber business in Canada, it started several years ago with shipments of beetle-damaged wood and gradually
the volumes have picked up and the quality has picked up. As we've noted before, the wood products are going into
industrial uses, primarily forms for concrete work, shoring, palettes and packing. We don't see demand backing off at
this point. And so we are taking advantage of the opportunity in our Timberlands business to increase flows to the
market because we've got longer-term relationships and we've got strategically advantaged logistical facilities. And we
are shipping some lumber out of Canada. But given the location of our saw mills, it's not a heavy percentage.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman CFA>: Okay. And just a question in terms of margins for domestic saw mill – for saw mills
in the West, given rising log costs, is that a major concern for you?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: It is a concern because, as you know, and as we've talked about, the U.S. housing market has
been relatively weak. And so there's not a lot of pricing power for lumber producers. So log prices have moved up

because of the demand from Asia. And it is putting a bit of a squeeze on lumber producers.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman CFA>: Okay. But no sign of that impacting log demand at this point?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We have not seen it.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman CFA>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So I think that the whole question of the impact of China on the domestic market is
difficult to dimension because we do have some logs that we sell domestically that could go to export, so others that are
exporting as well, as well as some of the domestic producers are shipping lumber to China. So that's helped the
domestic market as well for domestic producers. So I think it's a little mix in terms of the China impact isn't really all
export. It does flow over a little bit to the domestic market, which is good given that the U.S. housing market is so
weak.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: And then, I think as I mentioned and related to the Japanese earthquake, we would anticipate
that there would be a pick-up in demand from the West Coast not only for logs but for lumber. But I – at this point it's
too early to tell what the timing will be because they do have to work through their issues of infrastructure before they
are ready to take on significant rebuilding of permanent structures. The focus right now is on temporary structures
because of the incredible amount of damage that was done in the tsunami.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman CFA>: You're keeping your regular volumes to Japan at this point?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We are.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman CFA>: Thank you.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We've seen very little disruption, Gail, in shipments to Japan. Immediately after the
earthquake, there was a need for some rerouting and some short-term disruption. In our log export business, we had
some logs that were scheduled to be shipped to Japan, and on a short-term basis they were rerouted to China, but we
expect that the Japan demand will come back.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Thank you, Gail, for your questions. Next question, Nicole?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon III, CFA>: Thank you very much. And again, we very much appreciate the new reporting format.
I think this is the second straight quarter and we look forward to that. I think the biggest question I had just looking
over the results is trying to forecast the corporate expense line. And it looks to me from what you're saying is that we
obviously would shave a little bit from this quarter; it was pretty high for the lower pension expense, and I'm guessing
that might be, what, 5 million. And the other question is on the stock, 8 million you mentioned increase on the stock
compensation, is that a number that is totally a function of the stock price? Or is there some fixed level that we should
always factor in? So bottom line is, where do you see that corporate expense number going?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, Chip, as you look at that, you're right on the pension, and I would remind you that
what's in the corporate segment is just pension and post-retirement that doesn't get allocated to the segments. So in the
reporting package, to try to help you dimension that a little bit better, on page 4 we give you the total company look by
quarter and then back on page 9, in the Corporate and Other segments, we give you what portion of that runs through
corporate. So that should help you with the pension and post-retirement benefits. And you're right, in terms of a
go-forward number it's probably at 4 million to 5 million less on a per-quarter basis than what it was in the first quarter.
Now as you think about the variable comp expense tied to the stock, most of that really is a function of the stock price,
and it runs in a couple of areas. One, we do have some stock appreciation rights that we use for our equity plans in
Canada, and then we also have deferred comp that is in share equivalents. The share equivalents are about I think

roughly a million shares at the end of the quarter, and the stock price moved about $6 in the quarter, so that should help
you dimension that movement quarter-to-quarter. And on a go-forward basis, I would say, exclusive of those items,
probably $10 million to $15 million a quarter in the Corporate and Other segment would be a good rule of thumb. As
you know, the Corporate and Other segment is sort of a catch-all segment and it does get impacted by things like
foreign exchange, stock price, et cetera. So directionally, keeping those things in mind I think will help you chart what
that corporate expense will be on a go-forward basis.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon III, CFA>: So said differently, if we assume the stock price just didn't change in a given quarter,
there would still be the pension expense and that would be in addition to that 10 million to 15 million, correct?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes. That would be right.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon III, CFA>: Okay. And then the second and last question is I believe I heard you say that as you
forecast the second quarter for Wood Products, you expected realizations to be flat, I believe, sequentially. And just
sort of looking at recent prints from whether it's the futures market or random links, I'm just wondering if that might be
something that could be maybe a few weeks old or is that something that would on the other hand anticipate some
improvement as we go into May and June?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, we really haven't seen improvement as we go into May and June. Usually we would
expect to see some, and we held realizations flat in the forecast. As you appropriately note, in April those realizations
are a little softer, so if we don't get any pick-up then I would say that there's possible downward pressure on the flat
realization forecast.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon III, CFA>: Got you. Thank you very much.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Uh-huh. Next question?

Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - George L. Staphos MBA>: Hi again. Hi, Patty, Kathy. Good morning, everyone. A couple of nitty-gritty
questions, I guess, to start. Did I hear you say, Dan or Patty, that in Wood Products, while obviously it's still a
relatively weak end market environment, you expected unit costs to be lower as you were going to be improving
production. If I heard that correctly and you don't necessarily see the pick-up, does it make for perhaps a weaker third
quarter because at some point those costs have to come back to roost if you don't sell the product?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Costs are coming down for a couple of reasons, George. Part of it is a higher utilization rate at
our mills that is in part related to permanent closures that we took at the end of last year. So we are operating at a
higher rate in lumber and in OSB, slightly higher rate in our solid sections. With respect to lumber, we've got very high
operating rates in Canada, somewhat lower in the U.S., but those utilization rates should be sustainable given the level
of demand that we see today. We're also enjoying some benefits from reduced SG&A as compared to fourth quarter.
We brought our SG&A in the business down by 13%. So it is a focus on tightening up costs as well as our general
focus in our Wood Products businesses to work the margins very heavily and in some cases we do have some pricing
opportunity, but we've got to be working both price and margin.
<Q - George L. Staphos MBA>: Okay. That segues to my other questions. One, to the extent that you can comment,
and if you have it in the packet I missed it, what would you say your average operating rates are right now across your
major product classes within Wood Products? And secondly, for you or for Larry if he's on the phone – I'm sorry, go
ahead, Dan.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Larry's not on the phone so you've got me and Patty.
<Q - George L. Staphos MBA>: That's good. Do you think the initiatives that you've taken in Wood and the actions
that you've done to date would be sufficient to bring the business to breakeven on an EBIT basis if we held prices in

your major categories flat at the 1Q average, or would you need to embark upon additional actions to get to a breakeven
on EBIT? So operating rates and further actions if needed.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Operating rates, let's take that one first. In lumber for the quarter, our operating rate
approached 80%. In our OSB business we were running at around 66%, and in our engineered business it continues to
be in the mid-30s. As you know, engineered products go into new home construction, whereas at least with OSB and
lumber we've got some alternative outlets, potential export plus the home improvement warehouse business. With
respect to the initiatives in Wood Products, we have a wide range of initiatives underway in every single one of our
product lines – lumber, OSB, engineered and in our distribution business. We need to be making progress in all of
those to get to the numbers that we're projecting, and we're making progress. So I'm really pleased with the amount of
activity that we have ongoing in our Wood Products business to improve our competitiveness, but we have not
completed the initiatives and they are ongoing. And we need to continue to improve in every single one of those in
order to hit the numbers that we projected.
<Q - George L. Staphos MBA>: So, Dan, if I'm interpreting it correctly, your initiatives would get you to breakeven
on a cash flow basis but you really can't comment to whether they would get you to breakeven given the current market
environment on an operating profit basis, would that be fair?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, I think it would be fair, George, to say that in our forecast we said that we would be
cash positive for the second quarter. We said that the loss would narrow on an EBIT basis, so – and our forecast was
realizations flat. So we would not be to operating breakeven during the second quarter, but we do expect to be cash
flow positive.
<Q - George L. Staphos MBA>: Fair enough, Patty. I was looking at past really 2Q, but I'll leave it there for now. The
last question, working capital was up quite a bit in the quarter. Again, around the same line of reasoning or questioning,
is there a way that you can become even more cash efficient in the future? Certainly you can control that a bit more
than you can the markets that you're operating in terms of improving the returns. Thanks, guys. Good luck in the
quarter.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Working capital build that you see in Wood Products is seasonal. It is normal this time of year
that you would build first quarter. The utilization of our working capital has also improved over time. We continue to
focus on increased inventory turns in our distribution business as well as the manufacturing portion of our businesses,
and I would not say that there's no opportunity there. We continue to work it, not just in the Wood Products business
but every business that we've got.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, I think as you think about working capital, especially in Wood Products, you're
coming off a very low year-end December and holiday season. So that's a good portion of that build as well and is
pretty typical year-over-year. I would say that if we had more confidence in the housing outlook we would have built
more working capital than what you see there, although it is something that we monitor very closely, and we would not
expect to be building additional working capital in the second quarter. Next question?

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mark Wilde PhD>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Wilde PhD>: I just want to echo Chip's comment. I find this new layout with the results and the detail
very, very helpful. A couple questions on Wood Products. I did notice a big drop in Wood Products' SG&A, and I
wondered, Dan, is that likely to go down any further? Is that first quarter level sort of the new run rate in that business?
Can you tell us a little bit about what you did to bring that down?

<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: A lot of that, Mark, came out of selling cost. As we looked at our business and evaluated what
we really needed in operating, I would say that there is – that is the run rate that we've got today but we are looking for
ongoing opportunities to bring it down. It was a notable change. Those were actions that we took last year in order to
align our cost structure with the market situation that we find ourselves in.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: And a number of those costs, in addition to the selling, were actually costs that – were
costs that the corporate center in terms of allocated costs that historically – types of costs that would be allocated to the
segment for their use for things like IT and other services. And we have been working pretty steadily across the
company to bring those costs down in line with Wood Products' operating posture. So I think it's the combination of the
selling, the G&A, the G&A that is direct into the business as well. And as Dan said, I think in that business really
trying to pull all the levers that we can.
<Q - Mark Wilde PhD>: Okay. I was just struck, Patty, when I looked at it across all the segments, that was the
segment where you really saw the big decline, both year over year and quarter to quarter. One other question about
lumber, Dan, and I think people have kind of gotten around this a little bit already, but we've seen this big drop in the
lumber futures. And I wondered if you had any thoughts about what's behind that? One argument that I've heard is that
the Chinese have backed away from the lumber markets up in Canada and elsewhere in the short term and that's one of
the reasons we're seeing this. I wondered if you had any thoughts.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We're not a huge seller of lumber into the Chinese market. We've got some production out of
Canada.
<Q - Mark Wilde PhD>: Uh-huh. But you're a huge lumber player so you must have a -
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Go ahead, Mark. I'm sorry.
<Q - Mark Wilde PhD>: I was just going to say, you're such a huge lumber player, though, you must have a sense of
what's...
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: [ph] Oh we are.
<Q - Mark Wilde PhD>: ... going on.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I think some of this is a reaction to anemic U.S. housing starts numbers. That's really the
driver for lumber, especially across the West and in the South, also. We're just not seeing the starts levels that had been
anticipated as we entered the year. I made the comment that as we were entering the year we were expecting starts at
about 525,000 single-family. That was certainly not at the high end of the range of forecasts. And what we're seeing
now is those forecasts starting to drop below 500,000. Yesterday, NAHB came out with a revised forecast at slightly
under 480,000. And so I think that – the Chinese demand for lumber and logs has been important, but the main driver is
U.S. housing.
<Q - Mark Wilde PhD>: Yeah. Okay. I wanted to just step over to Timberlands for a minute. And I wondered, when
we look at the details you're giving us for the Timberland business, is there anything that you could do going forward
that would give us a little more visibility inside the portion of that business that's export in terms of export volume and
export prices? And it would particularly help us understand kind of how you're doing in the Japanese market because I
think you sell a much richer mix of logs into Japan than, say, what you would sell into other Asian markets.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Historically that's the case. You used the comment – the term "richer mix", and we've seen the
quality of the logs that are being shipped to China increase over the last 12 months. Some of that is related to
availability of logs out of the West. And we've been working to try to improve the data that we do get to you so you
have a better understanding of our business. So we'll take your question as input. We've got an analyst meeting coming
up where we're going to talk about Timberlands and so we'll try to give you some greater visibility.
<Q - Mark Wilde PhD>: Okay. Just one last question, Dan, just it seems to me there are still a number of peripheral
assets around the company, and just to take a single example, you've got a single bleached board machine up there at
Longview. It just seems like you have one machine in a market that you're not really in otherwise. It just doesn't seem

to me that you're the natural owner for some of these businesses. Any kind of thoughts on that?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The bleached board business is located in Longview. It's part of our Longview complex, and it
starts to get relatively complex in terms of shared services and integration with other activities. That business is much
improved, and in fact we are a significant player in that market. There are only a limited number of producers of that
product. We've got great long-term relationships, and we are a significant seller of that product in Japan. So it's a
significant contributor of cash. It's operating better than it has ever been for us, and at this point it continues to be part
of the portfolio.
<Q - Mark Wilde PhD>: Okay. Very good. Well, listen, I look forward to seeing you in a few weeks.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: First, your comments about housing mix in the quarter and expectations that the mix
will remain weak in Q2, do you anticipate at this point that your mix is where it ought to be for the rest of the year if we
don't see housing pick up? Or is it hard to see beyond the second quarter? And my second question, I was wondering if
you could just give us an update on your overall energy cost sensitivities?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: So on housing mix, let me understand your question, Mark. You're reacting to our comment
that margins shifted because of mix?
<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: Sure.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Okay. So that is a comment really around the relative mix of closings and where they came
from. So fourth quarter, we would have had a higher percentage of closings coming from Southern California, in
particular San Diego. First quarter, there were more closings in other markets, and so on a first quarter statement, and
as Patty said in her outlook for second quarter about margins, it is a function of where those closings occur. We would
expect, as we have in the past, to see a pick-up in mix towards California in the back half of the year. But as I reported
when we talked about activity on a year-over-year basis, our sales activity is much lower in California than it has been.
So somewhat of a concern as we look at what margins might be, and it's too early to tell what that would be in the third
and fourth quarter.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: Helpful. That's just what I was looking for.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: At this point, we've got a very good sense of what second quarter activity is going to be
because those homes are fundamentally in escrow.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: Right. Okay, and on the energy side?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Could you restate your question?
<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: Yeah. I'm just trying to get a sense of what your energy cost sensitivities are right
now. Fuel costs are up, oil prices are up. Just trying to get a sense on both the – whether it's significant enough for it to
matter going forward in the Timberland business and also in your Fiber business.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: As you think about it in our Timberlands business, Mark, diesel fuel really is the biggest
impact there, and it is a significant impact. If we were to take the prices that we have currently and have those for the
rest of the year, given where we were at the beginning of the year, it could be as much as a $20 million to $25 million
impact for the rest of the year. So that's the primary piece. As it relates to Cellulose Fibers, fuel, of course, impacts
freight costs there. And then the other major impact I would say as you think about oil prices flows over somewhat into
our Wood Products business in terms of the cost for resin, et cetera. So those would be the major pieces.

<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Just a final comment. I made a note in my remarks that energy also does affect consumer
confidence. The translation of oil prices into gas prices at the pump does have an impact on consumer confidence,
which affects the homebuilding business, which ultimately, as you know, flows back to the Wood Products business.
When we get to $5 a gallon for gasoline, people start to change their habits and it makes them cautious.

Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Hi, Josh.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Dan, you mentioned before some new products on the Cellulose Fibers side and, if I recall,
you were doing something with a commodity viscose staple extender. Can you give us some more details on that in
terms of timing, mix, how much that could potentially take out of your typical fluff pulp business and what your
expectations are for those new lines?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yes. Patty talked about this about six weeks ago in a conference and we are making a product
which has the ability to be an extender for dissolving pulp. It has a brand name called Pearl, and I think the estimate
that we made recently was that we may have as much as 60,000 tons this year. We've had very strong market response
for that product. We've had a very limited number of shipments so far, but we're building an order book for the balance
of the year and it does give us the potential to increase our average realizations across the pulp business. It's going to be
a relatively small percentage of total production, but on the margin it will give us some increased pricing power and it
should benefit us and you'll start to see that more in the balance of the year. Very limited activity in the first quarter.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Is there some rough estimate, if you get to 60,000 tons of production, how much that would
actually take out of the existing Cellulose Fibers production capacity?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, it's not a one-for-one substitution, so as we shift over to that product we have a
corresponding loss in fluff volume, slightly more than one-to-one, but it is more than made up by the increase in price.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Okay. But would it be like a two-for-one?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: No, no, no. Nothing that [ph] dramatic.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Okay. And on your Wood Products side, you touched on Japan and how much of that – that
actually makes up of revenues. Is there – would you be able to give us an estimate of how much Japan actually makes
up of your Wood Products division itself or is that -
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: It's a small percentage of Wood Products historically. We – they've been a major log
customer. We ship to Japan primarily from Canada, where we ship our J-grade product, and out of our operations in
Canada it is a small percentage that flows there. As demand may pick up for rebuilding, we would have the ability
perhaps to pick up lumber exports, not just from Canada but also the U.S. But primarily they're a purchaser of spruce,
and so that would be coming out of our Canadian operations.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Thank you very much.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: By and far, as we talk about Japan, it's a log market and it is a Cellulose Fibers market for us,
both pulp and liquid packaging board.

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: And next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Thank you. Trying to get a handle on the potential impact of increased purchases from Japan
for your log business related to rebuilding. I realize it's very difficult to forecast, especially on the timing. But if we
look back to Kobe, can you give us a sense as to what type of impact that you think that that had on your log business?
Did it perhaps increase your log sales to Japan by 50% versus where their run rates might have otherwise been for a
three-to-five year period? Or how would you frame what happened in that prior situation? And if you have any
perspective on how the current situation might differ that you'd share, that would be great, too.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I don't have numbers on the impact on our log shipments from that period. The most
significant aspect of the Kobe rebuild was that wood frame construction performed very well in that earthquake. And
so following that earthquake, there was a more significant adoption of Western-style framing for the construction of
single-family homes. And that's now part of their building code. So that's not a barrier that we would have to overcome.
Longer term, that may be an opportunity for us in China because the Chinese do not build stick-frame homes. They
build with concrete and brick, and so terrific long-term opportunity that the Chinese would start to build wood frame
houses. So I can't comment on the impact on our log exports. I can just tell you that we've got solid, long-term
customers that buy our logs, that convert them into structural wood frame products. And so we're positioned with those
relationships, not only with the operators of saw mills but also the trading companies that we work with over the years,
that – to the extent that there's a market opportunity and a demand for those products, we'd be able to take advantage of
that.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Maybe let me try and come at it a different way and perhaps you can provide some help. If
we think about the Japanese housing market, order of magnitude is 800,000 starts. Maybe 450,000, 500,000 wood starts
in the last year or so. If one were to make an assumption that there's going to be another 400,000 houses built, let's just
say, just pulling numbers out of the air, so it would be 50% equivalent of one year, and you flow that over five years
then it would perhaps add 10% or so a year to Japanese housing starts, 10% to 20%, depending on how you calculate it.
Would that translate to a 10% to 20% increase for you or would it potentially be very different than the 10% to 20%?
So the last part being kind of the question of if we make a judgment on how much the impact's going to be on Japanese
housing starts, how does that then flow back to you?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I can't comment on your modeling and how you would approach it. I assume that we will
receive our share of product demand for rebuilding, but remember they get wood products from all over the world. It's
not just North America that's sending either finished lumber or logs to Japan. The key for us is to leverage the
long-term relationships and the logistical advantages that we have, and we will take advantage of as much opportunity
as possible. And the timing will play out. As I said, they need to deal with temporary housing first. There's about
150,000 homes that were destroyed. Their focus right now is on temporary housing, which is both steel and wood
frame, and then they'll get to focusing on permanent rebuilding. And in some cases, some of the homes that were
damaged are in areas where it's going to be a while before there's any rebuilding because they have concerns about
radiation up north.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. Great. And then just one last real quick one, I guess I was a little surprised that we
didn't even see a bigger increase in the Pacific Northwest log pricing relative at least to the fourth quarter. Are those –
is that mix shifts that are offsetting what seemed to have been even bigger increases by specific grade?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, prices have been moving up and there is some mix. We also have some portion of our
logs, as Patty said, that are actually sold domestically to customers that end up flowing them to Asia. So I'm not sure
that I'm answering your question, Mark. Restate it one more time.

<Q - Mark Weintraub>: If you look at your Pacific Northwest log prices, it was up 5% first quarter versus fourth
quarter. And if you looked at what many of the movements on individual species of logs have been, it seemed to have
been much bigger than that. So I was just trying to understand why there wasn't an even bigger increase 1Q versus 4Q
in your average Pacific Northwest log realizations, and I wondered whether it was mix had something to do with that.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So you do have some movement in mix, Mark, because Japan is still our biggest overall
market, but in terms of movement quarter-over-quarter I would say that China, which has a little bit lower priced log,
was a bigger – had a bigger movement in the overall mix.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Right. That makes a lot of sense. And do the prices to the Japanese market – do you tend to
have longer-term contracts that are much more stable or do they really move with the market as well?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: They move with the market.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Richard Skidmore CFA>: Just wanted to focus on Cellulose Fibers just for a second. Can you just calibrate the
outages in the first quarter and possibly the second quarter, either on a tonnage basis or what you'd expect the
maintenance cost to be? And then had a follow-up just on the – how you're seeing the trends in the fluff market and
how you think those trends would play out through the balance of 2011? Thanks.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, Rick, this is Patty. Why don't I take the maintenance outage question. As you think
about your average outage for our mill set, on average they'll run about 10 to 12 days and it will be about $1 million a
day, just round numbers. So let's just say that's $12 million a mill. In the first quarter, we had two mills that were down.
So that would be a total of $24 million. And then as Kathy said in her comments, we did spend about $7 million in the
first quarter on the outages for the second quarter, just getting ready for those outages. So that would be around, just a
little bit over $30 million for the maintenance cost itself in the first quarter, and we do expense maintenance as it's
incurred.
So as we move to the second quarter, then, I said we would complete our remaining outages for the year. So that means
we have four in the second quarter. So, again, back to our $12 million a mill, that would be – 12 times 4 would be $48
million, and if you took the $7 million that we already spent on that, we'd be just over $40 million. Now those are for
average outages, and we do have one mill in the second quarter where we will be installing a capital project. So its
outage is a little over twice as long, or about twice as long as a normal outage would be. So let's just say that's another
$10 million. So roughly quarter-over-quarter you're looking at probably just over $30 million for the first quarter and
just under $50 million for the second quarter for an increase of a little under $20 million.
<Q - Richard Skidmore CFA>: Great. And then just maybe just comment on how you're seeing the trends in fluff
pulp, because we've seen some – certainly some tightening in paper grade pulp.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: There's been tightening in paper grade. You know, fluff index prices have been off a bit.
There is some substitution that's taking place where there's some fluff that is moving into the dissolving market and the
conversion of some machines. You know, our forecast that Patty provided is that we expect average realizations to be
up. And that's a function of, in part, what we see as forward pricing. But also there's some estimate of mix as we start to
flow in some of our Pearl product.
<Q - Richard Skidmore CFA>: Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: We have time for one more question.

Your final question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.
<Q - Steve Chercover CFA, MBA>: Just on Timberlands, please. First of all, are you currently marketing any
non-strategic lands or is there anything pending?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We are always in the market looking at land, in large part to improve the mix of what we've
got. The non-strategic land that we sold in the first quarter was whitewood land, and we have had a strategy of moving
into land that was better suited for Douglas-fir and so on. On the margin, we are always in the market, but we have no
significant non-strategic land parcels on the market today.
<Q - Steve Chercover CFA, MBA>: Great. And obviously you've been in the timber business for 100 years, but now
that you're a REIT do you contemplate stratifying your land holdings into core, non-core and maybe HBU categories
and discussing it with us?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We're absolutely prepared to discuss that. We've provided numbers in the past. If you look at
our inventory, we have a relatively small percentage of HBU because we have, over time, been active in marketing
HBU and disposing of it. In terms of core versus non-core, the majority of our timberlands we consider to be core. You
know, they're in our primary operating areas and so we don't have any significant amount of land that we would
consider not to be core. But we're happy to share those numbers. And we'll provide a little bit more color in May. But
we have done that in the past, and our core lands are well over 90% if you look at our timberlands.
<Q - Steve Chercover CFA, MBA>: Very good. Thanks, Dan.
