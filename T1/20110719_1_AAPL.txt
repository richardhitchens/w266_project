Peter Oppenheimer
Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us.
We're thrilled to report the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history. We also set a new all-time
quarterly record for iPhone and iPad sales and a new June quarter record for Mac sales, and we are extremely pleased
with the momentum of our business.
Revenue for the quarter was $28.6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 82%. This record quarterly revenue
tops the previous record established in the most recent December quarter by $1.8 billion and was almost $13 billion
over the year-ago quarter's result. The tremendous year-over-year increase was fueled primarily by dramatic growth in
iPhone and iPad sales in addition to strong growth in Mac sales.
Operating margin was a record high of $9.4 billion, representing 32.8% of revenue. Net income was $7.3 billion,
topping the previous quarterly record set in the December quarter by $1.3 billion. Net income grew even faster than
revenue, increasing 125% year over year, and translated to earnings per share of $7.79.
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new June
quarter record with sales of 3.95 million Macs, representing a 14% increase over the year-ago quarter's results. This
growth is more than four times IDC's most recently published forecast of 3% growth for the PC market overall. Mac
sales were particularly strong in our Asia-Pacific segment, where we experienced a 57% year-over-year increase in
total Macs sold. We generated healthy Mac growth in both desktop and portable categories.
In May, we updated the iMac with the next-generation quad-core processors, powerful new graphics, high-speed
Thunderbolt I/O technology, and a new FaceTime HD camera. The growth in Mac portable sales was driven by strong
sales of MacBook Pro as well as MacBook Air. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of
Mac channel inventory.
We are very excited to be launching Mac OS X Lion tomorrow. Lion includes more than 250 new features such as
Multi-Touch gestures; system-wide support for full-screen apps; Mission Control, which is an innovative view of
everything running on your Mac; and much more.
Moving to our music products, we sold 7.5 million iPods compared to 9.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Total iPod
sales were ahead of our expectations. And iPod touch continues to account for over half of all iPods sold. IPod's share
of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD. And iPod
continued to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. We
ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.
The iTunes Store generated strong results, with revenue of almost $1.4 billion. ITunes revenue was up 36% year over
year thanks primarily to continued strong sales of music, video, and apps. With more than 225 million accounts, iTunes
is the number one music retailer in the world, and customers have downloaded more than 15 billion songs to date.
I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We were thrilled to sell a record 20.3 million iPhones compared to 8.4 million in the
previous June quarter. This represents 142% year-over-year growth, which is more than double IDC's latest published
estimate of 67% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the June quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone
handset and accessories sales was $13.3 billion during the quarter compared to $5.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, an
increase of 150%.
We continued to experience very strong year-over-year iPhone sales growth in all of our operating segments. IPhone
sales momentum in the Asia-Pacific region was particularly robust, with sales almost quadrupling year over year.
We continued to increase our overall iPhone manufacturing capacity in the quarter. We were pleased to launch a
number of new carrier relationships. And by the end of the quarter, iPhone was available through 228 carriers in 105
countries compared to 186 carriers in 90 countries as of the end of the March quarter.

We ended the quarter with about 5.9 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 700,000 to
support strong iPhone demand, carrier additions, and expanded distribution. We remain within our target range of four
to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory.
IPhone continues to be adopted as a standard across the enterprise, with 91% of the Fortune 500 deploying or testing
the device, up from 88% last quarter. We are also seeing great growth in scale worldwide. Today, 57% of Global 500
companies are testing or deploying iPhone, fueled by strong employee demand and opportunities for custom app
development. Some examples of Global 500 companies supporting iPhone on their corporate networks include AXA,
Crédit Agricole, Nestlé, Dow Chemical, GlaxoSmithKline, SUPERVALU, and Comcast.
Turning to iPad, we continue to be thrilled with its incredible momentum. We sold a record 9.2 million iPads during the
June quarter compared to 3.3 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 183%. We were able to increase production
sequentially by over 4.5 million, and we sold every iPad we could make. We launched iPad 2 in an additional 36
countries. And combining the original iPad and iPad 2, we ended the quarter with distribution in a total of 64 countries.
Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was over $6 billion compared to $2.2
billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 179%. We ended the quarter with about 1.05 million iPads in channel
inventory, a sequential increase of about 200,000, which was well below our target range of four to six weeks.
Today, 86% of the Fortune 500 are deploying or testing iPad within their enterprises, up from 75% last quarter. We're
also seeing strong adoption internationally, with 47% of Global 500 companies testing or deploying iPad.
In the 15 months since iPad has shipped, we've seen iPad used in the enterprise in ways we could have never imagined.
Companies like Boston Scientific, Xerox, and Salesforce.com are deploying thousands of iPads and revolutionizing
how their sales teams engage with customers. IPad is being used inside the country's top hospitals like HCA and
Cedars-Sinai, and in retail at Nordstrom and at Estee Lauder's Clinique counters.
General Electric, SAP, and Standard Chartered have developed internal apps for training, currency tracking, and
business process management to help make employees even more productive. And Alaska Airlines and American
Airlines are using the iPad in cockpits to replace paper-based navigational and reference information pilots carry with
them on every flight. We continue to be delighted by the diverse and sometimes unexpected use cases we see around
iPad.
Combining iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, we reached over 222 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of
the June quarter.
Last month, we provided a preview of iOS 5, which includes over 200 new features, such as Notification Center for
viewing and managing notifications without interruption; iMessage for sending text messages, photos, and videos
between iOS devices; and Newsstand, a new way to purchase and organize newspaper and magazine subscriptions.
With the new PC Free feature, iOS 5 users will be able to activate and set up iOS devices right out of the box with no
computer required. We're looking forward to launching iOS 5 this fall.
In June, we also provided a preview of iCloud, our set of free new services that work seamlessly with applications on a
customer's iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, or PC to automatically and wirelessly store content in the cloud as well as
push it to all the users' devices. We think customers will love using iCloud, and we look forward to its release in the
fall.
The App Store continues to be incredibly successful, with over 425,000 apps available and over 15 billion downloads
to date. And as we mentioned last month, we're extremely pleased to have reached over $2.5 billion in cumulative
payments to iOS developers, far ahead of any of our competitors.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which generated record June quarter results. Revenue grew to $3.5
billion from $2.6 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 36%. This growth was driven primarily by higher
volumes of iPads, iPhones, and Macs. The stores sold 768,000 Macs compared to 677,000 Macs in the year-ago
quarter, an increase of 13%. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the June quarter were to customers who

had never owned a Mac before.
We opened four new stores in the quarter, including two in France, one in the UK, and one in Germany, ending with a
total of 327. With an average of 325 stores open, average revenue per store was $10.8 million compared to $9 million
in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 20%. Retail segment margin was $828 million compared to $593 million in the
year-ago quarter.
Store traffic continues to be very strong. We hosted 73.7 million visitors in the June quarter compared to 60.5 million
in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%.
Our recently launched Personal Setup program is off to a great start. Customers love this new feature of the Retail Store
experience as they are up and running with their new products before they leave. During the June quarter, we set up
over 2 million Macs, iPhones, iPads, and iPods collectively.
We plan to open 30 new stores in the September quarter, including our first store in Hong Kong. That will bring us to a
total of 40 store openings in fiscal 2011, including 28 new stores outside the United States.
Total company gross margin was 41.7%, which was 370 basis points higher than our guidance. This difference was a
result of three approximately equal factors: a stronger mix of iPhones; lower commodity and other costs, which
included some one-time items; and leverage on the higher revenue.
Operating expenses were $2.54 billion, and included $232 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was
$172 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%.
Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $76.2 billion at the end of the
June quarter compared to $65.8 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $10.4 billion. Cash flow
from operations was $11.1 billion, an increase of 131% year over year.
I'd now like to talk about the accounting implications of some of the new aspects of our products and services. First,
when we deliver Mac OS X Lion to customers, we are now including the right to receive future unspecified minor
software upgrades and features when and if they become available for both the Mac operating system and our suite of
Mac OS iLife applications. We will continue to charge for standalone sales of our periodic major OS upgrades, such as
Lion, as well as major upgrades of iLife. Revenue from these standalone sales will now be fully deferred at the time of
sale and recognized over a period of three years.
In addition to this future software upgrade right, Mac customers will have access to iCloud services when they become
available in the fall. We estimate that the combined value for the software upgrade rights and iCloud services for Mac
customers is $22. Therefore, as of June 6, we began deferring $22 of the revenue associated with each new Mac sold,
and we will recognize these deferred amounts as revenue over a period of four years.
Purchasers of iOS devices will also have access to iCloud. So beginning on June 6, we began deferring a portion of the
revenue from each iOS device sold to represent the estimated value of the right to receive iCloud services when they
become available. That deferred amount is in addition to the amount that we were already deferring for each iOS device
sold to represent the right to receive future iOS software upgrades. As a result, beginning on June 6, we are deferring a
total of $16 of revenue for each iPhone and iPad sold, and a total of $11 for each iPod touch sold and recognizing those
amounts over a period of two years.
As we move ahead in the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of
forward-looking statements that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $25
billion compared to $20.3 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38%,
reflecting approximately $55 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about
$2.725 billion, including about $245 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be
about $50 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 24%. We are targeting EPS of about $5.50.
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record revenue and earnings and the tremendous customer response to our
products. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, we have generated $35 billion in year-over-year revenue

growth, translating to a 78% increase. At the same time, we have generated over $9.5 billion in year-over-year earnings
growth, representing a 99% increase. We remain very excited about our new product pipeline, and we look forward to
releasing Mac OS X Lion tomorrow and bringing the wonderful new features of iOS 5 and iCloud to customers this
fall.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton
Thank you, Peter, and we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the
first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Good afternoon, thanks. The 12% revenue downtick, Peter, in September is much more
conservative than your typical September guidance and what you end up reporting in September, which is usually a
20%-plus increase over the last four years. Can you help us understand why you expect this next quarter to trend softer
than seasonal, and maybe how you handicap the impact from some of the new software, services, and products that you
expect to launch in the quarter? Thanks.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. Let me start with the units, and I'll give you some thoughts on revenue. For the
education buying season, September has historically been more weighted to higher education, and we would expect this
to be the same this year. We have the best lineup of Macs ever and would expect to see a year-over-year increase in
sales. We also expect a year-over-year increase in iPhone sales. And for iPad, we're continuing to expand our quarterly
production capacity and points of sale, and would expect a significant year-over-year increase in sales. For iPod, we
would expect to see a sequential year-over-year decline.
As we announced at WWDC, we have a lot going on in the fall with the introduction of iOS 5 and iCloud. We also
have a future product transition that we're not going to talk about today, and these things will impact our September
quarter. We remain very confident in our business, our new product pipeline, and our momentum.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Peter, as it relates to future product transitions, can you just remind us how you approach
working those into your guidance? Do you tend to be conservative and wait to see what happens with those products?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: As I said a moment ago, we're not going to talk about this in any detail today. We've
factored our thinking into our guidance. We are incredibly confident about our business, our new product pipeline, and
what we're doing.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thank you very much.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?

From Cross Research, we'll go to Shannon Cross.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Tim, could you talk a bit about iPad 2 sales and trends? It's still
relatively early, I suppose. But I'm curious as to what you're seeing in terms of any potential cannibalization or shifts of
people away from portables, just any thoughts you have on the iPad 2.

<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes. Sure, Shannon. In terms of cannibalization, we do believe that some customers chose to
purchase an iPad instead of a new Mac during the quarter. But we also believe that even more customers chose to
purchase an iPad over a Windows PC. And as I've said before, there's a lot more of the Windows PC business to
cannibalize than the Mac. Also we believe that the Mac has many other attributes that would make it continue to do
well in the market. We're very happy that we grew 14% versus the market's growth of 2.6%, which is about five times,
as Peter said earlier. And so that's what we see with iPad.
As Peter said earlier, we were still selling every unit we could make during the quarter, and that was the situation as we
ended the quarter. As we've stepped into July, over the initial week, to give you a more current update, we had been
able to increase the supply further, and some SKUs in some countries are at a supply/demand balance. But we're still
working very hard on the balance of the world. The sales of iPad 2 have absolutely been a frenzy for people to get one,
and we feel very good about the progress that we've made about ramping up and the reception it has received in the
marketplace.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. And then if you could talk just a little bit about China, clearly, your growth in
Asia-Pac was up almost 250% year over year, just any update on China? Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes, that's a good question. China was very key to our results. As a reminder, for Greater
China – we define Greater China as Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Year over year, it was up over six
times, and the revenue was approximately $3.8 billion during the quarter. And that makes the year-to-date numbers
through the three quarters that we've had thus far around $8.8 billion. And so this has been a substantial opportunity for
Apple, and I firmly believe that we're just scratching the surface right now. I think there is incredible opportunity for
Apple there.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question,
please?
Operator
From Barclays Capital, Benjamin Reitzes.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yes, thanks a lot. Good afternoon. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the outlook for gross
margins. You said 38% from the 41.7%. Can you talk about what components and/or mix dynamics will impact that,
Peter?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. We expect the gross margin, Ben, as you said, to be about 38% and down about 370
basis points sequentially. We expect about two-thirds of this decline to be driven by a different product mix. And we
expect the remainder to be due to the loss of leverage on the lower sequential revenue, the cost of a future product
transition, and a full quarter of the back-to-school promotion.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Okay; and sorry, I guess the components aspect of that?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Ben, it's Tim. Both NAND and DRAM and also LCDs, batteries, optical drives, and most
other components are generally in a very positive supply situation currently, and pricing is expected to fall at or above
the historical trend. Hard drive supply is currently constrained, and we project that price declines in this area will be
less than historical rates. We do expect, therefore, components to be favorable on a sequential comparison. However,
this is largely being offset by one-time benefits that we received that are embedded in the 41.7% gross margin that
Peter talked about earlier in the June quarter, and therefore not a part of the bridge that Peter just talked about.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Ben. Could we have the next question, please?

From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Bill Shope.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Great, thanks. Hopefully, I didn't miss this, but can you give us a little more color on that
one-time benefit in gross margins? How significant was it, and any color on what drove that?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. Bill, it's Peter. We saw some benefits in our warranty and phone support area and
some settlements that we had. They weren't huge in the June quarter, but we did see some benefits there. And as Tim
said, we see that generally offsetting – the reversal of that generally offsetting the component benefits that he just
talked about in the September quarter.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up, there has been a lot of news around patent disputes as
of late. Some seem to have gone in Apple's favor while others haven't. Can you help us understand, Tim, how to put
these events in context, how we should think about your IP strategy overall, and perhaps how all this is potentially
impacting the competitive landscape in smartphones and tablets?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We have a very simple view here, and that view is we love competition. We think it's great
for us and for everyone. But we want people to invent their own stuff, and we're going to make sure that we defend our
portfolio appropriately.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?

Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. I'm surprised nobody has asked it, but I was just hoping that you could provide a
little more color on what drove the iPhone strength in the quarter. Was it new carriers or existing, new countries or
existing? I know you've specifically referred to China as being a driver, but just a little more color on what you saw
with iPhone in the quarter, please.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes, Rich, it's Tim. It's a great question. We did add 42 new carriers and 15 new countries
during the quarter, and so we continued our expansion efforts to get up beyond the 225 carrier number and above 100
countries. However, those occurred throughout the quarter. And the real sequential improvement, frankly, was due to
emerging and developed markets. China was a big part of it. Latin America, driven by Brazil and Mexico, was a big
part of it. And the Middle East was a big part of it, which I think is great for Apple because these are markets that
Apple historically has not been as strong in, and we're really beginning to see the fruits of our labor in these markets.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Thanks. And then, Tim, would you be willing to give us as a follow-up any sort of
milestones that you're hoping to hit for the next quarter or two in terms of new carriers and countries for iPhone?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: No, but I think you can see that it's something that is of great focus to us. We want to do
business with great partners, and there are still great partners out there to do business with. And so we're obviously off
working new relationships.

<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Hi, good afternoon. The iPhone clearly is gaining share, but comments from Google last
week suggested Android activations are up 56% quarter over quarter. And by our math, it looks like iOS activations
were up around 20%. Tim, you mentioned that China is on fire right now, up 600%. Obviously, you're doing relatively
well in the emerging markets. But any thoughts in terms of – how do you think I guess about that Android activation
number relative to your business?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think the Android activation number is a difficult one to get our hands around because
unlike our numbers, which you can go to our data sheet and you can add the iPhones and the iPads and make a
reasonable approximation of the iPod touch which, we said is over half of our iPod sales, you can quickly see that in
the June quarter that we sold over 33 million iOS devices. And across time, as Peter mentioned in his opening
comments, we are now over 222 million cumulative iOS devices. And so we think this is incredible. And so our
numbers are very straightforward. They're transparent, and they're reported quarterly.
In terms of iPhone, iPhone is up 142% year over year. This is more than two times the rate of growth of the smartphone
market. We think that's incredible. Also, as Peter said earlier, we sold every iPad 2 in the quarter that we could make.
And so there certainly was not a shortage of demand.
We're also gaining traction in enterprise. From the numbers that Peter spoke of, obviously, now our attention is not
turning to getting corporations to test and pilot, but it's more we're really converting to more of a penetration focus.
Our App Store is the largest by far. And if you look at iPad specific apps, we're over 100,000. And I think you would
be hard pressed to find more than a few hundred on the other platforms. It also doesn't appear that the other tablets are
getting any traction to speak of. And we've paid over $2.5 billion to developers, and so there's a great business
proposition for developers. And you can tell that customers love it because we have well over 15 billion apps that have
been downloaded.
And so we're very, very confident of the product. We're confident with the App Store. We're confident with our
proposition for developers. The customer set in every survey I have seen ranks the iPhone number one, and so we're
very confident in the customer reception. We're also very confident in our roadmap. And so we feel very, very good.
You may have seen the data that just came out, I believe it was yesterday, from ChangeWave that reaffirmed once
again that iPhone is the clear leader in customer satisfaction, and also was the number one preference for those people
planning to buy a smartphone in the next 90 days. And so it seems like there are a lot of great things, and we feel
absolutely fantastic about it.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Okay. And just a follow-up question, any update on Apple TV and maybe some thoughts on
your strategy in the connected TV markets?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Apple TV continues to do well, but I don't want to mislead. We still call it a hobby here, and
we do that because we don't want anyone to conclude that it's another leg of the stool because it's not in the size market
that the iPhone is in or that the iPad is in or that the Mac is in or that the iPod is in. And so we love the product. It's
clear that customers love the product. We really got it right when we went to the new Apple TV just last fall. But right
now, it's still a hobby status, but we're continuing to invest in it because we think that there's something there.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: All right, thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question, please?

<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you, good afternoon. I just want to touch base here, Tim, on just the scintillating
sales velocity. Is Apple at a point now where you have to diversify your contract manufacturing base as well as even
your non-Apple retail channel? And what are the opportunities and risks there?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: In terms of the non-Apple retail channel, if you take the iPhone as an example, which, as you
know, makes up a large percentage of our business, we have about 115,000 points of sale. And so I feel that we're
incredibly diversified. We're selling through carriers, through retail. We're selling through our own stores, through our
online store. We're selling through companies that have direct sales forces that sell into enterprise, including an overlay
sales force of our own. And so I think the channel is extremely well diversified. There are still countries where we're
still building the channel, and so I don't want to give you a view that I think the journey is completed. But in the mature
markets, I feel that the channels are in good shape. And in the markets where we're putting more and more energy,
obviously there is still channel development to do there. But I think it's well understood and under control. So that's not
something that I worry about at all actually.
In terms of suppliers, I don't want to get into this in any detail because I think this is one of those things for us that is a
part of the magic and a part of the things that we feel that we have some secret sauce in, and I'd prefer not to share it.
But your general point about are we too centralized in one place, are we too dependent on a place, you can bet that the
people here that are involved in supply chain and we have some outstanding ones, always ask that question. And I think
we always at the end of the day make the right decision for Apple.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Understood, I appreciate that. Maybe as a follow-up either for you, Tim, or Peter, you've
talked in the past about the iPhone and the iPad 2, just because of the [ph] leading-edge (35:00) technology that
sometimes the manufacturing yields are a little lighter than what we all think. Where are you guys now in terms of
manufacturing yields? Have you walked further up the curve in terms of better utilization?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I don't want to give you specific yield numbers, but as I said earlier, the supply of iPad
improved dramatically in the quarter. That allowed us to do the over 9.2 million. That's up from the 4.7 million from
the prior quarter, so we added almost 100%. I also said that we have further improved the supply in the initial weeks of
July, and that has allowed us to get into a supply/demand balance on some SKUs in some countries. So I feel very, very
good about our progress in that area.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?

Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael Abramsky>: Thanks very much. Tim, the trajectory of iPhone growth has been nothing less than
astounding because now you are 142%. You were 113% last quarter, 86%. So I'm just trying to understand what your
thinking is on the keys to sustain that growth. Particularly, do you see the current pricing, for example, and tariffs
perhaps approaching a level maybe in North America of some saturation? Do you need to address that, different form
factors, expanded distribution, or just stay on the same business model, especially in view of lower cost Android
competitors potentially coming from Asia? Can you talk to that?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think on the tariff side, Apple doesn't set the tariffs. Those are set by the carriers, and so I
think that's a better question for them. But at a very macro level, I think what you would find if you went out and talked
to several around the world is that virtually every one of them are desirous of having more and more customers have a
smartphone and begin to use data on their networks because this is a way for them to expand their ARPUs. And I
firmly believe there is no better device than the iPhone for someone to move from any phone up to a smartphone. The
ease of use is just unparalleled and the ecosystem is just unparalleled. And so I think there's a good alignment in that

I mentioned a few moments ago the key driver in our sequential results on the iPhone, our sequential improvement in
units were emerging and developing markets. And so you can see that we're putting more and more energy in these
markets that have been a bit more difficult to do well in versus some of the markets that are in the established countries
and subsidized countries, or they're primarily subsidized. And so I think we have a very good focus here, and I think we
can compete with anyone.
<Q - Michael Abramsky>: So those markets would have prepaid, for example, lower purchasing power, indirect
distribution? Are those things that you're going to need to address through pricing and other means?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Those markets that I mentioned that we were doing well in, there are some percentage of
postpaid in some of those markets. But if you looked at the market in the aggregate, most of those markets are
predominantly prepay. In some cases, we've convinced someone to start a postpaid plan because in the long-term I
think that's better for the customer, the carrier, and us. But in general, we're also playing in the prepay market. We're
not avoiding that market. We don't want to avoid that market. We know that we need to play there in order to have the
kind of volumes that we'd like to have.
<Q - Michael Abramsky>: Okay.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: And in terms of your question on expanding channels and developing channels, obviously
that is on our list. And with 115,000 down now, we have some experience there. We know we've got a lot more to do,
but we've got some experience under our belt now to play with.

From Bank of Montreal, we'll hear from Keith Bachman.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Tim, this is for you. Mac growth was about 5% sequential. In the
past two years, the sequential growth has looked more like 17% to 18%. And notebook sequential growth was even
below that. So I wanted to go back to what do you think in this quarter was cannibalization versus perhaps some
holdbacks in anticipation of Lion. And how does that show up you think in terms of catch-up in the September quarter?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes, I really look more at year over year than I do sequential on the Mac, but I'm going to
get at the answer to your question anyway. I think first of all, I'm proud of the numbers that we achieved. To grow at
14% when the market is growing at 2.6%, doing five times the rate of growth is certainly something to be proud of.
However, in terms of why isn't the number higher than 14%, obviously we always focus on that. No matter if the
number were 42%, we would focus on that.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Right.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think there are three things that are the primary factors. And I don't want to try to quantify
these for you, but I do want to list them so that you know how we look at it. The first is, as I said before, I think there
was some cannibalization of new Macs by iPad. We shipped a record 9.2 million iPads during the quarter, which is
over two times the number of Macs that we shipped. And it's clear that some customers chose to purchase an iPad
instead of a new Mac. But the thing that really excites us is that more customers chose to buy an iPad than a Windows
PC.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: The second one is I think some customers have delayed purchase until Lion becomes
available. And as Peter commented on earlier, we are launching Lion tomorrow.

<Q - Keith Bachman>: Right.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: And we're looking forward to getting Lion out. It's a fantastic product. The guys worked
very, very hard on it, and it's really a revolutionary change.
The third thing that I wouldn't discount is in the year-ago quarter, we launched the new MacBook Pros. In this
particular quarter, we launched new iMacs. Both products were well received. However, the MacBook Pro makes up
the majority of the units that we sell in the Mac area. And so obviously, if you change the MacBook Pro and it's well
received, it's going to make the comp more difficult to compare to.
And so those are the three things that I think are primarily why the number isn't more than it is. But I don't want to lose
sight that it already is five times the industry, and this is the 21st consecutive quarter that we beat the market.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay. My follow-up then is if I look at the sequential growth pattern – sorry, in the September
quarter, I would assume given the demand, and as you said you're catching up here in the month of July, that iPads
would increase sequentially, including probably some potential channel fill. But I just wanted to see if you could give
us some feedback on what the growth trajectory looks like after this great quarter here in iPads.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We don't predict units, as you know. We aggregate things into guidance, and Peter went
through that earlier. And so I don't want to make a comment about iPad other than I think Peter said earlier, which I'm
sure that you would have reached the conclusion of anyway, that we think iPad will grow significantly year over year.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Yes.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: And we'll leave the rest of it to you to conclude.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay, thanks very much.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: And then we'd be very happy to report in October how we did.

From Bank of America, we'll go to Scott Craig.
<Q - Scott D. Craig CFA>: Thanks, good afternoon. Hey, Tim, can you maybe provide a little bit more color around
what exactly the issues are for the iPad ramping up into the levels that you want to get to? And can you hazard a guess
as to when you think you'll be at equilibrium on a global basis from a production and supply standpoint? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: This is a good problem per se in that the demand is fantastic. And so there's not something
that I would point to on the supply side saying this has created a huge issue. It's a good problem. And as I said before,
and I generally don't do that, but in this case I am, is to talk about July in the first weeks of July. We're now a little over
three weeks into the quarter. Supply has further improved since we ended our June quarter, and that further
improvement has led some SKUs in some countries to become in supply/demand balance. Now I'm not going to project
what will happen to the other countries, but obviously we're working very, very hard to get as many units to customers
as we can. And we've placed our latest thinking in the guidance, obviously.
<Q - Scott D. Craig CFA>: Okay, and maybe just a quick follow-up, Tim. Is there anything you guys are doing
differently as far as investing in the enterprise sales force, so to speak, or doing anything differently as far as going to
market on the enterprise side that you can point us to, and then I guess we'll see the fruits of that labor as we go forward
here?

<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We have a dual-pronged strategy with enterprise on both the iPad and the iPhone. As we
work with the carrier sales forces, and they have very large ones because they're selling their services into enterprise,
and many of these enterprises want one of our devices connected to it, and so we train and provide quite a bit of help to
the carrier forces. Plus we do some sales directly ourselves or act as an overlay sales force to a channel that sells to
enterprise. And I would characterize this as we're still building it out, and we do a bit better each quarter.
We're very, very happy with the numbers that Peter talked about earlier about the level of interest and taking people to
the pilot and initial deployment stages. And now our attention is moving to penetration within those accounts versus
getting on the standards list. And I think you can really look at it fairly, to be this far into the enterprise with a product
that has only been shipping for 15 months in the case of iPad is absolutely incredible because the enterprise is typically
much more conservative and takes a long time to evaluate products. In this case, people are moving at a speed I haven't
seen.
Also in a group that's not thought of as enterprise like K-12, K-12 generally takes a very long time for a new product
category. But last quarter, we sold more iPads in K-12 than we did Macs. And to do that after just five quarters is
absolutely shocking. We would have never predicted this. So we feel very, very good about the different areas that iPad
is being sold into. It's clear that it has a universal appeal in many different markets from consumer to business to
government and on and on.

From Wedge Partners, we'll go to Brian Blair.
<Q - Brian Blair>: Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit about your views on iCloud and how you feel as a service
it's going to drive more volumes of Macs, and maybe just talk about what your expectations on the halo effect across
other iOS devices?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: This is Peter. We cannot wait to get iCloud and iOS 5 into the hands of customers in the
fall. We really think that we have done it right with iCloud. We're going to deliver customers just a seamless integrated
experience that we think that they're going to love. We're going to make it very easy. And it didn't go unnoticed to us
yesterday that in the ChangeWave results, that was one of the reasons cited why the iOS devices are number one in
terms of intent to buy.
<Q - Brian Blair>: Maybe just briefly if you can comment on it, do you feel like you have much of a lead over
competitors in the ability to instantly mirror content across different devices? It feels like that's a real competitive edge
for you, but I'd love to hear your thoughts if you wouldn't mind sharing any.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: We're certainly very, very good with the Internet, with telecommunications and delivering
content. I think we have proven that for a decade, first beginning with iTunes and now with the App Store and our
payments to developers exceeding $2.5 billion. So we probably have some things to learn as we go forward, but have a
lot of skills and are very excited to get iCloud in customers' hands.

Obviously, China Mobile doesn't sell the phone, so that would certainly point to a lot of prepaid phones or unlocked
phones on their network. I believe also your direct distribution in China for the iPhone, both online and retail stores, is
in a prepaid fashion. So I was wondering if you could tell us how significant prepaid is in China and other emerging
markets, how much progress you've made there, and what lessons you've learned given that you yourselves are also
selling them prepaid? And I have a follow-up, please.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Prepaid or unlocked phones, said more in English, phones sold without a contract, are very
key in China and very key in a number of these emerging markets where the credit systems are not as well established
as they are in the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe and Australia, et cetera. And so you can look at our volume, Toni.
The iPhone volume for the first three quarters of the fiscal year was up five times year over year. And iPhone is the key
contributor to Greater China having a cumulative revenue of around $8.8 billion for the first three quarters.
And so I'm not saying at all that we have figured out precisely how to play perfectly in the environment. We haven't. I
think we have more to do and more to learn. But I feel very, very good about our progress. I think if any of us would
have been told a year ago that we would do $3.8 billion in Greater China in a quarter, I don't think very many of us
would have believed it and I don't think any of you would have believed it. And so we feel very, very good about it,
and we're taking those learnings and applying those to other markets as well.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: If I could follow up, your market share data is pretty irrefutable, and it's pretty consistent
in terms of your being a share gainer. There are parts of the world in developed countries like UK, Germany, France,
and Japan where some of the recent market data suggests that you've actually lost share in iPhones on a year-over-year
basis in Q2. I was wondering if you could tell us whether gaining share in the smartphone category for iPhone is
strategically important to Apple longer term, and how we get our minds around sustained share gains given that most of
the market data says smartphones above $300 are going to grow a lot slower than the overall smartphone market. So
how do we: A), are share gains important to Apple in this marketplace; and how do we reconcile where you participate
and its market growth rate relative to the overall market?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Share gain is important anywhere where we're going the opposite way. And we're not happy
and you can bet that we're working hard to change that. In terms of playing in different price points, we do offer the
3GS as an example today, which in the U.S. is $49 with a contract. And if you step that out into prepaid markets, it
really depends on the VAT and duty and channel time to upload as to what it is, so it varies greatly market to market.
But it's clearly in a distinctly different price than the iPhone 4 is.
Our philosophy is the same as it has always been, Toni. We will only make products that we're proud of that are the
best in the world. And if we can do that and the price is lower, then we're great with that. An example of that that
happened some time ago is the iPod shuffle was created. It started at a different price point, but it's now at $49. That's
because that's a product we're very proud of. It's very innovative. A lot of people love that product.
And so that's always the question for us and the litmus test. We will only make products that we're very proud of that
we want to own that are the best in the world regardless of what the price band analysis. Also, as we have seen and as
I'm reminded time and time again as I look at some of the China data, is it's up to us to convince people to maybe spend
a little more for a materially better experience and product. And we've seen that people will do that if the product is
great and if it's messaged appropriately. And we've got a lot of experience in both of those areas.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.

<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you've learned with
respect to media consumption on the iPad thus far.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We learned that people love using it, Brian, for a whole variety of things. And that's the
beauty of the iPad is that if you talk to ten people, they would likely give you ten different reasons that they love it.
And I think that's the reason it's doing so well among a very diverse group of consumers and a diverse group of
businesses and markets and geographies.
