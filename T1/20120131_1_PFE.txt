Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include
forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2010 Annual Report on Form
10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
Also, the discussions during this conference call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to
the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated
today, January 31, 2012.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap some highlights
from the fourth quarter and for the year, and I will talk about what we are focusing on for 2012.
We finished 2011 with a solid fourth quarter and the overall financial performance for the year was strong. Looking at
the quarter, the loss of exclusivity continued impact our business. This quarter we absorbed nearly $1.3 billion revenue
decline due to loss of exclusivity across our biopharmaceutical commercial units.
We saw strong operational growth in key markets such as Japan and China. Revenues in the Emerging Markets
business overall declined 2% operationally due to pricing pressures and exceptional items that Frank will review in
more detail. As we've said before the opportunity in Emerging Markets remains attractive although quarter-to-quarter
performance is volatile. I believe the best measure of our business in these markets is the yearly performance, which I
will speak to in a moment.
Animal Health, Nutrition and Consumer all turned in strong quarters operationally. Animal Health grew 13%, Nutrition
grew 20% and Consumer grew 8% over the same quarter in 2010 and we saw the benefits of our process improvements
and cost reduction work this quarter. Adjusted total costs were down 5% operationally.
Turning now to highlights for the year, we met or exceeded every aspect of our financial guidance. We reduced our
adjusted R&D spend by nearly $1 billion compared to 2010, but we also took significant actions to strengthen our
innovative core which included narrowing our therapeutic areas of focus, sharpening our analytical tools to better
prioritize investment and stop funding low potential programs earlier in the R&D cycle; advancing the most promising
compounds within our pipeline and continuing to invest in R&D network and the capability designed to drive
biomedical innovation.
During the year, the Emerging Markets business was affected by strong headwinds such as increased pricing pressure
in China and Turkey; the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in Brazil and Mexico in 2010 and devaluation in Venezuela.
That being said, revenue in Emerging Markets grew 5% operationally in 2011 comprised of 10% volume growth and a
5% decline in price. Performance was particularly strong in key markets where we increased our investment, such as
China, which delivered 18% operational revenue growth and Turkey, which delivered 17% operational growth for
2011.
We grew revenues from key assets in our branded portfolio, including Prevnar 13, Lyrica, Enbrel and Sutent. We
absorbed approximately $5 million in LOE and operationally only saw a slight decline in our revenues year-over-year.
We moved quickly to complete a strategic review of the businesses, which resulted in the ongoing exploration of
strategic alternatives for the Animal Health and Nutrition business.
We saw a steady cadence of progress in our late stage pipeline and the emergence of a promising mix of early to
mid-stage assets and we returned over $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I would
characterize 2011 as a year of committing the company to being a focused, innovative biopharmaceutical company

positioned to deliver value for shareholders.
We set a course to redefine and strength Pfizer. We concentrated on two key priorities: improving the performance of
our innovative core and making the right capital allocation decisions, and I believe we delivered on both of these goals.
Turning to this year, our focus is on change. We remain intent on continuing to take the actions that will create
shareholder value and like we did in 2011, we will continue to do so in two primary ways: getting our innovative core
more productive and sustainable and keeping our allocation priorities aligned with the best interest of shareholders.
The way we will do this is by, maximizing the value of our in-line portfolio including key in-line assets such as Lyrica,
Enbrel, Prevnar and Celebrex. Successfully launching Inlyta and Prevnar 13 for adults 50 years and older, advancing
the regulatory filings for Eliquis and tofacitinib and advancing the next wave of compounds in our pipeline including
new molecular entities that are showing promise and that we hope will achieve proof of concepts over the next two
years. I believe the recent approval of Inlyta as well as the early performance of Xalkori in the U.S. demonstrates how
well our Oncology business is evolving.
Regarding Prevnar 13 adult, the ACIP Pneumococcal Working Group plans to discuss the use of Prevnar 13 in adults
with the ACIP committee at the upcoming meeting in February. Although a vote on recommendation for use is not
currently scheduled, we are in discussions with the CDC to obtain guidance about use of Prevnar 13 and will launch the
adult indication in the U.S. in March. The rate of uptake will depend in large part on the ACIP recommendation for use.
Also in 2012, we continue to strengthen our Emerging Markets business and maintain our leadership role as we see
growth over time in key markets like China, Brazil, Russia, India, Turkey and Mexico. We'll keep examining our cost
structure including all aspects of our SI&A, our go to market expenses and manufacturing so that we can maintain a
lower and flexible cost base that allows us to respond to pricing pressures and additional LOEs over the coming years.
We are on track for determining the strategic alternatives and next steps for the potential separation of our Animal
Health and Nutrition business. We still plan to announce our strategic decision for each business in 2012.
And we will continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain committed
to meeting a target dividend payout of approximately 40% by the end of 2013. Further, our Board recently approved a
new 10 billion share repurchase program and we stated our intent to purchase approximately 5 billion during this year.
This amount does not include any repurchases that could result from actions taken related to our Nutrition and Animal
Health business.
To sum up, in 2012 we will stay the course. We will work to maintain the momentum we created in 2011. Longer-term,
after we potentially complete separation of Animal Health and Nutritional, Pfizer will be a company that has two
primary businesses with distinct cost structures and operating approaches. The first will be a growth business of
pharmaceuticals that we expect to generate profitable revenue growth with strong cash flow and that has a sustainable
innovation engine that will be evident through advances in our pipeline. The second will look more like a value
business that is also expected to generate strong cash flow and will be represented by established or post-LOE products.
We can see – we see consumer products fitting nicely into either of these businesses. I see these businesses generating
consistent and steady growth in earnings per share over time.
Now I will turn it over to Frank for additional details on the quarter and our 2012 financial guidance.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now let's
move on to the results.
Fourth quarter 2011 revenues of $16.7 billion decreased 4% year-over-year reflecting the continued impact of LOEs of
approximately $1.3 billion or 7% and the unfavorable impact of U.S. healthcare reform of $106 million or 1%, which
were partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange of $157 million or approximately 1%, the addition of
King products which favorably impacted revenues by $340 million or 3% and growth in certain in-line products.

Reported net income of $1.4 billion and reported diluted EPS of $0.19 were negatively impacted by the impact of
LOEs, the non-recurrence of a one-time tax benefit recorded in 2010 and higher charges associated with our cost
reduction and productivity initiatives, which were partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs and the
non-recurrence of certain litigation charges recorded in 2010.
Fourth quarter 2011 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 20.1% versus 21.1% in the year-ago quarter,
due primarily to the positive impact of foreign exchange and our cost reduction and productivity initiatives which were
partially offset by the addition of legacy King operations, the Puerto Rico excise tax and a shift in geographic and
business mix.
Adjusted total cost decreased 9% reflecting the positive impact of foreign exchange. Excluding foreign exchange,
adjusted total cost decreased 5% operationally which also reflects the positive impact of our ongoing cost reduction and
productivity initiatives, particularly in the R&D organization, and the negative impact of the addition of costs from
legacy King operations, the U.S. healthcare reform fee and the Puerto Rico excise tax.
Adjusted income of $3.9 billion increased 3% year-over-year driven by lower adjusted total cost and foreign exchange
which were partially offset by the impact of LOEs and a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.50 increased 6%, which included a $0.02 benefit from share repurchases as well as the
positive items I just mentioned.
Foreign-exchange positively impacted fourth quarter revenues by $157 million or 1% and lowered adjusted total cost
by $481 million or 4%. As a result, foreign exchange favorably impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by
approximately $0.06.
As I mentioned earlier, this quarter we continued to absorb revenue declines as a result of the loss of exclusivity of
certain products in several geographies. The fourth quarter negative impact of LOEs was approximately $1.3 billion.
The full-year negative impact was approximately $5 billion.
This quarter the impact of LOEs was partially offset by the addition of King products, growth in our Animal Health,
Nutrition and Consumer Healthcare businesses, the positive impact of foreign exchange and growth of certain in-line
pharmaceutical products including Lyrica, Enbrel, Celebrex and Sutent, Prevnar 7 in Japan and Prevnar 13, Norvasc
and Viagra in emerging markets with overall double-digit growth in China.
Fourth quarter revenues generated from both our biopharmaceutical and our other businesses in emerging markets
increased to $3.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, biopharmaceutical revenues in emerging markets declined 2%
operationally. Although that business experienced volume growth of 3%, this was more than offset by the negative
impact of foreign exchange, 2% increased pricing pressures, changes in institutional purchase patterns in Turkey and
Brazil, currency devaluation in Venezuela and Lipitor's loss of exclusivity in Brazil and Mexico, 2010.
It's important to note that for the full-year 2011, biopharmaceutical revenues in all Emerging Markets grew 5%
operationally which reflects operational growth of 10% and price reductions of 5%. Biopharmaceutical revenues
increased 6% operationally to about $4.2 billion in the BRIC-MT markets in 2011. As you can see, in 2011 we again
met or exceeded all elements of our full-year financial guidance including achieving our cost reduction target
associated with the Wyeth acquisition one year ahead of plan, generating more than $4 billion of cost reductions on an
operational basis compared with the 2008 combined cost of Pfizer and Wyeth.
Looking ahead to 2012, we're updating some elements of our full-year financial guidance and providing a guidance
range for adjusted cost of sales for the first time. Specifically, we have reduced the guidance ranges for reported
revenues and adjusted diluted EPS primarily to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies
from mid-October of 2011 to mid-January, 2012. We now expect 2012 reported revenues to be in the range of $60.5
billion to $62.5 billion and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be the range of $2.20 to $2.30. In addition, we expect
reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.37 to $1.52. We've lowered the guidance range for adjusted SI&A to $17
billion to $18 billion and we expect adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.
5%.

So finally, moving on to key takeaways, I'm very pleased that this year we again met or exceeded all components of our
financial guidance, including achieving the cost reduction target associated with the Wyeth acquisition ahead of
schedule. We've updated certain components of our 2012 guidance, primarily to reflect the significant unfavorable
changes in currency rates from mid-October of 2011 to mid-January of 2012. We remain on track to finalize strategic
decisions for our Animal Health and Nutrition businesses in 2012 and continue to expect that any separation of these
businesses from Pfizer will occur between July of 2012 and July of 2013.
In 2011 we returned $15.2 billion to shareholders through $6.2 billion in dividends and $9 billion in share repurchases
and we remain committed to allocating our capital in order to deliver attractive shareholder returns in 2012 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.

Thanks, Frank. And at this point, operator, can we please poll for questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Catherine Jayne Arnold>: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Good morning, Catherine.
<Q - Catherine Jayne Arnold>: I don't have to tell you guys that getting your share count down is going to make a
big difference in the way people look at your pipeline and your product story and fueling growth. I know you know
that, but obviously there can be big swings in what people expect from you in the longer term EPS based on what you
do there. And I guess there's a lot of questions about the various scenarios of how you'll use the proceeds from
Nutrition and Animal Health towards buying back shares. And I guess I'm wondering, are you thinking about giving us
any new guidance on share repurchase once you announce these transactions? Or is this something that we're going to
have to monitor? And are you thinking about the proceeds from these transactions as earmarked in any different way
than the way your sort of giving us your strategy from the year-to-year cash flow that you generate? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Catherine. Let me start and then Frank can add to it. There's been no change in our
strategy from 2000 to 2012. We've said that the use of our cash post dividends, post investment in the business will be
stock buybacks is the first test. And we remain aligned with that. So once we complete – if we complete the separation
of Nutrition and Animal Health, then the funds from that will be tested against the best investment with stock buyback
being the baseline. Frank, do you want to add to that?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: I'd just punctuate what Ian said, Catherine, which is the proceeds from those businesses,
assuming we do a separation, the case to beat is buybacks. That's what we've said, that's what we continue to say, and
that's what we will do relative to anything with those businesses. Let me just run a couple numbers, which is if you
look last year, Ian and I mentioned we returned $15 billion to shareholders. Of that, $9 billion were buybacks. We
bought back 459 million shares with that $9 billion and we said this year approximately $5 billion in buybacks plus
another $6 billion plus in dividends, $11 billion plus for the year. In the last two years we have returned $26 billion,
what we are estimating this year plus what we did last year in capital directly to shareholders.

The next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Ian, I've got a couple of questions. The first is, I appreciate your providing us your
vision for what Pfizer might look like post-2012 in terms of two different companies, an innovative core and a cash
generator, and the commitment to grow the company on a consistent basis. Can you provide a little bit more color
behind that in terms of how we should think about the revenue outlook? I mean obviously post-Lipitor there are still
other patent expirations, obviously divesting about $6.5 billion to $7 billion worth of companies, and then on the
bottom line what that could look like? So if you could be just a little bit more specific on your top and bottom-line
growth aspirations post-2012?
And my second question is more to do with just your view of the reshaping of Pfizer's portfolio. A lot of the discussion
last year focused on what that portfolio might look like and your goal was to achieve a smaller, more focused company.
And when I step back, I'm still looking at a $60 billion company, which is huge. And I'm wondering if you have
discovered through the process of being CEO other options that might now be on the table that weren't earlier in the
year that could lead to a further reshaping of the portfolio? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Jami, for those two questions. I think I tried laid out by saying I look at the company
in two parts. So clearly, with the post Lipitor we've got through the bulk of the LOEs but still continue to have
sequential LOEs through 2015. So I tend to look on the top line at two companies: one, where if we take it as it's core
and we see the growth coming from that, that in my mind is a growth company that's sustainable with a research engine
that's sized and will be predictable. And then I look at a value company that will have to absorb the post-LOE impact of
the transfers and then from that base will be stable or grow, given it'll have emerging market growth etcetera, etcetera.
So top line growth will be the impact of those two factors and I'm more focused on our ability to produce predictable
and consistent EPS growth over time as we manage those two businesses.
Now to your second question, I feel that while we are a $60 billion plus business, that's prior to any decisions on the
separation of Nutritionals and Animal Health. And then laying out this clear vision of two businesses, I think leads to
increased visibility to business models, different cost structures, different priorities and I think it'll allow the Street to
clearly see the value of those two businesses inside of Pfizer. Thank you.
<A - Chuck Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Next question, operator?
Operator
Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Thank you. On your 2012 guidance you said it was lowered, revenues and
earnings were lowered primarily to due to FX. Were there any other contributing factors?
And then second, Lilly's Q4 call was dominated by questions about solanezumab and your product, bapineuzumab, is
going to have important data in the current year as well, yet you never seem to talk about it too much. I'm hoping I can
ask you a few questions on this. The first is what will be the timing and venue for seeing the results of the two U.S.
trials? The second is can you confirm that you'll likely present the results of both trials at the same time, like Lilly will
do? And then the third point, have there been futility analyses done with the bapi [bapineuzumab] Phase III trials?
<A - Ian C. Read>: So, Frank, perhaps you can address the first question and then I would ask Olivier to answer the
questions on bapineuzumab. Thanks for the questions.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yep, so 2012 guidance, if you look at – we'll start with the bottom line. If you look at what
the previous bottom line was and now what the current one is for adjusted diluted EPS, it went from $2.25-to-$2.35 to
$2.20-to-$2.30; that nickel is entirely due to foreign exchange.
If you look at revenue, revenue went from $62.2 billion to $64.7 billion to $60.5 billion to $62.5 billion. So on average,
if you look at the bottom of the range and the top of the range, we lowered the 2012 revenue number by about $2

billion. Roughly two-thirds of that, approximately two-thirds of that was due to foreign exchange. The other one-third
was really due to, I'll call it three areas. One was a more challenging environment in the E.U. Second one was more
generic product offerings by ourselves in certain emerging markets. And the third was lower-than-expected volume
growth in emerging markets due to accelerated price cuts. That said, we still see robust growth opportunities in those
markets and the volume is less than we expected.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Frank. Yeah, reemphasizing that, it's just the – we – as price cuts occur in emerging
markets, we expect volume to respond. In '11, we saw the response slightly slower than we had expected in our income
projections and we corrected for that '12. Olivier?
<A - Olivier Brandicourt>: All right. In terms of timing, it's the same timing that we talked about in the previous
calls. The studies are going to be read out by midyear and we will report those results as soon as possible afterwards in
a scientific meeting.
There was no futility analysis done on those studies and I'd like to actually mention that the two products or the two
compounds are targeting a different epitope on the b-type M amyloid peptide, and that may trigger two very different
mechanisms of actions, and therefore, the results of one may not be transferable to the results of the other one.
However, I must say that based on what we heard this morning, we heard the alliance views the decision to continue
solanezumab with interest and we're maintaining confidence in the amyloid pathway for our AD program.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Olivier.
<A - Chuck Triano>: All right. Next question, please, operator?
Operator
Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from BoA Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you. First for Ian and Frank, given that we're actually getting closer to seeing proceeds, I
want to better understand the buyback being the case to beat comment you've been making. So buyback offers
immediate accretion while good acquisitions often take a few years to generate a return. So how are you truly
comparing the two? Is it an accretion in an out year or something like that?
And then for Dave Simmons, what have been the key positives and negatives learned from your Lipitor strategy and
how that might shape future strategy for generic launches? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. On the buybacks, I mean, I think it's clear that we look at the value of the share in the
market today and we have models that look at the value of the share on a discounted cash flow basis, so we look on that
return on a buyback along with the impact of dividend payments being lowered by the buyback. That gives us a certain
financial return and we compare that to the opportunities we have of acquiring businesses and the net present value of
those businesses. So it really is an economic view of what is the best use of the shareholders' – of the funds for Pfizer's
shareholders.
Lipitor, Olivier – sorry, David.
<A - David S. Simmons>: Gregg, yeah, for the question on learnings from Lipitor, I'd probably break these into two
pieces. The first is, we've done a lot of market research and learned one, that in depth, the incentives that are occurring
from different stakeholders in the health care environment during the LOE period, both from day one to day 180 and
then also post-180, and this cuts across payers, pharmacists and the patients themselves, and through those learnings
and research, we've also been able to discover a significant percentage of patients who want to remain on the brand.
They don't feel that they understand how they can do that, and we've been developing strategies as to how to tap into
that desire without increasing cost to the health care system. So the learnings are on that front.
The second thing that I would add in is that the response to the strategies we've put in have been very strong. We're
pleased with where we are in the Lipitor progress. Our share of branded Lipitor is tracking some 40% plus higher than

historic analogues so the strategies appear to be working. And as we go into upcoming LOEs, assuming we get the
same type of market research reads, we will be applying the learnings from Lipitor, tweaking them and trying to
continue with our core goal which is to make sure we maximize revenue, profit and patient value from our brands.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, David. That being said, the Lipitor opportunity is unique in its size and the 180-day
period. I'm not sure how many molecules going forward will have that same dynamic as I believe the law has been
changed to allow same-day filing. So you won't have one company with 180-day exclusivity, you'll have multiple
companies. So I think that will change the dynamic of post-LOE marketplace.
<A - Chuck Triano>: Thanks, Ian, David. Next question, please, operator?

Your next question comes from John Boris from Citi.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. First one for Ian. I appreciate the color, Ian, on the two separate
businesses post divestitures of Nutrition and Animal Health. Can you maybe go little bit more in detail on the
description of how you return the pharma portion of that business to growth relative to the value portion? And then how
you resource those two parts of the business, and is there additional room for improvements in the efficiency of R&D
and what you're spending in SI&A as you think about those going forward?
The second question on the ACIP panel, just help us understand what kind of recommendation you're expecting out of
that panel and how that is potentially going to facilitate the uptake of Prevnar 13 in adults? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. I'll take the first one and I'll ask Geno to talk to the second one. So thank you for the
question, John.
I think fundamentally the sort of separation or in my mind or in fact in the way we run the businesses will allow a focus
on an innovative core and a clear understanding of the capital being deployed and the growth expectations from
innovative products. So it'll allow the marketplace and ourselves to have a lot clearer view on are we returning cost of
capital on our innovative endeavors? And will allow a better valuation of that business and allow management to be
held to better performance standards.
And on the other side, and your SI&A spend as well, which will be more tailored towards physicians and investment in
innovative products. Whereas you move to the value business, it becomes a business that absorbs the impact of LOEs
and then continues to grow post that and adds strong brands from Emerging Markets and is a sort of value cash engine
with a completely different cost structure. So in my mind, it does allow clear valuation by the marketplace and by
management of two businesses with two distinct models.
So with that I would hand it over to Geno to talk ACIP.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: On the ACIP question, John, it's typical for ACIP to provide recommendations to the
healthcare system after the approval of new vaccine, and you know that Prevnar 13 was approved in December by FDA
under their accelerated approval provision, recognizing the significant unmet need for a serious medical condition, in
this case pneumococcal pneumonia.
So the ACIP needs to deliberate and discuss how this vaccine should be used or recommended to be used in light of the
availability of a polysaccharide vaccine for the over-65 population. So we're not privy to exactly how they're going to
vote or how they're going to guide on the use of Prevnar 13, but we know that Prevnar 13 is certainly a different
vaccine with a conjugate technology and the ultimate recommendations will influence the uptake of the vaccine in the
U.S.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And additional to that, post their recommendation we will have the catheter trials, we expect by
the end of '12 or early '13. Okay.

Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes, a couple of questions. One, could you give us a little more color on Prevnar in the
quarter? It just seems a little lighter than what we would have expected. And then second, can you give us an update on
the uptake of crizotinib, what's going on behind the scenes there? And also an update on Remoxy and what's happening
there. Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Thank you, Marc. So, Geno can do the Prevnar and the Xalkori and then I'll ask Olivier to
talk about Remoxy.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Okay. So for Prevnar 13, Prevnar 13 is humming along. Overall worldwide sales are $3.7
billion in 2011, up 50% from 2010, so the vaccine is doing extremely well on a global basis. As you mentioned, sales in
the fourth quarter in the U.S. atypically were soft compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 and it's simply because the
catch-up opportunity was strong in the fourth quarter of 2010 so comparing one quarter to the other, we see a change in
the growth rate. So, the fourth quarter of '11 we had much less catch-up and there was some adjustment of inventory in
doctors' offices and in the supply chain as a result of that reestablished demand level for Prevnar 13.
In terms of Xalkori, or crizotinib, this was approved last approved summer, a new personalized medicine with a
companion diagnostic. We – we're happy with the progress so far. The diagnostic is widely available now, essentially
in all major clinical sites and academic medical centers. Usage is accelerating pretty dramatically, there's been a
doubling of the use of the diagnostic so far and we expect yet another doubling of the use of diagnostic in this coming
year.
Growth for Xalkori (crizotinib) is going to go from accumulation of new patients and the sustained duration of therapy
and we know from our Phase 2 trials that the patients were sustained for a much longer period of time that on previous
therapies. So we see the development of the drug occurring over time, and then of course we continue to explore
utilization of crizotinib in other subtypes as of patients with different mutations and in combinations with other pipeline
therapies.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Olivier.
<A - Olivier Brandicourt>: Thank you. All right, Marc, on Remoxy we spent the last few months trying to understand
the issue. We have now a much better understanding of the formulation, the manufacturing controls and what we need
as analytical tests in terms of methods. So in addition, to that we will have to conduct two bioavailability studies that
we will run during the second quarter this year and when we will have all this data, we think that will constitute the
basis for our engagement with the FDA. We anticipate meeting with the FDA during the third quarter this year to
discuss next step.

Your next question is from Barbara Ryan from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Barbara A. Ryan>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the question is for you, Ian. You
talked about the two different businesses, the innovative core and the more mature established products and the
different P&Ls and the focus on that from investors, I'm just wondering when and if you would provide more
transparency into the difference of the P&Ls of the two companies so we could, in fact, value them and model them

differently? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thanks for your question. Yeah, I sort of see that developing approach to that as we go through
'12. We need to first of all, complete the potential separation of Nutrition and Animal Health and then as we do that
when we look at our P&Ls and we enter into late '12, or '13, I expect us to have a more clearer way of describing those
two businesses to the shareholders.
And I think it also going back to a question from Jamie, we see our research being focused on neuroscience and CV
med, Oncology, inflammation, vaccines and pain, and so that's a refocused portfolio where we are looking to really
focus on personalized medicine and bringing forward products that have a differentiation both in clinically and from a
genetic standpoint. So, I think that's the type of transformation we're talking about in our science.
<A - Chuck Triano>: Thank you, Ian. Next question, please, operator?

Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Steve Scala>: Oh, thank you I have three questions. First, historically Pfizer has treated businesses to be divested
as discontinued, so what does not considering Animal and Nutrition discontinued tell us about the status of the actions
on those businesses?
Secondly, on tofacitinib, did Pfizer request a priority review and it was turned down by FDA?
And then thirdly, should we assume that a good portion of the Lipitor sales force at peak, so at the peak marketing
force, will be marketing Eliquis? And I'm also wondering if you'd help us craft an expectation for the roll out? So
should we think of the roll out as Predaxa or Xarelto like? Or would you like us to think about it as being appreciably
better driven by the data? Thank you very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Steve. Frank, if you could take the first question?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So in terms of not having discontinued ops treatment as of today, Steve, that's because no
decision has been made. We've said all along, we're on track to finalize our strategic decisions regarding the Animal
Health and Nutrition business. We said we do that this year. We are pleased with the progress we've made to date. And
in terms of our objective, nothing has changed. Our objective is to generate create the greatest after-tax value for our
shareholders and we will be providing updates on this as we move through the year. But the reason why it's not being
accounted for as disc ops is simply because we haven't made a final decision.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Tofacitinib?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, on the tofacitinib question, we did not request a priority review. We are seeking a
broad label with usage in patients in second line as well as third line therapy. So we didn't go for a priority review for
an unmet need in the post TNF indication.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. And on the Lipitor/Eliquis question I'll make a couple of comments and then Olivier can
add to it.
I think from the point of view of your modeling, our resources have been dimensioned for both post Lipitor and an
Eliquis launch as of the end of the fourth quarter this year. And as regards Eliquis, I see that marketplace, number one, I
see the advent of having three products in that segment as positive in the sense of it's a new class that needs medical
education, it needs continuing promotion, and having three products in that class will be positive for the overall
expansion of the class. And we would expect, given the fact that the strength of our data, for us to take a leadership role
in that class.
Olivier, do you want to give your take?

<A - Olivier Brandicourt>: Nothing much to add. Frankly with BMS, we think we have optimized the launch and we
are putting the right amount of resources to make sure that we are very competitive with cardiologists and primary care
physicians and, as you said, it's going to be competitive but we think we have one of the best in class profiles, and

Your next question comes from David R. Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. I had a couple questions on the growth outlooks. With respect to
Emerging Markets, the revenue growth ex-currency was 5% in 2011. Can you please provide a little bit of color on
what the growth outlook is in 2012?
And then basically similar questions with respect to Nutritional and Animal Health. Nutritional grew 11% last year,
constant currency. I'm hoping that you might be able to provide some color on the outlook for '12. And Animal grew
14% last year. I'm wondering if you could provide perspectives on the growth outlook for that segment? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. I'll make a couple of comments on Emerging Markets and ask David to expand upon it and
I think ask Frank to handle the questions on Nutritional and Animal Health.
So the Emerging Markets growth in '11 was volume 10% and price reductions of 5% were beyond our expectations of
sustainable price reductions in the Emerging Markets. So we continue to expect volume at double digits, and we expect
to continue to see pricing pressures but not at the level we saw in 2011.
And, David, do you want to add more color to that?
<A - David S. Simmons>: Yes, just to call out a couple items. When we look at Emerging Markets as a backdrop we
see two fundamentally strong trends that aren't going away over time. One is the increase in population masses overall,
and the second is increase in the wealth of these population masses. So that's a backdrop that keeps us very optimistic
about opportunities in Emerging Markets.
Now as Ian mentioned, the price erosion we saw in 2011 was a little stronger than what we had anticipated and we've
factored that into our views going forward. We do expect to improve our growth rate moving forward. We would
expect to increase this up to high single digits and our strategies to do that are focused around maximizing the
opportunity space of our in-line innovative portfolio, having very, very targeted approaches to the generic market, more
targeted than we've ever had, and also being able to adapt to unique local market opportunities. Those are the three
fundamental strategic pillars that we think will cause an uplift in the inflection and growth rate.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, David. Frank.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: And then on our Animal Health and our Nutri, let me just add the absolute numbers to that.
So Animal Health this past year we did $4.2 billion sales and in the Nutri business we did $1.2 billion in sales and both
had strong growth rates, to your point, 14% and 10% respectively, $2.1 billion in Nutri, $4.2 billion in Animal Health.
We expect strong performance going forward and all of that performance has been factored into our 2012 guidance.

Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just a few questions here. First, can you talk about your
established product growth here? It's tough for us to get a clean read on this given some of the recent off-patent assets
skewing growth, like Effexor. Can you just talk about the growth or decline you're seeing in that business, let's say, for
the pre-2010 products in this portfolio to help us understand the underlying trends that you're seeing in that business?
Second on gross margins, can you confirm what your expectations for gross margins are for this year? And what type
of quarterly progression we should be thinking about, given the Lipitor decline throughout the year? I guess what I'm
trying to get at here is what your gross margins look like exiting this year?
And then the final question is on the tax rate. It's roughly 500 basis points above your competitors. Why are we seeing
this and when or if should we start thinking about this rate starting to come down? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Chris. So if David could comment on the Established Products and Frank could handle
the gross margin and the tax rate.
<A - David S. Simmons>: Chris, you're asking the question the right way. You've got to separate out the products that
are going through LOE events last year and into this year because you've got an abnormal comp. So if you remove out
Zosyn, Protonix and Effexor, that was the major cause of the decline in Established Products.
So when you go back to that original base of legacy Pfizer brands going back to 2009 plus the addition of growth
initiatives like some of the generic work we've been doing, what you see is that business that was decreasing three
years ago at about minus 18% to minus 20%, that business has been stabilized.
So if you look on that basis this year, the growth on that business segment plus those select growth initiatives got to
flat. So we stopped the deterioration on that business. And those strategies will continue going forward; whether we can
hold that line or not, we'll have to see. It's a very dynamic market in this off patent market.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, David.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: On gross margin, so in 2011, I think I'll answer this by doing cost of sales and then the
gross margin is just the reciprocal. So in 2011 our cost of sales was 19.3% for the year, our guidance for 2012 is 20.5%
to 21.5%, on cost of sales guidance. And what's happening there clearly is that's increasing, which means there's
downward pressure on the gross margin. That's based on the change or shift in the company's business and geographic
mix, including things like the Lipitor LOE.
That said, we continue to believe we can achieve operating margins in the high thirties to low forties because some of
the primary care revenue is being replaced by revenues in places like Emerging Markets where we don't need as much
of an expense base to generate those revenues. So there's clearly some pressure on gross margins but we continue to
believe we can generate operating margins that are in the high thirties to low forties.
In terms of quarter-to-quarter, there'll be volatility quarter-to-quarter based on how the mix of the business changes
from quarter-to-quarter, which is why we provide the guidance on an annual basis.
In terms of the tax rate, let me just give a little history on this and then I'll answer the question. Pre-Wyeth our tax rate
was in the low twenties. When we announced the Wyeth acquisition, we increased the tax rate to approximately 30%
and part of the reason for that had to do with the amount of cash that we planned on repatriating. That repatriation of
cash continues, which is why we gave guidance for 2012 of approximately 29%, which is pretty much what we
predicted. In 2011, we predicted 29.5%. One other point on the 29.5%, it was down year-over-year from 29.7% in 2010
to 29.5% in 2011. I think in 2012, we should assume that 25% and beyond 2012, with all of the winds blowing fiscally
globally today, it's hard to predict tax rates, but I think we should assume for the time being, a rate that's approximately
29%.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Frank. I mean, the only thing that would change that would be fundamental tax reform
in the United States which we would hope would move the United States more in line with the rest of the developed

Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. It's Jeff Holford here. Three questions for you, if you can. Firstly, what important readouts
could we see from tofacitinib this year in ongoing clinical studies? And if you can give us any indication of potential
timelines you think could happen there?
Secondly, when you talk about fixing the innovative core, as you put it in your release, is that deemed to be an internal
organic process or does that rely on to some or a large extent, on an acquisition or licensing going forward?
And then just lastly, on the disposal process, Newswire had indicated that there's a number of buyers out there for the
Nutrition business, but it is less clear on the Animal Health side. Can you give us any updates if you are seeing a
number of potential interested buyers for that business? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: All right, Geno, if you could do the tofacitinib? I'd like to have Mikael give a comment on the
innovative core, which we see as both internally being better and also reaching outside of our borders seeking the best
science. And the third question was on Animal Health, which Frank can deal with. Thank you.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Well, for tofacitinib, we read out our five pivotal trials over the course of the year in 2011.
In 2012, there'll be additional analyses from those databases that will be presented at EULAR and ACR later in the
year. And I really can't comment on the specific sub-analyses that will be presented at this point.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Mikael, if you could just have a comment on the innovative core?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, so I'm very excited about the flow of the pipeline. And you have seen strong discipline
in the late-stage pipeline, as exemplified by comments from Geno and Olivier, and we have a pipeline now with lots of
opportunities of differentiated drugs from early, mid to late-stage. And just to give you highlights of some of the spaces
that you may not have been able to follow as closely, so in Immunity and Inflammation, we have a number of Phase II
assets, such as [ph] Mabcam IO6 (51:36) and the associated steroids for indications from Crohn's, RA to lupus. In
oncology, we have a number of exciting signal transaction inhibitors in both solid and hematological tumors. In
Vaccine, we have not only MnB, but we have Staff Aureus in Phase II studies and we're bringing in towards the clinic,
a vaccine for nicotine and later on to [ph] clostridium difficilem. (52:05)
In Cardio and Metabolics, you heard Olivier to speak about Eliquis; we have a very encouraging data on our PC SK9
antibody for cholesterol-lowering. We have multiple diabetes readouts in the Phase II and we also have a very
interesting drug, [ph] Pedia 5 (52:24), a very selective inhibitor for diabetic nephropathy. Similarly, in neuro pain
where we had the discussion around bapi, we are adding a new generation of drugs in the pain portfolio with precision
medicine focus, as Ian spoke to, and a couple of more earlier CNS drugs.
So as you can see, there is a lot of exciting drugs where we are highly differentiated and either best or first in class in
our aspiration.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael. I'd like to reinforced that. I think we feel we've made good progress on the
innovative core, but in a way, we feel at Pfizer is just the beginning as we continue to accelerate what we're doing by
focusing in the therapeutic areas where we're in and merging together the biology and chemistry that I think – the
biology from Wyeth and the chemistry from Pfizer into a best-in-class scientific organization.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: And then on Animal Health, we've not yet decided on what the potential method of
monetization is. However, we continue to explore all options and once again with the goal being to maximize after-tax

Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Yes. Thank you. Just one brief question around Enbrel. Reps that you have today that are marking
to rheumatologists, if we make an assumption that tofacitinib is approved, do you actually continue to market Enbrel
given that you will – your contract expires with Amgen in 2013 I believe? And moreover is this a product actually that
will also be part of the bag of a rep who also is actually visiting primary care physicians? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Tony. I'll ask Geno to answer that question.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: So for Enbrel in the U.S., we currently co-promote with Amgen and that arrangement will
expire at the end of 2013. So we are in dialogue with Amgen on how we'll make that transition but ultimately we will
be promoting tofacitinib within Pfizer alone in the United States. Outside of the United States we'll continue to have a
role with Enbrel and we'll manage Enbrel and tofacitinib in countries outside the United States.

And your final question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Swann.
<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Thank you very much. So just a couple of questions here. Ian, maybe you could just
discuss for us what we're seeing in Europe with these developed market value determinations with the evolution of the
German market, equate GBA, and really what that might mean for the business and new products near-term?
And then also if you can just give us your sort of 30,000-foot view in terms of the expectations for these types of
developments broadening and how you are approaching those types of things strategically?
And then sorry for the long question there, but then lastly, can you also comment on what would prevent if anything a
timely separation of either the Nutritionals business or the Animal Health business? Thanks a bunch.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Thank you. Pretty expansive question there on Europe. I'll ask Frank to talk about the
timeliness of the Animal Health business for a second and then come back to you on your first question.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So relative to Animal Health and Nutri, I mentioned for both that progress is proceeding,
we're pleased with the progress, things are moving according to plan. In terms of what would hinder the progress at this
point, I don't see anything at this point hindering our progress. I think we're going down a good path and pleased with
the progress and I think we'll continue to move down the path.
<A - Ian C. Read>: All right. So regarding Europe, Europe has had HTA, or Health Technology Assessments, for a
long period of time and frankly in Europe, as you pointed out, they tend to be used in conjunction with medical
evidence also as a rationing tool. So as our portfolio changes, as Lipitor goes LOE, as some of our primary care
products go LOE and we become a more specialty business, the medical differentiation and the value add is a lot more
visible to those authorities than perhaps a primary care product would be.
So I think while my view is that this practice will continue to expand outside of Europe. And it's appropriate that payers
and governments expect value from their medication. I think in the U.S., we'll see a broader view of what value is
