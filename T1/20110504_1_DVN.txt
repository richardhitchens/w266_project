Vincent W. White
Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Devon Energy's First Quarter 2011 Earnings
Conference Call and Webcast. For today's call, as usual I'll begin with a few preliminary items and then I'll turn the call
over to our President and CEO, John Richels. He'll provide his perspective, and then Dave Hager, our Executive Vice
President of Exploration and Production, will cover the operating highlights. Following Dave's remarks, Jeff Agosta,
our Chief Financial Officer, will finish up with the financial review.
We will follow with a Q&A period. And as usual, we'll hold the call to about an hour. Darryl Smette, who is our Senior
Vice President – Executive Vice President of Marketing and Midstream – sorry Darryl – and other senior members of
management are with us today for the Q&A session. As always, we'll ask each participant on the call to limit his or her
questions to one initial inquiry and one follow-up. A replay of the call will be available later today through a link on
our Home page, that's www.devonenergy.com.

During the call today, we will make some minor refinements to our forward-looking estimates for items such as
production, capital expenditures and our hedge position, but since the revisions are so minor, we're not going to issue a
new 8-K. We'll just post the changes to our guidance page on our website. To find that, just click on the Guidance link
found in the Investor Relations section of the Devon website.
Please note that all references in today's call to our plans, forecasts, expectations, estimates, and so on are
forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities Law, and while many factors could cause our actual results to differ
from those estimates, we always strive to give you the very best guidance we can. We encourage you to review a
discussion of risk factors, if you're so inclined, that is provided with our Form 8-K forecast. We will reference certain
non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures, we're required to provide certain
related disclosures and those disclosures can also be found on the Devon website.
One final item, while our first quarter cash flow per share significantly beat the consensus estimate, our earnings per
share from continuing operations came in about a nickel shy of consensus. Production was better than expected and our
pre-tax costs per barrel were lower than the midpoint of our guidance. However, our deferred taxes were higher than
expected. Total adjusted income tax expense for the quarter of 34% of pre-tax earnings was four percentage points over
the midpoint of our guidance.
At this point I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels. John?
John Richels
Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter of 2011 was really an outstanding one for Devon. Our
North American Onshore production increased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2010, exceeding the top end of our
guidance range. We achieved this year-over-year production growth in spite of first quarter production outages
resulting from severe weather. In addition, production growth accelerated as we exited the first quarter. We're very
confident that we will deliver on our second quarter 2011 production forecast of 645,000 to 655,000 equivalent barrels
per day. This represents an increase of about 3.5% over the first quarter.
We remain on track to deliver on our full year 2000 production forecast of 236 million to 240 million barrels of oil
equivalent, and in addition, we expect to shrink our balance sheet with share repurchases and a reduction in net debt.
This should drive our 2011 production growth per debt adjusted share to a rate in the mid teens. Devon also delivered
an excellent first quarter performance from a cost containment perspective. Continued focus on cost containment
mitigated industry inflation and the impact of the stronger Canadian dollar. As a result, Devon actually saw a decrease
in unit costs versus the year ago quarter.
As Dave is going to discuss later in the call, we continued executing on our North American Onshore strategy with
excellent results from our key development projects and we also made some encouraging progress on the exploration
front. In the first quarter, we generated $1.5 billion of cash flow before balance sheet changes. This cash flow from
operations and the liquidity provided through our strategic repositioning comfortably funded our capital programs and
returned nearly $800 million to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. Of the $3.5 billion
authorized for share repurchases in May of 2010, we've now spent about $2.1 billion. We have purchased with that
more than 28 million shares or just over 6% of our outstanding shares at an average price of roughly $73 per share.
This brings our total shares repurchased since 2004 up to 95 million shares or roughly 20% of our shares outstanding.
As we previously indicated, we expect to complete our share repurchase program by year-end.
I'm sure by now that most of you are aware of the recent statements to the press by Brazilian authorities indicating that
approval of the $3.2 billion sale of our Brazilian assets to BP is imminent. Based on their statements, we expect this
transaction to close within the next few weeks. With the strategic repositioning that we began in November of 2009
now substantially complete, I could not be more pleased with the results. The repositioned company has all of the
attributes necessary to deliver superior per share growth. We're generating excellent full cycle returns, we have superior
financial strength and we have a very deep inventory of highly economic, low-risk development projects.

The depth and breadth of our balanced North American property portfolio provides us with a compelling strategic
advantage – the luxury of easily shifting capital in response to changing market conditions. Unlike many of our peers,
we can focus our capital on economic liquids opportunities within our existing portfolio. Because we've always valued
a liquids-to-gas balance, we already have a vast inventory of liquids opportunities including the Canadian oil sands, the
Permian Basin, the Barnett shale, the Cana-Woodford Shale and the Granite Wash.
In addition, we continue to replenish and build upon that inventory with our new ventures activities. In 2011, we're
allocating well over 90% of our upstream capital towards oil and liquids-rich opportunities. This will enable us to grow
our year-over-year oil and natural gas liquids production at a rate in the high teens. And inevitably at some point in the
future, gas prices will recover and incentivize the drilling of dry gas plays.
Since the vast majority of our properties are held by production, we can easily maintain our dry gas positions and the
option value they represent. In the meantime, we'll continue to allocate our capital to oil and liquids-rich growth
projects that generate strong rates of return in the current environment.
Just in summary, we remain fully committed to optimizing our growth on a per share basis adjusted for debt, and in
order to achieve that goal, we remain keenly focused on exercising capital discipline, maximizing our full cycle
margins and maintaining a high degree of financial strength and flexibility.
So with that overview, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?
David A. Hager
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started I want to point out a couple of changes we're making
this quarter to our operational disclosures. In this morning's earnings release, we have included a table that details
production, operated rigs and wells drilled by key operating areas. The absence of this information from my remarks
combined with our efforts to streamline the discussion of quarterly results should result in a more concise call and leave
more time for your questions. So with that, let's look at our E&P program.
The majority of our 2011 E&P program is focused on execution of our low risk repeatable development plays like the
Barnett, the Cana and Jackfish. We also have upside potential with funds devoted to the evaluation and de-risking of
various emerging plays in the Permian, the Rockies and in Canada. In addition, we have allocated capital to the
acquisition of additional acreage and drilling of the initial wells in a handful of new opportunities that we have not
previously disclosed, one of which I will identify today.
Looking first at our thermal oil project in Eastern Alberta, we wrapped up the final commissioning activities for
Jackfish 2 in the first quarter and expect to begin injecting steam in the next couple weeks with first planned oil for
later this year. Jackfish 2 production will continue ramping up throughout 2012. Our regulatory application for Jackfish
3 continues to progress through the review process.
At Pike, our SAGD oil sands joint venture with BP, we began appraisal drilling in the fourth quarter and continued
throughout most of the first quarter. In total, we drilled 135 stratographic core wells this winter and acquired some 60
square miles of 3D seismic data. Although additional seismic interpretation work will be done in the coming months,
results from the strat drilling program were in line with our expectations. Our 2011 drilling efforts were concentrated
around the north central portion of our Pike acreage and confirms sufficient resources for at least one 300 million-barrel
project. Ultimately, we expect Pike to yield four or five similar size projects. We hope to begin the regulatory approval
process for the first phase of Pike in the first half of 2012. Planning is already underway for next winter's drilling strat
program and seismic program aimed at further refining our view on additional Pike prospects.
Our combined interest in the Jackfish and Pike projects represent estimated risk resource potential of 1.4 billion barrels
net to Devon. The development of these projects is expected to drive our net SAGD production from the 30,000 barrels
per day we are currently producing to at least 150,000 barrels per day by 2020. This is based on the acreage we
currently have in hand without any additional acreage acquisitions.

Moving now to the Bone Springs play in the Permian Basin, Devon has established a position covering 185,000 net
acres. We currently have three operated rigs running. Our initial activity has been focused in two primary areas of the
play. We have been running two rigs targeting the first and second Bone Springs interval in Northern Eddy and Lea
Counties, New Mexico.
Our second focus area targets the third Bone Springs on the Texas side in Reeves and Loving Counties. In the first
quarter, we have completed our second well targeting this third Bone Springs interval and the results were quite
impressive. The 100% Devon owned Talladega 65 #1H was brought online with an average 30-day IP rate of more than
1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We recently added another rig to the Texas side of the play in the second quarter
bringing the total number of rigs we have focused on the Bone Springs to four.
Also in the Permian Basin in the Avalon Shale play, we are currently running three rigs. We are still in the early stages
of evaluating our acreage position. However, based on drilling results to date, it appears as you move east within the
play condensate yields improve. For example, the Cotton Draw Unit #134H in the eastern portion of the play was
brought online late in the first quarter.
For the 12 days the well was flowing back before a shut-in for installation of a pump, the well averaged 534 barrels of
condensate per day and 2.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. Production history from similar wells in the area appears
to support ultimate recoveries of between 400,000 and 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent. With approximately 60,000
net acres located in the eastern part of the play, Devon is well positioned in the liquids rich portion of the play.
Moving north to the Granite Wash play in the Texas Panhandle, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee and
Granite Wash A wells. The Wright 151 #2H completed in the Granite Wash A was brought online in the first quarter
with a 30-day IP rate of nearly 2,800 oil equivalent barrels per day, including 690 barrels of oil and 704 barrels of
NGLs. We also drilled our first Granite Wash B well during the quarter. The Eden 11 #4H was brought online with a
30-day IP rate of 1,700 oil equivalent barrels per day, including 340 barrels of oil and 410 barrels of NGLs.
In total, Devon brought six operated Granite Wash wells online during the first quarter. 30-day IP rates from these
wells averaged 1,760 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 250 barrels of oil and 490 barrels of natural gas liquids
per day. We believe that we have about 700 risked undrilled locations in the Granite Wash.
Moving now to the Cana-Woodford Shale in western Oklahoma where we are continuing to see outstanding results.
First quarter production reached a record 162 million cubic feet equivalent per day. This puts us well on track to reach
our year-end target of 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We continue to aggressively de-risk our position and
secure the term acreage we acquired last year located northwest of the core area. Initial drilling results from this
extension area indicate attractive rates of return, which should compete favorably for capital within our portfolio.
In our Cana infill pilot program we initiated last year in the core area, production history from our 500-foot space wells
continue to perform well. As a result, we plan to drill three additional infill pilot programs later this year. The
additional production history gained from these infill wells should further support our position that 8 to 10 wells per
section is the correct spacing in the core area.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in north Texas, our initial plan called for running 12 rigs throughout 2011. However,
as we entered the year we had 13 rigs grinding in the Barnett. Given the tightness in the market, we decided to retain
the 13th rig with the thought that we could probably need it in the Granite Wash as we de-risk that position. Given our
recent success in the Granite Wash program, we will be moving that rig up there during the second quarter.
In addition, we picked up a 14th rig in the Barnett during late March. This is a high efficiency rig being dropped by
another company and we secured it to high grade our fleet. We will drop a lower efficiency rig, bringing our operated
Barnett rig count back to 12 where we expect to keep it for the remainder of the year.
Our net production continued to grow during the first quarter, and we exited the quarter producing over 1.2 Bcf
equivalent per day, including 43,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. Remarkably, our Barnett production has
climbed in spite of reducing our rig count over the last 12 months. Our deep inventory of undrilled locations, in some
of the best parts of the play, has allowed us to high grade our drilling program, which in turn has yielded higher IP

rates.
In the first quarter, we brought 103 Barnett wells online with average 30-day IP rates of approximately 2.7 million
cubic feet equivalent per day, including an average of 137 barrels of liquids per day. We also continue to improve
results with pad drilling and other drilling efficiencies in the Barnett. By further reducing the number of days it takes to
drill a well, we are able to mitigate rising service costs. In 2010, we averaged 13.3 days from spud to rig release while
so far in 2011, we are averaging just 12.6 days.
On the exploration front, we continue to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on our acreage within our
portfolio that spans numerous play types across multiple basins in the U.S. and Canada. In Canada, for instance, at our
Viking light oil play in Saskatchewan, we drilled three wells in the first quarter. We are still in the early stages of
evaluating our acreage position but believe we could have between 1,000 and 2,000 Viking drilling locations.
In addition, we had three Cardium wells drilled at the end of the quarter in the Deep Basin of Alberta. Of our nearly
600,000 net acres in the Deep Basin, we believe at least 80,000 acres is prospective for the Cardium. We expect to
complete both the Viking and Cardium wells in the second quarter.
In the Rocky Mountains, our exploration efforts are focused on evaluating several cretaceous oil objectives including
the Niobrara and Parkman on our 220,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin. We have three rigs currently running
with two drilling Parkman wells and one drilling for the Niobrara. In the first quarter we drilled four Parkman wells,
which are all scheduled to be completed in the second quarter. We will keep you updated on our progress as we move
forward.
We have been telling you for some time now about our goal to identify and establish large acreage positions in highly
economic plays at reasonable prices. We have continued building these new venture positions and now have roughly
850,000 net acres in a handful of new plays primarily targeting oil and liquids-rich gas. While we are still actively
leasing in several of these plays, we're not ready to discuss them all, we have largely secured our position in one new
area that I will tell you about today.
The Tuscaloosa Shale is located along the Louisiana and Mississippi border. This is a cretaceous age formation that is
stratographically equivalent to the Eagle Ford Shale. It is approximately 200 to 400 feet thick, at depths of 11,000 to
14,000 feet across our acreage position.
Oil production has been established up-dip in the play from the Tuscaloosa Shale. We plan to utilize horizontal drilling
and fracture stimulation to enhance the productivity of the reservoir in both the oil and liquids-rich portion of the play.
We have leased or have committed, under contract, approximately 250,000 prospective net acres at an average cost of
$180 per acre. We plan to drill our first two horizontal wells in the play this year.
In total, first quarter capital expenditures for North American onshore exploration and development totaled $1.5 billion.
Our 2011 capital budget is front end loaded due to our winter drilling program in Canada and because most of our 2011
SAGD expenditures occurred early in the year. However, the $1.5 billion of upstream capital spent in the first quarter is
about $100 million over our internal budget.
Two areas drove most of this overspend. First, activity levels on properties operated by others exceeded the level we
expected. And second, some smaller working interest owners and properties operated by Devon were unable to fund
their share of capital, thereby allowing us to step in for a greater interest in these projects. While this will likely push us
to the higher end of the range we provided for capital expenditures, it should also result in greater production later in
the year and into 2012.
So in summary, our key development projects are delivering excellent results. Accordingly, we are highly confident of
meeting our production growth targets. This growth is being driven by strong double-digit liquids growth and we are
making substantial progress on the exploration front.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?

Jeffery A. Agosta
Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Before we move into the financial review of the quarter, I want to remind
everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations, or in other words, our North American
Onshore business. For those of you interested in a more detailed review of our discontinued operations, we have
provided supplemental tables in our news release.
As John mentioned earlier, first quarter results were very strong and most income statement and key operating metrics
were right in line with our expectations. For today's call, I will only review those items that require additional
commentary or were outside our forecasted guidance range.
The first item I will cover is our production performance. We produced 56.6 million equivalent barrels from continuing
operations, or approximately 629,000 barrels per day. This exceeded the top end of our guidance range by roughly
4,000 barrels per day. First quarter production benefited from better than expected performance from key properties
including the Cana-Woodford and Barnett Shales. When compared to the first quarter of 2010, our North American
Onshore production increased 7%. This growth was achieved in spite of production interruptions caused by severe
winter weather in the first quarter of '11. The most significant portion of this year-over-year growth came from U.S. oil
and NGL production. Gains in the Cana, Permian Basin and Barnett drove this growth.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2011, we anticipate continued strong growth. The midpoint of our guidance
range of 645,000 to 655,000 barrels per day implies an increase in sequential quarter production of nearly 3.5%. This
growth is driven by the same areas that drove our first quarter results: the Cana, Permian Basin and Barnett. Given our
performance thus far, we feel very comfortable with our forecast for liquids production growth in the high teens,
driving overall top line production growth of 6% to 8% in 2011. While we are clearly on track to come in at the high
end of this range, we are not modifying our full year guidance at this time.
On the pricing front, the major story for the quarter was the robust oil price environment. Geopolitical tensions and
strong worldwide demand resulted in WTI oil prices surpassing $100 a barrel in early March. The strength in oil prices
provided a good opportunity to hedge oil at historically attractive levels. As we have discussed in the past, we try to
protect the price on roughly half of our expected production of both oil and natural gas. Our objective is to strike an
appropriate balance between managing risk and retaining exposure to upside volatility. For the full year of 2012, we
now have 76,000 barrels per day hedged through various swap and costless color contracts. Of this amount, 22,000
barrels per day were swapped at a weighted average price of $107 per barrel and the remaining position utilizes callers
with a weighted average ceiling of $126 and a floor of $86.
Natural gas price volatility has also provided an opportunity to boost our hedge position. For the second quarter of this
year, we added 550 million cubic feet per day of hedges, increasing our total hedged production for the second quarter
to roughly 1.3 Bcf per day. This position covers approximately 50% of our expected natural gas production in the
second quarter with a weighted average protected price of $4.95. We have also begun adding gas hedges for next year.
For the full year of 2012 we now have swap and collar contracts covering nearly 400 million cubic feet per day with a
weighted average protected price of $4.93 per Mcf. We will post an updated hedging schedule on our website today
that provides a more detailed view of our 2011 and '12 hedge positions.
Looking now to expenses. Once again the repositioned company did a very good job controlling costs. Expenses in
most categories were generally in line with expectations during the first quarter. In aggregate, our pre-tax cash costs for
the quarter came in at $13.12 per BOE and were about $0.10 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2010. As E&P
and Service companies alike have disclosed, we are in a rising service and supply cost environment. However, our
focus on cost control combined with the efficiencies realized through our repositioning, have more than offset both
industry inflation and the negative impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar.
Shifting to income taxes. As Vince mentioned earlier, our overall tax rate was 34% of adjusted pre-tax earnings or
about four percentage points over the midpoint of our guidance. Current taxes were 2%, while deferred taxes were 32%
of adjusted pre-tax earnings. This is indicative of what we expect for tax rates on adjusted earnings for the full year. A
reconciliation of taxes on both GAAP and adjusted earnings is available in today's release.

Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued upward pressure on costs. However, we remain
comfortable with the full year expense forecast provided in our February 8-K. Regardless of industry conditions, we are
confident that Devon is well positioned to continue generating full-cycle margins that are among the best of our peer
group.
Also, from a balance sheet perspective, Devon remains exceptionally strong. At March 31, we exited the quarter with
$3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, and total debt of only $6.8 billion. This, of course, is before the $3.2
billion we will receive upon the close of the sale of Brazil. This significant financial strength provides us the flexibility
to consistently invest in our business based on our long-term outlook regardless of the near-term macroeconomic
backdrop. We believe that we are extremely well positioned to compete effectively, delivering highly competitive
growth in cash flow and production per debt-adjusted share.
At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A.
Vincent W. White
Operator, we are ready for the first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Heikkinen from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your
line is open.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Good morning, guys. In looking at your second quarter volumes, how important is the
Cana plant coming on line and kind of what is that impact as far as timing and the kind of quarter-over-quarter growth?
<A - David A. Hager>: The Cana plant is already on line. This is Dave, David. It came on in the fourth quarter. So
that's really...
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: So you don't have constraints in the Cana? You're basically able to continue to run your
rig count up and that is unconstrained?
<A - David A. Hager>: That's true. Probably the biggest driver for the second quarter volumes is we have a program in
the Barnett where we drilled from a couple of pads underneath Lake Benbrook, and we have 20 wells on the first of
those pads that we're been bringing on, and we've already ramped that up here in the second quarter to 47 million a day.
And that all happened after the end of the first quarter. So...
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: And then thinking about capacity with the big wells and the Granite Wash as well, 1,700
barrels of oil equivalent with the high NGL yield. Can you talk through – is that a risk location now, 700 risk, Granite
Wash locations?
<A - Vincent W. White>: Yes. That's a gross risk location number, David. This is Vince. And our average working
interest is somewhere around 50%.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: So still thinking around 350 total locations on a net basis.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Correct.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Okay. No changes to that. And then the – on the other side, thinking about the new plays
and kind of new ventures, can you talk about expectations for Viking activity levels which you have 1,000 or 2,000
locations? What are the constraints there, and could that become kind of a Spraberry-like development?

<A - David A. Hager>: Well, it has the potential to be significant. We're going to drill probably on the order of 15 or
so wells in the Viking this year. I think the primary variable there, David, is not so much is the reservoir there. We're
pretty confident we have the reservoir there for somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 locations. The primary variable is
can we get the costs down so that it competes effectively within our portfolio? We have a pretty high-graded portfolio,
and we're – that's why we're going to start drilling out there and see if we can achieve the efficiencies we think can to
make it economically within our portfolio. We're estimating a recovery of about 50,000 barrels per well and drilling
and completing costs of around $1.2 million, $1.3 million. So we need to get it to that to make it compete well.
<A - Vincent W. White>: And, David, you'll recall...
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: That's my question, so.
<A - Vincent W. White>: David, you'll recall as well that, as you're well aware, that most of the land in Canada is
leased from the Crown, but this is fee acreage that we have. So that also helps to improve the economics.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Yup.

Your next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler from Simmons & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - David W. Kistler>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Good morning.
<A - David A. Hager>: Good morning.
<Q - David W. Kistler>: Real quickly on the Bone Springs just a little, maybe, additional color. In previous calls you
talked about the EURs trending up to the high end of the range on the first and second Bone Springs. Can you give us
any color on – does that continue to be the case? Are you going to be adjusting those EURs higher, and then put that in
perspective to the third Bone Springs wells that you've drilled? That would be fantastic.
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: Hi, Dave. Yeah, they are – we are very, very pleased with the results that we're achieving
both in the first and second Bone Springs as well as the third Bone Springs. At this point, we're still wanting to get a
little bit more production history before we revise our numbers upward, but I can tell you that the results we've seen so
far have been very encouraging. We're certainly confident we're at the upper end of the range that we said previously.
Hopefully, with a little more production history we're going to revise those up further.
<Q - David W. Kistler>: And is there a big delineation between costs on the first and second versus the third Bone
Springs?
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: Yeah. The third Bone Springs is significantly deeper, so those wells are quite a bit more
expensive to drill.
<Q - David W. Kistler>: Okay.
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: The costs range from the first and second probably around four-and-a-half to five drill and
complete and up to six-and-a-half to seven-and-a-half on the third Bone Springs.

<Q - David W. Kistler>: Okay. Great. And one last just quick follow-up. When you talk about the production growth,
you highlighted the drilling efficiencies and high grading in the Barnett, as you just mentioned, the EURs in the Bone
Springs. Are those the primary drivers to the production growth and are we seeing it across the whole portfolio? Is it
really limited to those two areas?
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: We're seeing production growth across several areas within the portfolio, particularly on the
oil and natural gas liquids side. But when you look at the overall portfolio, just to give you an idea, just on the oil and
natural gas liquids, which is where our primary growth is, we anticipate growing volumes on the order of about 12
million barrels or so this year. Then about 6 million of that would be on the oil side in the Permian and Jackfish area
and then another 6 million or so primarily in natural gas liquids in Cana, Barnett and Granite Wash.
<A - David A. Hager>: One of the really high growth areas, of course, is the Cana. We've got a tremendous resource
sitting here about 40 miles outside of Oklahoma City. When you look at our production history, I think, if my memory
serves me correctly, we were at about 113 million a day in the fourth quarter of 2010. And by the end of this year that's
going to ramp up to 250 million a day, and our liquids volumes are going to go from 4,000 or so up probably up –
4,000 or 5,000 up to about 14,000 at the end of 2011. So that's a significant increase.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering, could you provide a little bit more color on what
you're seeing in the Tuscaloosa Shale. Did you have some like vertical well penetrations that you like to see? I
apologize. I missed some of your color that you did provide around it. Did you state that it's analogous to another shale
play in the area?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes, let me just give you a few of the things that we like about the Tuscaloosa Shale. Now
having said that, this is a frontier play, so I don't want to mischaracterize it as something else, because and, frankly, we
have been leading the industry by taking our position here. So it is a frontier play. Let me tell you some of the things
that we do like about the play that give us reason for encouragement. It is the stratographic equivalent to the Eagle Ford
Shale. It is deeper than Eagle Ford Shale, about 11,000 to 14,000-foot depth, but it is the stratographic equivalent to it.
There has been oil production established up-dip in the Tuscaloosa Shale also.
There have been some vertical wells have been drilled in there that indicate that you're getting for a shale type play that
has good porosity and permeability. We're also seeing some silts and carbonates in there, which indicate that it may be
somewhat brittle and able to be fractured. We've seen IPs on the vertical wells up to approximate 300 barrels per day.
There were just about – just a very small number of horizontal wells that have been drilled a couple or three years ago
and they were of limited horizontal length on the order of 1,500 to 2,000-foot with only three stages. But they tested up
to 500 barrels per day from these very limited and minimally fracked wells.
So all of those give us reasons for encouragement. Now having said that, it's very early on. We're going to start drilling
some horizontal wells. We need to get more data on rock frackability. There are some sands below that are wet. We
need to stay away from those. We need to get more information on the phase, oil and natural gas because there just
aren't that many wells to know exactly where on the play the boundaries between those are. There are some risks
associated with it. I don't want to mislead you, but there are some encouraging qualities. To establish a 250,000-acre
position for less than $50 million that's the kind of thing if it's successful we can create an awful lot of value.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. Great. Great. And you said you're going to drill two horizontal wells there this year, is that
correct?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes. We're going have a rig out there here in the second quarter.

<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. And then for my follow-up on the proceeds you're going to receive from the Brazilian sale
when that occurs, what is the status of those funds? Are you going to be able repatriate that money or should we think
about taking a haircut to that?
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: This is Jeff Agosta. When we gave you an estimate of $8 billion in after-tax proceeds from
our completed sales, that did contemplate a large portion of taxes paid on repatriation. The $3.2 billion of proceeds
from Brazil specifically is – that deal was structured as tax free as long as those funds remain outside the United States.
So we will leave those outside the United States until we get some more clarity around any potential change in U.S. tax
law that would encourage a repatriation of funds to the United States.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. And so I mean is the thought process right now you don't need that cash? And so is it can
just be serving some short-term investment out there, is that right?
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: That's correct. We would just leave it and park it as short-term investment, or to the extent
that we had incremental opportunities in Canada we would be putting that money to work in Canada.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. So that could be shipped into Canada tax free...
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: Yes, it can be.

<Q - Mark Gilman>: Guys, good morning. Dave, the Tuscaloosa Shale play I was wondering is this at all equivalent
to the play that Mainland Resources has been looking at in that same area?
<A - David A. Hager>: I'm not familiar with that. It's possible, Mark. I haven't heard that name. I can tell you there
hasn't been a lot of other leasing activity to date which is one of the reasons we're excited we're able to get in there for
such – and get a strong position for such a low cost.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Well, let me just go further if I could. Is there any Haynesville potential in this play that you've
identified perhaps?
<A - David A. Hager>: We haven't identified any, no.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: No? Just one other by way of not related follow-up. From a royalty-ringed fence perspective,
can you clarify whether Jackfish 2, 3 and potentially Pike are or not in one ringed fence for royalty purposes up there?
<A - John Richels>: Mark, this is John. We have made an application and believe that the three Jackfish projects will
be part of – will be considered as one project or have a ringed fence for royalty purposes. The Pike development will
likely be a separate project.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: But, John, you have not gotten approval with that submission?
<A - John Richels>: We have not at this point had confirmation of that, but it seems to meet all of the requirements. So
we expect that, that will get that kind of treatment, Mark.

<Q - David R. Tameron MBA>: Good morning. Back to the Tuscaloosa, how many vertical wells have been drilled in
the area? How much data do you have that you're looking at?
<A - David A. Hager>: It's just a handful of vertical wells. I don't have an exact number on it.
<Q - David R. Tameron MBA>: Okay. All right.
<A - David A. Hager>: About three or so horizontal wells were drilled about three years ago I think, three or four.
<Q - David R. Tameron MBA>: Okay. And again you said you're going to start drilling second quarter and then
update us late this year, first part of next year type of thing?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, yeah.
<Q - David R. Tameron MBA>: Okay. Okay
<A - David A. Hager>: Just so you know, I mean the Tuscaloosa Shale, there are – I worked this play as a
geophysicist 25 years ago by the way, not for the shale, but there are some sands just beneath there that everybody was
drilling for 25 years ago. So, there's a lot of wells that have gone through the Tuscaloosa Shale. But the wells I'm
talking about are ones that were actually completed in the Tuscaloosa Shale.
<Q - David R. Tameron MBA>: Okay. Okay. And then on CapEx budget, I heard the comment about 100 million
ahead right now in the – at the end of Q1 on the development side. It kind of sounded like CapEx is headed higher, am
I – for the full year – should we think about it as 400 million higher, should we – can you give us some type of...
<A - Vincent W. White>: Yeah. This is Vince. I would not assume that we're going be 400 million over for the full
year. Of course, the capital budget is fluid with changes in the macro environment and drilling results. And we – clearly
these were unanticipated nonparticipations by non-working – by working interest owners and a high level of OBO
activity. But I don't think you can extrapolate that over for the four years. So we think this likely pushes us high in the
range. We had a pretty broad range, but we don't have any reason to believe we're going to be out of range at this point.
<Q - David R. Tameron MBA>: Okay. No. That's what I was looking for. Good. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Thank you. Good morning. On the Permian in the Delaware basin, with – between the Bone
Springs three zones and the Avalon shale, can you refresh us on your thoughts as to whether you are seeing commercial
overlap of any of these zones and whether that's something that you have tested?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah. There are – the Bone Springs interval does tend to overlap somewhat with the eastern
portion of the Avalon. So, yeah, they are – they are the same acreage. You can see prospectivity on both of it – in some
of the areas, yes.
<A - John Richels>: And, Brian, you'll recall there are also some additional horizons that overlap. They're not all
directly overlapped, as Dave said, but portions of it overlap in some of the other plays in that area as well like the
Wolfcamp Shale and the UPS and some other zones that are prospective and that we're going to be taking a look at
throughout the year as well.
<Q - Brian Singer>: I guess, how many prospective zones do you think you would have on your average Delaware
acreage?
<A - David A. Hager>: Probably somewhere three to five, I would say something like that. Over a lot of the acreage
we see the Avalon, and even within the Avalon, there are different benches in the Avalon. So it's not all – it's not just a
single prospective zone there. And then over most of the Avalon you have both, as John said, the Wolfcamp and the
[ph] Upper Penn Shale (46:30) as prospective. And then over a portion of the acreage – same acreage is where the Bone

different zones.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Thank you. And in the Barnett Shale you mentioned that during your comments that the
production is surprising here to the upside despite the lower rig count. Is that just the higher IPs that you're seeing from
the wells you're choosing to drill that's keeping production higher? Or are you seeing anything different in the
underlying decline rates from past legacy wells?
<A - David A. Hager>: I wouldn't say we're seeing anything significantly different. It's primarily the higher IPs.
Although I can tell you that just about every year for the past five or six years, we've had positive reserve revisions in
the Barnett as we see shallower declines than we had booked.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Polak from Scotia Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Polak>: Good morning, guys. First question on Jackfish 3. Just can you just give an update on how the
regulatory process is going? And do you still think there's a chance of starting construction there later this year?
<A - John Richels>: I think, Mark, the process is going about as expected. We filed the application in the fall. We're
going through the regular part of the process. We don't have any reason to think that it's not on track on the timetable
that we expected. So if we were to get that approval, optimistically, we thought around the end of the year, probably
more likely is the beginning of 2012 sometime. And we'll get in there, and put a shovel into the ground as soon as we
can.
<Q - Mark Polak>: That's great. And you mentioned in the Barnett, taking – production growing despite taking the rig
count down. Just curious what the plans are going forward. Are you looking at further rig count reductions there? What
the development plans are in Barnett.
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we're going to stay – as I said, we're going to stay – we're temporarily at 14 rigs, which
showed up in the new table we put in the earnings release. But the reality is we'll be back to 12 here fairly soon and
stay there for the rest of the year. And we're very comfortable. But when we look at allocating capital, we look at it on a
company-wide basis. So we'll take a look later on this year and see where it looks like the best decision is for where to
get the most out of our capital for next year. But we're certainly extremely pleased with the results of being able to
actually grow production this year versus last year in the Barnett with 12 rigs and throw off after CapEx at over $400
million, just outstanding results.
<A - Vincent W. White>: And, Mark, you'll recall that we talked about the fact that we got 7,000 risk locations in the
Barnett. About 2,500 to 3,000 of them are probably in the liquids-rich areas. So we're really focusing on drilling in the
liquids rich areas. And frankly what we're trying to do is optimize our plant capacity and our throughput. We got the
biggest plant in that area and we're drilling in those liquids-rich areas having regard to what our capacity is.

<Q>: Yes, I have a question on the hedging. I must have missed this on the natural gas and the oil. How much of your
production in 2011 and '12 is hedged in gas and in oil and what is the average price?
<A - Vincent W. White>: We'll be filing a – or posting this, the details to our website later today, but we gave a
summary in the call today. Let's see. That was – go ahead and pick that up if you know...
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: Yeah, I think we're about 50% hedged on natural gas in the second quarter of this year and
we're about a third hedged on natural gas for the second half of the year. And those protected prices are in the high
4.90's, so, close to $5 an Mcf. We're about – on natural gas for 2012, we're only about $400 million a day hedged out of
about – so we're about 17% to 18% hedged for 2012 natural gas at a protected price of about $4.95.
<A - Vincent W. White>: We might add that we're actively in the market right now.
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: Correct. And then on crude oil, we're about 50% hedged for next year. We got about 76,000
barrels per day hedged next year, 22,000 barrels of which is swapped at about $107 a barrel with collars on the
remainder protecting a floor price of $86 a barrel with participation in the upside up to $126 per barrel.
<Q>: I see. Now, just a follow-up on that. On the natural gas, which I am probably the only guy that's bullish on, I've
been bullish for almost a year and not right so far, but should it go through your collar, would you remove the collar or
just stay where you are?
<A - Darryl G. Smette MBA>: Well, this is Darryl Smette. Historically, we've just left them where they are because
gas prices tend to be very volatile, as you know.
<Q>: Right. Right.
<A - Darryl G. Smette MBA>: And we would hate to get out of the position that our long-term forecast suggests that
we're going be in that type of price range. So our historical pattern I don't think we would change from that. We would

<Q - S. Ross Payne CFA>: Jeff, quick question. Do you have a target debt-to-cap for the company given all the cash
coming in with these asset sales? Thank you.
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: No, we don't have a target debt-to-cap. We don't manage our balance sheet around that
particular metric. What we do try and maintain is maximum financial flexibility and a strong investment grade credit
rating. We have – our credit ratings right now are BAA1 and BBB+ by Moody's and S&P, Fitch respectively. And
that's really the rating that we target for and manage our balance sheet accordingly.
<Q - S. Ross Payne CFA>: Okay. You've obviously been doing some asset – I mean some acreage, I mean purchases.
Can you talk just briefly of your appetite for any kind of acquisitions going forward here?
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: Ross, we've got a pretty big portfolio now and a portfolio that we really like. So whereas it's
the right thing for us to get out there and continue in some of these new venture areas and some of these first mover
positions like Dave said where we can put acreage together for a few hundred bucks an acre, we really don't have an
appetite for acquisitions because it's not going to make us – in most cases, it's not going be accretive to our asset base at
today's prices. If you look at it, most companies, even on the gas side, are still being discounted at a slightly higher
price than the strip, so that's not likely. We will continue to build our positions though in some of these new venture
areas where it makes sense.

<Q - John P. Herrlin Jr.>: Yeah, hi. Some quick ones for you, Dave, with the Tuscaloosa, have any idea what the
completed well costs will run?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, it's pretty early on here and obviously the first wells are going to be more science wells
I'd say where we're going to do a lot more and we're not going to have the efficiencies that we think we'll have in later
wells. We think probably eventually that somewhere around the $12 million range is somewhere where we'll be
looking at drilling and complete.
<Q - John P. Herrlin Jr.>: Okay. With that formation, do you have a sense what the TOCs are?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah. TOCs are running right around 3% or 4%.

Are you changing your completion techniques at all? Are you like with the horizontal wells doing more frac stages?

<Q - Harry Mateer>: Hi, guys. This is for Jeff. My question was going to be whether you might use some of the
Brazil proceeds to pay down debt. But given that it sounds like you won't be repatriating any time soon can you just
give us a sense for how the debt line is going to trend throughout the year?
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: Well, our short-term borrowings I would project as we continue to execute on our share
repurchase program our short-term borrowings would continue to escalate. We do have that $1.75 billion bond that
matures at the end of September of this year that we will be looking at, what portion of that we might refinance versus
pull into short-term borrowings. And so I would expect that our headline debt number would continue to increase as
long as we leave those proceeds offshore.
<Q - Harry Mateer>: Okay. And your intent is to keep that short-term debt in CP? Or do you think you might actually
term it out down the road?
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: It will all depend upon the capital markets and the cost of short-term funds. I mean right now
we're funding in the short-term market at very attractive rates, sub 30 basis points. So that's pretty compelling.

<Q - Eric Hagen MBA>: Hey, Dave, a quick follow-up on the Parkman, just wondering if you can characterize that in
the same way you did the Tuscaloosa. And also, has there been any industry activity around your acreage, any
horizontal results to date?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, the Parkman, there isn't as much activity going on around there. We have seen a couple
of plays historically that have been made in the Parkman. El Paso made a play two or three years ago that was not too
far away from it in a similar type play. The Parkman is really, it's a different play. The Parkman itself is more of your
stratographic trap. It's actually a sand. You're just looking at a stratographic trap typically one to two miles wide and
perhaps many miles long, and then what you're really looking as with many of these is where there is somewhat tighter
sands though that are more easily developed and much more economically developed with horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing. And so that's what we're really doing there is taking advantage in these tighter sands of the new
technology and producing the – increasing the ultimate recoveries of these wells through hydraulic fracturing and
horizontal drilling.
<Q - Eric Hagen MBA>: Okay. One follow up on that then, so would it be – would the Parkman then be prospective
across the whole, I think it was 220,000 acres, or will it be just sort of more geographically limited? Any...
<A - David A. Hager>: Let me give you a perspective here. Across the – we give – and these numbers change
day-to-day as our geologists are working it here. But if you say that right now that our – we give our Rockies
exploration program maybe 200 million barrels of risked potential, I'd say that the Parkman is not the biggest one. It
may be – and we may change our minds as we drill more wells. But it's probably more on the order of 20 million, 30
million barrels of that potential. The biggest potential out there we think is the Niobrara. And we are drilling our first
Niobrara well right now. We think that has 100 million-barrel plus risked potential in the Powder River. So it's a nice
play, but I think that the bigger potential probably is this and Niobrara and also in the Mowry.
<Q - Eric Hagen MBA>: All right. Great. Thank you.

Okay, operator. I'm showing the top of the hour. We're going to cut it off at this point. As usual, the Investor Relations
staff will be around the rest of the day for any questions we didn't get to. Thank you for participating in today's call.
