MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello, my name is Dawn, and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the
Baker Hughes Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions]
I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Trey Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed.
Trey Clark
Thank you, Dawn. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Baker Hughes second quarter 2012 earnings
conference call. Here with me today are Martin Craighead, President and CEO, and Peter Ragauss, Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation and a news release that was issued earlier today can be
found on our website at www.bakerhughes.com, additionally, reconciliation of operating profits and non-GAAP
measures to GAAP results for historic periods can be found on our website in the Investor Relations section under
Financial Information.
Finally, I must caution you that any company outlooks discussed this morning are as of today and are subject to various
risk factors. We'll try to highlight these risk factors as we make these forward-looking statements. However, the format
of the call prevents a more thorough discussion of these risk factors. For a full discussion of these risk factors, please
refer to Baker Hughes' SEC filings and in particular, the forward-looking disclosure in this morning's news release.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Martin. Martin?

Baker Hughes delivered improved results in the second quarter. While there were a lot of headlines around prices for
oil, natural gas and NGLs, the rig count actually only moved about 1%. And perhaps the story that grabbed the most
headlines with the price of guar, however by executing with focus and discipline and leveraging our balanced portfolio
products and services, Baker Hughes delivered 2% sequential growth in operating income.
The real story behind this success is the sense of urgency we applied to North America. The initiatives we implemented
to improve our pressure pumping business are on schedule. Furthermore, our drilling and evaluation, completion, and
artificial lift businesses posted outstanding results.
Our international business delivered improved revenue and operating profit as well, driven primarily by outstanding
performance in Europe and the Middle East. In a moment, I will share with you what we're doing to continue
improving the quality of our earnings, but first I'll turn the call over to Peter for more detail on the quarter. Peter.
Peter A. Ragauss
Thanks, Martin. Good morning. This morning we reported net income for the second quarter of $439 million, which is
$1 share. Revenue for the second quarter was $5.33 billion, up 12%, or $585 million from last year and down 0.5%, or
$29 million sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.02 billion, flat to last year and up 3%
sequentially. To help in your understanding of this quarter's results, I'll bridge last quarter's EPS to this quarter.
In Q1 we posted earnings of $0.86 per share. Subtract $0.07 for North America operations primarily due to the seasonal
reduction in Canadian activity. Add $0.04 for international operations as every international segment posted increased
operating profits. Add $0.04 for industrial services, as a result of seasonal rebound in activity, particularly in our
process and pipeline services business. Add $0.02 for lower corporate costs. Lastly, add $0.11 for lower taxes, as this
quarter was favorably impacted by the reversal of certain tax reserves [audio gap] (03:57 – 04:00) . That brings us back
to the $1 per share.
Looking at the year-on-year bridge, starting with $0.77 in Q2 of last year add back $0.16 for expenses related to Libya.
This brings us to the adjusted $0.93 we discussed in the second quarter of last year. Subtract $0.13 for North America
operations as a result of less favorable market conditions for our pressure pumping product line. Add $0.08 for
international operations resulting from steady international growth, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. Subtract
$0.03 for higher corporate costs, partially due to approximately $10 million quarterly of non-cash amortization that we
highlighted back in Q4 2011. Finally, add $0.15 for a lower overall tax rate, primarily related to the reversal of certain
tax reserves previously highlighted. That brings us back to the $1 per share figure.
In table four of our earnings release, we provide financial information excluding the impact of certain expenses in
Libya in Q2 2011 as a result of civil unrest. From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue,
operating profit, and operating profit margin refer exclusively to table four.
Moving to North America, revenue was $2.7 billion, up $300 million, or 13% compared to a year ago and down $191
million, or 7% sequentially. The sequential decline in revenue resulted from the seasonal reduction in Canadian activity
following the spring break-up. In the United States, our revenue was higher compared to the first quarter. North
America operating margin was 13.4%, down 60 basis points compared to the previous quarter. Similar to revenue, the
sequential decline in North American margin can be attributed to Canada, which was mostly offset by improved
margins in the U.S.
Let me summarize our performance in North America into three points. First, our self-help initiatives and actions to
reduce costs offset the market volatility impact to our pressure pumping business, and this helped stabilize margins.
The most well publicized story of this volatility was guar beans. Where our costs continue to increase for the most part,
we were not able to pass them on to customers. Pressure pumping pricing remained very competitive, especially in the
gas basins and in the Eagle Ford. The pricing for other basins such as the Permian remained stable.
Second, every other product line in U.S. land had very strong results during the quarter. We're very pleased with the
performance of our drilling systems, completion systems and production product lines. The rapid shift from natural gas

to oil is driving strong demand and improved pricing for artificial lift and chemical product lines. The third and final
point is that our results from the seasonality of spring break-up in Canada were just as expected.
Moving to International, revenue was $2.3 billion up $259 million, or 12% compared to a year ago and up $122
million, or 6% versus the prior quarter. International operating profit was $320 million, up $48 million year-on-year
and up $25 million sequentially. International operating margin was 13.7%, up 60 bps year-on-year and up 40 bps
sequentially.
Both sequentially and year-on-year, each international segment delivered increased revenue and operating profit. In
fact, we recorded the highest revenue and operating profit in Europe and the Middle East since the Baker Hughes
geomarket reorganization in 2009. Our Europe, Africa, Russia, Caspian segments delivered strong results for a second
consecutive quarter. Operating margins exceeded our expectations, primarily due to Europe where our drilling services,
wire line services, completion systems, and artificial lift product lines performed well across the region.
In Africa, as expected, the favorable product mix during the first quarter did not repeat. In the Middle East,
Asia-Pacific region, we saw sequential margin improvement as well. Overall margin increased 75 basis points as strong
completions in artificial lift sales in Saudi Arabia were complemented by increased drilling activities throughout the
region.
In Iraq, revenue continued to grow rapidly as our business expands. Latin America also delivered improved results
sequentially, with revenue increasing 5% and operating margin increasing 105 basis points. These results are largely
attributed to higher activity across the region, particularly in Mexico, Argentina, and Venezuela.
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue was $321 million, up 14% sequentially due to typical seasonality.
Increased pipeline inspection and commissioning as well as polymers activity drove strong incrementals. As a result,
operating profit was up $22 million, or 100% sequentially with operating margin of 13.7% for the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, overall our balance sheet at the end of the quarter remained strong. Our total debt was $5
billion, up $514 million from the prior period. This increase was primarily to fund U.S. working capital and capital
expenditures. Our total-debt-to-capital ratio was 23%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $771 million and at the
end of the quarter, we had $792 million in cash.
Now, let me provide you with our guidance for the remainder of 2012, starting with rig count. For North America, we
now expect the average annual rig count to grow about 3% year over year, from an average of 2,296 rigs in 2011 to an
average of 2,371 rigs in 2012. We expect to exit 2012 with 488 natural gas rigs in the U.S., which is a decline of 321
rigs compared to last year. For oil, we expect to exit 2012 with 1,430 rigs in the U.S., which is an increase of 300 rigs
compared to last year.
I will now give our third quarter outlook for North America. We expect continued activity and margin improvement in
the Gulf of Mexico, as the deepwater rig count continues to increase. In Canada, activity will rebound, but the current
pace is disappointing. Revenue and margins are expected to be challenged as pressure pumping market conditions and
cost issues experienced in the U.S. begin to impact that market. Similarly, we expect pressure pumping in the U.S. to
continue facing weak market conditions. And we expect margins will be eroded during the quarter by higher guar bean
costs as we consume inventory purchased at peak prices during the second quarter.
While the outlook in North America is very difficult to predict in the current environment, we would like to share our
view on margins for the third quarter. The seasonal increase in Canadian activity will be partially, if not entirely, offset
by continued weak market conditions in pressure pumping and higher costs for guar beans. In summary, we expect
North America margins to be flat to slightly up compared to the second quarter.
For the international rig count, our forecast for 8% year-over-year growth has not changed. This excludes the effect of
Iraq, which Baker Hughes began including in our rig count in June 2012. The most significant growth will remain in
the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Our international margins are expected to continue to increase this year,
with a Q4 exit rate higher than Q4 of 2011. Industrial services should see growth and Q3, but will likely decline in Q4
due to typical seasonality.

We expect interest expense to be between $55 million and $60 million for Q3. Corporate costs are expected to be
between $80 million and $85 million for Q3. Depreciation and amortization expense in Q3 is expected to be between
$395 million and $405 million. Our expected tax rate for the full year continues to be between 33% and 34%, which
means we expect a tax rate of about 36% in the second half. Lastly, capital expenditures for the year are still expected
to be between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion.
At this point, I'll now turn the call back over to Martin
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks Peter. In North America our management team has made good progress executing our pressure pumping
improvement plans, while every other product lines has delivered very strong results. Let me start by providing a brief
update on the productivity, supply chain and technology elements of our pressure pumping plans. Starting with
productivity, we continue to enhance the utilization of our workforce and at the same time, we've improved the
utilization of our fleet.
We added additional 24-hour fleets in the second quarter, and in fact, right now we have more 24-hour fleet than at any
point in our history. One example of our efficiency improvement is stages per fleet per day, which increased 10% over
the previous quarter. We also made progress in adding considerable infrastructure in the right basins in order to
improve operational efficiency and we finished relocating our fleets to the oily basins during the quarter. Shifting to
supply chain, we continue to make good progress on freight and logistics as we work to optimize shipping lanes and
rationalize carriers in the interest of leveraging volumes and better coordinating shipping schedules.
We've also beefed up our procurement function and made careful and calculated decisions on commodity-based
consumables such as [ph] croppence (14:17) and guar. As you know, the cost of guar has become a recent source of
volatility for the service sector. While prices reached a peak of $12 per pound in the second quarter, in the past few
weeks, they've come down to around $5 per pound. When you consider the market drivers for guar, there is reason to
believe the downward pricing trend will continue. And while that could be good news in the near-term, guar is still a
farmed product and we cannot continue to subject our customers, nor our income statement, to this uncertainty.
That brings us to the final part for our pressure pumping improvement plan, and that's the role of technology. Baker
Hughes has a long history of delivering solutions through technology and as we highlighted last quarter, we continue to
increase our technology spend in pressure pumping. To that end, we focus the experts in our fluids and chemicals labs
to develop alternatives to guar. During the quarter, we accelerated the introduction of AquaPerm, a linear, gel
fracturing system that is proprietary to Baker Hughes.
So far, our AquaPerm system has replaced approximately 5% of our guar volume in the second quarter, and there is the
potential to double that in the second half of this year. In addition, we're also working on the next generation of
cross-linked fluids to replace guar. Our operations technology and supply chain teams remain laser focused on the
initiatives to improve our pressure pumping product line.
As Peter highlighted, every other product line in U.S. land operations performed very well, and that serves as a firm
reminder of the impact of our technological contributions. In drilling services, our position with rotary steerable
systems continues to expand. Our AutoTrak curve system was formally introduced a little over year ago, and since then
it has been extremely well received in the market.
AutoTrak curve can do in one efficient pass what it takes other directional drilling system three passes to accomplish.
This drilling technology provides more well bore exposure within the reservoir. We've already drilled over one million
feet in just a year in the U.S. To put that into perspective the previous generation of the AutoTrak system took three
years to hit the one million-foot milestone.
Our completion systems product line remains a core strength and continues to outpace the market. Products such as our
FracPoint sliding sleeve technology are gaining further traction, as more and more customers improve efficiency by
moving to all sleeves completions, rather than a hybrid completion with both sleeves and plugs. Furthermore, we're

seeing more uptake of sliding sleeve completions in oily plays, such as the Permian and Niobrara.
Elsewhere in North America, our artificial lift product line continues to deliver strong results. We're seeing new
markets for electrical submersible pumps, or ESPs, in unconventionals. In the Mississippian play, we estimate that 60%
of all oil wells needing artificial lift technology are having ESP systems installed. In fact, some operators are bringing
new power lines into their fields to enable ESPs. Baker Hughes's ESPs allow customers to manage the initial start-up
and production profile of the well in order to minimize the damage to the fractures, thus, maximizing their ultimate
recovery.
Moving to international markets, we continue to make steady progress in the Eastern Hemisphere as we ramp up
activity in support of new contracts. Our balanced approach to investing in infrastructure while managing costs
contributed to the sequential and year-over-year margin improvement we highlighted previously.
In the Middle East, we're experiencing solid growth especially in integrated operations. And we believe the IO market
represents a significant opportunity for Baker Hughes. For example, our integrated operations in Iraq represent the
largest and fastest start-up in the history of our company. From zero drilling rigs in March, we exited the second quarter
operating six drilling rigs and expect that to grow to nine drilling rigs by the end of this year.
We've taken a disciplined approach, as we've highlighted in the past, to entering this challenging market and we're
pleased with our progress. Following this success, we've recently been awarded a long-term engineering, project
management, and integrated operations drilling contract by Saudi Aramco for turnkey delivery of over 75 wells in the
Shaybah field. This project along with additional awards in Iraq and in the Kuwait-Saudi neutral zone, are providing a
solid foundation for growth in this region.
I'm also pleased to report outstanding performance from our Europe, Africa, Russia, Caspian segment. And in Latin
America, increased activity in Venezuela and the Indian region continues to benefit our production product lines.
As we look to the rest of this year and into 2013, it's a story of two differing markets. Activity in international markets
continues to expand and pricing remains stable. We're focused on growing our integrated operations business while
taking a responsible position on margin expectations for new contracts. We continue to optimize our supply chain
strategic sourcing in order to position our manufacturing and suppler content in lower cost locations. This and
continued focus on reliable and efficient performance will pave the way for Baker Hughes to improve international
margins.
The North American market holds more uncertainty. Assuming natural gas futures claw back to $3 and WTI holds
about $85 a barrel, overall U.S. activity at year-end should look similar to what we're seeing today. As for our North
America customers, we believe there is a heightened bias to maintain capital discipline. Nevertheless, in our current
price environment, there has not been a wholesale change in activity levels across the wider customer base and we don't
anticipate one.
Regardless, the North American pressure pumping market continues to face overcapacity issues. In fact, we see signs
that the pricing pressure experienced in the United States is creeping across the border into Canada. Until this
environment improves and the supply and demand curves balance, Baker Hughes will not be adding another horse to
the herd. Today, the few remaining fleets to be delivered this year will not be going into service right away.
Our focus will remain on executing our plans to continue improving pressure pumping margins and maximizing
utilization of our existing fleet. We are bullish on our ability to harvest the value our other product lines can offer the
market. We will continue to invest in those businesses. In addition, we are particularly pleased with the outlook for the
Gulf of Mexico, as our business has returned to pre-moratorium revenue and margins levels. We are also realizing price
improvements as activity ramps up.
Furthermore, we predict that the Gulf of Mexico activity will continue growing and the active rig count at the end of
this year is projected to include 29 active deepwater drilling rigs, up from 24 active today. Our strength in high
technology completion and production systems will provide additional growth as our customer shift from exploration
and appraisal to multi-well development campaigns in 2013. In closing, we remain focused on the quality of our

earnings and the disciplined deployment of our capital.
So with that, Trey, let's go ahead and open it up for some questions.
Trey Clark
Thank you, Martin. At this point, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for your questions. To give everyone a fair
chance to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and the related follow-up questions. Dawn,
could we have the first question please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Kurt.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hi guys. I was curious – first and foremost I mean the improvement sequentially in North
America driven by everything outside of the frac business really underscores a pretty significant strength. You guys
provided your outlook [indiscernible] (23:11) flat to maybe slightly higher as you head out into the third quarter. Have
we seen the worst of the frac pricing situation right now? What was the greatest intensity in the second quarter? Can
you give us some color on that so that we can kind of frame the second half of the year and how these other product
lines are going to potentially offset what's happening in the frac business?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, Kurt. You asked about a couple of things there, so you asked about pricing on the
pressure pumping, so let me address it this way. We have some basins that are – let's say the worst in pricing, which
would be your NGL-driven activity right now. But interestingly, I think as this quarter came to a close it was becoming
apparent that a lot of the capacity had moved out of the gas basins. As you heard us say on the call, we're pretty much
there, if not all there, in terms of what we want to move. That's going to equalize the supply-demand situation, so we
don't expect any more meaningful price deterioration in the basins that have given us problems in the past.
Obviously, I think the oil basins are pretty well balanced. You do have one basin that I guess say is going through some
rapid change given the NGL situation, but other than that I'm a little bit more optimistic now. I'm not saying pricing
isn't going to continue to creep down overall, but it's definitely decelerated and that's a positive. If you asked also about
the pricing in our other product lines and the impact on that, it's really a technology type of driven event, Kurt.
And you can go through all the different product lines. I don't want to do that right now. The guys can probably give
you some more color, but as I highlighted briefly, rotary steerables, particularly the curve, some of the new technology
on the artificial lift, and of course FracPoint and all the derivatives of that are still driving some pretty impressive price
gains depending on the basin, depending on the customer and the application. So, I don't know if that answers your
question.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Yeah, it's helpful. It just – your commentaries being somewhat cautious on the progression on
Canada, obviously with some additional pressures on frac, I was really trying to kind of gauge your level of conviction
in this 300 to 400 basis point of self-help improvement you guys had indicated over the last couple of quarters in North
America. And just trying to once again get your conviction on whether or not you'd be fully – be able to fully recognize
that 300 basis points to 400 basis points as we get into the second half of the year.

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Go ahead Peter.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: This is Peter. We don't have that much conviction since we've delivered most of that already.
I think we came a little bit earlier. We had quite a few good quick wins. Our utilization of our workforce is a lot higher
than it was, say even two quarters ago. We're running more 24-hour frac fleets. Our logistics and freight costs have
come down sequentially, so we feel pretty – in fact, we're there pretty much on meeting that self-help. It doesn't mean
there isn't more that we've identified that can't benefit us in later quarters. And a lot of that has to do with customer mix
and utilization, which I think take a bit little longer to realize. But as far as the reduction in costs and getting more
efficient, we've achieved quite a bit of it already.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And maybe, if I could have one follow-up here on use of cash on a go forward basis, how
would you prioritize that?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Initially to pay down our commercial paper, which is about a little over $1 billion dollars
right now, so that's the obvious one. We've had quite a bit of increase in working capital in the first half of the year as
we've taken on [ph] propence (27:22), guar, et cetera, and so we want to pay some of that working capital down. But
we're still cash negative for the year and I think what we want to do is continue to get ourselves in a cash positive
position before we start worrying about increasing returns and that sort of thing.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Got it. Thanks.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of James West with Barclays.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Hi, good morning gentlemen.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, James.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Morning, James.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: And congratulations on a solid quarter. Quick question on the international side, Martin
and particularly on Latin America, we've seen obviously some pretty big contracts go through in Brazil, or at least
they're in the process of being finalized. There's been a lot of market share shifts, it looks like, in that market. And I
recognize those won't go into effect until probably the end of this year or early 2013, but how is Baker Hughes set up
for this change? Because if I'm reading – if my Portuguese is correct and I'm reading these contracts right, it looks like
you have given up some market share. And I recognize that you guys are thinking about it as your market share
probably as margin versus some that might think about it as revenue, but is there potential that we might see Latin
America going into the next year slip in terms of top line type growth? Or am I over overstating, kind of, the changes in
Brazil?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, you know James, there's a whole lot of rhetoric around that, so I want to limit my
comments. But I'll put it this way, the contract you refer to I know pretty well. I was fortunate enough to be involved in
our drilling segment when that contract was awarded to us five, six, seven years ago – I really can't remember now –
and it's a meaningful piece of business for us. There is going to be a likely shift in share, but our presence there will
still be significant, and I think that some of the rhetoric – what's lost in all the rhetoric, I should say is the fact that
there's no guarantee of share. You have to earn the share.
What the contract provides you is a opportunity, and performance is everything for Petrobras. It's everything obviously
in those basins. So, we're – I got to tell you, I haven't lost any sleep, and it's a bit of a non-event in terms of the way the
decisions were made. We felt comfortable with our pitch, given our time there, our cost structure, our infrastructure,
our knowledge of the reservoir. So, I think what you may want to take away, as you've seen in parts of Mexico, you
saw it in Saudi Arabia five or six years ago, the only winner here actually might be the customer.

<Q - James Carlyle West>: Right, okay. And so, and we could – if I articulate kind of how you – how that contract
had worked out the last five or six years, your performance has been excellent, if I remember correctly.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Both operationally and financially, and by the way we just received an extension well
into next year.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No changes in pricing and activity for us. So, like I say, down there, you get what you

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Peter and Martin, I'm not sure if you provided us – and if you did, I didn't hear it – but any
thoughts with regard to international margin possibilities for the third and fourth quarter respectively. You did 13.7% in
the second quarter, which was a bit better than a year ago and flat to up quarter on quarter. Should we expect more
market improvement second half of this year with continued seasonal recovery in the third quarter, or how should we
think about it?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Well, your bookends are this quarter at 13.7%.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yeah.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: And we did say we expect to have an exit rate higher than the exit rate last year, so
somewhere above 15.5%. So, we've got 200 basis points or so to achieve that, and it's probably a pretty steady grind up
from here and I think the word – the operative word we've been using for last month is grind, because it is a
volume-driven phenomenon.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: We are seeing some pockets in price and smaller tenders, only to be consumed by discounts
on big tenders, but, yeah we still feel pretty good about the rig count. We have high visibility on our current contracts
especially in the near term. So, we see margins improving from here.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay, good. And then secondly with regard to North America and specifically Canada, I
think you said in the press release that Canada unfolded as expected – which given the 70% decline in activity, I think
coming out of Q1, you expected a relatively benign result, generally a spring break-up with regard to eroding revenues
and margins, but perhaps not as severe as historically you had expected. And given the severity of the rig count
compression, and if in fact, your results were more benign than historical precedent, what drove that delta? Or in fact,
was the break-up kind of in line with what unfolded on the activity front which would, I mean your revenues would
have been down 15%. I mean is that what unfolded or something other than that?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: The break-up was in line with last year. There was nothing unusual about it, neither better
nor worse in terms of our decline in operating profit coming out of Canada. It's pretty much flattish compared to last
year.

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: What's different, Bill...
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yeah.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: What's different is the way it's coming back.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: It's -
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yeah, soft.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, it's very soft.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yeah.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think in fact, just looking at some of the numbers over the last few days, our guys – the
rig count where she sits this week is a three or four year-low relative to this time year on year and gas prices are, with
the pressure pumping saturation up there, I wouldn't expect – we're not expecting to be able to deliver out of that
business unit like we have in the past sequentially. It's two to three.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Right. So Peter...
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: It'll still be up, Bill, but it probably won't be up as much as it was last year at this time.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: No, I hear you. So, historically you've done, with your pressure pumping part of the mix
now, you've had a 50% revenue decline, something close to that with regard to detrimentals, and then two-thirds
revenue recapture in the third quarter, and the two-thirds revenue recapture probably is your reach at this stage.
Correct?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, that's probably a reach. And don't forget we mentioned – we think our traditional
businesses will be affected a bit by the rig count, but you're starting to see pressure pumping pricing hitting Canada a
little bit, and we are seeing guar cost increases in Canada. So, you've got combination of the rig count affecting all the
product lines, and you got the unique phenomenon of pressure pumping, which is under a little bit more pressure than
the rest of our product line.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: And I'll slip one more in here. Martin, have you thought about – we're seeing a pretty
significant production response on the natural gas front, as the storage data has been much better behaved over the past
several months.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Right.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Have you thought about – the entire industry, not only you, has sprinted away from natural
gas. At some point, we're probably going to revert back to natural gas in some form or fashion. How do you think about
that with regard to the logistics and the operational issues attendant to that switch back to gas?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, Bill, that's a great question, and we do think about it, but I got to tell you it's all
hands on deck right now with – so that's going to be a good problem to have to address, and we will have to address it.
What I would tell you is that the difference will be, at least for Baker Hughes, when we dislocated out of gas into oil,
we went into – we didn't have the facilities to move into. I kind of I want to say we went into a Walmart parking lot,
but we had some difficult logistical issues to address.
Given what's happened with gas in the previous three years, we were well under our way, as was BJ, in building pretty
significant facilities. Now those facilities today sit underutilized in the big gas basins. So it would be a much easier, if
you will, relocation back in than what we experienced moving into the oil, because we'll have the infrastructure. Now
staffing may be a bit of an issue. We'll have to address that. But that should be the only item that would cause us any
kind of pain would be the people side. We have the infrastructure.

And your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good morning. Martin, can you talk about where you see the best international prospects
over the next 6 to 12 months?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, I can, Jim. By far, it's Middle East followed by Africa, and then I think you drop
down to a Latin America, Europe type of story, and I think Asia Pacific particularly is going to continue to – to use
Peter's term – grind it out. We just don't see the activity and therefore pricing coming back as strongly there as we do
and in Africa and the Middle East into 2013.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Can you be a little bit more granular, Martin, and comment maybe a little bit by country
and which countries you see the strongest improvement in activity and hopefully Baker Hughes' revenue?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, in the Middle East, of course led this year by Saudi and Iraq, into 2013 and you
could probably add on Kuwait, as they move more into the horizontal markets, it's going to be fantastic for our
business, and Oman should come back a little bit stronger than it was this year. And in terms of Africa, the strength
later this year and into next year I think differentially will be Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, of course the deepwater plays
in Mozambique and Tanzania, and Nigeria. We could have a very positive surprise in Libya and Algeria and I wouldn't
say we're not banking on it. We are banking on it, but of course it's got a higher beta right now.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. Could you also comment on what you're seeing right now in international wireline
and LWD pricing, and as a subset of that, what you're seeing in terms of LWD pricing on deepwater jobs?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: LWD or wireline on deepwater?
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Well, maybe both.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay. LWD D&E pricing internationally is very, very good, except for the big contracts.
And on wireline it's the same, call out smaller – smaller term contracts in terms of money or volume or timeframe are
getting better. It's the high profile ones that pricing has been gutted on. Does that answer your question?
<Q - James D. Crandell>: That does. And one quick follow-up is what – and switching, it's really switching topics
here, what quarter do you see guar becoming a tailwind instead of a headwind for Baker?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: It's going to be the most costly based on the inventory work-out in Q3 and then if you
look at three to four, you'll start to see a – it will be favorable. And as both Peter and I said in our commentary, it
should then pick up a little bit of steam four to one and so forth and hopefully get us back to where it's a non-event. But
like I said, should it be an event, we're taking actions to try to minimize that, through either better contracting or
replacing it.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: And let me just add that Q2 to Q3 will be an increase in cost, just to be clear. Whether or not
Q4 comes down to Q2 levels it remains to be seen, depending on how much we can contract at today's prices. So we're
not expecting Q4 to be much below Q2 at this point.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. And Peter, how does your – what do you expect, what are your last expectations now
in terms of CapEx this year?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: We said $2.7 million to $2.9 million. You'll see in the press release we've spent about $1.4
million in the first half and we're on pace for the midpoint of the $2.7 million to $2.9 million.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Great, okay. Thank you guys.

And your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Good morning. Thank you.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Peter, you mentioned the international rig count growth expectations still at 8% year over
year, although you noted you had included Iraq in those numbers, and now I guess that wasn't the case at the time of the
first quarter call, since you guys picked that up in June of 2012. When you guys had lowered your rig count forecast
internationally last time you had still maintained a belief that your top line international revenue could grow
double-digits, and I guess, Peter or Martin, is that still the expectation now as we look at 2012 versus 2011?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, let me just clarify, the 8% excludes any impact from Iraq and we feel okay about that.
We feel there's a bit of ramp-up coming in the second half of the year and of course we'll obviously update that next
quarter. Yeah, we're still – feel okay about double-digit international revenue growth. As I said earlier, we have good
visibility of our contracts, prices, and so on, particularly in the near-term, and we usually are very good at predicting
our revenues internationally, and I don't feel that that's changed any – that hasn't changed in the past six months.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. I would assume, given the international margin – kind of exit commentary, Peter –
fourth quarter 2012 versus fourth quarter 2011, we're still comfortable if not conservative in the thought process of 20%
incremental margins non-North America year over year?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah. I would say we're comfortable and that does sound conservative.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay, okay. One last one from me, I guess Martin, can you talk about – I know Canada was
delved into in terms of the revenue deltas and what to expect here. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about
just the U.S. revenue trends as we move forward here in a flattish rig count environment. If you think about some
continued pricing degradation on the stim side, I guess if we assume – that's about 40% of your North America revenue
stream is stimulation right now, but you talked very optimistically, I guess, about your other product lines, non-stim
related. How do we think about top line growth in U.S. here relative to rig count, and also, just what's still going on in
terms of a tough pressure pumping market in general?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I don't want to share an absolute revenue projection for U.S. onshore, but I think
there is a, like I said earlier, a real bias towards this absorption of technology into these basins, and we can't keep up
with the demand on some of those products and services at this stage. Now, there's obviously a limited amount of
pricing of power given the economics that the customer's experiencing and so forth, but we don't have – I don't have
any worries about where our products sit relative to our competitors and our portfolio, especially around production
chemicals, artificial lift and completions, I think, is about as oily as you're going to find.
And we're seeing strong pull on all of those, and then the other elements of North America that I don't think has come
out yet on this Q&A, Bill, is around the Gulf of Mexico, and we got a couple of drivers there. Pricing is getting better.
Utilization is getting better and the mix of the well types is getting more favorable for us and certainly will into 2013.
So, yes a flat rig count is not generally a good indicator for our business, because it – all it takes is an extra wireline
truck or an extra motor somewhere to start to bring prices down. That's just the nature of this business. We generally –
we don't like to see a balanced condition, but when you actually drill a layer below that and say well, what can the Auto
Track curve do versus a regular MWD motor system as a whole different conversation with the customer and some of
those products, like I say, are in pretty tight supply. So we feel pretty optimistic, granted cautiously because there's still
lot of uncertainty out there, but feel pretty good about our pricing on our other products and services and our mix.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. I will turn it back. Thanks for the time.

Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Thank you very much. Martin, where do you think you stand at the moment? Or where do you feel
you stand on the integration of BJ Services and the two organizations, particularly within North America?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think we stand very well. The integration was never in question. As we've reported on
previous calls, we delivered the economic synergies with regards to the cost, removals early on, back in 2011. And in
terms of our cross-selling and working as a team, the blue well bore, as we call it, is stronger than ever in terms of
leveraging both products and services. As you recall on the last call, the issues we had around the pressure pumping
product line didn't have anything to do with its products, its services or its well site execution. It just had some tactical
decisions that we made around where we were operating, contract position and so forth, and we've taken actions to
resolve that. So the integration was, in all aspects, I believe very good and pretty much essentially complete.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: And so with that, can you share anything about where let's say leading edge pricing is in pressure
pumping relative to your backlog and relative to whatever else you can squeeze out of your cost side and bring that into
context of the improvement in the other segments? I was just sort of trying to get a feel for the cross-currents that we
have to think about going sequentially into the third quarter and fourth quarter.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, what I'll say, Ole, is kind of what I said earlier. On the pricing front, it's kind of
hitting its – it's gliding in on a – it has further to probably go in some of the gas basins, but it's decelerating. And it's
obvious, I think, where it's going to land as capacity is rolled out. Do we have some downside risks in some of the oily
basins? Yes, and it's probably weakening in some. And then you have one basin that's NGL-driven where I characterize
it as a knife fight right now in terms of pricing. But overall, I'm a little bit more optimistic about where this is going to
land than I was a quarter or two ago, and perhaps part of that is just our greater understanding of the business as we've
– as our teams has gotten our hands around it. That doesn't – as Peter highlighted, the improvement in utilization that
we had in our prepared commentary, but also the supply chain benefits will come more into Q4 and into next year. So,
that's about all I can say on it.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: This knife fight, or this covenant, with respect to downside in certain oily, is that a pressure
pumping-centric, or does it also extend to [indiscernible] (48:56)?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Only pressure pumping, Ole.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Only pressure pumping, everything else is holding together.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, correct.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: With respect to the unconventional opportunity outside North America, where do you see the
biggest opportunity for Baker Hughes?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Saudi North gas fields, China, and hopefully Argentina, in that order.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay. Thanks, Martin.

<Q - Michael Urban>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael Urban>: I appreciate all the detail and the attempt to help us work through North America, and so I
think it was pretty clear on kind of what the averages should be for the second quarter. Just wanted to think about it on
a leading-edge basis and see if I'm kind of understanding the different moving parts. So, guar obviously on a
leading-edge basis down quite a bit, you've had some success on the cost side in the self help initiatives. Your costs are
down and you get a full quarter benefit of that kind of going forward in the second – later in the second half, later this
year. Utilization sounds like it's up, and as you talked about price down, but kind of decelerating, does that – can I take
that to mean that at the leading edge, your pumping margins are bottoming here? And I know there's a lot of
uncertainty going forward, but as it stands today, are we kind of seeing those bottom out, netting out all those different
parts of the equation?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Going into Q3, the answer is no because these – you talked about leading edge, but we still
have inventories of guar that are going to drive our guar costs up sequentially and I think that's a big factor that's
probably going to drive margins down into Q3. And only when we start working through that inventory will we see
some benefit. And I think all the other factors of self help versus price and all that, they feel like they're possibly
getting into balance.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Right, okay. I was just trying to like kind of mark everything to market, so if you took your – if
you just were running through today's gaur price on the current cost structure, current utilization.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: And I'm referring to onshore U.S. Canada, it's just getting started, and pricing is more
uncertain almost there because we're starting to feel it. So -
<Q - Michael Urban>: Okay, that makes sense. I think that explains it. The rest of my questions were answered. That's
all from me. Thank you.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Thanks, Mike.
<A - Trey Clark>: Okay, and Mike, thank you very much. Dawn we'd like to take one final question, please.
Operator
Okay. And your final question comes from the line of David Anderson with JPMorgan.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks, good morning. Somewhat, I guess a kind of big picture question for you. I'm just
curious how your view on the pressure pumping business overall has changed over the last 12 months. Is this a business
that you really want to grow, or are you viewing it more defensively as a means to bring in other service and products?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No, we don't see it as a defensive business. It's a tremendous business and it's so critical
to being – it's part of the fabric of who we are. It's a core business for us. I mean, if you define the company, I mean, it's
– we really revolve around drilling, completions, and pressure pumping now, and all of those play so importantly to our
customer. I mean, there's so much rhetoric, David, around unconventionals. I mean, you can't pick up a publication
today, whether it's The Economist or The Journal, or Time Magazine or the New York Times and they're not talking
about the unconventionals.
I think what's lost a bit is that the companies like ourselves and our bigger peers, we're the manufacturing companies of
those unconventionals. I mean we produce the wellbore, and you can't be in that business without having a leading
organization like our pressure pumping business. And as we highlighted and shared with you guys as transparently as
possible, we had some technical challenges – I mean, tactical challenges, sorry. And I think some of you have met the
new leadership team of that business, and they've delivered great results in an accelerated fashion, which is the Baker
Hughes way and you coupled out with things like AutoTrak Curve, the FracPoint. And I go home at night, I can't think
of a better business to be in and pressure pumping's one of those.

<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. In terms of your view on the rig count saying U.S. market is going to be basically flat
for the rest of the year. We're not really seeing any more capacity being added. You said you're not adding more. It
sounds like we're hearing that from everybody else. Is that enough to balance the market? Is a flat rig count enough to
balance the market?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes, it is David, because – and in follow-up to your earlier question, our drilling group
with the Curve continues to drill longer and longer laterals faster. FracPoint guys and girls developed tools like
FracPoint, DirectConnect and so forth, which give you greater and greater density for that lateral. And guess what that
turns out, just like you saw on our prepared remarks, or heard in our prepared remarks, the number of stages per day
per fleet are going up, so a flat rig count, given that we're drilling longer laterals and more stages per lateral in addition
to our customers down spacing in some of these fields, yeah a flat rig count is fine.
<Q - David Anderson>: And just one last quick question on -
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: With discipline and how much horsepower is added of course, but hopefully that'll –
hopefully everybody has kind of learned their lesson. This wasn't – this issue around pressure pumping wasn't a
customer lack of demand. It was a supply-driven problem and we're getting our hands around it.
<Q - David Anderson>: Got it. And last quick question on your rig count forecast as you're looking out there. We're
hearing some concerns out there in the Bakken about differentials that are kind of blowing out there. I mean, I think
they're kind of bouncing around quite a bit. I'm also curious about just kind of maybe NGLs versus Permian versus
Bakken.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Right.
<Q - David Anderson>: How are you thinking about kind of just generally speaking about how those kind of play out
here and how sensitive they are to commodity prices? What are your customers telling you now? Because I think that's
a big concern everybody has out there. Is there another shoe to drop?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Right. I think the shoe's dropping in South Texas, no doubt about it. And in terms of the
Bakken and the Permian, I'm a little bit more concerned about the Bakken than I am in the Permian, even though the
Permian, I think, has a greater degree of NGLs. It's a – that differential in the Bakken is, I'd say that, depending on the
player and what his core property is, averages let's say a $15 differential, it's probably – as long as it's 85 plus in the
Bakken we're fine. I think it gets close to 80, people start getting a bit nervous and if it goes below 80, you could start
to see – if for a sustained basis, a sustained time, you could start to see some rigs coming off. But the whole NGL
situation has unfolded so fast, David. I mean it's down what, some of it 40% year on year and most of that in the last
three or four months. So I think we still don't know, to your question around the shoe dropping, but it's already dropped
in South Texas. That's for sure.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Trey Clark>: Thank you, David. That concludes today's presentation and thank you for your time today.
