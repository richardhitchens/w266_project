MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell, Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning everybody and welcome to our third quarter call this morning. As always, thanks for the
interest in the company.
Steve Malcolm, our President and CEO is going to review a few slides that we have prepared for this morning. But be
aware, though, as always all of our business unit heads, Alan Armstrong, Ralph Hill, Phil Wright, as well as Don
Chappel the CFO are here in the room ready for questions that we'll take after Steve's remarks.
This morning on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find the slides, the data book, the press release
which were all issued this morning. The third quarter 10-Q will also be available today, and you will be able to access
that on the website as well.
At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves, those
are both very important and integral to the remarks. So you should review those. Also there are various non-GAAP
numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available

and they'll follow the presentation.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call and thanks for your interest in our company. Let's just
dive in to the slides. Slide 5 shows the financials, the key financials results. Of course, adjusted earnings per share from
continuing operations is $0.22 for the third quarter. Year-to-date of $0.86 is 28% higher than 2009. Our 2010 through
'12 earnings guidance is relatively unchanged. We will go into some of the tweaks that we've made here a little later.
And we did record a $1.7 billion non-cash impairment due to the recent decline in natural gas prices.
Slide 6 please, some of the major highlights from the quarter. We did reach agreement to sell our Piceance Basin
gathering and processing assets to WPZ. I have a slide later that goes into more detail on that transaction. Secondly,
we're very excited about the progress that we are making to grow our businesses in the Marcellus Shale. And let me
just offer some color on that.
In the E&P space, we are now operating 3 rigs. That number will be increasing to 6 by the fourth quarter of 2011.
Current returns are greater than 30%. We have seen and expect significant continued improvements as Williams
becomes operator and as we proceed with the large Susquehanna drilling program. As you know, we now have 100,000
net acres at an average cost of less than 7,000 an acre.
Gross production near 20 million a day at the end of the third quarter and the Westmoreland County Slavic Trust Wells
have been the best performing to date. As well, good growth in the midstream space. We're rapidly expanding the
Laurel Mountain midstream gathering system. Projects there will ultimately provide over 1.5 Bcf a day of gathering
capacity and 1,400 miles of gathering lines, including 400 new miles of large diameter pipe.
As well, construction has begun on our Shamrock compressor station, where we'll have an initial capacity of 60 million
a day, but is expandable to 350 million a day. And that Shamrock station will likely be the largest central delivery point
out of the Laurel Mountain system.
As well, we have the Springwell system and we now have all of the right of way. We expect to begin construction in
the first quarter of 2011, in service during 2011. And given the demand from customers, we've upped the project size
from a 20-inch to a 24-inch diameter pipeline. So a lot of really exciting things going on in the Marcellus.
Moving back now to talk a little bit more about the highlights on the slide, we did close and finance the Overland Pass
Pipeline transaction and there was strong demand for the WPZ share offering. We did complete the restructuring
transaction with the PZ/MZ merger. We are prepared for a November start-up of Sundance Trail. We've brought the
new Echo Springs TXP-4 into full operation at the end of the third quarter. And just to remind you, the TXP-4 plant
adds about 350 million a day of processing and 30,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids production, in capacity,
roughly doubling what we already had there at Echo Springs.
We increased the WPZ distribution by $0.015 and did announce, as you well know, the leadership succession plan,
effective January 2011, which has Alan coming on board as President and CEO.
Slide 7 please. This slide just gives the guidance range and mid-points for Henry Hub and Rockies net gas prices, crude
oil and NGL margins and our assumed NGL to crude oil relationship. And I think there are just two points that I would
want to make here. One, these are unchanged from the commodity price assumptions that we gave you at Barclays.
And I guess the second point is, yes, we have seen natural gas prices fall since then, but we've run the numbers. And if
you ran, if you used strip prices, you would really see a de minimis impact on our earnings per share for '11 and '12.
Slide 8 please. Steady growth even on expected low nat gas prices. This shows adjusted EPS, adjusted segment profit,
cash flow from operations and capital. And just the key points here, earnings per share reflects some tightening of
ranges in '11 and '12. Segment profit reflects tightening in '11 and a slight increase in the range in '12.

CFFO tightens the range consistent with earnings. 2011 CapEx, we're seeing some carryover from 2010, as well PZ is –
with its Laurel Mountain and Piceance growth. That's added a little capital, 2012 capital as well up a little bit as a result
of Laurel Mountain and Piceance growth.
Slide 9. Again, segment profit moving up even during a low nat gas price environment. That's good stuff. Slide 10
please. This is the slide that we have been showing the last couple of years, which shows maintenance – the
maintenance cap, the maintenance to maintain volumes, the growth projects by year, and divided out by WPZ, E&P
and other.
Couple of points here. You will note in 2010, the blue WPZ growth bar is a little larger, and that's obviously associated
with the bar gas transaction, the Piceance gathering and processing transaction that I spoke about earlier. As well, you'll
notice the growth capital, the yellow bar in '10 and '11 and '12 continues to grow quite nicely.
Of course, that includes, that yellow bar, the Other category includes Canada, where through our first-mover
technological advantage, we continue to anticipate making significant attractive investments over the next three years.
Slide 11, this is our familiar pie chart for WPZ midstream. And as you well know, we've had success in moving
projects due to our success from the left to the right, we really see huge growth opportunities in the Marcellus
opportunities out west to expand on our already significant position out there. And we are still excited about what the
Gulf offers.
Slide 12 please, the WPZ gas pipeline inventory of projects, $1.3 billion represented here. PZ franchise, the gas
pipeline franchise is a major segment of the nation's energy infrastructure, transporting 12% of the country's gas on any
given day. And our gas pipeline enterprise produces consistent low-risk substantial free cash flow.
We've talked about the base hit approach that we've used here, most of our growth has been and will continue to be
from market whole projects within our existing footprints as opposed to, in my view, the more risky producer push
pipes, which are dependent on a given supply basin.
I would say looking out into the future, there is a significant opportunity for expansions to serve power generation,
particularly in the Southeast U.S.
Slide 13, please. I think you are familiar with our premier E&P portfolio and we have talked in the past that the
Marcellus will soon become our second largest producing basin. A couple other key points, our drilling returns
remained strong in our major operating areas of the Piceance, Marcellus and Powder River, with returns ranging from
17% to near 40% even in this low nat gas price environment.
The major reason for this is our industry leadership position on low costs. And I think a great example here is in the
Piceance for 2010, we've improved our well cost by 3% to 6% versus 2009.
We have a unique industry portfolio that allows us to flex-up our drilling program, up or down, without losing value or
losing leases. And as discussed in our September guidance update, we decreased our rig counts for 2011 by 9 rigs and
in 2012 by 17 rigs from our previous guidance. And simply put, we can do that and yet preserve our value and leases,
while we wait for gas prices to improve. And we still expect to grow our production by 3% in 2011, 7% in 2012.
Slide 14. This is the drop-down slide. So this is a large scale asset and you see the bullet points on the left there, 150
miles of large diameter pipe connects to 3,300 wells, 6 amine treating facilities, 160,000 horsepower of compression,
1.2 Bcf a day of dew-point processing capacity. So these are significant assets.
The attractive financial profile and some of the key points there, $105 million of WPZ segment profit in DD&A in
2011, immediately accretive to DCF for PZ. And as a general partner, Williams will receive a favored distribution
increase. WPZ is acquiring fee business. That's a good stuff. Williams E&P segment retains liquids upside and we have
a life-of-lease dedication from Williams E&P and we expect closing to occur in November of 2010.
We still get a lot of questions and there is a lot of dialogue in the industry about what's going to happen within NGLs
and ethane and ethylene, and I'm certainly not going to read all of these bullet points, but there are some points that I

would want to make. And we have made these in the past and continue to believe in them.
Short-term, the fundamentals remain very strong for near-term ethane demand as ethane is maintaining its favorable
position in being the low-cost feedstock for ethylene production. A lot of people are worried about the shale plays and
the large supplies of ethane that are going to come on. But you have to remember, large deposit supplies of ethane from
the shale plays will require significant infrastructure and infrastructure takes time.
The very strong ethylene markets will incent plans to invest in small plant expansions and WMB – Williams has a
low-cost expansion investment ongoing at Geismar, which is going to increase our capacity by 12%.
Longer-term, clearly, the U.S. right now holds a large advantage for being the next low cost tranche of ethylene
production given the abundant natural gas supplies. The U.S. should be in a strong position to export its ethylene
derivative products at a lower cost and incremental production elsewhere in the world. And I think ultimately the big
question is, will ethylene capacity be expanded to keep pace with increased NGL supplies here in the U.S. And given
the high ethane to ethylene spread that exists, we think ultimately that conversions and low-cost capacity increases will
happen.
Slides 16 and 17 talk about the progress that we've made on the 2010 priorities for value creation and you can see more
and more of the boxes now have check marks. And so we're pleased with the progress that we are making there.
Slide 18, please. Why Williams is a winning investment? No change here, we think that we have the assets, the people,
we have proven that we can execute crisply around our strategies. We are committed to financial discipline and believe
that we are going to have very, very attractive results in the future.
Before we go to Q&A, I have got a few comments and Alan will as well, but I wanted to address questions about my
decision to retire. There is no hidden intrigue or back-story here. As Gwen and I were thinking about the next chapter
in our life, and having been with Williams for 26 years, nine of those as CEO, we decided that – again, started talking
about it over the summer, and ultimately decided that it made sense for us to retire at the end of 2010.
And as you know, the requirements are such that once you make your final decision, you need to make it public in 4 or
5 days. So it's a decision that we're very excited about. But the Board was well prepared for this decision. We've had an
active and comprehensive succession planning process in place. The Board and I are confident in the team and
confident in Alan Armstrong and believe that Alan will take the company to new heights. I've had the great opportunity
to work with Alan, not only in his role as heading up our midstream group, but I worked closely with him back in the
1990s when I was running midstream.
So – and I don't want to get too carried away here, but the experience and culture here at Williams is very unique. And
I have been proud to work here for the last 26 years. I truly believe the Williams experience, the Williams culture is a
competitive advantage for us.
So with that, I will turn it over to Alan.
Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing
Great. First of all, Steve, I want to make sure that we acknowledge the accomplishments that Steve brought forward. If
you think back to the very difficult and tenuous circumstances that Steve was handed and to where he has brought to
the day with a very strong, very stable company with tremendous potential to create shareholder value from where we
sit today.
We have that potential in terms of financial resources. We've got extremely well positioned assets in the markets they
serve and we've got tremendous organizational capabilities in terms of exploiting resource plays, both in our E&P
group and in our Midstream group, and our pipes are well-positioned to serve the change in the markets today
associated with the resource plays.

And certainly, as Steve mentioned, our culture, with one of the most passionate and committed workforces in the
business today, leave me with a tremendous amount of optimism about where we can take this, and I just want to say a
big thanks to Steve for giving us such a tremendous platform to take the company from today.
So we are in a very enviable position. We've got all the tools necessary to really accelerate shareholder value. We are
going to be reviewing all alternatives and I'm charged up and can assure you that with the great platform, the
well-positioned assets and organizational capabilities that we have today, we will not be sitting still.
I don't have any particular bias, other than to assure ourselves that we are creating the most shareholder value that is
enduring and allows our businesses to be the most successful they can be for the benefit of our investors.
And with that, I will turn this over to Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers Investment
Research.
<Q - Craig Shere>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. And Steve, congratulations on really rebuilding the company
from some dire days early in the last decade and good luck on your retirement.
<A - Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.
<Q - Craig Shere>: Couple of questions here. Ralph, can you comment on how the commodity price assumptions
underlying the guidance of 3% and 7% production growth the next couple of years differs from the decision to write
down some E&P properties? And at the current lower strips, is it reasonable to assume the gas production may be
declining?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Well, the goodwill impairment and the impairment of the – primarily the Barnett area is really an
accounting exercise that we work on and it's basically the – there are several models there. There's the fair value model
we – and gross cash flows are discounted against that. So as we look at that, for example, on the goodwill, the internal
fair value was slightly less than the carrying value. And in that case, it caused an impairment of our goodwill, which
was – the goodwill for us associated with the 2001, almost a decade ago, acquisition of Barrett. And it wasn't cash out
the door. It was really a deferred tax liability gross-up, if you will. And that became our goodwill. And over the course
of the last decade, as we looked at prices and all that, we really didn't have any opportunities for impairment and then
with the forward price curve has gone down greater than 22% since the beginning of the year, that caused us to look at
that and that caused the write-down.
For the Barnett, it was simply just a factor of the fair value, again, versus the carrying value. Our forward prices have
come down substantially and we have that impairment. That really doesn't have anything to do with go-forward, on
where we are headed primarily in the Piceance and in the Marcellus where most of our drilling is in and, a lesser
extent's just [inaudible]. So those are just accounting exercises. If you look at it, you understand the value of what you
are carrying versus the value of the – the fair value and those are impaired from there.
And I don't know if your last question is more about the industry or us. We know that the level of rigs, which we did
drop a substantial amount of rigs in our forecasts at the Barclays Conference for '11 and '12, but we know that we
believe our production won't be growing that much. I think the industry in general, hopefully, at some time we'll see
our competitors put on more of a return hat and finish drilling for holding leases and finish drilling for holding JVs, and
we'll see a more rational response to the gas prices. And therefore, at that point, I would expect you to see some of the
gas supply to decline.
<Q - Craig Shere>: Well, I guess what I'm trying to understand is the write-down based on forward strips, which are
meaningfully below your midpoint guidance assumptions for the next two years? And if we incorporated that more

conservative assumption, given the wide range of CapEx guidance for the next couple of years, is it reasonable to
assume that we trend towards the lower end, is what I'm trying to get at?
<A - Ralph Hill>: It is based on really what happened – it's a strip through '20, '25 is down about, as I mentioned,
greater than 20%. And I would say, at this point, I would not trend towards the lower part. We feel confident that our
drilling program, as I think as Steve mentioned, our returns in the areas we're going to be drilling are anywhere from
17% to near 40%. We have cut our drilling program substantially, but at this point, we feel that we'll be – we don't give
out exactly, we give a pretty wide range. I think most of you guys look at the middle part of that range and that's kind
of what you assume, and that's generally where we try to come out. If prices would continue to come down
substantially, we always have the ability, as Steve said, to flex our portfolio down, our drilling program down and
respond accordingly until prices come the right way.
<Q - Craig Shere>: Great. And one other quick question, guys. I know if Don or Alan or Steve want to field this. But
do I understand that the latest drop-down to WPZ pre-tax the WMB may have been 7.5 times EBITDA and after-tax
maybe 6.5 times. And does that seem a little low for a fee-based business and how does that correlate to maybe future
drop-downs and how you'd envision pricing?
<A - Don Chappel>: Craig, this is Don. I might just comment, you have to remember that Williams retains its GP
interest. And with that, we get a substantial, you could call it, a royalty. But we get a substantial profit participation in
that asset despite the fact we dropped it down. So I think when you look at the GP interest on top of what we actually
sold it for in terms of cash, I think you get a much higher valuation. In terms of what's left to drop down, we have a
25.5% interest in Gulfstream, which is eligible beginning, kind of in the late first quarter. That's not guidance in terms
of what we may do, but it would be eligible for a drop-down kind of late first quarter. And beyond that, we really
haven't earmarked any other assets.
<Q - Craig Shere>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: Thank you. Recently, a couple of your competitors have decided to dance and leave you guys
out of it, creating some new projects in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford, does this signal a change in how you would
pursue the McMullen Lateral expansion in the Eagle Ford and the Keystone Connector in the Marcellus?
<A - Phillip Wright>: Let me tackle. This is Phil Wright. Let me tackle the Keystone Connector. It doesn't change
anything with respect to what we are pursuing on that project and we continue to work with producers. As you know,
the difficulty in achieving success on any of those large infrastructure projects is getting producers to a position where
they have a clear enough vision of what their needs are going to be and what markets want to try to serve sufficient to
sign a precedent agreement that would produce enough security around a project that would have an investment profile
attractive enough to proceed. And I think that chicken and egg problem persists. With respect to the McMullen Lateral,
I know Alan will have some thoughts on it from a Midstream perspective, but from the pipeline perspective, I can tell
you that as more drilling is done out there and as the lenses of liquids-rich and oil-rich finds sort of move northward,
we are seeing a higher level of interest in dry gas, but nonetheless a very high level of interest in the McMullen Lateral.
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: All I would add to that in terms of the –
first of all, in terms of Marcellus is we have a tremendous joint venture in our Atlas joint venture with Atlas called the
Laurel Mountain, outstanding growth alternatives coming out of that. And we've got some exciting developments going
on the north end of our Springville Lateral. And so I don't feel like we are being left out in any way, shape or form. In
fact, I would tell you, I think we probably have one of the strongest JVs in the Marcellus with – from a Midstream
perspective in terms of creating shareholder value, going up there. So I'm very excited about that position.
In terms of the Eagle Ford, the Markham plant, which is primarily positioned to serve the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,
does stand ready, and it's got great liquids outlets and we just – basically we want to make sure that we don't sell out

that capacity too cheaply. There is not a whole lot of that existing capacity and great liquids market available. And we
are going to make sure we get a premium for having that space available.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: I see. In terms of the transition of management team, I'm assuming this is kind of more of a – I
think Alan said it more of a same as opposed to a signaling of a strategic break in how Williams looks going forward?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: Are you asking a question there, Lasan?
I'm sorry.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: Yeah. I'm asking you, is there – do you expect to do anything majorly different than what Steve
has made in terms of foundation for going forward with WMB?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: Well, I would just say that I think the
integrated model from my vantage point of being in the business and working with our E&P group and our gas pipe
group has absolutely created a lot of value. However, I think we've certainly got to look to see that the markets fully
appreciate the value and that's certainly going to be an important consideration as we look at our alternatives going
forward. So I think it's very early for you to conclude or anybody to conclude really where we stand on that because we
will be looking at our alternatives. But I can assure you that everything is on the table and we will be not looking to sit
still. And we are looking to create – rapidly accelerate the shareholder value.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: I see. One last question, if forward curves materially improve, let's say, 20% from where it is
today, how much more ramp up do you have in terms of E&P spending that you think you could do within a six-month
period?
<A - Ralph Hill>: This is Ralph. We had a previous forecast that had, I think our growth was going to be 12% next
year and then 16% the year after. And what we did is we essentially dropped about 10 rigs in 2011 and about, I think it
was 17 rigs in 2012's forecast. So we have the ability to go out and that wouldn't all happen in 6 months. But we have
the ability to rapidly ramp it back up if prices signals – it should show that. And obviously, as Don would point out,
that as of our cash flows would grow and that's when we'd try to live within our means. So I don't know how much
would happen in 6 months, but I can tell you a few months ago we were planning on – with the different price strip to
have a substantial – higher level of growth and we've dialed that back through the prices.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: So instead of 12% and 16%, you are going to be doing 3 to 7?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Correct. Yes, 3% in '11, about 7% in '12, and that's down from what was like 12% and 16%.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: So that means, in theory, you could ramp up about 9% or 10%?
<A - Ralph Hill>: We could. At some point, we'd have to get the rigs to do all that, but we've been very successful and
always been able to get good rigs, good crews, our alliances with our vendors pays off very handsomely at a time of
ramp up and also helps when we ramp down.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: That's great. Thank you very much.
<A - Ralph Hill>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll move on to our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: Thanks, guys. And Steve, congratulations on your career and best of luck for your future.
<A - Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: I wanted to ask – first question, just in terms of the drop-down itself from the gathering assets,
what drove the decision to take cash versus units, kind of the split that you took there, why did you take one, why not
take all of one or all of the other?

<A - Don Chappel>: This is Don. I'd just note we had some tax considerations.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: Okay. Maybe Ralph, then just on the rig count, where do you see the rig count going by basin?
Over time, how many rigs do you plan on running in each one given the new CapEx budget?
<A - Ralph Hill>: In 2011, we are now at about – we are projecting – it's about where we are today in the Piceance.
We'll have 11 rigs running, nine in the Valley, and two in the Highlands. In the Barnett, we'll be down one rig. And in
the Marcellus, it's going to – as Steve mentioned, I think it goes from 3 and ultimately ends up 6 at the end of the year.
So on average, that, in the Marcellus, is more like – hate to do this – but it's 4.75 rigs in the Marcellus.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: That's for '11?
<A - Ralph Hill>: [inaudible] four rigs from where had planned earlier.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: And that's...
<A - Ralph Hill>: Piceance is down five rigs and Barnett is down two rigs.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: Got it, got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, again, just on E&P, it looks like your evaluating a lot
of expansion opportunities, you mentioned on one of the slides, I think, Marcellus, Eagle Ford, even Bakken. How are
you thinking about each of those opportunities? How do those fit in with your expertise, your footprint et cetera?
<A - Don Chappel>: I think they fit in well. Obviously, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken bring a different look to our
portfolio in the sense of liquids and/or condensate oil, which is we'd like to have that. But expertise-wise, we drilled
hundreds and hundreds of horizontal wells. We understand how to do that. So each of those areas work for us. So we
continue to – now, we have a substantial position in the Marcellus of 100,000 acres. We would like to continue to
evaluate opportunities there and we are. Eagle Ford has had some great looking opportunities out there and obviously
there is other areas such as the Bakken that we think would fit right in with what our expertise is.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: Okay, thanks. And then if I could just ask, since you issued the guidance a month,
month-and-a-half ago, gas prices are obviously lower, NGL prices are higher. Are you thinking any differently now
about capital allocation between E&P and Midstream or kind of how are you thinking about that going forward given
where the prices have moved?
<A - Don Chappel>: This is Don. We've asked our E&P business largely to live within its means. So to the extent it
generates cash flows, we would expect that they would likely consume those cash flows to reinvest in the business,
again, with a bias towards liquids rich areas, like the Piceance, in fact, we do get a lot of liquids out of the Piceance.
And I'd say the WPZ midstream and gas pipeline assets are well capitalized with a very low cost of capital. So we
really don't see too much in the way of corporate capital moving back into that business for the foreseeable future.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: Okay. Thank you very much.

We'll move on to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: Hey, good morning, everybody. And also, I'd like to throw in my congratulations, Steve, you and
Alan. Alan, actually let me ask a question just on the Marcellus with respect to projects, with the curve coming down,
the conversations with 40-some-odd producers, I guess, continuing, should we think about these as more incremental
projects or do you still see sort of more Laurel Mountain-ish type of potential, singular, large-scale projects that may
come over the end zone sometime in 2011, for instance?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: Well, certainly we are pursuing those that
give us a large scale position up there and I've got pretty high hopes that we'll be able to deliver on something of similar
nature to what we had in the Laurel Mountain area. On top of that, however, there are a tremendous amount of those

producers that we are talking to that in-fill into those assets that we're developing. And things like the Laurel Mountain
JV and other alternatives up in the Northeast Pennsylvania area we think are going to give us first-mover advantage
that allows to serve those remaining producers that we are talking to. So we're out there aggressively pursuing large
anchor customers and we will be in a position to better serve the balance of those customers.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: Okay. So the back end of the curve coming down hasn't necessarily eliminated or drastically slowed
down talks around these large scale projects then, just to confirm?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: I'm sorry. I think we dropped you there for
just a moment.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: Just paraphrasing what you said there, it doesn't sound like the back end of the curve coming down,
again, because of just the better marginal returns in the Marcellus, doesn't sound like that has necessarily jettisoned or
eliminated the potential for large-scale projects in the Marcellus?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: Marcellus is well positioned to survive a
very low gas price environment and we are certainly not seeing any signs of people backing off in the most prime parts
of the Marcellus.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: Fair enough. Maybe if I could kind of go further north to Redwater, what do you think has to
happen? The returns are there, clearly, given all the rhetoric we've seen in the Congress and the left on the
environmental with the oil sands. There seems to be a lot of driving factors that would continue to get you guys more
business up there. What has to happen to kind of break that logjam?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: Well, I would just tell you that the process
of negotiating – these are very long-term – obviously, those reserves are extremely long-life, and so the contracts for
them are fairly complex because they are meant to be very enduring. And so it just takes a while to get through the
contracting stage, but we are making very good progress on those fronts and look forward to making some
announcements on that in the not-too-very-distant future. So don't assume lack of us announcing anything as lack of
progress. We've got actually quite a bit of progress that's gone on in the last quarter there.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: I appreciate those comments. And maybe one other question, if I could, for Ralph, recognizing this
is always a bit of a moving target, but in conjunction with the back-end of the curve coming down, as you guys are
looking to potentially deploy more capital outside of the Rockies, what should we think about what you guys are using
for sort of a long-term clearing price of oil and gas? Should we be using the strip? Or if you guys were to, say, for
instance, deploy $1 billion somewhere, what do we take as far as, boy, this is where they ultimately think gas and oil
prices are going to trend out in the, call it, 2020 area, for instance?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Well, we have, obviously, several things we do. We have a point of view that – past 2012, we
haven't published. We also have the market that we look at closely and we monitor what's going on in the market at all
times. And then we run low cases and we run high cases and we run stress cases. So I'm sorry, I can't give you an exact
answer because we run a number of cases. We – typically, our point of view, from time to time is pretty close to what
the market is doing. That just happens to – it's just the way it works out. But we look at so many different scenarios, it's
hard to tell you exactly. But I can tell you, when we do look at all of these, we severely stress test them to understand
what it means in a low-priced environment, both for the gas side and the oil side.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: Okay, thank you.

And we will move on to our next question from Jonathan Lefebvre with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Jonathan Lefebvre>: Thanks. And let me start by congratulating Steve in his retirement and Alan as well. Just –
most of my questions have been touched, just wanted to ask, with the announcement to sell the midstream assets to PZ,
it sounds like you want to deploy capital into more E&P assets. How do you weigh that against potentially doing a

share repurchase?
<A - Don Chappel>: This is Don. I would say, we are looking at capital redeployments at very attractive after-tax rates
of return, using kind of the price scenario that Ralph laid out with, we think, a reasonable view of prices and then also
stress testing that and say, how bad could it be and would we still earn a return that was worthwhile? And if we have
terrific opportunities and particularly if we can do so in a way that broadens our footprint and perhaps also broadens
our commodity mix, that would be interesting to us. In terms of stock buyback, I think our view to date has been, in this
very low-priced environment and with a very uncertain economy, we just really don't have much in the way of
firepower to buy back stock without facing ratings downgrade. So we've – as Alan said, all the options are on the table,
we continue to look at all of the options. But today, we've not chosen to go down that path. But again, as Alan
indicated, we continue to look at all the options and we'll do that whenever we make a decision on redeploying that
capital.
<Q - Jonathan Lefebvre>: But if I hear you correctly, the preference is for – to do an E&P acquisition versus share
buybacks?
<A - Don Chappel>: Well, I think – clearly, we think that the share price is an attractive one, but we certainly don't
want to face a downgrade in order to do that because that has broader implications. So we'll look at the options, we'll
look at the potential consequences and benefits and make a decision that we think is in the best interest of the company
and the shareholders.
<Q - Jonathan Lefebvre>: Understood. Thanks very much for the time.

Our next question comes from Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen Maresca>: Hey, good morning, everybody. And Steve, also I'd like to wish you a thorough enjoyment
of your retirement.
<A - Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.
<Q - Stephen Maresca>: So a couple of questions. You've obviously got cash on this drop-down and I know you've
discussed – Niobrara under-review, Bakken, Eagle Ford evaluating, how imminent is something, how available are
properties in these areas, some color on that maybe?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Well, this is Ralph. I wouldn't comment at all on the imminent side of the world, but I can tell you
that there – as you probably know, there are a number of opportunities in all of these basins. There always are, but there
appear to be more than normal at this time. So there is just a lot of opportunities here. But as Don has said, as Steve has
said, and Alan has said, there are a number of things we take into account when we look at that. And so we evaluate
continuously, my group and the rest of the groups here at Williams, opportunities. We see when we think it creates
value, we bring it to the table and we talk about it and we try to see if that's something we want to do. So there is just a
lot out there right now, but there typically is in this industry.
<Q - Stephen Maresca>: Okay. And then looking at your guidance, I don't think you changed production guidance for
this year, which would sort of imply pretty significant sequential growth in the fourth quarter to third quarter. One, am I
accurate in looking at it that way? And I guess, two, what would be driving that?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Well, it's just the – it's really – yes, you are accurate in looking at that way. And it's just – we've
arrested the decline that we had. When you're coming off of, for example, 28 rigs in the Piceance and you're going
down to – what we went down to was 10, and now we're at 12. That's a huge decline that you overcome when you just
look at the way these type sand wells come on and/or any kind of wells that we drill now. So we've overcome that
decline from the number of rigs that we dropped. And now that we've have done, the volumes are starting to tweak

back up. I see, we had a 2% growth, I believe, company-wide, sequentially in the third quarter versus the second
quarter. I think Piceance itself is up 5%. So the big driver would be the Piceance and then also we have the new basin
where we're starting to get a little traction on in the Marcellus. But you are seeing it correctly that we have arrested the
decline. We are actually growing again and we'd expect a decent growth in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Stephen Maresca>: Okay. And then my final question is, so you updated guidance from a month ago, growth
CapEx went up at WPZ and obviously some of that has to do with this recent drop, is there anything else that was
added in the past month or is it all because of the new assets coming in?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: We do have some – there's some additional
capital in there from the midstream side associated with a more rapid expansion of our Laurel Mountain system, and so
that's one of the primary drivers of the addition of capital.
<Q - Stephen Maresca>: Okay, okay. All right, well, thanks a lot, guys. And, again best of luck, Steve. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Hi, good morning. Steve, congratulations on your retirement and we wish you all the best here.
<A - Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Alan, on the liquids volumes for the third quarter, they were down sequentially versus the second
quarter, can you comment on any outages or what was going on there maybe [inaudible]?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: Sure. Really there was two primary issues
there that did affect. And you're right, there was actually a fairly substantial reduction in our equity balance. First of all,
in the Mobile Bay area, we had Exxon who is the big producer into Mobile Bay, had some outages on one of their
offshore pipelines, completely unrelated to the drilling moratorium that reduced input coming into the plant
substantially. In addition to that, though, we also – the way those contracts work, they have rights to take their liquids
for a certain number of months out of the year, and it just so happened that two of those that piled up, their option piled
up in this quarter. It's actually our election, and so with their outage, we elected to give them the liquids in that period
where there was an outrage. So that was by far the largest. And then out west, we had a reduction related to a force
majeure that we got from ONEOK at their Bushton fractionator and that backed up all of our plants in the west. They
had some difficulties maintaining – with the volumes ramping up so rapidly, coming out of the west, they've had some
difficulty keeping their infrastructure out in front of that, and that resulted in a force majeure that did impact our
western volume.
So all in all, we are really well positioned right now with our Echo plant being now up, which just really got spending
here in September – towards the end of September and we've gotten the – some of the line problems resolved that we
had on the Perdido tie-in which were affecting our Markham volumes as well. So going into the fourth quarter here, we
are really well positioned to get back on track on our liquids production and grow that pretty rapidly.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, great. On the E&P side, Ralph, at any point in time, when you look at the price, have you
looked at shutting in production?
<A - Ralph Hill>: We've done that a little bit last year and that primarily is in the Powder. And so we look at it from
time to time, but we are – at this point, we are not contemplating any of that. We are about 56% to 60% hedged. We
have a number of things that go into that if you are shutting in that complicate that. So it needs to be more than a – it
would need to be for a substantial period of time. We don't see any reason to do that.

<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, got you. And as you look at these kind of more liquids rich opportunities, do you think that
given all the transactions that are taking place, the prices are too high or do you think they are still reasonable?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Well, it depends on where you are looking and if you are in the sweet spots or not. But we think –
generally, we think we know where the market is in our area of interest. We feel we know what it takes to win in
certain areas. So to the extent that we find something we think from a technical standpoint that hits our sweet spot, then
I think that's when we'd look to try to move something forward. So some of these transactions are out there, it's hard to
say which ones are good or bad, but we look at it first from the technical standpoint. If our exploration team likes it, our
engineer likes it, it hits in what we evaluate as what we call the sweet spot, then that's something we'll be more
aggressive at looking at than other fringe areas.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, got you. And then with the write-down that you guys took, is there going to be any impact
to DD&A or reserves?
<A - Ralph Hill>: We don't – the reserves report will come out at the end of the year. The reserves are based on a
different thing. The reserves are basically on the average of the first month prices for 12 months and the gas prices this
year are higher than last year if you average that in. So that's not really an impact on reserves. On DD&A, yes, we do
see an impact. Our DD&A, it's probably going to go down about $0.10 to $0.15 company-wide for 2011 and about
$0.10 again in 2012. That has been baked into the guidance. What it basically is, as you see previous guidance, at that
time we owned what we call the Piceance gathering assets. We also call that bar gas. We own those. They were
previously in our guidance. Now, it's out of our guidance, but we did get some DD&A pick up on the other side. So in
general, we see our guidance didn't really change. They kind of offset each other.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, got you. Last question on upstream. I know that you guys put a couple of slides into your
data book on Apco Argentina, specifically I guess some of the exploration plays you have in Colombia. Is that – are
those sort of prospects pretty substantial or how are you guys looking at that?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Well, the activity around us, the other operators around us said they've had great successes there. So
we bought into those concessions. We are excited that in one of them, we'll start drilling next year and the other one
we're still doing seismic on. But the operators in that area have done very, very well. So we think it's time to make sure
everybody understands that we have interest in those areas.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.

We will take our next question from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Good morning, guys. Congratulations to Steve and Alan, both of you.
<A - Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Most of my questions have actually been answered at this point. But Ralph, I know it's still very
early in the Marcellus for you guys, but you've outlined some particular areas in your presentation. Can you just talk
about well results to date? I know you've referenced in the slides, your best wells being the Westmoreland County. So
can you just kind of talk about that from a bigger picture standpoint?
<A - Ralph Hill>: The Westmoreland County area, and again, we took over operations just a few months ago, but what
we are seeing in the first handful – or the first several wells there is that 90 day flows in some of the areas are still
above, are at the 3.5 million a day type flow. So that's – we are impressed with that. We like that. So we're just still
learning, understanding. But we like all of the areas we are in. And obviously, we are excited to do a lot more in
Susquehanna County. We are only running one rig up there now and, obviously, we will have some completions that
we are backing up because of the delay in the Laser Pipeline.

But in general, all the – Clearfield, Westmoreland and Centre Counties are doing very well. Westmoreland is doing
slightly better. And I think Susquehanna, as you know, will do much better than any of those once we get there. So we
are excited that we've brought in a different-purpose Patterson rig. We've brought in a rig from H&P for the Rockies.
So we are happy to have at least two of those rigs that are different purpose. We've contracted for some more. And
again, it's just kind of like what we see. It happened in the Piceance. When you get the right crews, the right equipment,
and given the opportunity to move it into more of a scale operation, we think the efficiencies will come like we have
seen in the Piceance.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Any test rates on the Susquehanna Wells?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Not from us. We are intermixed with, for example, Cabot and others and you've seen their results
and we are right in the middle of all of that. So we're anxious to have that when that comes on. And hopefully, Laser's
going to come on in mid next year, and so we'll start completing before that and have some good results for you.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay. And given the delays that you've seen with Laser and then your pullback in capital, what's
your kind of expected timeframe now to achieve this goal of the Marcellus being the second largest producing basin for
you guys?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Well, we said that would happen by – I think within this – when we gave that kind of our
longer-term forecast, which I think went through 2015, and based on the 4 rigs averaging in the Marcellus, going up to
2012. We currently have a build up to 10 rigs and then it goes up a little bit after that. We still can easily make that in
the next four years or so.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Next four years. Okay, and then finally just from an integrated model standpoint, how can that
help you, I guess, alleviate these delays you're seeing in the Marcellus from an infrastructure standpoint?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Well, at this time, the only delay we really have is with Laser. And we've got our other facilities in,
what we call, the [inaudible] compressor station, and [inaudible] facilities in the other areas in Clearfield County and
Westmoreland. They are in good shape. The Laser is not a part of us or our midstream group. So that doesn't help us in
that particular area. However, as you know, Laurel Mountain has got a – they're really more the outlet to the south
that's out there. As LMM continues to grow and expand, maybe there's opportunities in the future, who knows for
consolidations and that would be great if LMM would be out there being a consolidator and being able to take over
some of those things.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: But you feel like you're pretty set in terms of – you're growing production or you're anticipating
growing production in a pretty meaningful way here in the Marcellus. So you feel like you're pretty set from an
infrastructure standpoint over the next couple of years?
<A - Ralph Hill>: We think we will be. Yes.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay, great. Thanks guys.

Our next question comes from Kevin Smith with Raymond James.
<Q - Kevin Smith>: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. What do you think your kind of rates of return right now are on the
Piceance Valley and the Highlands on the drill bit?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: We are showing – in the Piceance Valley,
we believe our returns are – I'll just give you a range, 35% to 40%. And in the Highlands, they are more mid to upper
teens, 17%, 18% type returns. In Highlands, next year, all we are going to drill at this point will be in the Ryan Gulch
area. Obviously, we pulled back capital. So those returns are primarily focused in the Ryan Gulch, although that still is

kind of a combination of what we would call Ryan Gulch, Trail Ridge well. So Ryan Gulch, we have a slightly higher
net. The number I gave you in the upper teens is really kind of a hybrid of the Trail Ridge and Ryan Gulch.
<Q - Kevin Smith>: Okay. And so are you going to be having enough activity right now in the Highlands to keep
production flat and then slightly grow it in the Valley, is that the right way to look at it?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Well, the Valley will clearly grow and the Highlands has been growing. The Highlands will – it will
be a challenge to keep it flat, but it seems we probably would need to – with two rigs, it'll be tight, we may need to –
we may see some decline in the Highlands.
<Q - Kevin Smith>: Okay. And outside the Marcellus, is there any other areas you're expecting to actually grow
production or to grow production, sorry?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Production generally will be flat in the San Juan. It will be slightly declining in the Barnett.
<Q - Kevin Smith>: Okay.
<A - Ralph Hill>: We have a number of completions we're backed up on in the Barnett that will keep that, so it can
remain – it will go down, but it won't go down by as much you think by dropping to one rig.
<Q - Kevin Smith>: Okay. Are we still seeing take-away activity backed up in the Barnett or are they just kind of
timing of when you decide to do the projects?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Really, Barnett is much more of a permitting side of the world basically, which is somewhat strange.
It's on the compression facilities and on water facilities.
<Q - Kevin Smith>: Okay.
<A - Ralph Hill>: It's not to take away capacity for us as much as it is on just permits in some of the area we operate
in. I'm trying to – what we think it's the best practice to build centralized water facilities and larger compression areas
just to be more efficient.

dispositions at all? Does it make sense to maybe exit the Barnett Shale and redeploy cash flow elsewhere?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Yes, I think we look at all options like that, and that is an option that's out there. It depends on
what's going on in the marketplace, but the Barnett has been frustrating simply from a standpoint of – a lot of what we
saw was the – just a complete delay and the opportunity to get the facilities we needed to – it wasn't the drilling permits
– it was just actually get the facilities done to get our gas to market, and that caused a chain link – or a chain reaction
and losing value.
<Q - Yves Siegel>: Did you have discretion in terms of the timing of the write-down? Could you have waited until
year-end to do that or was it something that you were required to do at this time?
<A - Ralph Hill>: Well, it's something we're required to do. They're really – and in this aspect, it's something we
actually look at all the time. And in the last year's Q, we basically talked about – there are certain triggers we would
look at. One would be if the forward market price – again, this is a forward market price, where like '20, '25 would have
them declined by more than 20%. We would have to take a look at this and it did. But we look at it every quarter
anyway. But for this particular quarter, the forward market price is down substantially. And it's just an automatic check;

there is no – we don't have the opportunity to pick when we want to do that.
<Q - Yves Siegel>: And then if I could, just two other quick ones. Do you have an opinion on using shale plays as
storage type of facilities at all? Do you have an opinion on that one way or the other?
<A - Ralph Hill>: This is Ralph, I do not. I don't know if any other team does here.
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: No.
<A - Ralph Hill>: No.
<Q - Yves Siegel>: Okay. That was just an off-the-wall question. And then the last question is, when you look at
potential growth CapEx, it looks like there's a real big chunk of opportunity in the Gulf of Mexico. Could you elaborate
on how you think about that going forward?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: Sure. A lot of continued opportunity out
there, it keeps – the Canyon area continues to be a very active area and certainly underserved from an infrastructure
standpoint. And we think we are very well positioned to capture some of that business out there, and as well continuing
to grow the infrastructure out of the Eastern Gulf area out of our Devils Tower facility as well. So we continue to see a
lot of opportunity out there. And our Gulf Star generic platform basically that is now well designed and really ready to
be deployed, we think can add a tremendous amount of value to producers out there and we're continuing to have a lot
of interest in that. I think all of it has to really change out there and I'm not predicting how rapidly this will change, but
I do think that what's going to be required is for the producers to gain confidence that even though the moratorium is
lifted, that permits will actually be processed in a timely basis in and in a reasonable fashion. And I think everybody is
waiting to see on that front. But if that does happen, then there is tremendous resource out there and it's going to need a
lot of infrastructure and we are very well positioned to serve that.
<Q - Yves Siegel>: And just from the realization of cash flow, is that a long lead time? Would you be able to do it
incrementally or would there be a big lag between dollars invested and the start of incremental cash?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: Yes. I think generally from the time that
we really start investing dollars on many of those projects and the time we've got cash flow is about the smaller projects
that maybe be a year-and-a-half in the longer projects would be three years. So to answer to your question, yes, in terms
of that capital, those large capital dollars being deployed. However, as you know, where we've got infrastructure
already there and production gets tied into that, that comes on pretty rapidly for us, and so there is a mix of that. But in
terms of the capital, those large chunks of capital that you see in our potential pie there, most of that would be probably
in the 2.5 year range from the time we would be investing heavily to the time we would see cash flows come back.
<Q - Yves Siegel>: Got it. Thanks very much.
<A - Alan Armstrong, President, Midstream Gathering & Processing>: This is Don. On your impairment question,
I'd just remind everyone that in 2008, 2009, many, many companies across the industry took very large write-downs.
So we did not. So while we took a write-down this quarter, we haven't had any large write-downs back in the '08, '09
period when many, many other write-downs were taken.
<A - Ralph Hill>: Yes. Don, just to follow-up on that, of the 20 peers that we track, I believe they took write-downs of
approximately $52 billion over those two years.

Well, thanks for tuning in. We are excited about the future. The best of class assets, the strong balance sheet, significant
inventory of growth opportunities, and talented and dedicated workforce we think will translate into significant
shareholder value growth in the future. So thank you very much. Bye.
