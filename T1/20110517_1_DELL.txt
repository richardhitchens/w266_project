Now I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Rob. We're pleased with the progress we're making in advancing our strategy and the impact it's having on the
company's results. More than a year ago, we committed to a growth strategy based on delivering efficient and flexible
IT solutions for the virtual era. This strategy is built around two primary objectives: accelerating our investment in
enterprise solutions and services; and improving our execution in our core client business.
Over the past several quarters, you've seen us execute on our commitment to build, develop, and grow our solutions
capabilities. These include organic and inorganic investments in storage, services, security, and systems management.
As we transition to more Dell owned IP, we're selling higher value and more differentiated products. And we're having
deeper conversations with our customers about their technology challenges and opportunities.
We're seeing significant trends like driving better product mix to Dell storage offerings and higher margins for value
sold in our services, server, and networking offerings. As such, we're capturing a growing share in the faster growing
segments of the IT profit pool.
Today, our client business is radically improved from where it was three years ago when we first moved into retail and
began our transition to more contract manufacturing. We're seeing significantly improved profitability across our client,
desktop, and mobility business that would have not been possible without the concerted efforts of our procurement,
global operations product organizations to reduce cost across the value chain and simplify and improve our product
offerings. We're also selling a higher value client portfolio and seeing improved sales execution across the company.
These strategic initiatives coupled with our focus on intellectual property, product innovation, and differentiation are
driving our business results. Our gross margins and operating income margins have improved across our lines of
business and in each of the four customer segments. We're pleased with our progress in the strategy, but recognize that
we still have a lot of work to do. We think our first quarter results again demonstrate the profound changes we are
driving in the company as we execute on our long-term value creation commitments.
So let's review our first quarter results. Key performance metrics are provided for your reference on pages five and six
in the web deck.
Revenue in the first quarter was $15 billion, up 1% year over year and down 4% sequentially. Our enterprise solutions
and services business grew 5% to $4.4 billion. While we did see strong growth in several key areas this quarter, like the
small and medium business, Asia-Pacific-Japan, and our server business, our overall revenue was slightly weaker than
our outlook as we saw slower growth from our consumer business and some budget related timing weakness in the
public sector.
We gained or held revenue and profit share in most of our key customer segments and product verticals, maintaining a
healthy balance of profitable revenue growth across the business. And we continue to believe that profit share is more
important than unit share.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.2 billion or 8.1% of revenue. And we delivered earnings per share of
$0.49. Earnings per share was up 188% year over year and 2% sequentially.

For the rest of the call, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures.
We delivered 23.4% gross margins, driven by continued, solid supply chain execution, a shift of product mix to Dell IP
and higher value products, and continued component cost declines. Pricing discipline also remains key for us as we
continue to prune and eliminate lower margin business that is not accretive to the company.
OpEx was $2.1 billion or 14.2% of revenue. We continue to invest in all the areas that will benefit Dell for the long
term and shift to a more specialized sales force. Enterprise product specialists now make up nearly 30% of our sales
spend. Moreover, our R&D spend has shifted dramatically over the past two years to favor enterprise solutions and
services versus client R&D.
Operating income grew 67% to $1.4 billion or 9.2% of revenue. We continue to focus on areas with accretive margins
and make appropriate tradeoffs to trim lower margin business and put business in places like S&P and our storage
portfolio. All of our segments showed improved operating leverage in the quarter. The commercial segment as a whole
delivered 11.1% operating income, representing a 340 basis point increase from the previous year. And we achieved
our second quarter in a row of record operating profit in our large enterprise and small and medium businesses.
Interest and other expenses were $42 million, driven by approximately $60 million in quarterly interest and offset by
investment income.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.3%, driven by an increase in earnings attributable to lower tax jurisdictions.
Earnings per share increased 83% year over year to $0.55 per share.
In the quarter, we generated $465 million in cash flow from operations and have now delivered $4.2 billion in the
trailing four quarters. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 31 days. Working capital and our cash conversion
cycle were adversely impacted by a reduction in our days payable, which is driven by a slight shift in production and
procurement linearity and seasonal buying patterns. Days inventory increased by one day due to strategic purchases of
commodities. We expect our cash conversion cycle should move back to mid-negative 30s over the course of the year.
We ended the quarter with $15.2 billion in cash and investments. And in the quarter, we repurchased $450 million
worth of stock.
Now let's take a look at our lines of business and regional performance, which you'll find on pages 11 through 15 in the
deck. Enterprise solutions and services revenue grew 5% to $4.4 billion, driven by solid performance in servers and
services. Server and networking revenue grew 11%, with commercial services revenue increasing 6%. Demand for
blades and networking was up 23% and 32% respectively. This quarter, we also launched our vStart offering to provide
customers with fully configured virtual machines.
Our storage business declined 13% year over year, mainly due to declining revenue of EMC products. However,
Dell-owned intellectual property, which now includes Compellent, EqualLogic, PowerVault, and DX Object Storage,
grew 11% in the quarter.
We're pleased with our acquisition of Compellent and the strong pipeline it has developed in the 2.5 months that we've
owned the business. Our fiber channel opportunity with Compellent is now larger than where we were a year ago with
EMC, and we're confident in the growth plans that we have for this business.
Dell Services revenue grew 5% to $2 billion. Transactional support revenue grew 5% and was mostly attributable to
attach-based services sold to our commercial customers. Outsourcing revenue grew 3%. The total contract value of new
contracts signed over the past 12 months was $1 billion. Following a year of elongated sales cycles, we're now
beginning to see a progression in our sales pipeline and a greater number of deals coming to closure.
Project and consulting revenue grew by 13%, with infrastructure, applications, and business process projects all
delivering double-digit growth.
Our services backlog is now $14.1 billion, and is split between $6.9 billion in deferred services revenue and $7.2
billion in contracted services backlog.

Turning to client, we continue to see the corporate refresh play out as expected, with client revenue in large enterprise
up 7% while SMB grew 1%. Overall client hardware revenues fell 2% to $8 billion, driven by weakness in public and
consumer, which were down 10% and 5% respectively.
Software and peripherals grew 3% to $2.6 billion and represent 17% of our revenue now. We have significantly
improved the profitability in our S&P business over the past few quarters and continue to exit portions of this business
where margin rates and returns are unacceptable.
Geographically, revenue in APJ and EMEA grew 15% and 1% respectively, while revenue in the Americas was down
3%.
Taking a further look between growth markets in developed countries, growth markets outside the U.S. and Canada,
Western Europe, and Japan now account for 27% of our revenue, and they grew 17% over the previous year. BRIC
countries grew 18%, with India up 28% and China up 22%.
Turning to our segment level performance on pages 16 through 20, in our large enterprise, public, and SMB segments
combined, revenue grew 3% to $12 billion. The combination of these segments delivered $1.3 billion in operating
income or 11.1% of revenue, and was up 340 basis points from the previous year.
Our small and medium business had a very strong revenue and profit quarter. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 7% to the
highest level in two years, driven by strong demand across all product lines. Servers and storage revenue were up 19%
and 7% respectively, while our client hardware grew revenue up 1%. We delivered operating income of $463 million or
12.3% of revenue.
As we moved through the quarter, consumer demand was weaker than we had anticipated. For the quarter, consumer
revenue was down 7% to $3.0 billion and down 8% sequentially. Even as revenue decelerated, our profit improved
significantly. And we delivered $136 million in operating income and a 4.5% operating profit rate. Keys to this
progress include a new, simplified brand strategy and improved products, a shift to higher value products, a better mix
of profitable retail, and structural and component cost improvements in our supply chain.
Now I'll turn it over to Paul Bell to discuss our public and large enterprise performance
Paul D. Bell
Thanks, Brian. I'll start by echoing Brian's comments on our strategy. As we continue to innovate and bring
differentiated IP to our portfolio, our business is more solutions focused than ever before. Our solutions feature designs
that are open, capable, and affordable, all attributes that provide customers with tangible benefits around efficiency and
flexibility.
This is important because our dialogue with customers these days is especially focused on productivity and efficiency
of IT. For instance, in our public business, budget cuts dampened spend on the client refresh. However, the same
budget issues are having the opposite effect on server consolidation, virtualization, efficient IT services, anything that
can drive structural cost reduction for customers given the budget challenges they're facing. Simply put, customers
everywhere are looking to do more with less money while at the same time capturing resources to focus on innovation
for their users and their customers.
This is where Dell's new solutions begin to resonate with customers in an overall cost level. When we say Compellent
requires nearly 50% less disk capacity versus traditional SANs, where security can be managed as a service via
SecureWorks, or we offer multi-vendor support and can do so remotely, then customers really begin to listen. They've
known Dell for open, capable, and affordable offerings in hardware systems for over two decades now. And they're
very receptive when they see the same value proposition brought to bear in their core enterprise infrastructure.
Second, none of our enterprise expansion would be possible without the investments we're making to enhance our sales
and solutions delivery capabilities. Over the past year, we've added more than 5,000 growth resources, a 50:50 split

between additional sales resources and engineers dedicated to the development of enterprise solutions and services.
Third, we're sustaining our flow of organic and inorganic investments. Following a string of enterprise acquisitions,
we've announced last month our expansion organically into building out new customer data centers and solution
centers. Our multi-quarter initiatives are evident to our customers. They know our commitment is real. They know
we're going to sustain it. And they're giving us the right to play as we design new products and services for them.
Turning back to our business unit results in Q1, we maintained pricing discipline and drove a strong mix in enterprise
and services business, resulting in year-on-year operating income growth of 24% in public and 78% in large enterprise.
Our public revenue was down 2% to $3.8 billion. We continue to see a mixed demand environment here, with budget
challenges both in the U.S. and in Western Europe, but with strong growth in Asia. Enterprise solutions and services
revenue was up 3%, while total client was down 10%. Overall public operating income was $370 million and improved
210 basis points to 9.8% of revenue. In large enterprise, segment revenue was up 5% to $4.5 billion, led by an ongoing
hardware refresh. Client revenue was up 7% and server growth was up 6%. OpInc as a percentage of revenue improved
460 basis points to $504 million or 11.3% of revenue.
Overall, the public and large enterprise business represents about 55% of Dell's revenue and about 60% of the
company's operating income. As our solutions focus gathers momentum, we have a big opportunity to drive an even
larger contribution in future quarters.
Now let me turn it back over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Paul. So let's turn to our outlook. As we think about revenue for the second quarter, our public business will
benefit from stronger spending among state and local governments and education as they close out their fiscal years.
We also see our SMB and consumer businesses experiencing above average seasonality due to solid demand for Dell
Sandy Bridge based offerings, which are now widely available, good consumer back-to-school spending, and a
refreshed portfolio of XPS products. In total, we expect mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth in the second
quarter, which is slightly above normal sequential growth of 2% to 3%.
On the cost side, as we have been saying, the component cost environment has moderated, and the overall rate of
deflation is slowing as we move into the second and third quarters. Despite this inflection point, we're confident in our
sustainability of strong margins as we head into this environment.
On a quarterly basis, we anticipate interest and other to be around $70 million in expense.
On tax, we continue to experience a higher proportion of our earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, and we now expect our
full-year tax rate to be between 21% and 23%.
The commitment to our strategy is working. We continue to innovate and own Dell intellectual property. And our
teams are motivated to grow revenue, sustain pricing discipline and operating income growth, and deliver cash
earnings.
As we move through fiscal year '12, we expect improving demand dynamics in the markets that are critical for us. Our
strong commercial client business with continued refresh tailwind, coupled with our expanding enterprise mix with
strong demand for our Dell branded storage and services, and our significantly better positioned consumer business all
give us confidence that we can deliver on our revenue outlook of 5% to 9% growth.
In our outlook for the rest of the year, we're very excited about the ramp of Compellent and our growing services
pipeline, and believe Dell-owned storage and Dell Services are positioned for above-average industry growth. And in
servers, we continue to execute a move to more differentiated and higher value products that should continue to drive
above-market revenue and strong margin performance.

As you recall, our operating income growth outlook for the year was for 6% to 12% growth versus last year. Our strong
first quarter earnings results are a great start to the year. And we're now raising our total year operating income growth
outlook to 12% to 18%.
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.
Michael S. Dell
Thank you, Brian. We're off to a solid start in FY '12. Our substantial profit increase demonstrates that our strategy is
working and our execution is improving. As Brian said, we are laser focused on executing our strategy to drive efficient
and flexible enterprise solutions for the virtual era.
We're moving much more into the core of IT and into the data center, increasingly with our own intellectual property.
We fine-tuned our focus on three key solution domains: next generation computing solutions and intelligent data
management; services, security and cloud; and end user computing. Each of these solution domains represents key
areas where Dell has to win.
As a design principle, we're creating solutions that are open, capable, and affordable. This is an increasingly
differentiated position that customers love. We built a significant leadership position in servers, having sold around 15
million of them during the past decade. Now we're extending that strength further into storage and networking. In
servers, this quarter we launched vStart, which combines servers, storage, and networking and management software to
provide customers with hundreds of virtual machines that are pre-configured and ready to run.
In storage, we're really excited about our Compellent acquisition and the tremendous ramp and customer enthusiasm
we're seeing for our newest SAN solution. This quarter, we also launched our first NAS product based on our Exanet
architecture we acquired a year ago. Combined with our number one position in iSCSI storage, we are quickly
becoming a technology leader in intelligent data management. With our own IP, we expect this will continue to be a
source of expanding margins and profits.
In Services, Steve Schuckenbrock has refined our strategy, and you'll see we're focused on winning business where
Dell can lower the overall cost of service delivery. To get there, we're building out capabilities in multi-vendor support
and remote infrastructure management, security, and application management for the data center. We also launched an
initiative to invest $1 billion to add solutions focused resources to build out data centers and solution centers to help our
customers as they begin to migrate to private and public clouds.
As our results demonstrate, our strategy is working well. We have the strongest IT solutions in our history. And we
appreciate the trust and confidence our millions of customers place in Dell each day. We'll have more to share with you
about our strategy and the IT solutions we're creating at our meeting in June. We look forward to updating you all then
more on our progress.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Robert Williams
Thanks, Michael. Just a quick reminder to please limit your questions to one with one follow-up. Casey, can we have
the first question?

<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thank you. I'm just trying to understand how much of the gross margin strength is
sustainable even if we head into a stronger component headwind. Is there a way to quantify how much of the upside
was the component pricing environment versus the structural changes you have made?
And then my second question is on visibility on these larger contracts. Is it right to assume that the rollouts happen over
multiple quarters, so you do have some recurring nature to them; and if so, any sense of what percentage of your
enterprise refresh revenue might be viewed as recurring? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Thanks, Maynard. I'll take the first part, and then Paul can take a shot at the second one. This
is a similar conversation to what we had last quarter. We continue to be focused on driving operating income as the
priority. Again, we've seen pretty good improvement over the past three quarters. And in general, we're exceeding the
long-term value creation OpInc target that we talked about over the last two quarters. We're updating our outlook in
terms of the operating income growth for the year to 12 to 18%, which we think is pretty good progress. So there is
some sustainability and a track record here. We're focused on operating income. And again, this target is a 7% GAAP
number. So we've been leaning on profitable growth as the priority, and we've done that over the last few quarters. The
teams are focused on balancing that growth, again, with operating income and profitability and cash flow.
So we're not going to provide gross margin or OpEx guidance, and I don't intend to parse the individual elements of
that performance. But we've talked about progress on things like driving to higher value products and services with
stronger intellectual property. We've got simplification and cost activities going on in the product lines that we've
talked about for multiple quarters. And I would tell you that we feel pretty good about the progress in the supply chain
there. We're pruning and eliminating business that we're saying isn't strategic for the company. And then we've been
managing our pricing fairly well in terms of optimizing growth but also clearly leaning on profitability, so a lot of
things that I would argue are sustainable. At the same time, it has been a good component environment, and we're
prepared for the change in the inflection point in terms of what component dynamics are going on right now. So that's
the view on margins. I'll let Paul talk about...
<A - Paul D. Bell>: Yes, there's no question that you have some very large engagements with major public or
corporate accounts spread over many quarters. We actually just won one a few weeks ago that will be for 600,000
client systems over multiple years, and clearly that would be recurring revenue. We think about it in terms of how we
stage that and execute that over multiple periods. But you have everything from that extreme down to pretty large
refreshes that might be done as one chunk in a quarter. So a lot of our large business is the kind that we can plan out for
overtly like that. There are others where we've contracts that give us the right to go sell over a period of time, and we're
pretty confident on win rates these days. So yes, there's a lot we have that helps us plan.
<A - Robert Williams>: Thanks, Maynard; next question?
Operator
Our next question will come from Richard Gardner with Citi Investment Research.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Thanks very much. Brian, you talked earlier about confidence in the sustainability of
"strong margins". Your 12% to 18% growth target, though, for non-GAAP operating income implies a deceleration
back to zero or negative growth in operating income during the back half of the year. And I just wanted to get a sense
of if that is indeed the way you're viewing the progression of the year, or whether you view the 12% to 18% number as
duly conservative for the year.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hi, Richard. I would just go back to – we're pleased with the first quarter, good results.
We've sustained pretty strong operating income levels for the past few quarters. And again, we're taking up the outlook
for the year. We're focused on driving to the 7% GAAP operating income target. Our outlook for the year implies
pretty dramatic improvement year over year for the total year towards these commitments. And we continue to focus on
balancing profitability with growth and cash flow as the priority.

So what I would say is it's early in the year. It's one quarter into it. We clearly have some uncertainty in the demand and
commodity cost environments. And we'll continue to monitor the environment and work to optimize within the
framework that we see in the environment. So in that context, we're still driving to these long-term value creation
targets.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. And then the follow-up, I guess, is which do you see? I guess it's a follow-up to
Maynard's question. Which do you see being a bigger factor as we progress throughout the year? It looks like you are
expecting operating profit margins to decline throughout the year. Is the bigger factor going to be the component
environment, or is it going to be a conscious decision on your part to reinvest some of this margin that's above your
longer-term target back into higher growth rates? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Again, I think it's a balance of trying to optimize given what the environment gives us. The
targets we've given you clearly imply stronger revenue growth in the second half of the year. We're trying to balance
that equation, deliver strong profitability. Again, the 7% target is something we're focused on, and managing to get to
the 5% to 9% growth is clearly a priority as well. So I think we're going to manage that as an equation. It's not as
simple as commodity deflation or pricing. It's all one big equation around how we manage the business.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Thank you, a question for Brian on OpEx. We're up sequentially into Q1. And I recognize some
of that is Compellent, and some of it is additional value-add salespeople. But is there anything else going on there that
should be discussed?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Jayson, I wouldn't call it anything unusual. We've been saying for a while that the shape of
the P&L is going to change over time as we move to become more solutions oriented and enterprise products and
services become more central to the company. The investments that we're making are the things we've been talking
about: enterprise R&D, sales specialists, sales resources to drive the growth. I would say things like G&A, we're
working hard to basically hold those essentially flat as we move forward. So again, we're focused on operating income
growth. And with the margin improvements that we've seen, it has allowed us to really fund the strategic initiatives that
are longer term and focus on the profitability targets that we're talking about. So we'll continue to make those
investments, monitor the environment, and we'll adjust them as we see fit in managing to the operating income.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Is there anything you can say qualitatively on an absolute basis? Should we expect OpEx to be
flat to up off current levels?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: We're not going to provide either gross margin OpEx guidance specifically. But as we see
strong profitability in the business, we're going to continue to invest for the future.

Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I have one and a follow-up, please. Regarding your revenue guidance, as
you mentioned, Brian, you're expecting a pretty dramatic acceleration in the second half. If I take the midpoint of your
revenue guidance at 7%, I get your second half revenue growing 12.5% over your first half. You haven't done that in
eight years, that kind of growth rate. So can you talk a little bit about what you see as unique factors in the second half?
You highlighted Compellent, but it's simply not big enough, quite frankly. So what is it that you see either about Dell's
initiatives or about the market environment that leads you to, at least recently, a pretty unprecedented acceleration in

revenue growth in the second half? And I have a follow up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Toni, I think as you think about 5% to 9%, clearly in that it has to be a stronger second half.
We expect that in general the market should improve over the course of the year. We also believe – and we have a
differentiated view around how we expect to exceed the market forecasts for demand growth, and that's not just around
client. Clearly, the client business is weighted more towards commercial versus consumer, where the growth is stronger
and clearly pricing and margins are stronger. The consumer business we think is in very good shape and well
positioned to grow and grow faster than the market, and particularly on higher value segments of that market with
higher revenue.
We're gaining revenue and profit share in key growth countries, which we think are growing in double digits clearly
around the world. There are investments that are going in and have been going in now for multiple quarters around
adding sales resources on the enterprise side of the business. And we, again, think that we can grow at above-market
rates there with more capacity on the sales side. The server growth is driven by good position in blades, DCS. And
moving to higher value offerings and a higher revenue per box in the server space is good progress. Storage is a bit of a
mixed bag. Clearly, we have pressure versus – given the EMC deterioration of revenue. But again, as you know, the
Dell-owned IP is growing – should grow faster than the market and is going to be higher margins for us as well.
And then services, we've talked about this in the past. It has the benefit of the dynamic with the growing deferred
balance that's accelerating here. And that will affect the support services. And the pipeline in outsourcing services looks
pretty good. So I think it's important that you put a different lens on the company as you think about revenue growth
and recognize that the portfolio is increasingly more diverse and that we have several places that we think we can grow
faster than the market and impact the overall revenue growth rate for the year.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Okay, thank you for that. I also wanted to ask about cash usage. You significantly
accelerated your share repurchases this quarter. I think you had been doing about $200 million a quarter for several
quarters. And that was up to $450 million this quarter despite the fact that your cash balance was lower, or certainly
your ending cash balance was considerably lower. Can you talk about whether that was opportunistic given your stock
price, or whether you're getting more confidence in your business outlook, and we should be thinking about this level
of repurchases as a more sustained level on a go-forward basis?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Toni, I would say we haven't changed our capital allocation strategy that we've been
communicating. We're still prioritizing investments, organic and inorganic investments, that are in line with the
strategy that we've been talking about. Clearly M&A is an important part of that. CapEx is up this year, as you know.
Those are things that are prioritized. We've said, I think, that we would use between 10% and 30% of our free cash
flow for buyback activities. That's where we are for the quarter, and we're not really going to provide guidance around
where we go with the buyback from here.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Yes, I'm just struggling a little bit to understand how the mix can be having such a
pronounced effect on your consolidated operating margins. Just looking at Dell's overall performance, operating
margins are up over 350 basis points, which is incredible. But your enterprise solutions mix has only increased to 30%
from 28%, I think, year over year, which isn't that dramatic.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: So if I drill down on the mix shifts within the customer segments, there also doesn't
appear to be such a dramatic mix shift towards enterprise. So can you just explain what I might be missing here?
Because it doesn't seem like the mix is footing with the margin improvement in enterprise.

<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, clearly, mix is one of the drivers. And it's clearly where we're focused in terms of
strategically driving the company. But the reality is for us to drive that sort of improvement in profitability, margins
have to go up across the portfolio, and that's what's happening. So driving the higher value products and services and
solutions across every segment of the business is what's happening here. And the mix is helping to contribute to that,
but it's profitability generally going up everywhere.
<A - Paul D. Bell>: Yes, I would just add that specifically the way this has worked is we've had the opportunity to look
at what we're doing with each customer, their fundamental challenges, how we add more value, and look at how we'd
be the best partner across their whole IT spend. So this isn't just about the volume of units that we sell to each
customer. It's how we add the most value and there's a mix shift within. Even in the client business, we've seen a faster
growth in our revenue than units as we have really delivered with our latest generation some real competitively
differentiated client products. And so we're moving to the higher end of the price range and getting more value out of
that, and that is playing out across other types of products and services. So it's more mix within the lines of business
than you described rather than across the lines of business.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: That's helpful. Just to follow up, it sounds like you guys are fairly bullish on the
commercial PC refresh cycle. But if I add up the client business within your commercial segments, it looks like the
client business within commercial is flat year over year. So I just wanted to clarify that and just understand that a little
bit better. If you're bullish on commercial PCs, why was that flat year over year?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think the client business in commercial was actually up, I think, 5%. So it's clear the area
that – it's up 5% on a revenue basis across the business in the quarter; so it is clearly differentiated versus the consumer
space, and we continue to feel good about the refresh as we look out over the course of the next multiple quarters. Paul,
refresh?
<A - Paul D. Bell>: Yes, we're back to solid growth in IT spending, which puts you into IT budgets growing in the
mid-single digits. We had very pronounced growth in commercial last year as people were recovering from the depth of
the recession and starting to execute on the projects that they knew would have a good ROI. So when we see mid-single
digits growth and we see that as sustainable, that's saying that we're in a pretty solid environment. And it allows us to
work with our customers and pick the right deals, the ones where we can apply the pricing discipline, where we can add
real value. That isn't just selling them the hardware, but it's the total sale, the whole Win 7 migration, or helping them
implement applications that are going to be important for the next generation of their products. That picking and
choosing allows us to ride what is a solid refresh cycle and make sure we're driving strong margins.
<A - Robert Williams>: Yes, and then, Brian, this is Rob. Just to clarify that point a little bit, our total client business
was up 5% year over year. If you actually look out within the commercial and public businesses, and I don't want to
break out every single one of those businesses, but for example in our large enterprise business, notebooks were up
16% year on year. If you look at the public businesses, as you know, there were some timing related items there that we
talked about on the call. So we did have negative in both desktops and notebooks in the public business. But then in
SMB, both desktops and notebooks did grow year over year. So you've got a little bit of a mix going on there public
versus commercial in there. But you're definitely still seeing some signs of a refresh. Although clearly we're coming
down off of some pretty phenomenal rates two or three quarters ago off of some very, very easy compares. So I think
Paul mentioned this earlier. We're back to somewhat of a more normalized refresh cycle as opposed to the accelerated
refresh cycle that we were seeing two to three quarters ago.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay, thanks for all the detail.

demand versus you guys still getting rid of some lower profitable business or pruning business, however you want to
phrase it?
And then on the operating profit, where are we in the improvement cycle in the consumer business? You have
obviously done an awesome job in the last two quarters, massive improvement. But where do you guys feel you are
with the whole getting standardized products and going to more boat versus air, et cetera? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: On the first one, there's still pruning going on. There's still refocusing the portfolio. There's
still a mix shift between regions around the world. There's clearly growth. We're seeing growth in the emerging
countries, and that's a place that we're focused on and will see continued growth. There are other places where we're
continuing to prune and focus our energy around higher margin, higher value products. So there's still quite a bit of that
going on. As we did say, the market itself is weaker than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. And that's just –
we've been talking about that for a year in terms of that general demand dynamic.
From a cost standpoint from a prioritization of activities within the portfolio, there's still work there to do. And as you
think about how much we've got on the water, as you think about product launches that we've got coming over the
course of the summer that will refresh much of the portfolio within consumer, a lot of that is going to be at higher
margins, improved focus on the higher price points and higher value products in that portfolio. So I think we've still got
quite a bit to do there. And we're encouraged by the progress. To be at this level of profitability with still that much
opportunity in front of us I think is encouraging. It allows us to appropriately manage that balance between growth and
margins as we move forward, hopefully.
<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. I was wondering if we could take a different tack on the gross margin
question. Based on my math, your outlook implies 7% operating margin for the remaining quarters on average. And I
guess my question is, what is sustainable about the improvements that you have done, if you can just reiterate those
again? And also, what isn't? Is there something maybe with sea shipping that maybe wears off? Is there something that
you saw in the quarter? Was there anything with certain accruals or anything that's not sustainable? Just to account for
the sequential drop-off, but also to offset that, what are the positives that keep it only at that rate? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Ben, I can't call out anything that I would call unusual or not an opportunity to continue to
drive sustaining improvement in margins. Clearly, the environment externally is something we have to continue to
watch and manage as you think about commodity pricing, which is clearly moderating, as you look at how the markets
play out in terms of overall demand, and as you look at pricing behavior in the marketplace.
So the things that we've talked about in terms of differentiated products and the new launches that are coming, a clear
focus and move to higher value products within and across the portfolio, execution that we've driven around contract
manufacturing, moving to more fixed configurations, continue to increase the number of fixed configuration client
products sold. Ocean shipment is still a big opportunity and frankly is a bigger opportunity with higher oil prices today,
and we continue to focus there. So clearly, those elements are generally repeatable. And then the reality, Ben, as you
know, is continued focus on expanding that services business, focusing on driving more server growth and storage and
those elements will continue to mix up the company.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Thanks a lot. And then just finally, what is your latest view on tablets? Are you seeing any of
that creep into corporate? And do you think you can play if you indeed believe that that trend is picking up steam?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: This is Michael. We're engaged with a number of customers on the services side helping them
deal with tablets from a security standpoint, a manageability standpoint. And clearly that's a near-term opportunity for
us. We see the ecosystems coming together probably taking a little longer than we would have liked. But as that comes

together, there will be some nice opportunities there.
Anecdotally, I think what we're seeing is that you can't really find a lot of companies that are going to have three
devices for all of their users. Yet, the tablet in almost all the instances we found is a third device. So it's not exactly
clear how many units are going to be sold. I think it will be a lot of units. Gartner says there will be 2 billion PCs in
2014. I think there have been 10 or so million tablets sold or so in the last six months.
So to put it in perspective, we're very focused on creating the solutions as the ecosystems come together, having a very
strong offering that intersects with when this is relevant, when there are applications, when security is in place, and real
deployments are occurring. But I'm not seeing this replacing either the smartphone or the PC in large numbers of
organizations.

Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter. The first question is
going back to the consumer side of the business. At 4.5% operating margin, you guys have obviously attained your
target long-term model. Can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of that and whether or not we should think
about that as being somewhat volatile over the next couple of quarters, or are we at a new level where you think it can
run at? And is that a clean number? I know in the past when you guys have seen quarterly moves like this, there's been
some one-time items in those.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, it is a clean number. It's good execution, and we're pleased with that. And over the past
couple of quarters, I think you've seen this progress. And it's a lot of things that Steve Felice talked about last year at
the analyst meeting and when we had him on the call in I think the third quarter. So a lot of good execution.
We're not going to provide targets for individual business segments. And again, I think what we said was we weren't
satisfied with the profitability when it was below 2%, and again we've seen nice improvements. We did talk about the
fact that this is the level of profitability that we'd ultimately like to see in this business, and that's pretty consistent with
what we said even a year ago over a longer-term time horizon. So we'll continue to balance growth with profitability,
and we're pretty pleased with that profitability right now.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Okay. And the follow-up for me is on the PC side in general. I think in prior quarters, you've
talked about or provided unit growth numbers. Can you provide those for notebook and desktop? And on that, talk a
little bit about what you're seeing currently in the pricing environment in the PC industry.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Do we provide unit growth numbers?
<A - Robert Williams>: No.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: It's not something we're going to provide. We're focused again on revenue and profit share
more than units.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Any comment on the pricing environment?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, pricing environment, as we've been saying for a few quarters here, has been relatively
benign. Maybe Paul can give you a view from a customer standpoint.
<A - Paul D. Bell>: We've certainly made it less aggressive for us because we're just not seeking out what frankly can
be negative margin business in this industry where people go in large reverse auctions and that sort of thing. We're
focused so much on having deeper relationships with customers where we're working across the whole span of their IT
infrastructure that we're just not getting in that as much. I think that has probably contributed to a more benign price
environment because we're not doing that. And that, of course, applies to the larger commercial space. And we have

more to come to the table with, with our new acquisitions. Our enterprise portfolio, when we talk about fundamental
transitions of their IT capability, then it just makes the whole discussion about what we're going to price the client
devices at a less critical path.
So I'd say the market is sort of average, maybe trending towards benign, but you can still get in some fights if you
choose to. We're just trying to really focus on where there's value for customers.

Our next question will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I'm having trouble reconciling your margin guidance with the rest of the
commentary on the call regarding business mix trends, pricing trends, demand trends, et cetera. Can you maybe lay out
the top two or three drivers that will take operating margins down from, on a GAAP basis, 8%-plus to 7% over the next
couple quarters?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Chris, I think we've laid out the key drivers that we think are impacting margins as we move
throughout the year. We're not going to continue to break that down. I think as you think about the second half of the
year, we're one quarter into it. And as you think about the uncertainty we may have here in the demand environment, in
the competitive environment, in commodity costs, we're just going to manage through that. And I think as you think
about the framework that we've got, we're going to drive these elements that we've highlighted here that we think will
generate positive results and react to what the market will give us. So again, we're one quarter into it. We'll continue to
provide insights on how we're viewing that over the course of the year.
<A - Robert Williams>: I would just add to that. Pretty consistently for the last two years we've been very focused on
operating income results, cash earnings performance. And regardless of the environment that we found ourselves in,
and it has been a fairly varied environment over the last six or seven quarters, we fairly consistently delivered; in fact I
would say consistently delivered on our operating income commitment. That's really the focus of the company.
And I think that if you look at the ability to balance the different factors, whether it was a very difficult component cost
environment, say, a year or so ago to a more favorable component and cost environment now, then layering in the
investments that we've made, the sales force, the specialists, there has been a lot of work that has been done here. And
we've done that all with an eye towards operating income dollar growth, and frankly it has been pretty consistent. So
that's really what we want to get you guys to focus on, and we need to have the flexibility to manage the business on a
quarter-by-quarter basis and drive that balance that we're seeking to achieve.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. Just two questions. One on Japan, can you just talk about if you saw any
revenue or commodity and margin headwinds emanating out of Japan either in the April quarter or in the quarter you
guys are guiding for?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, in the quarter, we did have some slight revenue and cost pressure from the market
disruption. The revenue, to be honest, was slightly less than we anticipated, and we did incur some logistics and supply
chain pressure and incremental costs to ensure that we delivered on customer commitments. But I would tell you it's
pretty immaterial overall to the results, and we're not even calling it out. The good news is that demand is returning to
more normalized levels. In some cases, there could even be upside as it relates to restructuring base – or reconstruction
kinds of activities in Japan.

We continue to watch components. But in general, we feel like the supply chain is pretty solid, though we will incur
probably some incremental costs due to the second quarter around that supply chain. Again, I would call it immaterial
to the overall. So we'll just continue to monitor it, but we're optimistic that we're through this from our standpoint.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Got it. And if I could just go back once more to the margin questions. If you look at
year-over-year numbers, op margin have gone up by 270 basis points with very limited revenue growth. How much of
that 270 basis points growth do you think was due to sustainable and controllable factors that you've been executing on
versus things like commodities that may be a little bit out of your control at this point?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Singling out commodities as a driver here is a bit dangerous. And the reality is it's an
execution model that we have to drive taking into account commodity prices in any environment. And as you think
about the things that we've done to drive progress in the business, it's around the products and services that we're
offering. It's an increased mix in solutions. It's good execution in the supply chain. It's moving to higher price points
and higher value products. It's more solutions. It's all these things that we've talked about and we've detailed over the
course of multiple quarters.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: And do you think all the things you're talking about is the bigger or more than a 50% driver of
the margin expansion?

Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Q – [06G6W1-E Shannon Cross]>: Thank you very much. My first question is just with regard to linearity during the
quarter. Can you talk about whether you saw things improving and maybe on a segment basis? That would be helpful.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Shannon, I wouldn't call out anything unusual in terms of linearity in the quarter. We did
have the Easter holiday towards the end. But other than that, I wouldn't say there was anything different in terms of
linearity than you would typically see in the quarter. Paul, you may have a different view.
<A - Paul D. Bell>: Yes, in general, that's right. It was pretty consistent [ph] payment (58:30) to the forecast
throughout the quarter, at least in public and large enterprise; and one exception being the federal government, which is
just a piece of our public business. But you have real sustained budget cuts throughout the year [indiscernible] (59:13)
an extreme stop as everybody was just waiting for the continuing resolutions and the budget. But that's less than a
quarter of our total public business, and I think we balanced that out pretty well.
Q – [06G6W1-E Shannon Cross]>: Okay. Great. And then I'm just curious, if you think about where you've gone about
going into your enterprise customers and your public customers and looking at where you can add value added services
and digging down into them, what inning do you think you are in terms of optimizing the revenue opportunities at these
customers? Are we early days or is this something where you've been doing this for several quarters?
<A - Paul D. Bell>: Let me come at it from two perspectives. One, we've been at the relationship building side of that
for 27 years, and I'm not being flip. That's a very important part of the equation that when we come to them with new
capabilities from what we just acquired or we have developed a new solution, we have an incredibly receptive audience
because customers have worked with us and seen what open, capable, affordable solutions mean.

Then if you actually talk about the solutions themselves and what inning we're in, well, some are inning one or we're
still in the dugout because we've just bought the company. But you've got others that we've been really working hard at
and we're in the third, fourth, fifth generation of the product. So you really have to look offer by offer to see where we
are. But really the important thing is that we're really leveraging the direct relationships we've had with these accounts.
We know them. Unlike many of our competitors, have one account executive whose job it is to represent all of Dell,

Q – [06G6W1-E Shannon Cross]>: Have you changed sales comp plans at all in fiscal 2012 to drive more profit or

in some businesses that had not gone to it yet, we extended the quota cycle. So it was too short when it was quarter by
quarter. So a lot of the world had already gone to a six-month plan or in some cases an annual plan. Now everybody is
on the longer plans because it takes a longer sales cycle to close these.

on. But if you look at what you guys report on storage, it was pretty weak overall. Even the 11% you guys reported for
the high IP businesses was down, a fairly substantial deceleration from what you've been doing in those types of
businesses in the last year or so. And it was well below – not well below, but below what NetApp and EMC were
doing. So you seem to be implying that that business is going to accelerate, so we wanted to just get some more basis
for why we should think that's going to accelerate going forward. And then also maybe a comment on when the EMC
and maybe legacy PowerVault business hits such a small number here where we're really seeing mature growth from
that and higher IP stuff.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: We absolutely think it's going to grow. As you think about it, we're in a quarter where we're
continuing to build out the portfolio and a pretty dramatic shift in the focus. Obviously, a lot going on with the close of
the Compellent transaction. And the EMC dynamics in the quarter, we've added significantly to the storage specialist
population. And as you think about that, just a lot going on in terms of distraction amongst the team. But again,
margins continue to expand overall, even within the quarter. The pipeline looks very good, very optimistic about that,
and we expect to see strong growth there.
The lead times and the close cycles on some of these transactions is actually longer, especially on the PLE or the public
and large enterprise side. And we begin to see that some of those deals begin to flow through the pipeline as we move
forward, especially on things like Compellent. In our SMB business, for instance, we have fundamentally almost
completely replaced the EMC revenue with Compellent revenue quarter on quarter. And so this has a much shorter
close cycle, and the impact of that is much more dramatic and a quicker timeframe. So, very encouraged about that. We
do expect this will accelerate pretty aggressively as we move throughout the year as we get past the first quarter.
<Q - Kevin M. Hunt>: So we also assume that means for the total business, we should be maybe one or two quarters
away from hitting an inflection point where that starts growing substantially because there really isn't much more left to
lose on EMC.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I think we'll start, as you get towards the end of this year, clearly driving positive
revenue year-over-year growth. I think it has been declining for a while, but clearly it's on acceleration towards the end
of the year.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: We had margin growth in the quarter.

<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Absolutely.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: And that has been going on for a year-over-year basis for a long time as we continue to change
out the portfolio. Q1 was a dramatic change-out, and high confidence in our ability to grow storage margins and
revenue going forward.
<A - Robert Williams>: And we've owned Compellent for less than a full quarter, and the number of salespeople out
there introducing Compellent technology to customers is up by an order of magnitude. So most of that went into
building the pipeline. And so we're very bullish about the acceleration there.
<Q - Kevin M. Hunt>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - Robert Williams>: Great. Casey, let's go ahead and take one more question.
Operator
Okay. Our last question will come from Abhey Lamba with ISI Group.
<Q - Abhey Lamba>: Yes, thanks. Michael, just following up on the tablet question, can you talk about how do you
plan to participate in this space? Which operating systems will you build it out on? And where do you see most demand
from your enterprise customers?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Clearly for us, we're in the Android and Windows camp. I think Windows really starts to
become relevant in the Windows 8 timeframe. There's a lot of activity around ARM microprocessors, obviously, in
tablets to get the thin and low power, lightweight characteristics, so those are really the attributes.
When you go into the enterprise, customers are looking at security. They're looking at applications. They're looking at a
robust set of offerings. Those are still being formed. And we're very much active with a number of partners to create
those and form them. And as that all comes together, I think you'll see us be very present in that market. So it's Android
Honeycomb on the tablet side. And I think we're still seeing earlier release versions. That needs to get a bit more
mature.
<Q - Abhey Lamba>: All right, thanks. And lastly, Brian, now that you've achieved your operating margin level in the
consumer business where you wanted it to be, do you have room over here now to go for market share gain, or are you
going to continue to improve on margins in that business?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: We're not changing the strategy. We're going to continue to lean on profit. We think we're in
a spot now where we can begin to grow the business as well while maintaining some pretty good profit.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: See, I think the broader point here is that we have an improving product line execution. And
that along with the change in our approach to our customers where we change the conversation to be more solutions
based is really opening up a new set of opportunities for us. And I think that's what's contributing to the strong growth
in earnings that you're seeing.
<Q - Abhey Lamba>: Thank you.
Robert Williams
Great. Thanks to everyone for joining us. We look forward to talking to you over the course of the quarter, and would
remind you that we've our Analyst Meeting here in Austin on June the 28th and 29th. Thanks again.
