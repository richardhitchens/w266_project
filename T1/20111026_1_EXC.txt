MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Cassandra and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to
welcome everyone to the Exelon Third Quarter Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you.
And now I would like to turn the call over to Stacie Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Stacie, you may begin.
Stacie Frank
Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Exelon's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.
We issued our earnings release this morning and if you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon
website. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and
estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please
refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from
management's projections, forecasts and expectations, and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings.
In addition, during the call we will be discussing the proposed merger of Exelon and Constellation Energy. Today's
discussion is not a substitute for disclosures in the definitive joint proxy statement that was mailed to shareholders on
or about October 12.

For important additional information regarding the proposed merger, including the associated risks and uncertainties,
please refer to the earnings release and today's 8-K as well as the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew Hilzinger,
Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by several other members of Exelon's
senior management team who will be available to answer your questions.
I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John W. Rowe
Thank you, Stacie. Our operating earnings of $1.12 beat our own expectations at the upper end of the range by a couple
of cents and beat your consensus by $0.03. We are very proud of having achieved that because in the third quarter we
were haunted by intense storms. As you all know, we had a hurricane in the east and we had one month with the most
severe repetitive storms that I have ever seen at ComEd.
Matt will discuss the storm costs and restoration performance in more detail, but just let me say that at ComEd, Frank
and Anne's ability to get the troops out again and again to get extra troops in to deal with repetitive storms was really
remarkable and the preparation that Dennis O'Brien and Craig did for the hurricane was really exceptional.
PECO was one of the first utilities to have all of its customers back and did it with absolutely seamless public relations,
so it was tremendous performance. Our nuclear organization continues to spend at world class levels. We had a
capacity factor of 95.8% in the third quarter.
Now the stand out driver, the thing that made our ability to recover all of those storm costs in the same quarter was our
strong performance in Texas. Due to the extreme heat, higher demand, we had on peak prices in the ERCOT north zone
of $107 per megawatt hour. We had some hours as high as $3000 per megawatt hour.
Our units generated 2.4 billion megawatt hours of electricity, which was an increase of 20% over last year. The higher
prices in the spot and the day ahead markets and the open generation linked in our portfolio enabled us to gain about
$0.10 per share in the third quarter from our Texas operations. Congratulations for this are due to Ken Cornew and his
power team for how they managed the open position and Chip Pardee and Sonny [ph] Gard (5:13) for making the units
perform when we needed them. This was just a good news story for Exelon, and it shows how different pieces of our
system can contribute when they're really needed.
Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our 2011 full year earnings range of $4.05 to $4.25, Madame
Frank has allowed me to say we expect to be comfortably in that range. I would say damned comfortably within that
range. Matt will cover our financial performance in more detail in a few minutes but let me first give an update on the
Constellation merger, our Solar acquisition and what's going on at EPA.
So far all the formal benchmarks are on track for an early first quarter close of the merger. We have mailed our proxies
and scheduled our shareholder meeting for November 17. We appreciate the support of the transaction that we have
received from so many of you and the earlier you cast your votes in support of it, the more momentum we will have.
Our regulatory approvals are progressing nicely. We've made progress at both FERC and DoJ and with the PJM Market
Monitor, the key proceeding remains the Maryland Utility Commission approval and our negotiations with the
governor's office in Maryland.
In order to address the concerns raised by the PJM Market Monitor, we filed a settlement agreement committing not to
sell the plants we agreed to divest to other significant market participants in PJM. We don't think those people's own
lawyers would have let them bid anyway, so we don't believe this concession comes with a significant cost. We are
very pleased that we have everything worked out with the Market Monitor. This is one of those benchmarks we've been
looking at to make certain that we don't have the problems we had in New Jersey five years ago.
We have received word from Massachusetts that no further approval is required. We expect an order from the New
York commission next month and in Maryland hearings before the PFC begin next week.

We have made a number of additional commitments in our rebuttal testimony and we have refused to make some of the
commitments which we have been asked to do. We are very happy to have a live negotiation with Maryland officials,
but we're not going to give away the real value in this transaction. We believe we can make this work for you, our
shareholders, and for the customers in Maryland and we are hard at work convincing folks in Maryland that that is so.
Turning to the Solar acquisition, we announced that we had acquired Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One from First
Solar. This is a 230 megawatt utility scale installation in Southern California. It will be fully operational by 2013 and
we have a 25-year PPA with PG&E for 100% of the output. DOE has provided a loan guarantee for $646 million of the
total $1.36 billion investment. We are taking investment tax credits on the project and we'll also get federal bonus
depreciation for assets placed in service by the end of '12. Putting all these cash flow benefits together, we expect to
recover our initial investment by 2015.
Once complete, Antelope Valley will be one of the largest photovoltaic projects in the world. This is another example
of working within our Exelon 2020 plan to bring low emission, low carbon generation to the economy. With our tax
capacity, we were able to do that without sacrificing our financial requirements.
Let me turn briefly to the EPA's regulatory calendar. As you all know, the administration has directed EPA to put
ozone regulations on a slower track and we expect a new ozone standard to be proposed in 2013. At the same time, the
administration has backed EPA's work on the Cross-State and Air Toxics rules for power plants. While EPA has
indicated it will take another month to release the final air toxic rules, we see their careful attention to detail as a good
thing. The President has made it clear that he doesn't intend to abandon the effort to regulate hazardous air pollutants
like mercury.
Despite the passage of the TRAIN act in the House, we do not believe a Congressional effort to suspend [ph] the EPA's
(11:17) work will ultimately pass both houses and we do not see how it could sustain a veto if it did.
As you know, EPA recently proposed modifications to the Cross-State rules; we think that's a good thing, not a bad
thing. They are obviously trying to eliminate cases where the rules had unintended consequences for that. So we
continue to believe that Exelon will see the market benefit from additional EPA regulation that we have been
discussing for some time.
But what's more important is we are already seeing the actions that we really care about. The last PJM auction resulted
in over 1,800 megawatts less coal bidding than before. About 7,000 megawatts less coal capacity cleared the auction.
To-date, about 10,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity in PJM has been announced for retirement. We have revised
our estimate upward from 10,000 to 11,000 to be retired to about 15,000 megawatts retiring over the next few years in
PJM. This is partly due to the pending environmental regulation and partly due to the fact that many of these units
simply aren't economic at today's natural gas prices and with today's low load growth.
So, we continue to think the market will improve and our views on this are supported by increasing spark spreads and
the general power market behavior that we have seen; and Ken Cornew is with me today and will be happy to discuss
that in more detail later.
Now, let me just comment on a couple of other things. First, the NRC continues to take a careful and thoughtful and
decisive response to the events in Japan at the Fukushima plants. The staff has evaluated the findings of the task force
and presented a prioritized action plan. The Commission recently approved the staff's near terms actions.
The Tier1 priorities include reassessing policies, procedures and tax guidelines. We expect additional requirements
requiring hardened vents and spent fuel pool instrumentation, as well as more back up equipment for station blackout
response. While these Tier-1 requirements will be handled decisively on a short time line, there will be an opportunity
for industry input. We believe the NRC is handling the Fukushima event in a very responsible manner.
Now, turning gears, we are actively involved in the AEP Ohio and Duke Energy Ohio rate and marketing cases. And in
this case neither of these companies was enthused about how much capacity was supposed to go to market. We have
intervened strongly, making it very clear that we didn't wish to impair either company's ability to recover its current
investments, but at the same time making it clear that we wanted future investments judged by market standards.

We have achieved settlements; we have both AEP Ohio and, Joe, is the Duke one done now?
Joseph Dominguez
It is.
John W. Rowe
We have a settlement with Duke also. Not only does this create an opportunity, a market for some 70 million megawatt
hours of electricity, I view this is one of the most important steps forward for competitive markets in the past decade.
As you all know, in the late '90's, it seemed like everything would be competitive, and then after Enron things rolled
back. Well here we have cases of utilities that have been strong advocates of competitive – of regulated monopolies,
agreeing to a larger percentage of market participation. I think that's a very good thing indeed and Joe Dominguez and
Scott Brown and Delia Stroud of our team just did a tremendous job working on these things in a way that wasn't
possible for the other utilities, but was definitively pro-market.
Closer to home in Illinois, we watched Senate Bill 1652 and the accompanying trailer bill on an hourly basis. The
trailer bill passed the senate yesterday by the required majority to overturn the governor's veto. The trailer bill passed
out of house committee this morning. By vote, I think 17 to 1 or 16 to 1. We believe both bills will be presented to both
houses in the next day or two, but you'll know when they pass as soon as we do.
Frank Clark is on the phone and so is Joe Trpik and they can talk to you in more detail about these, but I think this is a
remarkable effort by the legislature to both try to improve the electric service in Illinois and to do so in a way that's fair
to ComEd and Ameren. I'm very pleased about this work.
So just to finish off and turn it over to Matt. Again and again we find a way to deliver earnings. And I think we are on
track for a very good year at Exelon and there is no part of the company that hasn't made a contribution. As you all
know, Tom Terry's tax work has been exceptional this year, but all of the basic units are pulling together and we're
giving you results. So with that, Matt.
Matthew F. Hilzinger
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will review the operating results for the quarter in more
detail and share a few thoughts on power market performance and cash flow. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered
operating earnings of $1.12 per share this quarter, a penny per share better than the same period prior year.
Moving to slide nine, generations operating earnings are up $0.04 per share this quarter compared to last year, largely
due to improved portfolio and market conditions, which reflects PECO's transition to market at the beginning of the
year and our third quarter Texas performance.
As you can see on slide 10, we are near our ratable hedge targets for 2012 and 2013. Although we slowed down the
pace of our hedging this quarter, we continue to make sales and we're able to benefit from the higher pricing we saw
periodically through the quarter at the West Hub and NI Hub. We attribute the higher pricing primarily to two factors.
First, the market's reaction to the Cross-State Air Pollution rules; and second, additional heat rate expansion at the West
Hub and NI Hub consistent with historical levels at similar natural gas prices.
On the right side of this slide, you can see that prices increased following the release of the Cross-State Air Pollution
rule in early July and increased again when some limited amount of emission allowances began trading in early
September. Those few trades cleared at prices more than double the EPA price of approximately $1,100 per ton. Since
then, the EPA has modified to save emissions budgets and we are currently seeing 2012 SO2 emission markets quoted
at $700 to $1,100 per ton, which at or below the EPA's expectations.

With respect to heat rates, NI Hub heat rates continue to build on the improvement we saw earlier in the year and both
NI Hub and West Hub heat rates expanded by approximately one point during the quarter for 2012 and 2013, which
were supportive of higher prices as natural gas prices remained low. You may have also noticed that our expected
generation in the south and west region is up since our second quarter across all years. As a note, we are now including
the expected generation from Wolf Hollow and Antelope Valley Solar Ranch, two acquisitions that we competed
during the third quarter.
Turning to comment on slide 11, operating earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $0.17 per share compared to
$0.18 per share last year. Incremental storm costs were up $0.06 per share this quarter compared to last year due to a
very busy summer of storms. ComEd screws managed an unprecedented total of 10 major storms in close succession
this summer including the July 11 storm that we mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, which affected
nearly one million customers. In each instance, ComEd's restoration performance was commendable under very
challenging conditions.
Moving now to PECO on slide 12, operating earnings were $0.16 per share, which reflect a $0.02 increase in
incremental storm costs versus last year, due to Hurricane Irene. As many of you experienced directly, Hurricane Irene
caused extensive flooding and wind damage and interrupted service to nearly 7 million customers in 14 U.S. states.
About 500,000 of the affected customers were in the PECO service territory.
What set PECO apart during the aftermath of Irene was the extraordinary job of restoring service to 99% of their
affected customers within 72 hours? PECO management proactively mobilized 1,000s of employees, contractors and
workers from other regions, including ComEd before the storm hit the service territory, which enabled the immediate
and effective restoration response.
With respect to load for ComEd and PECO, total weather normalized electric deliveries are down for the quarter
compared to the prior year at ComEd and are essentially flat at PECO. The slowdown in growth in the economy is
weighing on the electric demand in both regions. Almost every economist we watch has reduced their U.S. gross
domestic product growth expectations for this year, which shows that they are not expecting the economy to gain a lot
of momentum in the near term.
Based on our year-to-date performance and a decline in our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are modifying our
full year load expectations. For 2011 we are now projecting a decline in load from last year of 0.6% at ComEd and a
decline of 0.5% at PECO. For details regarding our load results and outlook, they can be found on slides 28 and 29 in
the appendix of today's presentation.
On slide 13 you'll find our updated cash flow projections for this year. During the third quarter, based on new IRS
guidance issued on August 19, ComEd and PECO can immediately deduct expenses associated with certain repairs
which will reduce their tax liabilities and generate an additional 300 million of cash from operations. We expect to
receive about approximately $250 million this year and $50 million in 2012.
As John mentioned we will fund Antelope Valley Solar project with a combination of a federal financing bank loan,
which was guaranteed by the Department of Energy, cash on hand and other short term debt. Interest rates on the loan
will be fixed at an attractive spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity adding to the
financial attractiveness of the project. Maintaining a strong balance sheet and identifying and executing value-added
strategies, has positioned us to end the year with strong cash and with strong credit metrics. For yearend we are
projecting FFO to debt of 47% at ExGen and Holdco, which is well above our 30% to 35% target and gives us
flexibility heading into the next few years to manage the changes in our generation margins.
Before I close I'd like to touch on a couple of additional items starting with pension on page 14. At the end of the third
quarter our pension was funded at 83%. Two significant factors that impacted our funded status are discount rate and
asset returns. The discount rate is used to determine our pension obligation and pension costs for the following year and
is determined at December 31 of each year, and is based on the yields of long-term high quality corporate bonds, which
we can't control. However, we can and have influenced the asset returns generated by our portfolio based on our
investment decisions.

In 2010, Exelon implemented a liability hedge strategy and rebalanced the portfolio to a less equity concentrated asset
allocation. Our investment strategy has resulted in significant outperformance of our plans relative to the S&P 500. The
$2.1 billion pension contribution in January in conjunction with our liability hedge strategy has in large part reduced
the impact of lower discount rates on the pension unfunded status costs and contributions. As a result we do not
currently anticipate substantial changes to our planned 2012 pension contribution. Consistent with the prior year we
will provide our latest 2012 pension contribution projections and sensitivities at EEI in a couple of weeks.
On October 14 we received an order from the FERC on our incentive and formula rate filing for the RITE Line
transmission project. FERC approved an 11.43% return on equity without hearing. The rate includes adders for our
RTO membership and for projects risks and challenges. In addition the order grants 100% CWIP and abandonment
recovery and regulatory asset treatment for preconstruction costs.
All incentives are subject to PJM including the RITE Line and its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan known as
RTEP. We plan to move forward with PJM's RTEP process by participating in the stakeholder process currently
underway to asses modifications needed to the existing RTEP requirements to address FERC order number 1,000 and
policy-based transmission expansion.
Finally, when we present at EEI in a couple of weeks, we will introduce the status of our 2014 hedge disclosure, but
due to our pending merger with Constellation, we will not be introducing 2012 earnings guidance.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results and remain on track to deliver earnings solidly
within our earnings guidance range for the year.
And with that we are ready to take your questions.
Stacie Frank
Cassandra, we are ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line Greg Gordon from ISI Group.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you.
<A>: Hi, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Good morning. Gentlemen, when you look at what happened in Texas, obviously you had a big
benefit from the heat wave, the $0.10. I think it appears that your open gross margins reflect, I think in part higher
results going forward from Texas just given how tight that market's become. Is that true? And can you give us some
sense of whether you think there was a structural repeatability to the type of option value you retain there and how that
fits into the industrial logic of the merger?
<A>: Stacie and Ruth Ann are not present, but other than that I am going to defer it to Ken who is the gentlemen to
answer that.
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Hey Greg, clearly as you can see in our hedge disclosure, the increase in heat rates in
Texas has added value in our open gross margin. In addition to that obviously, we've picked up the second half of the
Wolf Hollow plan, which we had in first half PPE and we have a solar facility there picking up some generation. So
about half of its increase – half of the increased generation in our hedge disclosure represents the increased dispatch on
our plants, and half are the new acquisitions. And Texas is the kind of market that is set up for this kind of volatility if
you have supply demand equilibrium driven by either longer term supply and demand fundamentals, or in some part in

this case, extreme weather, extreme drought that caused the conditions that we saw in August and somewhat through
September.
So the heat rates picked up to a point where they represent more value, option value for peaking assets. I think this is
something that can continue obviously driven by many of the fundamental long-term drivers we always discuss, as well
as weather. But this is an indication that as you get closer to equilibrium, you will see more power volatility and see
higher value for the kinds of assets that we have in Texas.
From our retail business perspective, we like the retail business, the retail business is the most effective way for us to
find hedges for our portfolio that's designed to serve retail load. We have that in large part in the Mid Atlantic, we have
it in Texas with our mid merit and peaking assets. So this in no way changes our perspective on what the value of a
retail business and load following in a portfolio can do for you. We just don't like to sell it when it's not valued fairly in
the market and we will sell it appropriately when it is valued fairly in the market.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great.
<A - John W. Rowe>: I don't think we see any consistency coming out of these Texas prices, but on the other hand, as
Ken said, the closer Texas gets to equilibrium, the more frequently we should see these periods of high prices.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. I have two other questions. The first is, in Maryland I know you're currently negotiating –
trying to negotiating a mutually beneficial outcome. It seems like the biggest area of dispute is your willingness to build
25 megawatts of renewables and their desire to have several hundred megawatts of renewables. What do think the most
likely sort of mutually constructive outcome there might be?
<A - John W. Rowe>: Well, it's got more dimensions than that. I think the Public Utility Commission's RFP on
capacity suggests that it has some interest in a large number of megawatts produced in the most economic play
whatever that is, and that means probably gas. The governor's office is clearly interested in more renewables. And so
the negotiation has to be designed to achieve a Pareto optimum position between a number of different perspectives. I
do think you have your finger on it. I think an ultimate settlement requires more renewables.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. And my final question, maybe this is more up yours and Bill von Hoene's alley since he is
on the board of NEIL [Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited], but what is your perspective on what's going on at Crystal
River 3 with the significant delamination event there as it pertains to sort of introspection on your part on the care and
maintenance of your units as they age?
<A - John W. Rowe>: That I – you've got me, you got Bill Von Hoene, you've got Joe Grimes, and Joe I'm going to
kick this off, but I think you're going to have to pick it up from Bill and I, because there are those who do not think two
lawyers are the best people to opine on containment integrity. But the real message for us is any time you have to make
a hole in the containment, do it with exquisite care and be very, very careful about what you're doing. Also go into a
containment like that rarely is possible, but Joe would you pick up on that please.
<A - Joe Grimes>: Yes, John we had no plans in our near term planning scope which would have us do any concrete
cutting on any of our structures similar to a containment. We are continuing to closely follow the activities associated
with the concrete crack indications and we don't currently have any concerns for our facilities.
<A - John W. Rowe>: Bill, do you want to add anything?
<A - William A. von Hoene>: The only thing I would add Greg is that as you know the claim is under consideration at
NEIL currently and there has been no determination as to how we have to handle it, and that will be forthcoming.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you, gentlemen.

<Q - James L. Dobson>: Good morning.
<A - John W. Rowe>: Morning, Jay.
<Q - James L. Dobson>: John, I was hoping a follow-up on the last question regarding Texas and understanding that
operationally that was just a fantastic result and the folks that operate deserve a lot of credit. But as we look out to next
year you would be assuming the Constellation merger has closed, you'd be operating from at least a neutral and
probably a short position rather a long position. And I'm just wondering how, as you look forward, your comments
regarding retail. How are you thinking about these tightening markets in a retail context both strategically but then also
as you frame up and prepare for the consummation of the merger, how you think about hedging particularly in Texas
tactically, understanding that you will have a large short position you will be taking on your books?
<A - John W. Rowe>: We are strategically somewhat less comfortable with shorts than Constellation has been. We
believe one of the great virtues of the merger is it puts their retail marketing capability with our generations, and we
like that in Texas as in other places. Ken Cornew, who will be heading the whole trading chart for the combined
company will be working with both Chris and Mayo to try to come up with a conservative, adequately hedged approach
to handling places where we have more load than generation.
I think the real difference is that learning, as we all have, from the last nine months, we probably hedge a little sooner
than Constellation has historically or a little more completely. In other words, we take the tail out of a little further. It
was possible to do that; indeed, Ken was able to sell some power at very high prices from our fleet in the wake of the
heat and then buy it back a few weeks later at cheaper prices than he could produce it for.
So to us it's a matter of learning from the whole thing. We believe Constellation will turn out to have had some losses
in Texas. Ken's last guess is that they are smaller than our gains but we don't know yet, and you'll find that out in the
Constellation's earnings call. What's really important here is the two things are stronger together than separately and
we're going to impose a conservative edging discipline on the whole. Ken would you like to add to that?
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Just a couple of comments, Jay, to add to that. We do have, when you combine the fleets,
a substantial amount of peak load coverage capability in Texas, so from a peak perspective I don't think we have the
situation you're describing, maybe more from an expected generation situation is what you are describing. And we've
served load for many, many years we've served the 23,000 megawatt peak in ComEd. We've served almost a 9,000
megawatt peak in PECO for many years with certain base-load generation more in the Midwest and having to add the
peaking to it, with a well-rounded portfolio in the east.
We know how to do it. We understand and know how to create a portfolio that will fit our needs in Texas; and quite
frankly I think it'll be pretty easy for us to do that once we bring the portfolios together. But I have to say we haven't
brought the portfolios together and we'll be taking a deeper dive when we do.
<Q - James L. Dobson>: That's great. Thanks very much for the clarity and just a detailed question on Texas. How
long was the Handley plant out in the early third quarter?
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: The Handley plant was out approximately in seven weeks and the rest of our fleet
operating superbly.
<Q - James L. Dobson>: That's great. And then, John on the Mark I retrofit, have we gotten our head around what
those cost might be? I understand from the second quarter we do you feel they are going to be small, but has there be
any more granularity on what that might cost?
<A - John W. Rowe>: There really isn't yet. Strangely what the Commission is doing on debt hardening, I think will
add more cost to the Mark IIs than the than the Mark Is but Joe and Jeff, would you pick up on that question?
<A - Joe Grimes>: Yes. I mean, at this point of time, John, we again don't see any significant costs in 2012 and we
actually expect to continue that the cost for compliance for both the Mark Is and Mark IIs will be very manageable.
We'll have a better estimate on those compliance costs once we get through the technical review process with the
industry and the NRC through next year.

second quarter you have the tax benefit from the transfer of cash to a qualified nuclear trust. And you indicated in the
second half of the year you'd have about a $0.01 benefit. Did that book in the third quarter, is that pushed to the fourth?

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Hey, good morning guys.
<A - John W. Rowe>: Hi, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Quick question on Texas, I noticed in the release you mentioned having had this outage at
one of the units early in the quarter, which I guess was before the real spike. So I guess I have two questions on that,
would we have seen a noticeably better result if that outage hadn't occurred. And then how in terms of the way you
hedged would that outage have impacted the result had it happened say in August?
<A - John W. Rowe>: Jon, we were aware that the outage was in the middle of the summer. It did happen and it was in
July and part of August. We are aware of our situation operationally staying very close with Sonny Garg and his
organization. We decided to expand the length in our portfolio in August to keep our position where we wanted it to be.
We got to play it back sometime in August, we got another half of Wolf Hollow sometime in August. Those things
went in our favor. If the plant was running full time and market prices stayed the same, we would have made more
money. But when more plants come online, you know, that impacts the price as well. So it's hard to recreate on that
relevant curve but we are very happy with our result. It was executed flawlessly by Walt Kuhn and our south trading
team, and the results show.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay. Thanks, Ken. And then one other thing I had for you; we've seen I guess in the last –
since the end of the quarter we've seen those forward heat rates in PJM and related hubs rollover beyond 2012 a little
bit, out in that '13, '15 window. What do you attribute that to – is it hedging activity in the market, is it the fact that gas
has held up a little better in the out years 2012, any sense of what's causing that?
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Jonathan, my guess is it's more of the hedging activity that's happened since the quarter's
turn. September 30th prices as you see in our hedge disclosure reflect higher heat rates than we've seen – a little bit
higher than we've seen in the last 20 days, although heat rates have held up very well.
Any time you get cycles of hedging activity, you will see some movement in power prices one way or another and I
think that's some it. I would have told you based on September 30th prices, a larger amount of our forward upside from
the environmental regulation was in those NI Hub and West Hub price, and in the last 20 days or so, it's shown me that
there still is more upside particularly at the NI Hub level. So I think heat rates have moved up substantially to reflect
reality and spot prices and the reality of price impact from environmental rules, and you will see that cycle a bit as gas
price or power price moves with short-term market activity.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay. Thanks, Ken. And then if I could just on one other topic on the pension, it looks like
the move into fixed income was very timely, and should we think about the mix that you shifted to as being static now,
or with that big improvement in the bond portfolio is it possible, we see you rebalance it again?

<A - John W. Rowe>: Well, I think it's directionally static, Doug Brown, who manages it is here. Do you want to pick
up on it Doug?
<A - Douglas J. Brown>: Yes. We view that as a dynamic allocation that we constantly reevaluate. So we are very
happy where it is right now, but if rates were to go lower, we could lighten up on the hedge. We are firmly committed
to that strategy, we'll always have a hedge, but we constantly evaluate it. So it could move in the future.
<A - John W. Rowe>: Lest that sound like too much of a hedge, Doug has been very firm with our risk management
committee on our board, that he thinks year in and year out, we ought to be matching our investments more to our
exposure than we were before. And we'd have been better off three years ago, four years ago if we'd started Doug's plan
earlier. So, while I'm sure he'll change it from time-to-time, the direction of a larger weighting toward debt, I think, is a
pretty constant board commitment. Doug, would you agree with that?
<A - Douglas J. Brown>: Yes John, I would agree with that and I think as rates will eventually go up and the funded
status will improve, we will actually continue to increase the hedge level and the matching portfolio strategy.
[indiscernible] (45:54).
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: So, when you talk about asset allocation and then this – and a liability hedge, is the hedge
something different from just increasing the bond weighting or is it basically the same thing?
<A - Douglas J. Brown>: It'll be the same thing. We roughly have about 40% of the assets in what we call the liability
hedge portfolio. It's a physical bond portfolio of Treasury and high quality corporates that match the interest rate
characteristics of the liability.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay. And so it's only a hedge in the sense that it's just a higher percentage weighting than
you used to have before?
<A - Douglas J. Brown>: Yeah, much higher. We essentially didn't have really much of a hedge at all previously and
we've moved to a rather high level at the moment.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
<A - John W. Rowe>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah, hi, good morning, John. First a question regarding merger approval in Maryland.
Could you maybe give us kind of a summary sense of what you think the main issues are that need to be resolved still
with the state of Maryland, like where are kind of the couple critical path issues with them?
<A - John W. Rowe>: Well, I think we did that largely, Steve, on an earlier question, the issue is what does the state as
an entity really want as an adequate demonstration of benefits to Maryland. And we put in a package to start with that
matched the scale of the FirstEnergy Alleghany package. We knew it would be a little different when you're talking
about buying the state's largest utility.
And the real issue is trying to guess what the commission wants because you can't talk directly to the commissioners,
and to work with the governor and the governor's office as to what they want, and as an earlier question explored, the
governor's office appears most interested in more renewables. The commissioners may have some interest in
accelerating the timing when additional gas capacity comes online. I think those are the nub issues. We hope we have
largely made the city happy with the offer to build a new office building in the city, but this is a multiparty negotiation
and it can all change a little before it's done.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay, I guess just conceptually the issue of wanting more gas generation is more of a
general issue that has a lot of broader implications, as I know you know, than just this merger. So, how do you resolve

something like that in the context of a merger?
<A - John W. Rowe>: Well, the problem with the merger is you are at a point when your need to negotiate is at the
highest. That's one of the prices you pay for the benefits you get. I don't think anyone thinks the whole issue of how
much new generation comes on in the East will be solved in the merger proceeding, but there is a public benefits test
here and we are going to see what's most important to people directionally. As you know that and you know this as well
as I do, this issue isn't confined to Maryland, we went through it one way in New Jersey and at FERC, it comes up in
Illinois on the proposed Tenaska plant: everybody likes markets except when they want something else.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. One other question totally separate on the EPA rules coming, I guess, soon. Just
what's your perspective on how, I mean, obviously a lot of the industry is pushing for more time in some cases, kind of
like a blanket extension of time. What's your perspective in how EPA is going to deal with the mix of the more time
and the economic worries issue in this – and the reliability issue, I guess that keeps getting brought up in this ruling?
<A - John W. Rowe>: I think we're going to try to make people prove the reliability point. There is a lot of talk about
reliability problems that simply don't exist and we're constantly pushing that they announce their shutdown plans and
then let FERC and PJM investigate whether they are any reliability issues. We think there will in fact be very few and
we're being very pugnacious about saying if you going to claim a reliability problem, prove it.
EPA has some discretion. We would certainly urge EPA to use its discretion where there are real reliability problems,
but not phony ones. And from an Exelon economic point of view, it doesn't trouble us much if people get a little more
time where they are actually putting on a new scrubber or some other major rehab. But, we're adamant that nobody
should get more time for a plant they're going to shut down anyway.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Great. Thanks, John.
<A - John W. Rowe>: Thanks, Steve.

Your next question comes from the line of Julian Smith with UBS.
<A - John W. Rowe>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - John W. Rowe>: Clearly.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. So I wanted to ask, you commented briefly before on CSAPR and seeing
some of that flow through. I mean, perhaps being a little bit more explicit about it. How much of an uplift do you
expect to see into implementation into year-end given where pricing is today? And then maybe can you comment a
little bit more granularly, call it West Hub versus NI Hub on that just to get a start?
<A - John W. Rowe>: I think I'll let Ken answer that, but I think the short answer is, we think a lot of that effect is
already in the market, but, Ken, go ahead.
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: We've consistently, in our modeling, seen about a $1 to $2 uplift in prices from the
Cross-State rule. We think that that is largely in the market, both NI Hub and West Hub. The $2 is more of a NI Hub
number and the $1 is more of the West Hub number.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you. With regards to residential retailing and aggregation, there seems to
have been quite a few developments of late in Illinois; it seems like there's an accelerating trend. Perhaps if you could
somewhat in light of your pending merger on your own activities and perhaps activities of others in the state to that
end, and where you anticipate seeing that moving as we look at 2012?

<A - John W. Rowe>: Well, we believe that with what's happened in power markets, what's happening in more
regulated jurisdictions, the opportunities for retail marketing are consistently increasing. Most large customers have
switched where they can. That's true in both Illinois and Pennsylvania and in other competitive markets. But we're
seeing more switching by small commercial customers, the beginnings of serious switching by residential customers
with more in Pennsylvania than in Illinois, but the trend is the same, and more efforts by municipalities to aggregate.
And this is one of the reasons why we value the Constellation purchase, because they're further along in developing
both the marketing groups and people and the backup IT platform than we are. With that I will turn it over to Ken.
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: We've been consistent in our marketing to commercial and industrial customers in Illinois
and that business remains a solid, viable business. We focus our attention on industrial and commercial customers in
Pennsylvania and have spent most of our time developing those systems and people and capability to market to that
segment. We continue to push and move into the Ohio area in the industrial and commercial segment. And as John
indicated, once we bring together the Constellation retail element, we will be in the residential market. We have no
activity in that market right now.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And then the last quick question, you've kind of alluded to previously with
regards to Maryland, perhaps just commenting a little bit more broadly, would you feel comfortable participating in the
RFP as it's proposed currently or any further flavor around the participation in what's been proposed?
<A - John W. Rowe>: I would like Darryl Bradford to pick up that. My own view is we might participate in the RFP,
but be more likely to be a nonconforming bid, but Darryl?
<A - Darryl M. Bradford>: Yes, John. The RFP has been extended out now so that responses aren't due until January.
As you may know, the Commission issued an RFP, the Maryland Energy Administration had some questions about the
shape of the RFP and whether it should be expanded to include renewables, so it's a matter that we're going to continue
to watch and evaluate, but from our viewpoint what that RFP looks like yet hasn't been settled, so I wouldn't want to
speculate on what we're going to do with it.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Quick clarification there actually. There was an allusion to DPL staff or potentially
expanding it on that front, is any comments on that one?
<A - John W. Rowe>: I'm sorry. I didn't understand the precise question.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: It seemed as if there was a comment in the RFP regarding perhaps extending it to the
DPL South region of PJM. Is there any comment around that? I mean you commented on the renewables expansion of
the RFP.
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: I think it just highlights the fact that from our viewpoint at least this is still forming, and
what it's going to look like and what it's going to encompass is from our viewpoint not yet settled and so we will look
forward to hearing from the state as to how this is shaped, what its requirements are, what other RFPs are going to be
there and then we will look at it holistically.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you all very much for the time.
<A - John W. Rowe>: Thank you.

Well, first, thank you everybody. Second if, Chris Crane and Bill Von Hoene, and Darryl Bradford, and Calvin Butler
are really successful, by the time we get to our next earnings call we might have closed Constellation. And if that's the
case, it would be a very good thing indeed; but if that's the case, this will be last time you'll hear from me on one of
these.
So I just want to make some points very crisply about what's going on here. Again and again over the last several years,
we have beaten estimates, we have proven that the machine works across the board, that different parts of the company,
find the extra at different times. And, yes, it's coincidental just which one performs when with the extra value. But
what's not coincidental is we've got a whole lot of hounds hunting and they do it really well and they're not here
because they are pretty; they're here because they produce results. And that's true in our nuclear operation, it's true in
the two delivery companies, it's true with our rate making people, it's true with Tom Terry's work on taxes, it's true with
Joe Dominguez's remarkable work in Ohio with Duke and AEP. Things are working here. And, Chris Crane will be as
absolutely dedicated to value as I'm; and this management team will be as dedicated to value without me as it has been
with me.
And you know and we know because your forecasts for the next couple of years aren't much different than ours that the
next couple of years are going to be tougher on an earnings basis. And you know and we know that there's nobody else
with the same upside that we have down the road. And it really is fortunate in my view they we're starting to see
glimmers of that upside in the power markets already. Energy just isn't going to be free in those markets indefinitely.
So, I really just want to end this by saying you have one hell of a team working for you here and they will continue to
deliver.
Thank you very much.
