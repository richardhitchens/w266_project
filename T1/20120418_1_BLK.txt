Presentation
Operator
Good morning. Good morning. My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would
like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2012 Earnings Teleconference. Our hosts for
today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Ann Marie
Petach; and General Counsel Matthew Mallow. [Operator Instructions]. After the speakers remarks, there will be a
question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.
Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.
Matthew Mallow, Senior Managing Director, General Counsel
Thanks very much. This is Matt Mallow. I am the General Counsel of BlackRock. And before Larry and Ann Marie
make their remarks, let me point out that, during the course of this conference call, we may make a number of
forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these
statements.
BlackRock has filed with the SEC reports which lists some the factors that may cause our results to differ materially
from any forward-looking statements we make today. And finally, BlackRock assumes no duty and you should not
expect that we will undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Ann Marie.

Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Uncertain markets continue in 2012. Markets began the year strong globally,
void by hopes for stability in Europe and positive economic data in the U.S. However, the mood remains fragile, and
some of those initial gains have sold-off as confidence and mood vary with each new data point. You can see that just
in the last two day. The initial market improvements and investor activity supported BlackRock's strong first quarter
results with EPS up 7%, compared to a year ago and 3%, compared to the fourth quarter.
Our financial performance highlights our strong focus on our clients needs and our ability to work with them, supported
by the breadth of our product set, our global presence and our unmatched risk tools. These strengths uniquely position
us to meet the diverse needs of clients in this complex and ever evolving market.
As seen in our branding campaigns, BlackRock is focusing on products and solutions that are especially important to
investors in this environment and this alignment with client needs is supporting our flows and our revenue. Our five
client focus areas drove our net new revenue for the quarter. We expect them to be substantial contributors to organic
revenue growth throughout 2012. At the same time, we saw the outflow of the previously identified 36 billion low fee
fixed income index mandate related to a single client who in-sourced the asset. The revenues associated with this
mandate was about $4 million.
Despite starting the year behind on high watermarks, strong performance in the first quarter allowed us to maintain
stable performance fees, compared to the first quarter of 2011. Our cost base is benefiting from actions we took in 2011
and supporting our margin. Supported by strong cash flow, the Board approved the 9% increase in our first quarter
dividend and increased our share repurchase authorization back up to 5 million shares. In the first quarter, we
repurchased 648,000 shares for about $125 million. The key takeaway for me is that our breadth and diversity have
positioned us well for organic growth and the ability to perform well in various market environments.
With that, let me quickly walk you through the results.
As I make my comments, I'll be referring to the slides in the supplement, which you can get from our website. And as
usual, I'm going to be talking primarily about as adjusted results. I've already talked about the trends, so I'm going to
move us right ahead to slide three.
Our first quarter operating margin was 38.6%. The margin improved sequentially when you adjust for two items. First
of all, we had seasonally high performance fees in the fourth quarter of 2011. And second of all, the first quarter had
seasonally high employment taxes. Sequentially, the margin reflected the benefits of the lower base comp resulting
from the restructuring we did last year, so this is partially offset by a sequential increase in marketing associated with
our commitment to the brand. Our comp-to-revenue ratio of 36.2% was consistent with the long-term range of 35%
when you normalize for the seasonal payroll taxes.
Taking a look at markets, as shown on slide four. The strong recovery in all global market benefited every -- all asset
classes since the fourth quarter and you can see that on the right hand column of the page. I am focusing on average
market since the majority of our equity fee is priced daily. Then if you look at the second column in, although, markets
are up compared to the fourth quarter, compared to a year ago, the story is quite different.
U.S. markets are up, on average 3%, but world markets as seen on MSCI, European markets, emerging markets, Asia
markets are still between 4% and 9% below the first quarter 2011. As a result of the diversity of our equity business,
about half of our equity AUM is tied to non-U.S. markets.
These mixed market results obviously impacted our revenues compared to a year ago, so it created headwinds for us
coming into the year. Though new business with clients and other revenue strength helped to buffer the headwinds
associated with these market effects. I'll start with a comparison of results to a year ago then discuss results compared
to the prior quarter.
On slide six, you can see that earnings per share of $3.16 included $3.10 of operating earnings and $0.06 of
non-operating income. EPS benefited from growth in long-dated assets, expense discipline and share repurchases. The
first quarter as adjusted tax rate was 31.5%. This sequentially is a half a point improvement and this reflected the
positive effect of state and local tax legislation and those benefits will continue for us going forward.

Operating earnings of 825 million, which you can see on slide seven, reflected expense discipline and improvements in
long-dated base fees. Our business model benefits from the first revenue sources. We've got a revenue slide laid out for
you on slide eight. First quarter revenues were 2.249 billion. This includes about 2 billion of base fees, 80 million of
performance fees and 123 million of BRS revenues. Flows into most long-dated products helped to drive growth in
long-dated base fees. At the same time, low rates and regulatory uncertainty have been a drag on our cash products.
As I mentioned before, strong performance in the first quarter allowed us to generate performance fees that were
comparable to 2011. And while our performance varies by fund, the gap to high watermarks for some funds was
eliminated completely and for other funds was narrowed to a couple of percentage points. We also continued to benefit
from strong performance on our traditional product, which generated 28 million of the total performance fees.
BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues of 123 million were relatively stable compared to the first quarter of 2011.
An almost 20% increase in our core line revenues was sufficient to offset, first of all, the non-recurrence of a larger
segment in the first quarter of 2011 and secondly, the successful disposition of assets from our advisory portfolios. The
49 billion decrease in advisory assets compared to a year ago was driven by dispositions, which have broadly benefited
U.S. tax payer. The appetite for BRS remain strong both on the lending and the advisory side, something Larry is going
to talk more about.
Despite the effects of negative world equity market, first quarter base fees, which you can see on slide nine, on
long-dated assets are up compared to 2011. This is driven by clients putting assets into income, multi-asset and index
products and to an improved set lending environment.
Just to note a few highlights. Revenues on multi-asset class products are up 11% compared to a year ago. And to put
the growth of iShares revenues into perspective, the revenues are up 7% from the first quarter of 2011 and up 28% from
the first quarter of 2010. The only long-dated asset class with a notable revenue decline compared to a year ago is
active equity. And that is explained by the flows of quant products over the past year. Given our strong performance on
these products and really on a three year basis, we're now 80% above benchmark. We continue to believe that this trend
will reverse itself. And as a matter of fact, the quant outflows were at their lowest level in a single quarter since the
BGI merger.
Compared to a year ago, we also saw about a 20% decline, a little more than that from the exodus of cash products, low
yields driving that.
Looking at expenses now on slide ten, our expense discipline continued, combined with an absence of close end
launches, resulting in a 3% decrease in adjusted expenses. And adjacent to the reduced launch cost, G&A benefited
from lower occupancy cost as we eliminated double rents booked in Princeton and London when we were moving to
new locations. We also maintained stable marketing cost. This is despite the launch of our major new brand campaign,
which I hope and assume everyone has seen at this point.
Keep in mind that the first quarter campaign launched in late February, so reflected only one month of our actual
advertising expense. This is an important long-term investment already paying off in the volume and quality of dialog
with our clients, also something Larry is going to talk more about.
Compensation expense was more than explained by an increase in base comp. We have invested in the business and
added great talent over the past year. Our investments were focused around ETFs, income, retirement, solutions and
alternatives. These are the same themes which are resonated with our clients and generated organic revenue growth.
Further, as evidenced of our investment in the business, in the first quarter, we closed the Claymore transaction, that's
our Canadian ETF platform, we launched 44 new iShares product.
Moving on to sequential results. Operating results were relatively stable, despite seasonal factors, aided by favorable
markets and a strong client response.
On slide 12, EPS improved by $0.10 compared to the fourth quarter, including $0.14 associated with improved marks
on our pro and seed investments.

Relatively stable operating income of 825 million, as seen on slide 13, reflected strong markets and seasonal factors,
which I'll talk about as we continue on slide 14, looking at revenues. Organic growth and strong markets resulted in a
114 million sequential base fee improvement, shown in the green, offset by lower seasonal performance fees, 67
million. The fourth quarters are peak last periods for performance fees. And recall that in the fourth quarter of 2011, we
completed a very large advisory assignment in BRS, accounting for the decline in BRS revenues.
As discussed earlier, the combination of strong markets and flows benefited all asset classes. Base fees are shown on
slide 15. It was particularly strength in iShares, resulting in revenues of 594 million and now representing almost a
third of our total base fees. We did put a new slide in the supplement with various breakouts of revenues that we
thought would be beneficial to you.
We saw robust flows into, both equity and fixed income iShares, specifically emerging markets and a large array of
income oriented products. Further, we saw continued strength in both asset class revenues and strength in first quarter
defined contribution flows.
It's encouraging to see the themes we believe to be so critical to our clients, playing out in our flows and revenues as
we begin the year. I mentioned earlier, our continued expense discipline. I'm now on slide 16. The base comp benefits
of our fourth quarter personnel reduction were more than offset by the seasonal effect of first quarter payroll taxes,
driving that increase in comp and benefits, sequentially.
Direct fund and distribution expense increased with our strong asset growth. The $34 million reduction in G&A
includes a $15 million increase in sequential marketing expense, associated with our brand campaign that was more
than offset by other cost reductions, including we had no fund launch costs in the quarter, lower occupancy expense
and lower professional fees. Non-operating income of 15 million is shown on slide 18 and included 55 million of
positive marks, primarily as you can see on our co-investments in private equity on the left hand side and distressed
credit in the middle bar.
The value of the investment portfolio was up about 18%, closing the quarter at 1.2 billion, excluding hedges. The
growth related primarily to seeding, include that we seeded two new European income funds important for future
growth and markets. As a reminder, we invest alongside and aligned with our clients and seed new products as required
for the base business. So, we have no proprietary investments.
Our revenues and business model are predicated on acting as fiduciaries on behalf of our clients and receiving a fee for
providing those services. Our balance sheet remains small with less than 8 billion of economic tangible assets,
primarily composed of cash, receivables and the investment portfolio.
So, wrapping up, summing up on slide 19, we delivered a healthy margin and returned a large amount of cash to
shareholders, resulting in over a 70% payout in the first quarter. Our cash flow generation allows us ample opportunity
to reward shareholders consistently.
Our operating cash flow in the quarter reflected, both the strong operating results and also the fact that we make our
annual incentive comp payments in the first quarter.
Looking ahead, we're extremely excited about opportunities we have to work with our clients in 2012, and believe we
are uniquely positioned to continue helping them navigate this challenging environment. We've entered the year
benefiting from our business model and client focus.
Our intense focus on delivering to clients needs generated top-line revenue growth across long-dated asset classes as
clients responded to investment themes, designed to benefit them in these times.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry to discuss the external environment, his dialogue and what we're seeing with our
clients and the ways in which we can help them navigate these markets.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Ann Marie.
Before I talk about 2012 and the first quarter and going forward, it probably makes sense for me to reflect how we got
into 2012 and talk about 2011.
The volatility we saw in 2011 really froze many, many clients worldwide. Cash buildup grew up throughout 2011.
Investing in bonds, short-term bonds as a means to preserve wealth was a norm for most investors worldwide. And we
saw, as an overall portfolio in 2011, pronounced de-risking.
Although the markets had risk on, risk off, risk on, risk off, I would say the preponderance of investors worldwide
added more cash in short-term bonds over the course of 2011 than they did in some incremental investing and more risk
on products. We certainly also saw in 2011 more bar-belling strategies going into beta products, index and ETFs and
going into alternatives.
And it was the uncertainty from the U.S. in terms of our management of our deficits and our fiscal discipline, and
which was essentially the lows from the latter part of the second quarter going into the third quarter. And then, we have
the European crisis really coming to a real crisis in the third and fourth quarter last year.
We began to see stability in the world, as the U.S. economy started showing some rays of hope that there is stability.
But more importantly the actions from the ECD with their long term financing vehicle LTRO that provided the
necessary liquidity to stabilize Europe. And from that we then began to see client starting to focus on how the risk they
were. And then going into 2012 we certainly saw large scale clients moving from cash position into longer dated bonds
into credit type products into dividend like equity products all the types they seems that we are focused on in our
campaign. And so overall, we saw some risking into the market.
However, if you think about the internal generation of cash, I would still say the fears of the investors still is more
overwhelming than the hope for a better future. So, we despite the global equities from it's flows I would still qualify
the market to be quite fragile. Additives are basically on a broader line pessimism than optimism. And also we are
seeing this from our perspective we see behavior, we're still seeing most companies been very risk adverse. I think
we're going to see in the first quarter above forecast earnings essentially the reason for that is everybody is overlaying a
overview of pessimism not optimism. And we are actually seeing performance better than that pessimistic view and
therefor we're saying in terms of corporate earnings more exceeds than this is.
But as we enter the second quarter, I still believe there is a great deal of uncertainty ahead of us. It is very hard for
investors and CEO's and politicians to decipher between the good news and the bad news. It is very difficult for
investors to have truly a long-term view. And so this growth investing in bonds continues -- cash build up continues
mostly through bank deposits less in money market funds as an industry. And so I don't believe the future is much
different than it has been. But it is remarkable to think about how strong equity markets were in the first quarter, with
just some incremental investing in equities. This is why, as I said last year as I said February this year I still believe that
equity more than ever before. Because we witnessed with just small investing a pretty substantial rally in the equity
markets and that just as a great sign of how d-risk people are.
And as you look back in the first quarter we saw large scale repurchase this stocks from corporation, a very modest
calendar of IPOs. And so as we enter the second quarter, the outstanding of equities in the world is less today that it
was in January 1st. And so it is so we're seeing feel behavior purchasing shares back, raising dividends all
fundamentally strong foundations for a better equity market. But let us be clear we are not seeing major changes in
investor behavior, we're seeing some re-risking. So incrementally versus the third and fourth quarter of last year, yes
we are seeing a lot more investing but I don't believe to the it had a quite well we could say the markets are going to be
really strong because of strong a transition out of the cash, out of more bonds as equities, that's just not happening yet.
Despite all that I thought very well which I'm going to talk about in minute. I think the U.S. economy will be and will
continue to be a strength in the world economy. We believe the U.S. economy can grow between 2.5% and 2.8%. We
are seeing stability in the employment market, we are seeing incremental from the private sector some job growth. We
are still seeing some negative flow jobs created from the public sector. And I should remind everybody if we have to do
tackle our federal deficits that is another way of saying we will have less jobs in our federal government as we tackle

our deficits. And so we do need a robust private sector and we do need a robust job creator in the private sector and
that's going to be very important going forward.
Volatility in the world will continue in the next few weeks. We have a serious important elections in France, we have
elections in the United States in November. And it's very important that everyone focus on the issues around the U.S.
deficits.
We in our quest to trying to stabilize our fiscal discipline we created this $1.2 trillion mandatory decline in spending
beginning next year of which $700 billion will be for our military budget. This should start having impact on our
economy in the second and third quarter as businesses that are cheaply doing business with our military and it depend
they're going to have stay focused on what is this decline in defense spending means for their companies. And so I have
that time in watching urging congress to focus on it today, because this is not an issue that they need to focus on
November as they think they are back against the wall. I am trying to alert Congress today, they are back against wall at
this moment. This is behavior I have to respond not as quickly as politician but over a multi-quarter period of time. And
I do believe you are going see this is behavior change as we head towards the ultimate decline in military spending, we
don't address that.
One last thing on the macro issues. I do believe oil is going to play a more significant role in terms of the outcome of
different parts of the world. I think the oil prices have a real influence of the ECB behavior. I do believe the ECB have
the ease. If their interest rates are 1% but because the oil playing a significant issue around inflation the reluctance to
ease in Europe is going to be very pronounced if we don't see a reduction in oil prices. If we can't see an oil price
reduction and some magnitude, I do believe the ECB will ease, will ease aggressively because it is our opinion that the
euro has the fall in value for the sovereign European countries to ever find growth. Right now the sovereign politicians
are constantly working on fiscal discipline which arose the economy, which creates greater strains on their population,
greater strains on the issues of unemployment in the sovereign. And so we also need to find ways of growth in Europe
and growth beyond the Northern rim. If we don't find that growth we will have more serious issues as I said earlier the
ECB issues is not a three year problem that working out it's a four, five, six, seven year issue.
So what does this all mean for BlackRock, with all this noise? We have seen a great interest with our clients worldwide
and working with BlackRock to help them in guidance with advice in terms of how they should navigate their
liabilities, how they should invest into assets to meet those liabilities. So I do believe our business model today is more
valid, it's never been more valid than today. In terms of working with clients as they try to decipher the good news and
the bad news, the push and pull of markets and I believe we are witnessing a real large increase in this type of advice.
We are certainly seeing this in the form of our BlacRock Solution area, but we are seeing this in our multi-asset class
area, we're seeing that in match, we are seeing that in find contribution business. Some of this has been manifest in an
increased performance in our ETF iShares platform, some of it as I said the defined contribution, some of this in our
alternatives business.
So excluding as and we discussed of this one time previously announced outflow of a piece of index business that was
out of our control this organization portfolio was assumed by our government and they internalize the internalized the
assets. We had approximately $25.7 billion of long-term flows, very diversified. And when I look at the environment of
the world, we were very pleased with that type of organic growth across many spectrums. And it actually -- these
long-term flows actually corresponded to our brand campaign, our focus areas of ETFs, retirement income, multi-asset
strategy solutions and alternatives. So it's validated our platform.
As our press release announced, we have approximately $3.685 trillion of assets. We witnessed over $200 billion of net
growth in long-term assets to $3.34 trillion. And what I think is also interesting as we focus on BlackRock's mix. Our
mix continues to increase in the multi-asset strategy area where we are closed to $246 billion. We added more assets in
alternatives to $110 billion. Fixed income ended the quarter with $1.244 trillion, and equities $1.744 trillion. So once
again, it's this business model of mix. It's a global business model, it's a solution-based business model that truly helped
us navigate what I would call -- in a very uncertain time in the marketplace.
The other thing that I think is important to relate, especially relative to the S&P. We entered this year with
below-market level of revenues because of the performance of global equities outside the U.S. in the third and fourth

quarter. And so, when everyone focused on the S&P, the S&P was flat. And yet, as Ann Marie discussed earlier, there
were some obviously very negative market performance numbers oversees in the third and fourth quarter. We have that
big hole to overcome, we did. And so this is another reason why I'm particularly proud of how we navigated in this
quarter.
Before I get into some of the business highlights, let me just discuss some of the investments we made. Obviously,
we're making investment in our brand. We believe our brand is becoming more and more important. It is significant for
us to expand our brand. Our retail distribution partners have told us, you need to expand your brand. We need to have
some demand pull instead of sell push and we are accomplishing that. The brand recognition is growing. The types of
inquiries we receive globally in terms of our brand initiative has been quite strong. It is that brand campaign that has
helped us to distinguish and it helped our clients decipher some of the noise. It is helping them understand where they
should be focusing in these uncertain times, and how they can navigate higher returns and mitigate some of the
associated risk.
We had more inquiry than we've ever had with our website. We had more inquiry with our telephone operators than
we've ever had before, not just in the U.S. but worldwide. And so the impact is immediate. And we expect that impact
to transform into sales over the course of the next few quarters and years. So we continue to believe in this. We believe
it is differentiating us. We believe we're being thoughtful, helpful and most importantly we want to come across as a
solution provider to all our clients from our retail clients to our largest institutional client.
The other area that we continue to invest and we will continue to invest and that is investing in our people as we see
more and more opportunity to expand our platform. As I said over multiple quarters, we are not actually looking at
large-scale acquisitions. I could tell you, today we are contented enough looking at large-scale acquisitions. I've never
seen an environment with more companies for sale, when we have not showed any interest in doing that. What we are
doing, though, is looking for talented teams to augment our platform already. We added a emerging market debt team
in Europe. We added a new head of one of our emerging market equity teams. We're adding more people across our
capital markets, trading platform, marketings, communication. We're adding heavily in technology, which I'll get into
in a minute, and risk in our quantitative analysis group.
The one thing that I think the world doesn't understand in terms of cost, and that's the regulatory environment. The
regulatory environment continues to take shape. I don't know what this totally means for BlackRock, but we're
investing large sums of money to become compliant and stay ahead of regulations. This regulation will be required for
all asset managers, all hedge funds, all private equity firms. We are talking about regulations such as Form PF, which is
going to be requiring reporting derivative holdings to the CFTC and to the SEC. This is a large-scale need. We -- this is
client-by-client reporting that has to be done on a continuum. We have FACTA, which we are going to have to report.
This is a big issue for our EMEA area. We have a AIFMD, the alternative investment fund management directive, in
EMEA.
This is all requiring a buildup of technology. This is requiring building up more -- a larger team with our regulators.
This is not just a BlackRock phenomenon. This is an industry phenomenon. This is going to be a large-scale need
worldwide. One of the reasons why -- which I'll talk about it later on, why we are seeing more and more interest in
Aladdin and BlackRock Solutions is because the need for better technology, better systems. This is not just for our risk
management reason, it is for reporting purposes too. Having a single technology platform is going to be imperative to
properly submit all your necessary regulatory requirements to all the regulators worldwide.
And so, we are trying to stay ahead of this. We are investing money and time for this, and I do believe this is going to
be a very large component of how other asset managers are going to have to respond. This is -- as I just want to
underscore it, this is not a BlackRock-only situation. It is an industry-wide issue. Society is looking for greater
transparency, greater information. And we are staying ahead of that, making sure we are compliant with all our clients
worldwide. And we do believe, because of our position, we have a higher fiduciary standard in making sure we do this
as properly as possible.
Let me discuss quickly some of the businesses things. Ann Marie did a very good summary of a lot of the business
issues.

Our iShares business was a standout in the quarter, with $18.2 billion in net new business, which was remarkable. This
is inline with our growth in the fourth quarter. Traditionally, in the first quarter we have sometimes outflows, as you
saw big inflows in the fourth quarter and outflows in the first quarter. The whole industry saw a very large increase in
the utilizations of ETFs. As I said, I think a lot of the ETF flows was related to this modest risk on client -- added risk,
added beta. As they were probably mismatched and too much concentration in cash and in bonds, they added more
exposure, more beta, whether it's long-term bond beta or a high-yield beta or beta in equities or commodities. They did
it through ETFs.
We are seeing a trend, though, of more and more investors using beta products as alpha. We are seeing more and more
investors tactically allocating, using ETFs to get greater exposure to an asset category to a region, and ETFs are playing
a more demonstrable role in that. I believe that will be become a larger and larger component, and this is why we
believe ETFs will continue to drive more and more growth. We are still not seeing ETF cannibalizing the mutual fund
business. The mutual fund business is slow because people are not adding risk. I'll get into ours in a minute, but it is -- I
don't believe much of this is cannibalization. I believe most of the growth in ETFs are in new participants in these
products. Much of it is institutional, as they use beta for alpha.
The band across the ETF platform was oriented towards fixed income. For us, we had $9.4 billion of net flows. We
captured 46% of the fixed income flows for the quarter. Particularly great where our U.S. and Canada iShares products
growing by $14.5 billion however a lot of this is driven in emerging markets and move of our high yield products. Our
emphasis in dividends was rewarded also in because we saw equity income grow we saw high yield grow to about $8.2
billion inflows.
We also saw as people went back into the emerging markets after a huge outflow in the third and fourth quarter, we
have $2.7 billion inflows in our emerging market product ETF is now extends about $40 billion.
And we suggested we closed the Claymore transaction with a wonderful time in the close on it we had good flow in
Canada. And more importantly we have the dominant position both institutionally and retail in market ETF market
Canada, which we are very happy with. BlackRock, legacy BlackRock was much stronger institutional in Canada but
Claymore transaction really helped us on the retail side. So we can see more pleased with our position in Canada today.
And as I said earlier we really looking to do in market types of transactions like that if we can find opportunities
augment our position in different products such as ETF.
International iShares we grew by $3.7 billion, we had 59% of the EDM market much of that was had to do with a lot of
market participants. We're living the note related and the derivative types of ETN products and moving in to the
physical based products we have been the large beneficiary of that as we have aggressively discussed the attributes of
physical based ETF versus derivative based ETF.
The credit exposure that investors have with derivative based ETFs.
As a another example of our culture of innovation, we continue to build up more products, we added 44 new iShares
products and we discussed in those products that attracted already in the first quarter $700 million in new flows. And
we continue to try be as innovative as any organization. On the retail side, we continue to strength in the U.S. and we
continue to build our presence in the U.S. So we have many participants had outflows in retail mutual funds, we
actually in the U.S. had $1.2 billion of a net long-term flows. Another example how we are building our brand, we are
building our presence in the retail area. In our European mutual funds we had a modest $100 million of outflows, that is
example of the uncertainty in Europe and some of the uncertainty in Asia.
Hopefully we can stabilize the businesses in Europe, but I think the European mutual fund business is going through as
transition as the marketplace try just to understand what it means with the sovereign debt prices as of Europe.
In terms of institutional business, we are still seeing clients being very, very cautious. Most of our clients institutionally
they are adding data, they are adding data mostly in faster strategies to gain that market exposure. But we are seeing
some inflows in our active products. In our Americas institutional business we had $7.7 billion of growth, which was
driven $5.7 billion in our active product. Lot of that was in our multi-asset class solutions. We also had a $1 billion

award of a very large international client, tat is a best idea strategy for BlackRock a huge award with a very large
international client.
Our defined contribution continues to grow nicely, we are close to $10 billion of growth, split evenly between active
and passive strategies, which $3 billion was in LifePath multi-asset strategy offering. As we discussed in our branding
campaign and as we discussed in many other forums, we believe a focus on longevity is essential. We do not believe so
many Americans are adequately investing for their retirement properly. We believe they are miscalculating how long
they are going to live and we have a serious growing crisis in this country in terms of meetings indeed of longevity of
life.
As I said at many forums, we spend so much time focusing on health. As humans are trying to find new ways of
extending our life, but we are spending so little time how to afford that longevity. This is something that where
BlackRock is trying to provide answers, solutions, hope and I think we are beginning that dialogue with many people
on trying to find that solution. But it is essential that we all, all of us in our industry focused the needs of financing
longevity in this country. This is not I should say this country this is a worldwide problem it's just as dial in other parts
of the world too and making sure that we are saving enough.
EMEA institutionally generated about a $1.5 billion in inflows despite all the caution and d-risking, particularly that
was for a large benefit plan. And we continued to see growth in our index strategies. But we about $3 billion is in the
active strategies in Europe predominantly in UK equities as people d-risk in the UK and some of the credit strategies.
I predictably pleased the first quarter our growth in alternatives, we had about $800 million of net new business during
the quarter. But we are involve so much dialogues. We've never had more dialogue with our alternative strategies as we
have before. This is what we've been talking about over the last year so as we are seeing client bar-belling using data
and using more alternatives strategy, that is persisting, that is continuing to grow, that is not just a U.S phenomena that
is a worldwide phenomena.
And in Asia-Pac we've had one some outflows in Japan particularly we have $3 billion of outflows. We actually using
some very good inquires in Japan right now and more opportunities. So, I don't believe there is anything that is
systemic about what happen in Asia.
Let me talk about BlackRock Solutions. The need for Congress management, analytics continues the drive demand for
our Aladdin based services. We're particularly encouraging while BRS revenues were down year-over-year by $5
million we saw 19% growth in Aladdin revenues. So we transform the one time wins into long dated sticky revenues so
this 19% growth in a Aladdin was one of the biggest growth rates we've had in the last few years, is indicative of what
we see and the opportunities we have in Aladdin. I have to remember we had as Ann discussed some large dispositions
in our advisory business, which reduced our fees. And we also had one very large governmental assignment, one time
advisory assignment the first quarter last year that we obviously it was a one time assignment.
So, if you look at the consistency of growth in the Aladdin side, this really encourage us to believe that we have huge
growth opportunities going forward as we are becoming more and more as percentage of revenues been Aladdin versus
the one time and product revenues I am not trying to suggest the advisory revenues are good they are wonderful they
actually in many cases the one time advisory revenues translates into Aladdin contract, so it is a very, very important
component of the BlackRock Solutions business.
The momentum is strong, as I said Aladdin we won a very large assignment in Japan another example how we are
becoming global in this platform. We now have $12.3 trillion in the Aladdin platform that we are navigating risk for
clients and providing an operating system and that as a record level.
There have been quite a bit of noise related to the BlackRock Aladdin trading network, let me try to give a little more
clarity about this. We are responding to the regulatory regime that is transforming the future ways of the sale side of
this business. Under Basel III, banks are going to really require to have higher capital. Because of the Volcker rule
banks are going to have more in addition and some prohibition in doing principle trading. The natural outcome of that
will be probably wider bid-ask spreads, and I want to underline probably. Well, last, if we could see a narrowing in
bid-ask spreads, quite frankly we don't need the Aladdin trading platform. We are doing this with the idea that we want

to be the most and highest level of fiduciary to our clients. And if we are seeing a persistent widening in spreads, we
believe this system will continue to be Aladdin will flourish and grow.
And so, we are doing this with our sales right now where we are trying to cross more and more trades and through our
Aladdin clients wishes, they ask to come on to this platform. And so we are beginning the process in which we are
going to be adding some clients to this platform. And what -- let me underscore it, it will only be Aladdin based clients
that are going to be permitted to go on to this platform.
For BlackRock trades, there is no commissions on this. We are not going to make -- we're not trying to become a
broker dealer. We are trying to be a fiduciary in minimizing our friction cost of trades. For our clients that are on the
Aladdin system, we are going to try to charge a fee that overcomes our cost and that is it. It is our intention through this
platform in terms of revenues. Hopefully, this will be another mechanism, another reason why clients want to go into
Aladdin system. And if they are allowed, if they are on the Aladdin system for risk management, they'll have access to
this platform, that will be the revenue model as we design this.
But this is not going to transform BlackRock in anyway. This is not going to change our behavior, our relations with
the sell side. They are going to be powerful counter parties and powerful partners for us. And so, I just want to diminish
this noise around this, we look at this as raising the bar in fiduciary standard. Hopefully, this will augment more
Aladdin like revenues over the course of the next few years. But let's be clear, this is a long-term, multi-year strategy.
This is not unlike when we've launched the Aladdin trading -- Aladdin technology platform as a mechanism to expand
our relationships with our clients.
We are going to continue to invest in our Aladdin system. I am very pleased to say that we are now winning more
assignments in equities. So Aladdin system used to be only bonds, it's now in equities. So, we are now having great
opportunities across all our existing clients to offer the Aladdin system across all the different asset categories.
Our SMA business, although we had those one-time wins last year and we had some dispositions for our clients,
continues to generate strong returns. And we are -- we have been awarded another country assignment, which I am not
going to divulge, so we're working with another European country right now. It is public that we work for Ireland and
it's been public that we've been reengaged by Ireland this quarter. It is public that we are working on behalf of the
Greek central bank. It is not public related to another central bank assignment in Europe. So, we continue to be a firm
that institutions are looking for advice and help. And it's -- and it continues to drive and differentiate BlackRock for the
future.
Let me just talk about some notable performance. We had very good performance at our hedge funds. We overcome
some of our high watermark hurdles in products like Obsidian. Our FIGA product continues to differentiate ourselves.
R3 had a very good first quarter. Our equity dividend fund continues to grow and continues to differentiate it. European
equities, year-after-year, quarter-after-quarter, they have done an amazing job. Global allocation to outperformed our
benchmarks in the first quarter, that's our $8 billion go anywhere product that Dennis Stattman runs.
Our fixed income mortgage operation had a very good quarter performance. Global bond continues to do well.
Municipal retail has had another good quarter. So overall, I would say it was a very good quarter in terms of our
products, our performance and the performance in the products that we are really pushing.
Ann Marie discussed quite a bit about capital management. We are committed in increasing shareholder value through
capital management decisions. We increased our dividend by 9%. We are -- we continue to repurchase shares. We have
authority for 5 million share repurchase. We continue to think and believe that we have great opportunity. We do have
about $3 plus billion of free cash flow. As I said earlier in this talk, I am not here thinking that we're not going to ever
do a large merger again, so I would suggest that our position about using -- utilizing our free cash flow for dividend and
for capital management through shares is going to be a position that we're going to take over the course of the next few
years.
We are very interested in, as I said, doing fill in mergers, but we are -- with the opportunity that we have in lift outs of
teams, as we showed that we were able to do that in the first quarter, we will continue to do that too.

So, overall, the first quarter was a good one. I am very proud of how we positioned our self going forward, this year. I
am remarkably excited about where we are and where we're going. I am -- I really do believe we are as well positioned
as any asset manager in the world -- we are as well positioned at BlackRock as we've been in the last six years, we don't
have mergers to worry about, we don't have a world collapse to worry about. We're focused on clients, we're focused
on providing solutions to the clients and we're well positioned globally worldwide with our team to provide those
solutions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Nomura.
Corporate Participant
Hi, Glenn. How are you?
Glenn Schorr
Great. Thanks. Thanks very much. I guess the first question I have is Larry just mentioned the $3 billion or plus of free
cash flow. The 72% payout was bigger than where you had been running the last, call it two years. And just curious on
if that's a high level of payout that we should expect or you -- or 50 is your best guesstimate going forward, as you
indicated in the past?
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
No. Well, no. The 70 odd percent is a combination of stock repurchases and dividend. Our payout ratio of dividend is
going to be between 40 and 50. I don't want it ever to be higher. But last year, I think we paid out 120 something
percent. I don't want to -- that in terms of -- so, I expect it to -- I think, to be very frank, we expect to use our free cash
flow opportunistically up to the Board approval in terms of utilizing that free cash flow to do whatever is necessary to
support a robust stock.
Glenn Schorr
Fair enough. On the trading system, just curious on the basic principles of it. Is it a similar crossing network that you
see in some of the equity markets where trades get done when there are same security, same price at the same time,
trades crossing at the same time? And can you pre-load pre-existing trades and underneath the covers, so to speak and
wait for them to be hit? Just curious on how it's going to actually work?
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I believe that is the design, that is the design of the platform. Right now, it is obviously crossing and all that as we get
more and more players on it. There is going to be some transparency where the underlying desires of sellers and buyers
will be.

Glenn Schorr
Got it. One other question on the new product pipeline has been good and you've been able to consistently launch new
funds. I think you launched four new fixed income ETFs in April. So, I guess the question is -- there has been some
attention in the press to credit ETFs in terms of providing, promoting volatility in the markets. Just curious if it's gotten
any regulator attention and how you feel about that because it's obviously a big growth business?
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
There's certainly regulatories reviews on all things related to ETFs at the moment. Much of it in the Europe has to do
with -- ETFs. There is obviously reviews by the FCC in the freeze in terms of leverage ETFs. They're not allowing new
ETFs with any leverage to be created until they have a full review. Specifically, in terms of credit ETFs, I'm not aware
of any inquiry from any specific regulator. Matt?
Matthew Mallow, Senior Managing Director, General Counsel
No, I'm not aware of any, either.
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
So, I believe there is greater and greater demand for credit. Whether you see that in separate accounts or you see it in --
or you see that in ETFs. ETFs gives you more transparency and clarity where the market is going. But, I don't think
ETFs are adding any more volatility than when you see large scale demand in any one product, whether it is in physical
based securities, separate account or through a publicly traded vehicle, like an ETF.
I cannot understand why somebody would say the ETF creates more volatility than demand in any other physical based
separate account. So, I don't understand that noise, if there is such noise. And I'll just leave at that.
Glenn Schorr
Okay. And may be last one is just on margin. There is always a bunch of moving parts and obviously, the first quarter
has the performance fee, give back. But, given higher asset levels and what's clear
expense control, even in the face of the marketing campaign, any reason to think that margins won't be in and around
that 39% level that you've been in for a long time?
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I see no reason why over the course of the year, margins will be consistent as they were last year, 39% is a good
benchmark, 39.5%. Whatever that comes in, it should be a good benchmark. I just want to overlay the issue around
regulatory issues. I was trying to be very specific on that. Regulation costs a lot of money. And so, I don't want to -- I'm
not here to tell you we're lowering our margin expectations, so I'm not saying that. But, I am saying that we are
spending a great deal of time of making sure we're compliant. And I don't believe this could be a onetime cost that's
going to be very large.
Once we get it routinized on the system, it will certainly -- certainly, once we get it on the system, cost will be less.
But, it really depends on how we are going to be regulated, and how many more people do we need to interface with
regulators as regulation of asset managers increases across the board, so. But, at this moment, I am not saying it's going
to have any major impact on margins.

Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Craig.
Craig Siegenthaler
Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Larry. If we look at the core institutional pipeline, the sequential
change there, I'm wondering if you can just comment on kind of what drove the decline there if we back out the $36
billion mandate? And also, are you seeing a mix shift in your institutional clients into ETFs out of passive mandates?
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
There's no question, you're seeing -- those institutions who are adding beta -- tactical purposes they're doing -- couple
of sovereign wealth funds who historically used index funds are now using ETFs. And so, yeah, there is a change in
mix, but it's not entirely. And our pipeline, I don't think it's sequentially that much lower -- keep in mind, we are not
forecasting ETFs, as you suggested, or retail in those flows and -- but there are -- you're seeing behavior change with
some institutions going using ETFs because they value liquidity more than the cost of the -- than -- obviously, for those
clients who believe that they're going to be sitting with a beta exposure over a period of time, they will go into index
funds with -- liquidity, we are seeing --
Craig Siegenthaler
And then on SEC lending fees, the second quarter is always your seasonally strong quarter for these fees. So, if we
think about the changes in rates over the last year and really kind of what hedge fund activity is doing, which seems to
be another driver, how should we think about the step up in SEC lending fees, which flows through management fees in
the second quarter?
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we had obviously a very good first quarter in this, we are seeing more hedged fund shorting stocks looking for
shares. So, utilization was up in the first quarter, and we -- utilization -- second quarter. And quite frankly, in a very
short end of the curve, there's a yield curve. It's like a few basis points, but there is a yield curve at the very shortest
period of point. And so, a combination of utilization rates and then -- Ann Marie, do you have any comments related to
-- quarter?

I think that's good. --

Your next question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry of Goldman Sachs.
Marc Irizarry
Great. Thanks. Maybe you guys can talk about just the in-sourcing this quarter. When you look across your AUM, is
there some more of that low fee index oriented mandates that might be at risk as you look forward?
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
No.
Marc Irizarry
Okay, great. Thanks. And then, on -- Larry, on the world of fixed income in terms of the bar-belling between alpha and
beta strategies, if you will, can you just talk a little bit about what's happening in core and core plus, and just how
important credit is becoming in institutional allocations?
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, it's very hard for -- pension liabilities to meet their liability needs with -- without
having some type of income in credit strategies. They're not going to -- they're certainly not going to -- duration
anymore with even long -- we are seeing across the board a very strong interest in credit -- strategy. We're seeing
increased interest in hedged --credit. But core strategy with treasury market being so dominant -- you're seeing more
core plus interest and more credit oriented -- across the board -- more strategies that are global in nature, emerging
markets in nature. So, you're seeing institutions really -- So, obviously, for those who have the luxury of having their
assets and liabilities pretty matched, owning bonds is a very sensible thing to do. -- I'm not trying to suggest across the
board owning fixed income or owning in treasuries is not a thing to do. Unfortunately, so many of our pension plans
are sitting with very large -- and they're all addressing it. And this is another reason why we're seeing more interest in
dividend related -- and, obviously, try to reduce as much -- But I think -- pension funds. And it's a real question, can
these organizations tolerate for a couple of more years and sit in bonds -- is that the sensible thing to do.
Obviously, if you're incredibly risk adverse -- cost. And we are trying to identify to clients, at -- what type of costs this
is -- first quarter, the average pension fund had greater mismatches as a result of market performance last year, as we
saw lower rates also -- value of their assets went down. So, it's not a pretty picture.

Your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Cynthia.
Cynthia Mayer
Hi. Good morning. I apologize if you mentioned this, but are you guys still targeting a comp-to-revenues ratio around
34.5% or 35%?
Ann Marie Petach, Senior Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, we're still in that 35% range. It's a little higher in the first because you get your annual bonus -- it's always a little
higher in the first quarter.
Cynthia Mayer
Got it. Okay. And then, on the move to the physically backed ETFs overseas, do you feel as though that still has room
to go that you could still gain more share there, or is that pretty much run its course at this point?
Corporate Participant
Well, I am not sure they gained more share, but I don't think -- one of our -- one of the derivative based ETF players
translated its business into physical base. So, I don't think it's run its course because I do believe most -- most buyers
are going to be looking for physical based products. And I think that awareness has been -- is basically more apparent.
Obviously, we have 55% market share in Europe and so, the last thing I'm going to do is forecast a higher market share.

on alternative products has never been stronger. I think you said a kind of similar commentary to prior quarter and
showing up in your flows a little bit more this quarter. So, just wondering if you could segment your client base a little
bit for the alternative interest. So, which institutional clients are most interested, -- interested --?

It's -- platforms -- institutionally -- we're having dialogues. I would say, our penetration with foundation -- pension
plans, especially in Europe. EMEA has been a very strong growth area. Hopefully, we're going to be closing one of our
private equity types of strategies, a lot of participation that in Europe. And so, it is growing worldwide, our penetration
is -- strong with smaller institutions. And -- but there is not one area or - that I could suggest to you that this looking to
add alternative to BlackRock. But it's -- I can say, geographically, Europe has been a particularly large area of growth
for us.
Matthew Kelley
Okay. Great. Thanks. So, one follow-up for me. Just curious to get your thoughts on what we need for retail investors
to truly reengage in equity mutual funds. I know you said that the markets are still skittish and I am sure you feel like --
the clients feel like they've been burned a couple of times in the market. So, what do you think we really need?
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Oh my gosh. Look, I think we -- it's all a confidence game. It's a confidence game from our politicians, we need
leadership. It's a confidence game with our CEOs, we need leadership. It's confidence game from the FAS to give
people more confidence. In the United States, I think, as we see a stabilization in housing, which we expect to see next
year, that will be a -- for growing confidence. But the issues of trying to navigate this European situation, I think it's
frightening for a lot of people just don't understand.
As we are trying to show in our branding initiative that there is a huge cost of doing nothing and we have to educate
more and more people, by doing nothing and market timing, that is not a good answer. And we need to really engage
everybody in talking about what type of -- in terms of individuals, what type of pool money do you need upon
retirement? And how are you going to achieve that, earning very little sustaining cash?
And the question is, does the noise of today, does that have any impact on a 30-year objective? And unfortunately, as
we watch financial news on television and listening to it on a radio and reading it in print, through blogs, it's all about --
and day-to-day strategies. And so it actually accelerates the short term-ism, but as advisors, we have to focus on
focusing what the -- what your needs are and that's what we're trying to do, not with just retail, with mutual fund buyers
but we're trying to do that institutionally worldwide. And it's very important for us to do that.
Matthew Kelley
Thank you very much, guys.

Hi, thanks. Ann Marie, just on the expenses, G&A a bit lower. You mentioned the marketing. I think you said, this
quarter is around 15 million. And I just want to make sure we had that rate. So if we run rate that, would it be another
30 million for the second quarter? And then I guess on the flip side, when I look at the comp, any way to size up the
payroll tax impact because that will obviously moderate and provide some offset there.
Ann Marie Petach, Senior Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I can take those all offline, but the payroll was broadly about 27 and the marketing is directionally correct. I'll
talk to you more.
Michael Carrier
Okay. And then Larry, if you look at recent like trends in the institutional part of the business and you compare that to
say like the past 10 years, like what is the level of activity, meaning engagement, making decisions, because it seems
like the flows are improving but it still seems like, industry wide, there is still a lot of uncertainty? And then just one
follow-up on that trading platform. Just if we do go the route where - is more --, then in a good scenario for you guys
and your clients, what do you guys anticipate being, like the max of your ability to internalize, like meaning the
percentage of the volume?
Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
TO answer your first part of the question related to the activity of dialogue. Dialogue has never been stronger, but it
takes a lot more time to try to get --. So their behavior is more of --. But the dialogue is probably more unique than ever
before. But more importantly, the dialogue is different. 10 years ago, dialogue was on core strategy, a core fixed
income strategy, a large cap strategy. Those conversations don't happen anymore.
The conversations today are more about multi-asset strategy. It's about alternatives. It's about overlaying assets versus
liability. It is much more complex. So, the dialogue is longer, the timing in which people commit is much longer. -- is
large. And so -- and that's what I am trying to say at the beginning, although we have some nice market movements,
we've seen some nice long-term flows at BlackRock there is still an overwhelming amount of reluctant. It's not a
reluctance because they don't want to do something, it's a reluctance overlying there, well that's cost my job how do I
respond. And we are trying to hit hard to everybody well doing nothing could cost a job even more. We have to
respond to people with these all issues. But I think the key is the dialogue is different it's more comprehensive
multi-asset strategy alternative bar-belling much different.
And I should also state, if you looked at our pipeline, our pipeline speaks about that. Our pipeline is much heavily
oriented to multi-asset strategy and lot more alternatives. So when you see our pipeline, you'll see more of that type of
behavior and such a dialogue.
In terms of trading platform the Volcker rule is more I hope it's not that's not in our interest as investors, it maybe in a
society but there is a fundamental cause for that and investors are going to have to pay for that. Right now I think we're
crossing about 6% of our trades, our hope is if we can get up to 30% that would be magnificent, that's the big very high
volume to achieve. So let's go 1% at a time six to seven to eight. And obviously, we don't know the magnitude of how
many clients from Aladdin will go on to it. We never achieved those objective of 20% or 30% profit it's going to have
mean a lot more participation with many more clients. And so but it is more if markets are much flatter, I think more
clients will want to be part of this platform and that will accelerate the utilization rate of this platform.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup.
Corporate Participant
Hey, Bill I thought you forgot about it.
Analyst
Good morning. This is actually Neal standing in. Larry I was wondering if you could give us some thoughts today on
money market performance the likely outcome? Thank you.
Corporate Participant
We believe money market reform should be a [Technical Difficulty] we believe the industry has been reluctant to
change. We need to be working with the SEC on money market reform and have dialogue with some of our fellow
asset managers to work together on money market reform working with the SEC. It is our position that if we do not
work together with the SEC and money market reform the S stock committee will make it for us. And so we have been
much more aggressive on addressing money market for reform we believe it's necessary for this business growing again
as we witness the industry is shrinking every quarter. We have been isolated though with that opinion we have been
remarkably one of the only firm to aggressively believe that we need money market reform working with the SEC with
sensible industry and client oriented solution. And so but I must say in recent weeks we have through our offline
dialogue with other firm I believe a good opportunity in front of us to work with the SEC for money market reform.
Analyst
Thank you
Corporate Participant
We have the S stock telling us what the money market reform will do to us.
That's it. Good. Thanks everyone, thanks for good quarter everyone as a firm. And look forward to talking with you
next quarter. Talk you later.
