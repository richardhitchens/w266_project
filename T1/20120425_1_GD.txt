MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Jeff, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor
Relations. And you have the floor ma'am.
Amy Gilliland
Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter conference call. As
always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These
estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the
company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson
Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by noting that today marked the 60th anniversary of
General Dynamics listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Generations of employees have helped to make this great
corporation successful over the past six decades. Our exceptional people continue to drive GD through their innovation,
operational excellence, and commitment to continuous improvement. I am proud to be their CEO.

Before speaking to the quarter, I want to address the current Defense budget environment. On the fourth quarter call in
January, I mentioned the potential for complications to the 2012 budget execution from the combination of upcoming
elections, the likelihood of another Continuing Resolution, and the threat of sequestration. These potential
complications have indeed revealed themselves to us in the first quarter. Particularly in our shorter cycle IS&T
business, as looming budget cuts negatively influenced Department of Defense and federal government acquisition
execution.
While it's still early in the year, and we're in no position to know the full effect of these complications on the year,
anxiety over these issues will almost certainly escalate as we move into the summer months and election campaigns roll
into high gear.
Washingtonians are seemingly unified in their belief that sequestration will not happen as currently legislated, although
no one can explain how avoiding the severe cuts will be achieved. In recent weeks, Pentagon leadership has reiterated
that no plans are in place to deal with sequestration, while stating that they expect further guidance from the Office of
Management and Budget this summer on how to begin planning. This will certainly spawn increased rhetoric and
speculation as details emerge on how cuts will be administered, making it even more difficult to overcome our
customers' reticence to commit resources.
In the midst of this uncertainty, or the fog bank as I often refer to it, the FY 2013 budget has begun the congressional
approval process. While there are some puts and takes across our portfolio as you would expect, there were no real
surprises for General Dynamics in this budget request, and we were generally pleased with the support for our
shipbuilding and tactical communications program. As expected, the future disposition of Stryker and Abrams
programs will be the subject of ongoing discussions with all stakeholders.
As we look to the rest of the year, in much of our portfolio contracts are in hand and we're on our way to achieving our
expectations. In other parts of our portfolio, particularly our short cycle IS&T products and services, risk remains. We
are doing everything we can to jump start the expenditure of previously appropriated funds.
And with this as prologue, let's talk about the quarter. Revenues in the first quarter were $7.6 billion, down from the
first quarter of last year due to lower Defense revenues, particularly in IS&T. Operating earnings were $860 million,
leading to companywide operating margins of 11.3%. Net earnings were $564 million, which resulted in earnings per
share of $1.57 on a fully diluted basis.
Revenues, earnings and operating margins were negatively impacted by $67 million of non-cash, out of period
adjustments recorded at Combat Systems' European subsidiary, European Land Systems, ELS. In total, the corrections
at ELS reduced the company's fully diluted earnings per share by $0.13 in the quarter.
These adjustments were not a function of program performance, but rather were related to shortcomings in our
accounting department at ELS. Following a thorough analysis, we determined that certain transactions were not
properly reflected in prior periods. The corrections have been made, and the underlying causes remedied.
Free cash flow after capital expenditures, totaled $324 million or 57% of earnings from continuing operations, better
than last year's first quarter.
In terms of capital deployment, we repurchased 1.4 million of our shares in the first quarter, and acquired an FBO at
Houston Hobby airport, the fifth most active U.S. business aviation airport, to further expand Aerospace's service
network.
We also invested $90 million into our businesses, to include the continuation of a $500 million seven-year program to
ensure Gulfstream's Savannah campus is sized to accommodate an expanding global customer base.
And in March, our board increased the dividend 8.5%, the 15th increase in as many years.
First quarter orders were stronger than the first quarter of 2011, due to healthy activity in our Marine Systems Group.
At the end of the quarter, backlog totaled $55.2 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog,

unexercised options, and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, totaled $82.2 billion.
Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business groups, starting with the Defense businesses. First
Combat Systems. Combat Systems' revenues were $1.9 billion, down modestly from last year's first quarter and in line
with our plan for the year. Revenues in the quarter reflected increased international vehicle volume, including growth
on two significant LAV and tank export programs, improved axle sales, and the addition of Force Protection. This
upside helped mitigate lower U.S. and European vehicle and ammunition volume, as well as the sale of the Detection
Systems business which was completed in the second quarter of last year.
Combat Systems delivered $203 million of operating earnings in the first quarter. The group's operating margins were
10.6%. Without the previously discussed accounting adjustment at ELS, the group's margins would have been
approximately 350 basis points higher, reflecting good execution across our three U.S. combat businesses.
And we continue to work on improving ELS's profitability by divesting noncore assets, reducing the number of
operating locations, moving its headquarters, and better integrating the four entities that comprise the business. These
actions position ELS to compete more effectively in the broader global market. Particularly given the present
challenges in their more difficult European home market.
Combat Systems' backlog declined from year end, to $10.7 billion. Despite this decline, there were several notable
awards in the first quarter, including contracts to produce Stryker Mine Rollers and Foxhound vehicles and to continue
to demilitarize a variety of munitions. We anticipate improved order activity at Combat Systems as the year progresses,
including over $1.5 billion in Stryker and Abrams awards, and several production awards for a FMS tank upgrade
program. Last week, in fact, we received an award for the 46 Abram step upgrades funded in the FY 2012 budget.
Additional award opportunities that may happen this year but are not integral to our 2012 results include selection to
compete in the next phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, JLTV competition, additional Stryker Double-V-Hull
vehicles, and new LAV and tank export programs for an array of international customers, including nearly 200 tanks
for Morocco.
In March, our General Tactical Vehicles team delivered our proposal for the JLTV competition to the Army. This
combat proven, off the shelf vehicle, EAGLE by name, has already been deployed successfully in Afghanistan by
German forces. It incorporates the unparalleled protection of Double-V-Hull technology, and is a reliable, operationally
cost-effective, low risk offering which aligns with the Army Secretary's priorities for faster, smarter, cheaper and better
solutions.
For the year, I expect – I continue to expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales. Full year operating
margins will be pressured due to the impact of the adjustment made this quarter and will likely be closer to the high
13% range.
Next I'll discuss Marine Systems. Marine Systems revenues were $1.6 billion, down 4% from last year due to less
T-AKE and littoral combat ship volume as these construction programs near completion and lower Virginia-class sales
as we transition from the second to the third block of submarines. Increased ship repair revenues following the October
2011 acquisition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk, helped to mitigate the decline in construction
programs.
Operating earnings were $185 million, up nearly 11% compared to a year ago. Marine Systems 11.5% operating
margins were a 150 basis point improvement from last year's first quarter. The favorable earnings and margins are due
to improved performance on the T-AKE, and Mobile Landing Platform, MLP, auxiliary program. The 13th T-AKE
Medgar Evers, successfully completed sea trials last month and was just delivered to the customer yesterday. The 14th
and final T-AKE, Cesar Chavez, will launch in May and deliver before year end.
The first MLP, Montford Point, now 51% complete, remains on schedule and budget to deliver in May 2013. This ship
is demonstrating the value of completing ship design before starting construction. We began construction of the second
MLP, John Glenn, last week and received a contract to build the third ship, Lewis B. Puller in the quarter.

In addition to these NASSCO programs, we continue to see the group focus on cost efficiency, overhead management
and risk reduction in our other two shipyards. At Electric Boat, Mississippi, the 9th Virginia-class submarine, recently
completed alpha and bravo sea trials and is due to be delivered to the customer nearly one year ahead of schedule and
under contract cost.
At BIW, the first Zumwalt-class destroyer, DDG 1000, is over 60% complete, while the second ship, recently named
USS Lyndon B. Johnson is 30% complete, and fabrication of the third ship has just begun. We remain focused on
ensuring construction success and are working closely with the Navy and other major suppliers on ship integration
efforts. The Marine Group's backlog totaled $18 billion at the end of the quarter, our shipyards added several key
orders to their workload in the quarter, including an additional DDG 51, and that third MLP.
The Navy's updated 30-year shipbuilding plan provides several opportunities to enhance the group's backlog over the
next few years. This revised plan includes a multi-year procurement for 9 DDG 51s between 2013 and 2017 and a
block buy of 9 Virginia-class submarines known as Block IV, between 2014 and 2018. We expect the Navy to award
these contracts next year.
As part of the new shipbuilding outlook, we will also continue to work on several development programs. Including the
Ohio ballistic missile submarine replacement effort and a new program called the Virginia payload module which will
provide additional payload capacity for Block V Virginia-class submarine. The Navy's outlook also includes an
additional MLP ship, the fourth in the class, planned for FY 2014.
Marine Systems remains on track to achieve my guidance of revenues slightly below 2011. Also, as the T-AKE
program winds down through the remainder of this year, I continue to anticipate some margin compression. However,
given the group's strong first quarter performance, I anticipate margins will be closer to the high 10% range for the
year.
Now, IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology Group had a challenging first quarter, as many of the negative
trends that we experienced in 2011 persisted. Group revenues were $2.4 billion in the quarter, down primarily as a
result of weakness in our Tactical Communications portfolio. Volume in our IT service business was flat year over
year, as the addition of several businesses in 2011, including Vangent, offset lower workload on several major IT
infrastructure support projects that are concluding.
There are several reasons for the continued softness in our communications business, including further award delays in
our shorter cycle products, especially encryption hardware, slower than anticipated ramp in programs moving from
development to production, like JTRS and WIN-T. And the slower than anticipated transition of some legacy contracts
to new award, particularly common hardware systems for CHS-4 program. In each case, we expect gradual
improvement activity as the year progresses.
As it relates to encryption, persistent and dynamic threats to vital national networks require continued upgrades and
updates to encryption equipment. Because of the mandate for regular investment in these products, we view this
shortfall as largely a timing issue.
On development programs, our JTRS HMS, and WIN-T programs continued to demonstrate their capability in the first
quarter, including deployment of our HMS Rifleman Radio to Afghanistan with the Army's 75th Ranger regiment. In
the past six months, WIN-T Increment 2 has made great strides through its formal milestones, including successful
government production and reliability testing. Both JTRS and WIN-T, remain on track to progress through further
testing and acquisition milestone decisions this year.
Additionally, both programs were well funded in the FY 2012 budget, and received strong support totaling nearly $2
billion in the FY 2013 request. We expect to receive FY 2012 funded awards for WIN-T, as well as Rifleman and
Manpack radios later this year.
With respect to contract transition, CHS-3 was a very successful program that exceeded its original ceiling cap value
several times. We were awarded a $3.7 billion, five year single source IDIQ contract for the CHS-4 program last
summer. CHS-4 is an extremely flexible contract that purchasers from across the military and other government

agencies can use to acquire the latest ruggedized commercial computing and communications technology. Following
last summer's award, we had limited activity under the new CHS-4 contract. We are now finally beginning to receive
some orders.
IS&T's lower sales volume impacted earnings and margins which were $218 million and 8.9% respectively. While both
were down from last year's first quarter, the margin decline was due primarily to program mix. With the addition of
Vangent in late 2011 and the continued top line pressure in our communications product portfolio, services now
represent the largest component of our IS&T portfolio. While IT service work provides an excellent return on
investment, margins on these types of programs are generally lower than more product-intensive programs. The IS&T
group continues to aggressively manage its cost structure to protect profitability and competitiveness through actions
such as facility consolidation, work force reduction, and discretionary spending reduction. These actions should afford
some operating leverage when delayed volume returns.
IS&T's backlog was $9.6 billion at the end of the quarter. While order activity improved from the fourth quarter, it was
not at the level of prior years. We did however, book several awards, some of which are detailed in today's press
release, which highlight our ability to capture opportunities in high priority growth areas, including cyber security,
cloud computing, health IT, and IT mission services.
When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contract totaled $32 billion. For the
reasons I just outlined, I anticipate award activity to improve as the year progresses, and in point of fact we have
already seen some positive indications in April.
For instance, earlier this month, we received a four-year $173 million Rescue 21 sustainment award. Also, last week
our Tactical Communications business received a 10-year IDIQ contract with the FAA worth potentially $400 million,
to deliver radios to enhance air traffic controller communications. And we recently received long lead funding to
provide security systems for buildings and infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. This is the beginning of a multi-phase several
hundred million dollar project. Awards are starting to break free albeit slowly. In light of IS&T's slow start to the year,
we now expect group sales to be approximately 5% lower in 2011, with margins in the mid 9% range. Revenues and
earnings will be back half weighted.
Now let's talk about Aerospace. Aerospace growth continued in the first quarter, with revenues of $1.6 billion, up 20%
from last year's first quarter. This healthy top line growth was driven by more large cabin deliveries including G650s
and continued growth in aircraft service demand. The additional large cabin deliveries also drove double-digit
improvement in the group's operating earnings, which were $271 million.
Margins were 16.7%, down modestly when compared with the prior year period because of lower liquidated damages
and higher R&D expense. Earnings and margins were up sequentially, due to improved performance at Jet Aviation.
Gulfstream orders were good this quarter, representing demand for products across our portfolio. Customer interest
remains strongest at the upper end of our portfolio, although we are seeing improved interest in the G280 as entry into
service approaches, and the mid cabin market slowly improves.
Orders from our North American customers comprised the largest percent of orders in the quarter, a noteworthy
development, spurred by corporations taking steps to recapitalize their fleet. We also continued to see he strong
demand from Asia-Pacific customers.
First quarter gross new aircraft book-to-bill was 0.7 times on a dollar-denominated basis. Orders continued to
significantly outpace default. Default activity was driven by a few additional G650 cancellations which spilled into
2012 from customers who were billed for milestone payments following the aircraft's provisional type certification late
last year.
Consistent with my fourth quarter remarks, the G650 defaults are in line with our expectations. And even in light of
G650 deliveries and defaults over the past two quarters, we still have close to 200 in backlog. At quarter end, the group
backlog was approximately $17 billion, down from year end due in part to the G650 default activity I just mentioned,
but still very robust by any measure. Because new orders for the G650 currently have a five year entry into service
date, we don't expect orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. Continued demand for our G450 and 550

products keeps us in our target 18 to 24-month window from new aircraft order to delivery for these aircraft. The
decline in Aerospace's backlog in the quarter also reflected the cancellation of a wide-body Jet Aviation completion
project following the death of a customer.
Aircraft flight utilization trended up in the first quarter, with a particularly strong March finish. This positive trend
enabled service revenues at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation to post gains over last year's first and last quarters.
We continue to make investments in our service network to better correlate our footprint with growth in the installed
global base. For instance, Gulfstream recently announced a planned opening of Gulfstream Beijing, a joint venture
which enables Gulfstream to be the first business jet manufacturer to offer factory service in China. This facility
complements an authorized Gulfstream repair center in Hong Kong, as well as Jet Aviation's newly upgraded MRO and
FBO locations in Singapore.
Similarly, Gulfstream and Flight Safety International have teamed to open a new flight simulator in Hong Kong. This
center will train Asian operators on G450 and 550 aircraft, enabling them to complete training much closer to home.
In addition to the stronger service volume I just discussed, Jet Aviation's completions business made positive progress
in the quarter. We delivered one of the three narrow-body, wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost
growth. We will deliver the second shortly, actually almost any day now, and we expect to have the third aircraft
delivered by the end of the second quarter. The new Jet leadership team remains focused on capturing narrow-body,
wide-body completions opportunities, while simultaneously optimizing the business to better align with today's market
conditions.
Gulfstream's G650 and G280 development programs continued to make progress in their respective flight test programs
in the first quarter and remain on track for type certification in the mid year, perhaps moving into the third quarter.
We're in the final stages of testing with the FAA, so the exact date of type certification will really be determined by
their schedule. Rest assured, however, that we are getting close and both aircraft continue to perform extremely well.
Entry into service for these aircraft, particularly the G650, continues to drive my Aerospace guidance of approximately
15% top line growth. Given the strong performance in the first quarter, particularly at Gulfstream, Aerospace margins
will likely be somewhat higher than my original guidance, probably in the mid 15% range for the year.
In summary, given the environment I've detailed, and our current outlook, I am reiterating my full year guidance of
$7.10 to $7.20. With that said, in light of the company's first quarter results, we'll most likely come in at the lower end
of this guidance range, and as I detailed at the group level, the composition of the earnings has changed slightly. I
would remind you that this guidance does not anticipate the result of capital deployment.
As we look to the rest of the year, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in Defense. However, our businesses are
focused on execution and remain agile and well positioned to adapt to the dynamic Defense environment confronting
our industry. Meanwhile, our Aerospace Group is well situated to continue a steady growth trajectory fueled by
demand for our large cabin in-service Gulfstream aircraft, the entry into service of our new G650 and G280 aircraft,
and increased global demand for the group's aircraft services. Our diverse portfolio, healthy balance sheet and cash
outlook afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional finance detail. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd
Thanks, Jay and good morning. Before we start the question and answer period I'd like to cover a few additional
financial items including some more detailed discussion of the $67 million adjustment in the Combat Systems segment.
And let me start there. This adjustment is the result of human error, which we caught and have now corrected. We have
accounting policies and procedures and systems in place throughout all our operation. Unfortunately, sometimes
individuals fail to follow them. I should mention that this was limited to an isolated in our European Land Systems
based, Switzerland-based vehicle business.

Beginning in late 2010, and spread over every quarter in the interim, there were two central accounting issues. I want to
remind everyone that there were accounting issues not performance issues. First, revenue was recognized in excess of
the contract value on three contracts due to foreign exchange costs that were improperly accounted for.
And second, revenue was recognized on costs that were not properly recorded to cost of sales, but rather remained in
CIP. We have evaluated this adjustment, the quantitative and qualitative impact adjustment of the current quarter, prior
quarters, and the full year earnings and we've determined that it was not material.
Moving on to net interest expense, net interest expense for the quarter was $39 million versus $34 million in 2011. For
2012 we expect net interest expense to be at the lower end of our range of $155 million to $160 million. At the end of
the quarter, we had just over $900 million of net debt, down just over $100 million from year end.
The effective tax rate was 31.3% for the quarter, compared with 31% in the first quarter of 2011. For the full year, the
effective tax rate should approximate 32%, rising slightly over 2011, due primarily to the lack of an extension of the
R&D tax credit.
We plan to contribute $500 million to our pension plans in 2012. Funding will be the greatest in the second and third
quarters, the first installment of approximately $100 million having been made in early April.
Finally, now that we've seen one quarter of run rate, we are lowering our forecast of corporate expense, which is shown
in the segment detail of operating earnings in Exhibit B to the press release, we're revising that forecast to $70 million,
down from the $80 million we were forecasting at the beginning of the year.
Amy, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the time back over to you for the questions and answers.

Operator
Thank you very much, Amy. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with
Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Jay, could you talk a little bit more about the sensitivity at IS&T? You've adjusted the
guidance given the pressure. How do we think about a CR in the fourth quarter might – how that might further affect
things?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: First of all, as I think we've probably talked before, we see the likelihood of a CR very high. So
I think that will be the reality we deal with later in the year. But I will say that we've had a slow start, as I described in
IS&T, but we are starting to see award activity. My guidance assumes the resumption of – my terms here – what I
would call more normal activity as the rest of the year progresses. We have indications that that is still going to be the
case. The encryption business, as I described, will have to move here at a certain time because you just can't put that off
but so long. So that was a basis of my timing statement.
The Communications programs, specifically WIN-T and JTRS are in the test at NIE, what next month? And we expect
LRIP 2 decisions that are in the plan, we have every indication that's going to happen here, May, June timeframe or

slightly thereafter. That's 6,000 Rifleman Radios and more Manpacks. So we feel pretty confident that that's going to
happen.
So what am I saying? I'm saying that we see enough daylight ahead of us, even in front of the fog bank, and feel that a
CR at the end of the year, based on what we have already appropriated, if you will, in 2012, will put us in pretty good
shape to go through that fog bank with the guidance I've just delivered. Okay?
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Yeah, would you characterize IS&T as having greater uncertainty than Combat at this point?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I think yes, of course. Why do I say that? Because again, it's a shorter cycle business and it's
been the one that's been, shall we say, most exposed here through the CR – look at it this way, I don't want to
overdramatize here and say perfect storm scenario, but in a way you could almost make that case when you say look,
we've had two CRs in the last year, we're likely to have another one. We've got the reality of award delays, we got –
because of that – or part of that is protracted acquisition cycles. You got this fog bank of sequestration out there.
And then we've got programs that were mature and very successful concluding, PENREN, Pentagon renovation,
Rescue 21, CHS-3, the Walter Reed here in D.C. So that's being replaced by other programs that are good programs but
they're slow to pick up the ramp if you will, and the margins will probably be a little challenged relative to the old
mature programs until they get rolling. But still in all, that scenario, I can see it through what's appropriated in 2012 in
a way that makes us confident that the guidance is very achievable. Could it change? Sure it could change. But right
now the best vision we have says we think we can get there.

Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, actually, I wanted to put a finer point on the other question. I guess as we – can you just help
us reconcile a little bit, Jay, sort of what seems to be conflicting puts and takes between you're talking about budget
cuts affecting execution and anxiety escalating, and then revenues and margins in IS&T being back half weighted and
award activity improving. And I'd also love if you could touch on top of that, talk to us about what's happening with
award fees in general. Where are you today versus a year ago, and versus maybe two or three years ago?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Okay. Let's see, Heidi. We do believe that it's going to be back half weighted. I mean, one of
the reasons I took the guidance down was because of what we're seeing so far. So if you take my guidance down 5%, as
I just did, and then you look at the rest of the year as I just described to Rob, is there uncertainty out there? You bet
you. But again, if the appropriated funds are obligated, we believe this is a good piece of guidance for IS&T.
As we've discussed and we'll continue to discuss, I'm sure as the year goes on, the fog bank becomes more real the
closer we get to it. But again, I was – to be very honest with you, three weeks ago I was more concerned about it, it
being 2012 execution, than I am today just because we are starting to see some award activity that was frankly absent in
the first part and the majority of the first quarter.
So am I enthused about that? I am gratified by it and I'm hopeful for it. But the check's in the mail to a certain extent
here until we see, as I mentioned before, more sustained, "normal" activity going forward. And that ties back to the
obligation of appropriated funds. So it's going to be a very, I think, dynamic is probably a fair way to say it, year,
particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T business, but I'm giving you the straightest we have right now on the view that
we see out forward.
The award fees in general and that, I don't see, frankly – I guess the comment I would make would be the competition
you see in particularly the IT service business, is as intense or more intense than it's ever been. So there I think, Heidi,
is where you're seeing a lot of that. That accounted for – the IT service business was probably about a third of the
decline in my forecast. The Tac Communications business was probably, 50%, 60% of that decline. And part of that
decline in IT service, frankly, is bids lost, my term, in this hyper competitive environment which gets to your point on
fees.

<Q - Heidi Wood>: Just one last follow-up, Jay. When we – so I guess when you talk about the 5% guidance down
and obviously we wonder whether that's sufficient, could we at least have the understanding that you've baked enough
cushion in the other divisions that could have potential offset to what we're seeing or potential worsening in IS&T?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah I think – I mean, my answer to that, Heidi, is yes. And if you look at – I see opportunity
and I juiced a little guidance in Aerospace and Marine both and I'm very – at this point I feel good, confident about
Combat Systems, in terms of absorbing the impact of what happened with the accounting issue at ELS, but the three
U.S. businesses were essentially on and on. So I think yes, that's a long yes to your answer.

Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss at UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Jay, back on IS&T, you talked about service being a bigger portion now and that impacting
the margins. Can you give us a breakout of service versus product, and given the biggest – bigger portion of that is
service now, are normalized margins when IS&T kind of gets back to somewhat normal here, are normal margins going
to be more in the 9% range on a go-forward basis?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: 9% to 10% is probably what I have in my head right now, as a fair answer. To your earlier
point, we're talking right – given the, shall we say, pull-back or delay in the Tactical Communication product business,
in IS&T, the service side of it takes, 40%, 45%, it becomes, you're approaching half of the IS&T book, is in the service
business, with great business as I said in my remarks, great return on the investment but at a lower margin.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: And then at Gulfstream, you commented that North America was pretty strong. Can you give
us the breakout how much North America actually – how much of total orders were North America in the quarter?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: For the quarter it's about 60%. So – and I've talked about that some in the past, but it just – I
think it's really good for everybody to see that coming back. And even better when you match that to the other
statement I made, which is it's not North America replacing rest of world. Rest of world is still doing great. But North
America is also coming back now, which is I say a good sign for everybody.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.

<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Jay, on the Aerospace division, I was wondering if you could comment on the pricing situation in
the quarter, whether you'd seen any improvement there, and how it differed from model to model or even region to
region?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Pricing, did you say?
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Yes.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Okay. Right now, the pricing is very strong on the large cabin. That's a consistent statement.
That hasn't changed. And frankly I don't see it changing. Both 450 and 550 for us. The mid cabin market, as we see it,
based on the activity levels and listening and talking to the other OEMs, I think for us it's improving but still a bit
challenged. I guess is a fair way to say it. We're seeing 280 activity. The 150 activity for us was slow in the early part

of the quarter. And it picked up in the latter part of the quarter. So that's a good thing. I hope that's responsive to your
question.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Yeah, just to follow up. With this strong pricing and the continued strength in the backlog for the
450 and the 550, at what point do you think we can anticipate production heading higher?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: We've got a pretty good sense of having it about right now because as I mentioned, we're still
in kind of the 18 to 24-month sweet spot backlog and as long as that's the case, I think we've got the production rate
about right.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Finbar Thomas Sheehy>: Hi, it's Finbar Sheehy for Doug. Jay, as you mentioned earlier, in Washington there
seems to be broad agreement that sequestration would be bad. But no clear path to avoid it. At what point during the
year do you need to have contingency plans in place just in case they actually don't manage to avoid it? And how do
you think about what sort of actions you could take, especially given that sequestration, if it ever happens, could be
quite short-lived or not?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah. That's a tough one to give a crisp answer to, because we don't know the frame of the
template that we're going to be dealing with. Suffice it to say that, as I've said previously here, I think the challenge for
us, the responsibility really for all of us, is to stay committed to executing the appropriations that have been laid forth
for the year, and if we can continue to do that, there is reasonableness in entering, as I say, that fog bank called
sequestration out there. How it manifests itself, nobody knows.
How do you prepare for that? It's really tough. But what you do is you maintain your agility, you keep running your
business, you control your costs as best you can, you stay focused on execution, and you don't over commit yourself
with capital, I think, in that kind of an environment. And that's about the best protection I believe you can give yourself
coming in to something that's as unknown as what we're seeing right now.
<Q - Finbar Thomas Sheehy>: Great. And just a quick follow-up on a specific aspect. You mentioned about
restructuring in European Land Systems. Can you give us a sense for the scope and scale of that, sort of how far you
are along in it and whether the restructuring costs might be a drag on margins this year?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: No to your latter and it's been a work in progress, quite honestly for quite some time. Example
would be the movement which we executed late last year of the ELS headquarters from Vienna to Madrid. So we're
attending to that, basically all around and it's continuous work, and it will continue to occur as we move forward. But
it's not impacting our margins right now.

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Jay, I guess I want to take a different tack, which is that if I look at your guidance and I see
Marine margins up, Aerospace up, even with the volume cut at IS&T. Hugh mentioned interest expense on the lower
end and corporate expense on the lower end, it would seem as though actually you should be higher, not at the low end,
and so I'm just trying – are you forecasting a contingency of the Continuing Resolution, is it haircutting that IS&T

could be worse? Where are you hedging? Because it would seem like it actually should point higher not lower.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, I mean, I appreciate that, Sam. And I would just tell you that I think particularly as it
applies in IS&T, we like what we're seeing, we just haven't seen enough of it. That's a fair way to say it. I mean, it's
early in the year, there's starting to be movement. We're starting to obligate the appropriated funds, we're starting to see
that. That's a good thing. If that continues, okay, then maybe I can feel differently. But right now in terms of where
within the $7.10 to $7.20 band we are, but right now to be honest with you, I haven't seen enough of that goodness and
I've got the $0.13 divot that just was the reality here in the first quarter, that's what puts me at the low end. I'd love to
outperform that. And I'm hopeful that we can, but I'm just not ready to write that check yet.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay and then just secondly, it sounded like when you mentioned the 650 and the 280 type
certification, that perhaps it slipped into third quarter. What's happened there? It just seems like it's moved a little bit to
the right?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, it has. I mean, to be fair, and it's frankly just a matter of scheduling and executing a very
detailed test regimen with our partners in the FAA. I mean, pure and simple. And may we do it better than that? Yeah,
but right now with the testing we see, that they want to have, I'm just – I'm hedging it a little bit. I'm not worried about
it. It's just a matter of – and it's not just a matter of getting type certification, okay, you get type certification, then you
have to get the simulator certified, then you have to get the crews for the airplanes that are entering into service type
rated, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a fairly complex set of realities that have to be dealt with, starting of course with
getting the type certification.
So, if it happens second quarter or third quarter, to me I'm happy either way. It's coming. The airplanes are performing
beautifully, and when there's great enthusiasm for them out there. So I'm not hedging it because I see a problem. I'm
just hedging it because of the reality of the testing and the pacing of that testing, and this isn't the only thing the FAA
has to do either, so I'm just being sensitive to that.

Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Jay, on that score with the G650, have they done the tests that caused the problem – that
caused the crash last year?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, we've done those, yes. I mean, we've done most all of the – as I would characterize it,
company testing. But the protocols are such that you do it and then you analyze it, and then the FAA works with you
and you do it again. So it's a series of sequential events that have to occur here and so that's I think, the answer that you
were looking for.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: And then a quick follow-up. Were forfeitures at Aero around $20 million? And does the Jet
completion business still have a loss this quarter?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Sorry, I missed the first part of that, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Were the forfeitures at Aero about $20 million? From the G650 cancellations?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I don't quantify that. But I've been very consistent here in saying that we expected a number of
G650 cancellations once the PTC call was made, and we got basically what we expected, so Gulfstream piece of that is
in line. The reason I brought up the other for the Aerospace backlog, is because it was a big jet that fell out of the
backlog, because of frankly the death of the customer.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: And did the completions business have a loss yet in the first quarter?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: No, completions business is doing – is on plan. And I'll take the opportunity to say that – you
didn't ask this – but I mentioned we've delivered one of the three aircraft, I would tell you that the – just reaffirm to

<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the call.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Just a quick follow-up on Jet Aviation. You talked about the deliveries of some of the
challenged planes going forward. Can you just talk a little bit more in detail around the timing of the margin recovery at
Jet? Just kind of update us on where we are and when you think that Jet will reach normalized margin rates and what do
you – what more do you need to do to get that done?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, as I said, Jason, I think before that what I expect out of Jet this year is essentially
breakeven. And then we ramp from there. And right now I feel pretty good about it. In fact, I feel very good about that.
The real challenge in the completions business, quite honestly, will no longer be our ability to manage the throughput.
It's to fill the skyline. So what am I saying? I'm saying if the business is out there, we've got the protocols and processes
in place now to really nail that business. Okay? Which is good news for everybody, I'm really proud of what they're
doing now. And the challenge will be if the customer demand is there. And we're working that very seriously, as you
would expect.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a quick one on Jet. On the wide-body cancellation. Was there any P&L impact as a result
of that in the quarter or was it just the backlog?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Mostly backlog. Maybe just a smidgen on the quarter. To be honest with you, I can't – I don't
even have the number in my head, but it's not material.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: It's mostly just backlog, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: I just didn't know if there was a big forfeiture or anything one time. And secondly, I know
there's a lot of discussion on the Hill about Abrams and the facility and the budgeting there. I wondered if you might
provide us an update with how you see that playing out and what risk there may be in the guidance should you not see
the sort of plus up you guys were trying to get similar to last year?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, I mean I think – I'm not worried about the 2012 piece. We've got work to do as I
mentioned before in 2013, but I would say that it's pretty consistent here in terms of the concern that Abrams has
generated with JSMC Lima regarding the whole issue of defense industrial base going forward. And we've had as
recently as yesterday, I think, I read in the clips this morning, 170 members of Congress signed a letter to Secretary
Panetta, expressing their concern on this issue. Which says, frankly, this defense industrial base as we go into this

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: You had some pretty significant management announcements over the last several weeks, and
Jay, I'm wondering if you might comment on A, on how you and Phebe will be working together in her new role. How
do you envision this role? And any update you can provide given this announcement on succession plans for the
company? Then also any comments you might have on the new head of your shipbuilding business?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: You're not trying to push me out the door are you, Joe?
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Not at all, just want to get the updates. A pretty big announcement.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: No, listen, first of all, just to refresh, next week, the 2nd of May to be precise, Phebe
Novakovic does become the President and COO, working directly for me. As you would expect, that's the start of a
very disciplined succession rhythm here, if you will, she and I are spending a lot of time together, as you would hope.
And I'm very anxious to get started here frankly. We've spent a lot of time with my direct reports now, the Executive
Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents, with Phebe, and so the transition is beginning and we're very encouraged by
all of that. So – and we'll continue to work very closely together as you would hope.
Likewise, Phebe is in the process, as we speak, of turning over Marine Systems Group to John Casey, who is currently
President of Electric Boat and then John will be turning over EB to Kevin Poitras, as you probably know. In every one
of those moves, we are very well served and John's going to do a superb job as EVP, and Kevin will do likewise as the
President of Electric Boat. So it reaffirms, frankly, the bench strength of General Dynamics and how seriously we take
the succession business. And we feel very comfortable with all of that, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Are there any comments you can make on just how you and Phebe will be working
together day-to-day on running the company, are you going to maintain a focus on different areas than her? Or are you
going to make joint decisions? Or how do we think about how you're going to divide executive responsibilities?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, one of the things she'll be doing first order, of course, as you would expect, is spending a
lot of time with the other – the Executive Vice Presidents, if you will. And the businesses getting herself, shall we say,
refamiliarized because she's fairly been total focused in the Marine Group as you would – as was her task. To get her
now snapped in, if you will, resnapped in, to the other three business groups. So as first order of business, that will be
elemental to what she's doing. And she and I will work very closely throughout all of that, as will the rest of the
leadership team. So this is teamwork underlined.

All right, thank you very much, Amy. Our final question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr, with Cowen &
Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, so you had very strong large biz jet deliveries in the first quarter. Could you comment,
what are you looking for for the year? Is there upside, given that very strong first quarter, unless it was bloated by huge
forfeitures, which you're seeming suggesting isn't the case. Isn't 15.5% a conservative number?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yes. I always give you conservative numbers, Cai. But I mean, it's a pretty reasonable number
from what I see today. Is there some upside to it? I certainly hope so. And I think there probably is. But I think that's
reasonable today, quite honestly.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: I mean, you haven't told us – I mean, are you looking for more? More, large biz jet deliveries.
You said that completions were on plan, but you didn't say whether it was in – Jet was in the black. You say you expect
it to only breakeven for the year. So it's a little hard to kind of see the roll-out from here.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I think the completions – the production rate, as I think I always say, can be – it's unchanged
today. Can it be tweaked a little bit? Yes, as we go through the year. Will it be? It's too early to tell. That's a fair
answer.
