MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams Companies Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call
over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Company Representative
Good morning and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams. As you know, yesterday afternoon
we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com.
These items include the press release of our results with related schedules and our analyst package; a presentation on
our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and
an update to our quarterly data book, which contains detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.
This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments, and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is
here from our Midstream business; Frank Ferazzi is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel,
is also available to respond to any of your questions.
In yesterday's presentation and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to
forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it.
Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to
generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation
materials.
So, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.

Alan S. Armstrong
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. First, let me wish everyone who has been affected by Hurricane Sandy the
best of luck in the recovery. As you know, given the significant disruption that occurred to the normal market activity,
we decided to delay our earnings release webcast by a day. We also know this concentrated a number of earnings calls
today. So thanks a bunch for joining us this morning for this webcast amongst a very busy morning.
Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to my prerecorded comments released yesterday afternoon. But just in case you
didn't, I'll quickly hit on some key themes, and then we'll move on to our Q&A session.
We have several really important items to communicate to you this week, starting with, of course, a review of our third
quarter performance. So I'll quickly touch on the key themes from that discussion.
For the third quarter, WMB's adjusted income was up about 17% over second quarter in spite of NGL frac spreads that
were about 18% lower on average than the already low two -- second quarter amounts and the impact of Hurricane
Isaac. And I'll talk about that just a little bit.
With regard to the NGL frac spread, we saw about a 9% lower average NGL composite price but an even higher impact
from natural gas shrink prices that were up about 26% on average. So, certainly, the frac spread environment that we
saw in the third quarter continued to decline from what was a heavy decline from first quarter to second quarter. And so
we were not expecting that degree of decline into the third quarter. And again, a lot of that was impacted by gas prices
moving up.
Turning to fee-based revenues now for third quarter, this measure grew about 5% [ph] per year over year (3:32) for the
third quarter. And, importantly, at the Midstream segment, for WPZ, this grew at about a 12% rate. So, continued great
volume growth there in our fee-based revenues.
And just to highlight a few of the areas that affected that, our gathering volumes in the business – so this is our natural
gas gathering volumes in the Midstream business were up 17% higher from 3Q '11 to 3Q of '12, and in the Eastern
onshore which is basically our Marcellus area and the Perdido Norte, which in the Western Gulf of Mexico, we saw
both of those areas, gathering volumes actually double from year to year.
The main driver of the 12% growth rate for -- overall for our business was the Eastern GMP business, as I mentioned,
and, of course, one of the drivers there was the acquisition from the Caiman, which we now refer to as the Ohio Valley
Midstream in our business, and that was up about $30 million between years.
Also, there was a couple of factors that brought that 12% growth rate down and tend to lessen it. The -- Hurricane Isaac
reduced some of our Gulf Coast fee-based revenues and in third quarter of '11, we actually had a pretty significant
contract settlement related to some of our Perdido Norte business. So on a normalized basis we see these fee-based
revenues actually growing even stronger than the 12% for WPZ Midstream.
Most of the Hurricane Isaac impacts were caused by interruptions in third party operations. So while we did have some
immediate interruption in our offshore assets, in particular, in terms of getting things back up and running, it really it
was due to some downstream oil terminals and some downstream NGL pipelines that held us up little bit longer. So we
really did fare pretty well against our assets and there were some assets that we're integrated with that were a little more
challenged.
Hurricane Isaac also significantly impacted our results in the Midstream Canadian and Olefins business as Geismar had
downtime that affected its production volumes as well as some damage to a furnace as we tried to restart the plant after
the hurricane. So all in this affected our segment profit from about $9 million to $13 million about $4 million of this
was treated as an [ph] adjustment for adjusted segment (6:04) profit.
So that's a quick look at our third quarter drivers. But again, given the continued lower NGL commodity price
environment and the Hurricane Isaac impact, we actually had a pretty good operational period here for the third quarter.

So next up, we have some important updates to our guidance for 2013 and 2014 from both WMB and WPZ; included in
these updates are the effect of the Geismar dropdown, which we've announced we'll be closing very soon.
But we've also got some other adjustments, including somewhat lower revenue growth rate assumptions for WPZ, and
these are really being driven by a prolong natural gas price assumption and some of the producers' reactions that we're
seeing to that as we went through our September planning process where we take in a lot of the input from a lot of our
producers around our systems.
And I certainly want to let you know this really is across the board that we're seeing this in areas that, whether -- where
we may -- where the producers themselves is heavily impacted by the gas prices. So some examples of that would be
areas where we hold the [ph] keypole (7:17) rights for natural gas drilling operations and so the producers are not
enjoying any of the uplift from the NGLs and so, of course, they're responding to lower natural gas prices. Those, of
course, would be mostly out west where that would occur.
We also had some response in the Gulf Coast and then to, and then to some degree in the Northeast, but we'll get into a
little bit in the Northeast. The good news, I would say, in the Northeast is that the activities continue there and, for the
most part, the activities, particularly in the Ohio Valley Midstream area really have nothing to do with either prices or
with the drilling or results from the resources. Actually, those are coming in a little better than we thought; it's really
just a delay in terms of the activity and our ability to get infrastructure into place there quickly.
So all in all, I would say the environment's pretty good, but I do think with our gas price assumption at $3.25, it's in our
assumptions and planning around that, we do expect continued reduction in areas that are totally dependent on just the
natural gas price.
So I do want to reaffirm our plans for strong cash dividend growth where we're expecting a 50% -- a 55% higher
dividend in 2012 with WMB, and as well the 20% growth in each 2013 and 2014, which would move our dividend to
$1.20, $1.44, and $1.75 respectively.
Our stated policy of paying out WMB dividends for all of the distributions WMB receives from WPZ, less taxes,
corporate interest, and corporate CapEx; however, we also want investors to appreciate how committed we are to
sustaining the great strength of WPZ for the long run, and, of course, that's what the Geismar dropdown is all about and
it really shows the evidence of WMB's commitment to keeping WPZ healthy and making sure that the commodity
hedge, the natural commodity hedge there is shared with WPZ and not just held at the WMB level.
So in that transaction, WMB is receiving nearly 43 million new WPZ LP units related to the Geismar dropdown;
assuming the strong WPZ cash distribution growth rate included in our guidance, WMB will see a significant increase
in cash distributions from WPZ.
This could result of course in an ultimately higher dividend growth rate than what we have forecasted right now for
WMB, and certainly if the forecasted pricing environment that we have out there, particularly around ethylene prices
occurs, then we would certainly be in a position to further increase the dividend at WMB.
So, a lot of questions around that as a lot of people have snapped to the fact that our cash distributions will go up
significantly from that, and we have certainly been clear that we intend to maintain that policy, and I think our response
to that is we certainly agree with that calculation, but we do have quite a bit of risk embedded in that pricing at WPZ,
and so we don't really want to go out any further on that distribution being two years ahead of time, in terms of the
dividend at WMB.
I do think we intend to be very sure and really work hard to maintain the distribution growth rate at WPZ, however, and
some of the [ph] active (11:18), some of the things we might respond to if we did see a commodity collapse it would
pull us down – pull that coverage ratio down, of course, would be our ability to impact the GP IDRs that we receive.
So we remain very committed to WPZ and the health of WPZ and we think we have got a great model. And certainly,
if the pricing environment occurs, we're going to be in great shape to continue to increase that dividend at WMB even
further.

Of course, at the same time WMB will no longer enjoy 100% of the cash flow and earnings it enjoys today. And as a
result, you have seen a lowering of WMB's income guidance related to the non-controlling interest that arises in
Geismar once it's dropped into WPZ. So even though the cash flow piece of that looks stronger, particularly with the
capital burden being shifted over to WPZ, the earnings piece of that gets diluted by the issuance of -- to the WPZ LP
unit holders.
Additionally, as I previously mentioned, we have some other updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, including lower
revenue growth rates across most of our operating areas that are exposed to natural gas prices, as I mentioned. And
although we have some fairly low natural gas price assumptions in place for '13 and '14, you really should not
misconstrue that that we have a lack of confidence in the natural gas market.
And in fact, I would tell you we are fairly bullish about the long-term demand that we continue to see build for natural
gas, but we also been impressed with the capabilities of natural gas producers here in the U.S. to continue to lower their
cost of production and so we're balancing that. We do think it will take some time for a lot of the big capital that's
coming on to build that demand. But long-term, I would tell you we're bullish on seeing this natural gas market
continue to expand.
Finally, in the prerecorded podcast we provided additional information about exciting new developments in our
Canadian and petchem services businesses, and updates on all of our end guidance projects, most of which are
fee-based, that really continue to demonstrate how Williams is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this long-term
super-cycle as a trusted name in the development, construction, and operation of exactly the types of infrastructures
needed to realize the full potential for producers and end-users of natural gas, NGLs and olefins.
So with that, I will open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I think I understand your -- the lower guidance in '14. I just want
to understand a little bit more, if you could, and I have a follow-up question, but on the guidance, it seems like your
commodity price assumptions are roughly the same from the last time you issued guidance. And so, the decrease in
earnings seems like a meaningful decrease in volumes. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what the volume decrease
you expect in '14 versus your previous guidance? And I understand it's because of low natural gas prices.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Right. And I would just say this, Faisel, really what we saw, again, how our planning
process works is that we start to pull that together in September, and we take in input from all across our systems from
producers' planned capital for the following year. Of course, it's in their best interest to have us educated on their plans
as well because we've got to go build a lot of the infrastructure for those volumes and so we have been going through
that process in September.
And I would just tell you that it's really across the board, and I would tell you if we thought gas prices were going to be
$4.50 or $5 in '13, and then we probably would have had a different perspective on that. But with our assumption of gas
prices being at $3.25 for '13, with that assumption embedded, we would have a hard time being more bullish than the
producers in terms of their capital plans. And so, we really basically took the capital plans from producers.
Now, remember, this was -- a lot of their ideas, of course, were formed over the summer when gas prices were even
softer. So if we do see gas prices rebound, we probably would see some more activity and more rigs picked up. But of
course then we would have to raise our gas, natural gas price if we believe that, and that, of course, would come out of
the margin for both the NGLs and Olefins margins.

So I think there is a pretty good balance there, but in general, I would tell you that we gather a lot of gas and there's just
a lot of areas that are exposed to natural gas pricing. We're seeing drops in really all of our regions from what we had
forecasted earlier in the year based on producers' forecasts that we would have picked up in the first part of 2012.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the Olefins business and the chemicals business, you know,
how are you guys are thinking about the distributions at WPZ once you drop these assets in? I mean, will some of the
distributions be a little bit more of a variable rate or will they -- will you have some base level of free cash flows that
will be distributed to unit holders and then the rest will be kind of discretionary sort of use of capital? How are you
guys thinking about this cyclical business within the – within WPZ?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, it's a great question and I would say that we do feel like we will need to maintain a
coverage ratio there. Of course one of the things that's heavily impacting our coverage ratio of PZ right now is the
amount of growth and amount of equity that we have issued here in 2012. And so, I would say that in a more normal
environment with not quite so much leverage to growth in that balance sheet, that we would expect to be seeing higher
recovery ratios, despite even lower NGL prices that we saw here in the third quarter.
So, bottom line is we intend to maintain a coverage ratio there at WPZ, and try [ph] to let (18:05) the swings. Good
news is that there is a lot of cash flow in WPZ and we would expect to let that coverage absorb a lot of those swings. If
that wasn't enough to absorb that, then our next move in a more dire environment would be to waive some of the GP
IDR if necessary to maintain WPZ's health.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead, your line is open.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Just to follow up on Faisel's question, about the volume growth assumptions that go into your
guidance, how -- you mentioned kind of broadly lower gas volumes across geographies; would you say that this
volume change is enough to impact your longer-term 5 Bcf a day estimate in terms of gas that you handle in the
Marcellus?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: It certainly could in some areas. I would tell you the areas that are the drier gas are most
likely to be the larger part of that impact. On OVM I would say there might be some delays there. But currently, we're
actually increasing that a little bit above in the near-term here from what we had in our September – sorry, in our June
forecast for that.
So, it's really the areas that are just dependent on dry gas volumes and OVM, I would say, to the degree that is lowered
a little bit, that's going to be from just delays and getting the infrastructure in the drilling activity occurring there. But
we certainly are very excited about what we continue to see in the OVM area in terms of the producers' economics, and
their activities and the resource there.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay. Great. And as far as, in the Midstream side of the business at WPZ, it looked like the OpEx,
which had ticked up in the second quarter, was kind of flat sequentially. And I was wondering if there are items in there
which are transitory in nature or whether we're looking at maybe a kind of higher go-forward operating cost in that
business?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: This is Rory. I'd say for the near-term across Midstream on operating expenses, we're
probably pretty flat with '12. And so, in terms of thinking about a run-rate, that's probably a comment that I'm making
for '13, but we're expecting to be fairly flat with '12 or '13, and then after that, there may be some growth.

<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great. Thanks. And just one last question, could you – I realize that some of the petrochemical
pipelines are making their way down to PZ in conjunction with the Geismar dropdown. But are there – are there
additional assets as part of this Exxon asset package that you've acquired which will remain at WMB for the time being
and maybe if you could just give a breakdown of what percentage of those assets sit at PZ versus MB, that would be
great? Thank you.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: This is Don. I could just mention that the assets that we announced, the petrochemical
assets we acquired from Exxon will be owned at the Williams level. For the time being, we felt that Williams had more
financial capacity to hold those assets while they're being developed than PZ did, given the already large array of
growth opportunities that PZ was holding. So that was the primary reason we moved that to Williams rather than WPZ.
But that remains a dropdown opportunity that PZ will likely enjoy at a [indiscernible] (22:07) future date.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks. I was just thinking about the commodity exposure here at the WMB level and the
increased investments in Canada. Just wondering how you're thinking about the mix of maybe adding more commodity
sensitivity with those additional investments rather than – and kind of how you're thinking about what the cash,
otherwise you could do if there's tax issues with bringing it back and maybe that is part of the reason why that you're
driving more investments in Canada?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Just – this is Don again. I would say again for us to bring back $500 million, our cash tax
rate would be about 50%, so about $250 million of that would be paid to the IRS and that's pretty -- a lot of value
leakage. And the good news is, we have some opportunities in Canada that we think are very strong with very high
rates of return, so if we look at that versus the opportunities here in the U.S., we just see, despite the fact there is some
commodity volatility, we just have a higher hurdle rate on the projects such that even in a low commodity price
environment, they're still very attractive investments. And in a more of an expected case it's very strong, and when you
compare that to, paying all that cash tax and bringing it back and investing in an opportunity here in the U.S., the
Canadian investment, despite the fact it's in the commodity sense of the business is, tends to be something that we're
interested in, I think. The one area that we're exploring is PDH and, again, we think that propane in Canada is likely to
be under tremendous pressure, and the margins from that business will likely be very strong.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. Thanks. That was helpful.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would add to that on the -- this is Alan – I would add to that the, for instance, the CRNL
is an ethane contract that supports that, does have a floor for the ethane that's at a cost-of-service pricing for the ethane.
So there is contractual support for that risk that we are taking in that expansion up there, for both the new ethane capital
that we are investing as well as the CRNL expansion.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Great. Got it. That's great. And can you talk a little bit on the price that you came to for
Geismar? You could argue that it's something of a low multiple for WPZ to pay. Just how your thinking was coming to
that price?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. I think, you know, the multiple is always dependent on the amount of pricing risk and
where you are to peak or trough. And certainly that is a build out of a business. And so, today's pricing, of course, if it
was a steady, already-existing asset that didn't have a lot of growth in it, would deserve a higher multiple for those
more sure cash flows. But I think with the pricing assumption, that is our best guess, that the pricing assumption is out
there and, nevertheless, that is a peak relative to the market and we don't think it would deserve such a high multiple.
So a lot of, as you can imagine, a lot of interesting debate amongst the conflicts committee for WPZ and its -- the folks
that support that as well as internally here, but we think that we really hit the right spot for both WMB and WPZ in that

transaction.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Sure. And then you touched on it a little bit, but maybe talk through more of your assumptions
on the price for [ph] gas, I'm (25:48) particularly interested in natural gas at $3.25. It looks like the forward curve is
closer to $4 for '13. And then on ethylene you have got this big jump in '14 going from $0.50 a gallon – a pound,
excuse me, to $0.63, kind of what's driving both of those forecasts in your guidance?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. On the gas price, I'll hit that first. I think gas price yesterday is coming off of a year
about $3.90 or so for '13, and of course, that's been moving around quite a bit. I would just tell you, we certainly hope
that and think for the health of the industry, that is a good thing, but, we can see -- continue to see supplies grow. And,
in fact, our forecast of lower volume rates is not showing up currently in our growth rates, it's continuing to grow. So,
we think that a lot of the demand that we picked up over the summer, obviously, was very price-dependent growth and,
you can argue whether that price is $3.50 or $3.75 or $3.25. You can argue as to where that price that kicks coal out
and brings gas in, but it's certainly not $4 from our vantage point.
And so I think -- we think that that low that we saw in the natural gas price is pretty temporary and is very price-driven.
So, we continue to be impressed with the kind of drilling and growth around our systems as we sit here today, but we
think eventually that's got to moderate and obviously, that is our reaction to it.
On the ethylene price, I would just tell you that what we saw in the -- what we continue to see is really response to --
between crude oil and ethane. As you get into '14, we're -- you know, we're actually completely, or almost completely
neutral to ethane prices, and in fact a little bit short ethane. So if our ethane price is wrong, that will just show up in
ethylene price, but we're really just driving that ethylene price off of CMAI forecast and oil prices. And so that's the
best intelligence that we have based on the markets that we're seeing out there.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: That is it for me. Thanks. I appreciate it.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with Touhy Brothers. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Hi, guys. A couple of questions. First and I apologize there's some competing calls today. But I
just want to clarify: the $600 million segment profit plus DD&A for the dropdown is a proportional number?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yes.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And Don, can I stay with you for a minute? Speaking of taxes that have been discussed,
can you speak to what the tax rate might be on the LP distributions from PZ? Would that be changing at all with the
Olefins dropdown? And also would there be any potential over time as you invest more CapEx and get more
depreciation in Canada for that 50% tax you alluded to to come down?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I would say that our cash tax rate moves around a bit, depending on when assets were
placed in service. Minimum tax -- a lot of variables here and moves around a bit. I think from a planning standpoint on
this slide, we have it here in our illustration, we kind of normalized it at about a 25% rate on the distributions from
WPZ. Some years will be higher, some are lower. We normalized it there for -- to take some of the volatility out of it.
I would note that when we issue equity, including in the Geismar transaction, our effective tax rate goes up because in
effect that -- to the extent that we issue units to the public, there is an embedded gain there from a tax standpoint. So it's
a pretty complex subject. But I think the way we've modeled it here I think is generally representative with some
volatility. I think you will see some years, you know, could come in sub-20% and some could approach 30%.
As to Canada, we have got a negative basis in our foreign assets. And so the issue there is to bring the cash across the
border with the trigger gain and that's a pretty substantial gain at this time.

<Q - Craig K. Shere>: It's -- since they've never been taxed with U.S. authorities, when you reinvest money in the new
projects in Canada, do you get credit for that when you bring it back?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: No. I mean it comes down to tax basis in all of our international assets. And again, we've
got some legacy European and Venezuelan tax positions, so it's a big ball that includes a lot of legacy stuff. So, it's
going to take some time to unwind that. There is a -- we do have an embedded 25% tax rate in Canada, so we're
providing taxes, and paying Canadian taxes at about a 25% rate on Canadian income. But it's really that cash balance
that we have sitting in Canada or the cash that we might generate is still working against a negative tax basis.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. And my last question: Alan, there were some questions around the changes in expected
gathering with natural gas volumes, you alluded to trying to be a little conservative, especially as maybe C-t-G fuel
switching eases off a bit and suggested that some of the numbers may change if you're wrong to the high side, with
maybe the volumes will be greater.
My question is: many producers that have alternatives are saying even a $4 gas, they're not going back and turning on
the spigot because they make just so much more money on the liquids part of the plays that they have, that there is a
limited amount of capital and they just can't see putting it towards dry gas. And you all have mentioned even the
Marcellus that some of the prolific dry gas areas are easing off, even though there's probably very respectable returns at
some of those very good wells today. Can you speak to whether you really think the volumes will necessarily follow
price?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, that's a great question and one that we obviously wrestle with around here on a
regular basis. And I honestly think it is very dependent on producers' capability; certainly not all these basins are
created equal. There is quite a bit of differentiation from one -- even in Susquehanna County, I'll let you there is a
pretty big spread in one part of the county versus others. And as well, I would tell you that some producers are better
than others at getting their costs down, and as well, there is a major variability in terms of what their other options
might be and what they're invested in.
And so, I would just say it's not as -- the market's not perfectly efficient in that regard. It is remarkably -- from my
vantage point sometimes, I always marvel at how efficient it is, particularly this summer the kind of pickup we saw
with low natural gas price on the demand side. But in the producer side, it's not -- not everyone has the same number of
options where they might take their rigs and some are more invested in others in getting their cost structure down in an
area.
And so, we certainly saw that with our previous ownership of WPX in the Piceance where they had a very low cost
structure in the Piceance, and we certainly see that in the Marcellus with some players having a much lower cost
structure and a – and lower cash cost than others.
So, I would just tell you it's pretty variable out there and I think it's hard to draw it with a broad brush. And so that's not
the way we do it. We do it kind of from a – building it from a ground up perspective based on all the different input we
get from producers in each of our areas and so that's really how we've come up with that.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. Thank you.

Your next question will come from Sharon Lui, Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to get your thoughts on what's an appropriate coverage ratio for
WMB and WPZ longer-term. Are you thinking about I guess, the figures you outlined in 2014, meaning 1.2 for WMB
and 1.1 times for WPZ?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, it's Don. I would say it's a complete function of business mix and commodity
prices, and the growth rate because, again, as Alan mentioned earlier in the near-term we're burdened with an
extraordinary growth rate. We're financing a lot of growth and that means more units out, more interest expense with

little cash flow.
But, if you look at 2014 and you look at the ethylene price, you know you can vary that ethylene price and you are
going to get a lot of different coverage. You can move gas price and you can get much different coverage. So I think it's
really a function of what you assume on prices. So, the 1.23 is built off the price assumptions we have here, price and
margin and all the other assumptions. So, if you have lower-margin assumptions, you will get lower coverage, if you
have higher, you will get higher. But again, I think it's going to be variable, coverage will be variable based on where
we are on the commodity cycle and a number of other factors.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And then, I guess, looking at your 2013 guidance at -- for the low-end, are you comfortable
at this point in terms of continue to deliver growth at WPZ and distributions and have a negative coverage given the
cash flow visibility in 2014? Can you maybe just talk about that?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I'd say we still have positive coverage in 2013, based on our guidance, so, yes, we are
comfortable. Obviously there's business risks, including commodities that we'll face, and there's upside opportunities,
but, at this point, we're comfortable with our guidance as being, what we're certainly targeting and we think, we think
that it's realistic.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And I guess the last question: [indiscernible] (37:11) any operational impact of Sandy on
your northeast operations at this point in time?
<A>: Frank, you want to take this?
<A - Frank J. Ferazzi>: Yeah, I'll -- this is Frank Ferazzi, I'll take that question. We did lose [indiscernible] (37:24)
power in many of our compressor stations in New York and New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania, but at those stations
we have backup generation capability and it's powered by natural gas. And so there is no disruption to flows.
We do have our LNG facility that's located close to the water, and so we anticipated that we may get some minor
flooding and that did, in fact, happen. So in anticipation of that, we took the facility down on Sunday. We did, in fact,
get some water, but once the facility dried down and we pumped a couple of feet of water away, we're not expecting
any permanent damage there. No leaks on the system, no other disruptions in flow. So I think on balance we fared
remarkably well. We're going to have to remove some trees from the right of way. Some fences were blown down, but
again, no permanent damage to the facilities and no disruption in flow.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A>: Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead, your line is open.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Good morning, guys.
<A>: Good morning, Becca.
<Q - Becca Followill>: On the gas pipelines it just looks like the EBITDA is a little bit, or the EBIT is coming in a
little bit lower than at least we were expecting despite some double-digit increases in throughput. Can you talk about
what you see going on in that business? And then just given where you are year to date, do you still think you're going
to meet the low-end of your guidance?
<A>: Yes, Becca, this is [indiscernible] (38:54). In the third quarter we did see some higher expenses at our gas
pipeline. Those were driven principally by the Pipeline Safety Act. As you know we have to complete testing our
system by the end of 2012, so we're certainly on track to do that. But as we get near the end of that period, we did have
some higher integrity and testing costs that we did see in the third quarter. And then we also saw some higher benefit
costs related to our pensions and our post retiree medical expenses. Those were the primary drivers, I think, of the

lower results in the third quarter. We are on track, you know, to hit the guidance that we have given for 2012.
<Q - Becca Followill>: That would -- I mean that would imply a really big fourth quarter of close to $200 million
versus $178 million a year ago. So what's really driving that?
<A>: Well, we have some additional revenues from expansion projects that we put in service earlier in 2012, so we'll
get revenues from there and then we do have some projects that we look at expensing those dollars until they reach a
level of [ph] profitability (40:10). And so to the extent that we have some projects that move down the development
path, we'd have some opportunities to revert some expenses there as well.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Got you. Thank you. And then on the Caiman-Utica JV, any status updates on that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: This is Alan. I would just say there's a lot going on there. We're not positioned to announce
anything new on there, but very pleased with the opportunities that are coming forward on that. So, stay tuned.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. And then on shared services, you guys talked about a new shared services
undertaking in your second quarter 10-Q and then had a charge for reorganization in the third quarter. Is there more to
come on that and what kind of benefit do you see to Williams as a result of this?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Great question, Becca. There has been a lot of efforts around the organization on
that, and frankly, we were responding to overhead costs as one item that came at us from the spin-off of WPX, and so
trying to make sure that our overhead costs are in line with the size of the company and the complexity of the company
today. And so, we are going through a process of taking out some layers of management across the organization.
But as well, I would say very much on the positive side, we are bringing a lot of alignment and a lot of focus around
our engineering and construction capabilities, as well as getting the customer voice from all these various areas right up
to the leadership table and getting that as close to our actions as possible. So, a lot of very positive things coming out of
this where we're really trying to get more of our resources focused on our areas of opportunity.
And when I say that, I'm talking about people resources that are really focused on where our frontline opportunities,
whether it's growing out our business on the E&C side or being able to be very responsive to customers' needs as this
infrastructure build-out continues to really amaze us, in fact, in terms of the amount of demands and opportunities that
are in front of us. So we're really trying to position the organization to be more responsive to the kind of build-out that's
ahead of us and we continue to enjoy.
<Q - Becca Followill>: You have a financial impact in terms of incremental savings or incremental costs?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: We have not -- we don't have a final number to put forward on that yet, Becca.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. Thank you. And then finally, on EBITDA guidance, looks like the base business is
coming down and you talked about the gathering volumes, but we're also seeing CapEx for the base business come up
once we net out the numbers for Geismar. So, what is that higher CapEx related to on the base business?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Is this on WPZ, Becca, I didn't follow you?
<Q - Becca Followill>: Yes. Yes. If you want, I can wait [ph] for an answer on that on the PZ call (43:24).
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: We'll get back to you on that, [indiscernible] (43:25).
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: One item there, Becca, that I can think of that's in there is the Gumbo acquisition and the
capital that's driving that is a piece of that at Williams. And so....
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Some of it is timing that we've shifted some capital from '12 to '13 and the timing of some
other projects have moved around as well. So we'll dig out the details here and advise you, if not on the call, after the
call.

And we'll take our final question from Carl Kirst of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks, good morning, everybody. Just a quick question on the petchem pipeline initiative, and I
guess my question is, since you guys have somewhat of a first mover advantage here, as we look at the return profile of
that capital being deployed, should we be looking in sort of a – the return profile of a normal kind of fee-based
contracted pipeline asset or is there the opportunity to earn perhaps a significantly higher returns for that capital?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, Carl. Good question. You know, I would -- we didn't get a ton -- given all the other
moving parts we have had in this earnings call, we haven't had a chance to focus very much on that, but I think we've
forecasted that in the past in terms of our bullishness around the need for infrastructure as the petchem business grows
out from all the new NGLs coming into the market there, and we are more convinced than ever that that is the case and
there's going to be a lot of infrastructure.
We've made three acquisitions from pipelines that we're converting the service on here in the last 10 months or so, and
have been doing that fairly quietly as we want to make sure we've got the business contracted for that business. But in
terms of return expectations, I can tell you that it does vary according to risk, but I would say probably on average it's
between about 14% and 20% pre-tax returns on those capital investments.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. Appreciate the color.
Operator
We have no further questions at this time.
Alan S. Armstrong
Okay, great. I will close it up here. Thank you all very much for joining us. Very excited about our future. A lot of
moving parts happening in this quarter. And I want to reiterate that we're very committed to maintaining the health of
WPZ as I think we've demonstrated with the Geismar dropdown. And frankly as we have been forecasting for quite
some time, we were concerned and have been concerned about the ethane supply getting out and ahead of the cracker
capacity. We certainly think our Geismar expansion is timely and is going to be able to take great advantage of new
ethane supplies, ahead of any other cracker expansions. And so -- but we think eventually the petchem market is going
to respond to the huge amount of NGLs that producers are going after today.
So, we're excited to be in this space and excited about the growth opportunities that are out for us really across the
board in our business today. So, really feel very good about the growth prospects that lie before us in the company. And
we've got a lot to execute on, but very confident in our team's ability to do that.
So with that, we'll close it up. And once again, thank you very much and good luck in your recovery if you have been
impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Thank you.
