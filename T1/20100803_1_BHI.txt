MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Carrie and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Baker Hughes Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Flaharty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed.
Gary R. Flaharty, Vice President, Investor Relations
Great. Thank you, Carrie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Baker Hughes second quarter 2010 earnings
conference call. Here with me this morning are Chad Deaton, Baker Hughes' Chief Executive Officer and Chairman;
Peter Ragauss, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Martin Craighead, President and Chief
Operating Officer.
Following management's comments we'll open the lines for your questions. Reconciliation of operating profits and
non-GAAP measures to GAAP results for historic periods can be found on our Web site at www.bakerhughes.com in
the Investor Relations section under Financial Information.
Finally, I want to caution you that any company outlooks discussed this morning are subject to various risk factors.
We'll try to highlight these risk factors as we make these forward-looking statements, however, the format of the call
does prevent a thorough discussion of these risk factors. For a full discussion, please refer to our Annual Report, 10-K,
10-Q and, in particular, the forward-looking disclosure in this morning's news release.
With that, I'll conclude our discussion of the administrative details and turn the call over to Chad. Chad?

Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you very much, Gary, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd say following up on two pretty decent
quarters, I'd rate the results of this past quarter as mixed. On the positive side, operationally, we performed better than
expected in North America, Russia and Asia Pacific, where we made some significant improvements sequentially.
In North America, we're now well positioned to benefit from the continued increase in our unconventional gas
development, and I'd say our acquisition of BJ Services has turned out to be pretty well timed. As a leader in
completions, directional drilling, bits and now pressure pumping, we have the full tool kit we need to compete in the
unconventional shale plays.
Sequentially, our U.S. land business showed strong growth. However, the sequential improvement for North America
as a whole was muted in Q2 by the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and, of course, spring break-up in Canada. Now
that we own BJ Services, our revenue in the Canadian market has increased by about 80% as both companies enjoy a
very strong presence in the country.
Revenues in Russia made significant improvement, both year-over-year as well as sequentially. Our acquisition of
Oilpump Services has given us the uncontested #2 position in the Russian ESP market, which is the largest ESP market
in the world. And in Asia, our new Geomarket organization is beginning to deliver contract wins and improve share.
Aside from the temporary slowdown in the Norwegian drilling activity, our European region performed well during the
quarter. And in the Middle East we're winning some contracts and expanding our presence in Iraq. On the other hand,
in Africa and Latin America, where we have invested heavily, revenue has lagged and our profit is below our
expectations.
Africa is a particularly difficult challenge for us right now. In North Africa, Libya has announced 30% budget cuts.
Spending in Algeria is recovering slowly following a change in the management of Sono-Trak. In Nigeria, revenue is
down following significant Q4 '09 and Q1 '10 deliveries for the Total Usan completion project. As a result, profits
declined in the region and resulted in a temporary increase in our tax rate in some countries, which calculate tax as a
percentage of revenue.
As for Latin America, we're disappointed with the progress we've made in Mexico. In the second quarter, we were on
just two rigs on the Alma Marine project. And if you recall, this is to be a 7-rig, 15-well contract. So despite strong
operational performance and a significant investment to support larger-scale operations, we've been unable to secure
more activity. And this contract is up for renewal during this quarter and at this time we intend to let it lapse.
Africa and Latin American regions do have some bright spots. Sub Sahara Africa revenue was up strong year-over-year
and we're seeing strong year-over-year and sequential performance in our Andean and Brazilian Geomarkets. Also in
Brazil, we obtained a good contract for the second most active Brazilian operator that further diversifies our customer
base in the country.
In the quarter we completed our first year under our new geographical organization, and I'm pleased with our
accomplishments in several different areas. We sought to improve our understanding of the market, moving from eight
different product line views to a coherent view of each local market and the global market as a whole, and we've done
that.
We wanted to do a better job of setting R&D priorities for the organization, thus reflecting market priorities, and now
we have a process in place to do that. We wanted to make sure that we didn't compromise our standards for field
execution and safety, and to date, we have maintained our high level of service quality as well as our HSE standards.
We decided to launch a multi-year effort to upgrade our supply chain, and we're beginning to see the benefits of this
transformation. We wanted to address the market share growth challenges of the past, and under the new organization
we've made progress. Over the last several quarters, we've kept pace with our peers, and we are achieving higher
success rates on tenders.

We also said that the new business model would help us achieve long-term profitability, and that is where additional
work is required. International margins remain disappointing. I believe we are now about three to four months behind
where I expected to be at this time. Now that the regional organizations have a year under their belt, we're increasing
our focus on improving efficiency and returning our international margins to acceptable level.
On April 28, we closed on our acquisition of BJ Services and began integrating its international operations into those of
Baker Hughes. We've established reporting relationships where both BJ and Baker Hughes international managers, and
we've aligned operating territories in order to improve coordination between our product lines. Financially, BJ Services
has already had a positive impact on our results, excluding the acquisition-related costs, and it was slightly accretive to
earnings per share in its first two months.
Unfortunately, while the international integration is proceeding, we have not yet been able to engage the full power of
BJ because of the hold-separate order imposed on us by the Department of Justice, which has kept us from combining
operations in the United States. As you may know, full integration of our business in the U.S. is predicated on our
selling two stimulation vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and related assets in order to create a fourth competitor in the
sand control and stimulation services in the Gulf.
On July 6, we announced that we had reached agreement with a buyer on the sale of the vessels and the associated
assets. We now look forward to the DoJ's approval of the agreed sale so we can integrate U.S. operations and take
advantage of the opportunities of the combined company in what is our largest shared market.
I do want to take just a minute and comment on the Deepwater Horizon accident. This was clearly a tragedy and one
that we – and we cannot forget the fact that 11 lives were lost. The loss of life, the oil spill and the drilling moratorium
have touched all of us here on the Gulf Coast. With so many rigs idle, Baker Hughes has redeployed over 300 people.
And also a substantial amount of equipment has been moved to U.S. land and international offshore markets where
deepwater drilling continues.
We do remain committed to the deepwater drilling industry. While the loss of life and environmental damages are
significant, we believe the industry will rebound. I was working in the U.K. in 1988 when the Piper Alpha disaster
occurred. That accident left 165 people dead and resulted in significant improvements in operations in the North Sea
and throughout the industry.
Operating procedures and safety standards were strengthened and enforced and accident rates have been substantially
reduced. The Deepwater Horizon accident likely will result in similar process and technology improvements that will
reduce the risks of deepwater development. Already customers from around the world are asking service companies to
certify that their employees have the right competencies to work offshore. Many are asking us to help train their people,
and they're demanding quality programs to verify that equipment does the job it is sold to do.
Financially, the Gulf of Mexico moratorium is negatively impacting our business on the shale and in the deepwater,
with a potential impact of 0.08 to $0.11 per share per quarter in the second half of the year. As was the case with Piper
Alpha in the North Sea some 20 years ago, government and industry must work together to find the answers and to
begin moving forward.
As to our outlook, we expect our North America land business to continue its solid performance, as unconventional gas
and oil-directed drilling in the U.S. continues to grow and as the Canada market rebounds seasonally. We look forward
to completing our integration with BJ Services and attacking this market with our full suite of products and services.
And we believe international markets will continue to improve. Deepwater activity outside of the United States will
continue to be strong. And finally, we expect our emphasis on operational efficiency to help us improve our
international margins significantly by yearend.
So at this point, I'm going to turn it over to Peter to go through the financials, and then he's going to hand off to Martin
for a review of some operations. Peter?

Yeah. Thanks, Chad. This morning we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $93 million or $0.23 per share.
Adding back the impact of a $0.13 charge for acquisition-related costs, our earnings were $0.36 per share. This
compares to $0.28 per share a year ago and $0.41 per share for the first quarter of 2010.
Q2 was a very complicated quarter with a number of factors that impacted results and our disclosure. Last quarter, we
gave guidance that our earnings would have been in the low 40s, excluding the impact of the acquisition-related costs,
purchase price adjustments for BJ Services, and a tax rate between 33 and 34%.
So excluding the merger-related costs of $0.13, the step-up in depreciation and amortization of $0.05, and about a
$0.03 impact from the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium, underlying operating earnings would have been about
$0.44. This also excludes the impact of the change in tax rate of about $0.07.
You will notice this morning that we changed our reporting segments from Drilling and Evaluation and Completion
and Production to five new segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/Russia/Caspian, Middle East/Asia
Pacific, which are all the same names we used before but they've been replotted slightly, and a new segment called
Industrial and Other.
The new Industrial and Other segment consists of our global downstream chemicals, pipeline inspection and reservoir
technology and consulting businesses. BJ Services' historical segments have also been remapped into these five new
segments. This was a natural outcome of the reorganization begun last May, and recognizes that the transition period of
product line management to geographic management has ended and that our primary process for evaluating
performance and allocating resources is now along geographic lines.
Many significant changes were related to our acquisition of BJ Services on April 28. Acquisition-related costs
expensed in the current quarter were $56 million before tax, 51 million after tax, or $0.13 per share. We acquired BJ
mid-quarter so Q2 only includes results for May and June. U.S. GAAP results from BJ for prior periods are not
included in our prior periods.
We issued 118 million shares, representing 27.6% of the company, which brought our total share count to a little over
430 million shares. The average share count for the second quarter was 399 million shares.
During Q2, our purchase price allocation process for BJ Services progressed to the point where we can now provide a
reasonable estimate of the fair value adjustments relating to inventory, PP&E and intangibles. As it currently stands,
we're ending up with about 1.8 billion in intangibles and a PP&E step-up of about 475 million.
In addition, as part of the ongoing purchase price allocation analysis, we identified certain transaction costs of
approximately 196 million that we have included as part of the purchase price consideration and have included the
amount as part of goodwill.
The preliminary incremental non-cash charge for D&A, depreciation and amortization, is about $172 million annually,
or about 43 million per quarter. These D&A amounts are offset somewhat by reduced interest expense of $4 million a
quarter resulting from a debt revaluation. These, of course, are subject to change as we complete our valuation work.
Since Q2 includes only two months of BJ, the net impact in this quarter was about 26 million before tax, 18 million
after tax, or about $0.05 per share. This charge impacts our reported operating margins. It is allocated to the segments
based on where BJ's assets are; mostly North America, Latin America and Asia.
As Chad said, for the short two months BJ Services has contributed to our earnings, it is already accretive on an
earnings per share basis and accounted for about one third of the company's EBITDA.
This morning we also provided supplemental information for Q1 2008 through Q2 2010 by quarter. This schedule,
which is available on our Web site as an Excel spreadsheet, shows revenue and operating income for our new
segments, for Baker Hughes and BJ Services on a pro forma combined basis including the D&A charges and excluding
synergies.

Our tax rate in the quarter was 44%, significantly higher than our previous guidance, reflecting a 39% rate for the first
half of 2010, so Q2 reflects this rate along with a true-up for the first quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate is
primarily due to profits below expectations in certain African countries. This results in unbenefited tax losses in some
foreign jurisdictions or tax losses in countries that impose taxes on revenues or deemed profit.
In addition, profits are well over plan in North America at marginal rates between 35 and 37%, and the BJ Services tax
rate is planned at 36.5%.
Back to operations. Q2 revenue was 3.4 billion, up 44% or 1.04 billion year-over-year, and up 33% or 835 million
sequentially, primarily due to the addition of BJ Services for two months. Looking at quarterly comparisons by
segment, North American revenue was 1.5 billion in the second quarter, up 115% year-over-year and up 62%
sequentially.
Revenue outside of North America was 1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 13% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially.
Industrial and Other revenue was 223 million in the first quarter, up 34% year-on-year and up 18% sequentially.
As outlined on table three of the earnings release, on a combined pro forma basis, combining BJ Services and Baker
Hughes results for all prior periods and adding in April – and adding in just the month of April 2010 results for BJ
Services, Q2 revenue would have been 3.75 billion, an increase of 629 million or 20% compared to the same period a
year ago, and an increase of 88 million or 2% sequentially.
Q2 North America revenue would have been 1.73 billion, up 658 million or 61% year-over-year, and up 87 million or
up 5% sequentially. Outside North America, revenue would have been 1.77 billion, down 2% year-over-year and flat
sequentially. And Industrial and Other revenue would have been 247 million, up 3% year-over-year and flat
sequentially.
Referencing, again, table three on a pro forma combined basis, our oil field operating margin for the second quarter was
10%, up 100 basis points from 9% in the first quarter. International margins were flat sequentially at 7%, including the
BJ Services businesses. And North America margins increased 300 basis points, despite the spring break-up in Canada
and the impact of the drilling moratorium.
In Q2, our combined corporate costs were $56 million compared to 49 million in Q1 for Baker Hughes standalone.
Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter end our total debt was 2.9 billion. In the second quarter we used 480 million in
cash and issued 320 million of commercial paper in total to fund the $800 million cash portion of the BJ transaction.
We also assumed $500 million in debt from BJ Services. Our total debt-to-cap ratio was 18%.
We had cash of 900 million and our net debt was 2 billion and our net debt to cap ratio was 12%. We also completed
two other acquisitions in the quarter for $154 million.
Following the BJ Services transaction we met with the rating agencies to review our financial condition and our
long-term plan. The rating agencies re-affirmed our debt ratings, single A by S&P and A2 by Moody's. Today, we have
$1.7 billion of committed credit facilities consisting of a three year $1.2 billion facility accessible through March 2013
and our existing $500 million facility accessible through July 2012.
Last, a few thoughts on guidance for the third quarter and the balance of the year. We expect to have a tax rate of 37 to
38%. As mentioned previously, the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium would have an impact of $0.08 to $0.11 per
share per quarter. We expect corporate costs of $60 million in Q3, and we are on track to meet our first year synergy
targets. Finally, CapEx for the combination on a pro forma basis is unchanged at 1.7 to $1.8 billion.
I'll now turn the call over to Martin who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?

Thanks, Peter. As Chad mentioned, this quarter marks the first year for our new organization. And as I look back over
that year, I'm pleased with the progress we've made and the short timeframe in which we did it, and I look forward to
capitalizing on the enormous potential of this combined organization.
North America had a good quarter. The U.S. rig count averaged 1,506 rigs in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of
571 rigs or 61% from the second quarter of '09 and an increase of 161 rigs or 12% compared to the previous quarter.
The horizontal rig count for the second quarter 2010 increased 102% year-over-year and increased 18% sequentially,
reflecting the increase in drilling activity in the unconventional reservoirs.
At least 90% of the growth in the U.S. rig count was concentrated in six active plays. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing are prominent in all of these plays, and as such, we saw high differential growth in fracturing-related
products, including our growing FracPoint multistage completion system, our AddFRAC frac fluid treatment service
and our extremely successful line of composite plugs.
Our ability to ramp up to meet demand for these plug systems is one recent tangible benefit of our new supply chain
organization. We've reviewed and overhauled the manufacturing processes, enabling us to double production in less
than 12 months and capitalize on this near term market opportunity.
Another couple of highlights for U.S. land operations this quarter. Hess Corporation awarded Baker Hughes a 5 year
contract for directional drilling services, drill bits, drilling fluids, pressure pumping, cased hole wireline logging,
packers and completion systems in North Dakota's Bakken Shale play.
Also in the Bakken, Baker Hughes installed the first FracPoint multistage frac system to be instrumented with
downhole fiber optics and electronic monitoring sensors in a 20,000-foot horizontal well so the customer can acquire
real-time downhole data during the fracturing operations.
In the Gulf of Mexico, our business had built up strong sequential momentum prior to the moratorium. We're taking the
actions necessary to properly manage the downturn, yet ensure we retain our market-leading position once the activity
recovers.
And Chad mentioned we remain committed to providing differentiated technology for deepwater applications in the
Gulf. During the quarter, for example, Baker Hughes installed electrical submersible pumping systems in two vertical
subsea boosting stations located on the seabed at Shell's deepwater Perdido field in the Gulf of Mexico. These pumping
systems have the capacity to boost up to 125,000 barrels of fluid per day.
Canada has had its seasonal spring breakup, yet I'm happy to report that Canada is rebounding quickly, and we sense
that Q3 will be a strong quarter for us. The BJ merger has given us an especially strong franchise position in Canada,
and the teams are integrating at a great pace, and sharing ideas and opportunities to leverage the synergies there. For
example, one of the largest SAGD producers in Canada awarded us the contract to complete all of their 50 SAGD
heavy oil wells in 2010.
Latin America has a very diverse mix of geomarkets. We are experiencing strong performance in the Andean and
Brazil geomarkets. In Brazil, for example, we were awarded an offshore multi-product contract for a Brazilian
independent, the second most active operator in the country. The award includes directional drilling, logging while
drilling, wireline and surface logging and real-time monitoring services.
Not much has changed in either Venezuela, which remains difficult because of the payment issues, or in the Southern
Cone, which is dominated by high operating costs, particularly labor costs, in Argentina. Mexico is, however, the most
disappointing. Budget cuts have idled industry capacity and flooded nearby markets, creating incremental pricing
pressure in what was already a low-priced market.
In Europe, revenues declined in the quarter primarily due to a dramatic, but temporary shift in activity from drilling and
evaluation in Norway in the first quarter to completions in Q2 and the impact of a stronger dollar on our local currency
service revenues in the U.K. compared to the first quarter. In June, we opened our Eco-Centre waste management
facility in Peterhead, Scotland to serve the North Sea with environmentally compliant waste processing services from
the rig site to final disposal.

And as Chad mentioned, our results in Africa were disappointing and won't show meaningful improvement until Q4.
Activity in Africa had been strong in the last couple of quarters. However, projects in four countries finished during the
quarter for us. Operations in Angola are down to a rig dispute that halted work on a major project of ours, and in North
Africa, Q2 revenues were impacted by project delays in Algeria and severe budget cuts by our customers in Libya.
In Russia, activity improved in the second quarter over a weak Q1, and as long as oil prices remain above $70, we
believe our customers will continue to invest. Our Middle East performance was driven by the Saudi Arabia and Gulf
geomarkets, as key product delivery of screen, ESPs and safety valves were completed.
In Saudi Arabia, the mobilization of our coiled tubing drilling rig was delayed for the entire quarter, but the project is
now underway. A second hybrid rig is in the country and will be mobilized next quarter. Our Saudi Arabia geomarket
received a purchase order for 30 permanent downhole monitoring systems to be used in conjunction with intelligent
well systems, and we achieved a milestone of completing and controlling more than 1 million feet of reservoir section
with equalizer technology.
Our operation in Iraq is up and running. We will install our first ESPs this month, and I'm pleased to announce that we
signed a 3-year technical services agreement with the Iraqi South Oil Company for the deployment of wireline data
acquisition and logging services.
We saw growth across the broad region of Asia-Pacific, especially in the completion, artificial lift and fluid product
lines and growth was strongest in Australia and Indonesia. During the quarter we were awarded upper completion
contracts in Australia and drilling and evaluation service contracts in Indonesia and China. PetroChina awarded Baker
Hughes a contract to supply 77 multi-stage openhole FracPoint completion systems for horizontal wells in China's
second largest onshore oil and gas field. We also signed a strategic 2-year framework agreement with PetroChina
Tarim Oilfield Company to supply directional and vertical drilling systems, formation evaluation services, completion
services, artificial lift technology and electrical submersible pump systems in the Tarim field in northwest China.
Some final words on our merger with BJ Services. From an international perspective, the BJ Services acquisition is
fundamentally complete, and the international teams from both organizations have been meeting to develop joint
approaches to customers and to exploit the co-location opportunities. We've also begun to see some benefits in our
international operations. In Indonesia, Baker Hughes has gained chemical treatment business based on BJ Services'
ongoing coiled tubing operations in that country.
In the UAE, Baker Hughes and BJ Services obtained a joint contract to work on seven offshore rigs together. And in
Iraq, we're moving BJ Services' coiled tubing and cementing units on to the Baker Hughes base that's already
established in country.
We're 14 months into our geographic organization. The structure has improved our ability to understand our market and
better serve our customers. It has enabled us to standardize numerous functional processes and procedures and
implement our supply chain strategy, all of which were impossible under the previous structure.
Today, we're focused on leveraging the benefits of the international geomarkets to improve productivity and efficiency
and to fine-tune our overhead and support costs at our geomarket, region, product line and corporate functions. And we
will be making adjustments focused on international margins.
Finally, I want to let you know that our supply chain initiatives are proceeding full steam ahead. We are consolidating
vendors and leveraging our purchasing power. We have trimmed our manufacturing footprint and adopted Lean
manufacturing processes to deliver more output from the same fixed cost base.
We're also reviewing labor costs globally and working to geographically align our manufacturing capacity to more
efficiently supply customers in our geomarkets. Again, all of this made possible by last year's reorganization.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad.

Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Thank you, Martin. We went on a little longer today with our comments than what we normally do. So I think,
Gary, let's just open it up for questions. We'd love to talk.

Great. Thank you, Chad, and at this point I'll ask Carrie to open the lines for your questions. To give everyone a fair
chance to ask a question, we do ask that you limit yourself to a single question and a related follow-up question. So,
Carrie, at this point could we have the first question, please?
Q&A

Your first question comes from the line of Joe Hill of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
<A - Gary R. Flaharty, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Thanks. Chad, I noticed in the release you expressed confidence that your operating margins in
international would improve significantly by the end of the year. And given what we saw in the second quarter with
ECA, Africa in particular, and Latin America, could you tell us what gives you confidence that you can meet those
targets?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Joe, Q2 and as Martin said in his comments,
Q3, Africa will not return until Q4 in terms of improvement. Africa in Q4, Q1 of last year and this last quarter was very
strong, but fell off for various reasons in North Africa and parts of West Africa in Q2, and that'll carry through into Q3.
So we see West – we see Africa coming back in Q4.
Also, we see in Europe, Norway, which has been very strong for us, had a shift mainly from drilling to completions, but
that already is moving back into the drilling side, so we see Norway returning Q3 and Q4. U.K. is picking up. I mean,
the rig count is forecast to be up around 20% for the second half of the year versus first half, so we see that improving
there. There's strength in Europe.
Both Middle East and Asia by Q4, again, I think Q3 is just going to be kind of a quarter similar probably to Q2, but I
think by Q4 we're seeing – starting to see different activity from Iraq to these contracts in the Emirates to some work in
Oman. Egypt's picking up. So the forecast is showing that for Middle East/Asia, Q4 we should see some improvement
there. And of course we've got some things to do in Latin America in Q3, which we should see the benefits of in Q4. So
when we plan this thing out, it looks like Q4 will start showing the improvement.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Okay. That's very helpful. And if you exclude pressure pumping, what product line performed the best
in the quarter, relative to your expectations, and what was the worst?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I think drilling services, drilling systems
continued to perform well. I don't think any of them were really the worst. I think probably wireline North America's
got some of the most challenges. I think bits are coming back due to the rig count increase in North America. ESPs,
obviously, always swing back and forth based on orders, big orders from quarter to quarter, but the ESP business had a
fairly decent quarter. Obviously, as you said, Joe, pressure pumping was clearly the strongest of all the product lines.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Okay. And just finally for Peter, the incremental tax rate obviously took a big step-up here. Given the
forecast improvements in profitability, should we expect the tax rate to come down for 2011?
<A - Peter Ragauss, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We do think it will probably come down
in 2011. If we do get a nice uptick, steady uptick in international margins, which we're expecting beginning in Q4, it's

going to help. And if we can stay at those levels and improve from there, it's going to help a lot. And the other thing
we've got going on is we're reviewing our cost structures and margins from a tax perspective, and we're looking for
efficiencies as we integrate Baker and BJ together. There's a lot we can do there with respect to tax planning. So a
couple of levers we've got there going into 2011.

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro of Jefferies.
<Q - Stephen Gengaro>: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. I guess two things, and I start with North American
margins. If you look at, I guess, table three that you provided, the incrementals were, I think, north of 60% despite
Canada. How should we think about that going forward? And kind of, can you give us some sense for what the biggest
drivers were there?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well – hi, Stephen, this is Chad. The biggest
drivers in North America go back to the pressure pumping. Very strong incrementals in pressure pumping. Land,
traditional legacy Baker Hughes, decent incrementals. Not as strong as first quarter, but decent in the second quarter. I
think going forward, what you'll see is right now on the pressure pumping side we're maxed out. We are adding
equipment. Some is actually coming in this week from some capital equipment that we authorized back in January to be
built, so that's rolling out. That will give us some continuous revenues and help with some incrementals on there.
There's still some room for pricing on pressure pumping. That's coming up. I think where we've got our other side is,
although we're tight in some of the other traditional product lines, directional drilling bits, et cetera, we're not as tight
there as we are on the pressure pumping equipment side, so that gives us some room to continue to grow in second half
of the year. I think that would be the breakdown of how we'd see incrementals through the rest of the year.
<Q - Stephen Gengaro>: And then just as a follow-up you mentioned, I think, pro forma CapEx unchanged. Is there
any reallocation of that to North America pressure pumping versus other areas?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. We're running we said at 1.7 to 1.8. We're
roughly at about 600 million through the first half of the year, spending. That's typical. Usually the second half spends
more than the first half, just by the time people get their orders in at the end of the first quarter, et cetera. Obviously, the
BJ side of that is a fair amount of the CapEx and probably about 60% of BJ's capital plan for this year is for North
America. And that's kind of split between Canada and the U.S. land, and then the other 40% of BJ is international. As
far as legacy Baker Hughes, most of our capital continues to be for international operations.
<Q - Stephen Gengaro>: Great. Thank you.

<A - Gary R. Flaharty, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: You guys referenced the waiting on the DoJ to approve the sale of the stim assets. I think when

<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Kurt, I wished I could. We're surprised it's not
closed as well. We continue to get back in front of the DoJ almost every day. I send an email asking where we stand,
our team. We're just waiting on some final things that they need to go through with the buyer, but we're hoping that this
happens pretty soon. It is a tremendous inconvenience for us right now.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. But you're kind of at a point where either you're hesitant or really, given the DOJ situation,
you really can't handicap the timing at this stage?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. And then I had a follow-up here. Peter, I was wondering
if you could just, you've mentioned that your synergies are on track. Just for the benefit of us with early-stage
Alzheimer, can you go through the list of those synergies for us once again?
<A - Peter Ragauss, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. So what we said was we expected
the first 12 month synergies of 75 million and an additional 75 million the following 12 months. In the first 12 months,
most of those would be sort of in the corporate functions and associated with the change of control payments and
everything else. And I'm happy to report that in the first two months that we've owned BJ, we've achieved $10 million
of synergies. So we're, when I say we're well on track, I mean we're six-sevenths of the way there for the first year.
And then going forward, we've got a lot of opportunities in co-locating facilities, back office synergies as we put our
systems together. We're working together already internationally on combined supply chain activities, chemicals
purchases and things like that. And all of that is starting to unfold now, but that was more or less in the plan for the
second year.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: And given the delay in the DOJ approval here of this transaction and the integration, full
integration of the U.S., BJ U.S. operations, does that mean you guys are going to have to run even faster in the back
half of the year? Or could you give us some general color how you think you might be able to make up for the lost
time?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Kurt, I don't think it's going to affect us that
much. As Peter said, a lot of that was the corporate. That is being worked on or is being done. That has nothing to do
with just the U.S. land type operation. And as far as some of the other synergies, that's more – a lot of that involves
combination of bases at our facilities, our offices, which I think the last time I looked in the Far East, they've identified
some 13 offices that can be co-located.
And whereas in North America it's going to be a little harder to combine facilities just because of the size of BJ's
facilities and the amount of horsepower and equipment they have. We don't have anything big enough for them to
move in with us and vice versa. So we never did consider that type of synergy in the U.S. We looked mainly
internationally, where we felt there was a lot of combination. We're working on that already.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. That's great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Boyd of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Dan Boyd>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Dan Boyd>: Chad, you mentioned that you are increasing – or you may increase CapEx for BJ, but it looks like
they're still spending a decent amount this year. Some of the data out there suggests that BJ lost some market share
during the last cycle, so how do you think about the competitive position of the combined company going forward? Do
you want to take back some of that lost market share, or is the goal really just to maintain the current position?

Page 11 of 17
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think everybody lost – all the majors lost market
share in the last cycle. Obviously it's gone from three or four big players to 15 or 16 players, so everybody gave up a
little bit. I think BJ did lose a little bit, maybe a point. It's not our goal to go out there and build a whole bunch of
excess equipment and take all that market share back. We will defend the market share. We're not going to let it go
down anymore, and that's one reason why we are building some additional equipment.
BJ is turning down work today, and we just don't want to let that number get too big. I think there is the danger that this
industry, history has shown it's overbuilt and that's always the possibility out there, but we're trying to balance the
amount of equipment. They didn't build a lot last year, just simply because they really tightened up, so we're building a
little more. Like I said, we authorized some in January and we just authorized some more large 3,000 horsepower fleet
to be built for the second half of the year, delivered in October/November. And then we'll watch it and see what the
market conditions are doing at the time.
<Q - Dan Boyd>: All right. That's helpful. And you guys are impacted a little bit more by the Canadian seasonality
than some of your peers. Can you share some of the statistics on what you saw in U.S. land revenues sequentially,
maybe on a pro forma basis? And then also talk about the margin progression you saw just in U.S. land specifically as
the quarter progressed?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we don't break out U.S. land versus Canada
in terms of margin or anything, but in general, we saw U.S. land margins improve dramatically in BJ and nicely in
Baker Hughes. Canada wasn't as bad as we thought it was going to be; it held up better. If you had looked at us during
what our plan, we thought the breakup wasn't as bad. And that holds true for both BJ, as well as Baker Hughes. Baker
has always been in pretty good shape up in Canada due to our split of services on completion and on the ESPs and the
chemical side.
So that helps condition us or I guess positions us a little better in Canada during the breakup. There's no doubt BJ gets
hit hard. As Martin made the comment, though, we see Q3 coming back pretty strong for both BJ, as well as Baker
Hughes. And I think Q3, Q4 should be good quarters for us. We see land U.S. we talked about continuing to go
forward. I don't think Canada will offset the problems we have in the Gulf on the moratorium, which we talked about.
Martin, do you have any comments on Canada or U.S.?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: No. That's good.
<Q - Dan Boyd>: The one thing I'm trying to make sure. Is there any reason, I think peers are reporting margins I think
as we look out for the third quarter probably in the mid-teens range at least. And I think Halliburton just reported over
20% in North America, though they don't have as much Canadian exposure. Are you on track to hit those type of
numbers in the back half of the year?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, throw out the Gulf and I would say yes. I'm
not afraid of those mid-teens to high teen margins.
<Q - Dan Boyd>: Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it back over.

Your next question comes from the line of Marshall Adkins of Raymond James.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Good morning, guys, and, Martin, congratulations on the promotion. I want to focus, stay on
the North American topic just for a minute here. As he just said, the peers had some pretty impressive sequential
margins. Help me to understand where your margin improvement's going to come from. I mean, you mentioned
Canada, obviously BJ and you were huge in Canada. It's a down quarter. We're going to get some improvement there,
but were you exceptionally large in Gulf of Mexico and/or could you share with us how BJ margins are comparing to
Baker margins as we go forward?

<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I think so, Marshall, this is Martin. Let me take
a crack at that. In terms of how do we see the margins progressing and why, let me follow up on some of the comments
Chad made. Across all product lines and across all of the key basins in U.S. we've begun to see price movement. Now
obviously in some of the product lines, directional drilling, as well as some of the key completion technologies, like our
FracPoint and our composite plugs, there's differential pricing movement there. I think we're also seeing in some of
those key basins our customers prepared, besides just a supply tightening, there's a strong focus on our customers to
improve their efficiency, improve their recoverable numbers. Some of the drilling is getting tougher, not easier, even
though we're drilling further and in more concentrated profiles.
So we're seeing a willingness like never before to pay for technology in certain of the basins. And certainly it's not
across all customers yet, but that's gaining some traction. And then we are very anxious, more so than anybody out
there listening, to get this hold separate off of us. And the numbers that we're presenting today are really just an
accounting exercise of adding BJ for two months and us, and that's not why we bought BJ, and you know that,
Marshall. There's a whole lot of synergy that a couple of our competitors are able to enjoy, and it's not just on the cost
side. More importantly, in this market, it's in the solutions that we're able to bring forward to the customer, and we are
probably less able to do that now since the announcement of the acquisition than before. So it's really a – we're running
it separately, as we're supposed to. So working together, being very selective on the price, but more aggressive than in
the past, and by no means is U.S. land dried up when it comes to technology, so I'd say that's the three main areas, if
that answers your question.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Yeah. Yeah. Very helpful. All right. And follow-up to that, it sounds like getting the approval
of the disposition of the sand control business is going to be a big deal for you guys in terms of integrating those two,
which is helpful. Can you give us some sense of the business you're selling to Superior, what was the run rate of that
business before it was sold? Or is there such a thing?
<A - Peter Ragauss, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. The annual revenue is roughly $70
million or so and profitability varies depending on what jobs you're on, right?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. It's really hard to try to pull it together and
come up with a number of each.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: I thought it might be, but figured I'd take a stab. Great. Thanks, guys.

client, along with some of the things that we're doing on reservoir mapping, microseismicity and various other things, I
do think we'll be able to gain that market share. Now there's no doubt the horsepower side of things is critical. You
don't have the horsepower, you can't grow the market much. But I do think that we probably can do a better job as an
industry in terms of picking where these fracs need to take place, perhaps bypassing some zones and increasing size on
other zones. I just think over the next year or two the industry's got to move forward to be, rather than just brute
treatment, need to be a little bit more selective in technology understanding of the formation. So I think that's the
excitement, again, as Martin said, why we bought BJ, to bring this total package to the client.
<Q - Scott Gruber>: Okay. Turning to Mexico, Chad, can you update us as to your plans for your people and
equipment in the country? You highlighted your intention not to renew the Alma Marine contract and, obviously,
onshore activity is down as well. Could you just provide some color on your plans there for your people and
equipment?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. We're already – some of that is project
management-backed, so some of these people are operational people to manage projects. They're already – several of
those have been relocated to various projects around the world. Some of that goes on down to Brazil to support the
growth and activity in Brazil. Some of these people even come back up to help support U.S. land. With NAFTA and
things, we can go back and forth on some of our Mexican employees there. So right now, there are some areas around
the world that require help. Now the equipment, again, we need to just find the right home for some of that equipment
and move it around. The good news is, with the exception of pressuring pumping equipment, logging tools, et cetera,
can be moved pretty easily.
<Q - Scott Gruber>: Does the discussion of a significant expansion in CapEx by Pemex, does that incentivize you to
keep more operational support in the country during the second half of the year?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we'll keep a base there, Scott. We'll,
obviously, keep a few bases there. We have ongoing work with Pemex, and we will maintain a presence, but we're not
going to keep a lot of equipment there, anxiously waiting for the thing to take off. There is a lot of competition down
there right now. We all are over-staffed. I think everybody's in the process of reallocating assets and people. And we'll
see, once that budget comes out and the activity starts up, and again, we've got the facilities there, we've got the base
case. We can build once that happens.
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Scott, this is Martin. Let me just clarify a
point.
<Q - Scott Gruber>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: As Chad mentioned, allowing that contract to
lapse is the only really structural thing we're doing in Mexico. I mean, we're still participating on the ATG labs. I think
we're managing nearly 100 wells for them right now in terms of monitoring and collecting the data. And it's
progressing as planned, and we have ongoing businesses in the North and in the Central and in the South, as well as
offshore. It's just that project, which was a big resource hog, if you will, in this global market. It's just got a lot better
places for it to be redeployed and that's what we're doing.

<Q - Brad Handler>: I guess a basic question, just to see if you – to the degree to which you can help us. Can you
give us some guidance for the third quarter EPS?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No.
<Q - Brad Handler>: I guess I'd assumed so.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think what you have to look at, Brad, is we talk
about Africa continuing the problems through the third quarter. We've got to continue to fix Latin America, especially
in Mexico, through some of that. We have the Gulf moratorium, which we said 0.08 to $0.11. Now that's kind of the
negative areas. More on the positive areas. You've got an ongoing continued strength in land U.S., which we don't see
any weakness coming out of that in the third quarter, and if you get a good strong recovery in Canada, probably won't
offset the Gulf of Mexico, but it will definitely help.
You see Europe bouncing back with the U.K. activity and you see Norway bouncing back from the drilling to
completions back to drilling. Russia had a very good quarter, probably will hold in that area through Q3. And slow
improvement in Middle East and Asia in Q3. But there's still a lot of moving parts out there, obviously, trying to get
one more quarter BJ rolled in from two. And some ongoing, just some clean-up issues as the organization, as Martin
said, we're ready to tweak certain things internationally a little bit. So I just don't think we're ready to throw out a
guidance number for Q3.
<Q - Brad Handler>: I appreciate that. And I certainly – I think I appreciate the revenue drivers more or less. It is –
it's just that area of, you're talking about getting some synergies, you're obviously anticipating a bit more – in the tax
rate, it sounds like you're anticipating some recovery in some of those markets. But I don't know how much of that
perhaps is cost driven, not activity driven. It's just, how much of the – how much can we think about in terms of
structural margin improvement that you're – as you're pushing your way through? Or maybe it makes sense to ask it
across the second half of the year just on that basis. How much can we think about you getting just in terms of raw cost
improvement, supply chain organization, synergy with BJ? Help us put some numbers around that, please?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I would just put Q3 in as – I'd carry through
from a Q2 type number, but good recovery in Q4...
<Q - Brad Handler>: Not much benefit...
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Being much better. And all-in-all, we actually are
pretty bullish when we look at where we are in the company. We love this new organization. We're now ready to take
the next step in terms of some efficiency gains in this organization. Clearly, we've got better relationships with our
customers around the world than we've ever had. We're excited about getting BJ. We see what's happening on the
international front and how well that's working and going and we're real excited about getting the U.S. deal closed so
we can take advantages of that.
And internationally, we see activity improving, especially as I said, around the Q4 and on into 2011. So I think we need
another quarter. As I made in comments, I think we're about three to four months behind where I think we thought we'd
be right now in our international margins, so that puts us in Q4 that we should see that improvement.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay. Maybe just to follow-on, Peter, maybe just a couple items. In Q3, can you help us with
D&A and expected kind of SG&A expenses?
<A - Peter Ragauss, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. D&A, about 310 to 320 million for
the combined company, and talked to you about corporate expense being up just a little bit. I haven't run the SG&A as
we reported. I'll have to run those numbers. I haven't got it in that format.

Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed of Macquarie Company (sic) [Capital].
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Good morning. You have a comment in your press release that you're helping South Oil Company
in Iraq to develop the wireline capabilities. I just want to understand, does that mean you're going to be selling wireline
equipment to them? Or are you just helping them in data interpretation and those kinds of services?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Yes to all of the above, Waqar. The Iraqi South
Oil Company has been a big customer of Baker Hughes in the logging business for years and years, and our fleets of
Eclipse logging trucks are already in Iraq from previous purchases, but this agreement is a three year renewable
contract between South Oil Company and Baker Hughes to upgrade some of the existing equipment, to train the local
logging crews that are employed by South Oil company, to help them maintain the equipment, and to train their
engineers on running some of the newer technology.
And on occasions where higher levels of technology are required on their fleet, then we will deploy Baker Atlas type of
technologies, such as magnetic resonance or reservoir characterization instruments on their trucks. Now that's not –
now that is completely separate from the two logging trucks that Baker Hughes already have in Iraq at our base.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Okay. And then just one final question on the R&D side. What would be the combined R&D for
cost of the BJ Services and Baker's? And do you see reduction, on a pro forma basis, are the costs going to remain the
same or do you see some synergies in that area as well?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's roughly $500 million combined on an annual
basis. We right now don't anticipate any reduction in that. Probably be a little bit of synergies and improvement, but
we'll probably hold that in that ballpark going forward.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Gary R. Flaharty, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Great. Thanks, Waqar. Carrie, we're reaching the
bottom of the hour. At this point, can we take one final question please?
Operator
Yes, sir. Your final question will come from the line of David Anderson of J.P. Morgan.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Thanks. Just kind of another question on the capacity you mentioned on the pressure
pumping, maybe asked a slightly different way. Perhaps you disagree, but it seemed pretty apparent that BJ
underinvested in this business in the years leading up to the acquisition, but now that you finally have the reins, I was
just wondering if you have a sense as to how much capital you're going to need to spend on equipment to get to par? In
other words, what percentage of the fleet do you think needs to be overhauled? It is a third, a quarter, half? Do you
have any sense of that right now?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Not as much as we would like based on the whole
separate – we haven't been able to dig into that as much as we'd want, but their equipment's not in bad shape. I think it's
mainly in the last year, year and a half that perhaps there was a little bit of under-spending, but it's way less than a
quarter of the equipment that's old, so I don't think we have a huge amount to go to catch up.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: So you think you can get there within the next twelve months?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I think – yeah, I think we can. Obviously,
what we're looking at doing today, and the equipment that we're building, if in time there's a downturn, what we'd do is
cut up a lot of the older equipment and replace it with equipment that we're building now. Right now you're using every
piece of equipment you've got in the yard, so you just want to continue to keep it rolling down the road, downturn
hitch, you get rid of the old stuff and replace it with the new stuff you've built over this last year.

<Q - J. David Anderson>: I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit more on that contract you mentioned
with Hess in the Bakken. I'm kind of interested in the mechanics of it a bit. Is there a set amount of volume that's
associated with that that's guaranteed? And how does the pricing change over the life of the contract? Is it indexed in
some way?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I'll answer the first part, because I know the
answer, and I'll let Martin answer the second part, because I don't know the answer, but there are certain products that
have a certain guarantee, directional drilling, for example, pressure pumping. We have a certain amount of guaranteed
contract. Not guaranteed, you obviously got to perform, but then some of the other things, entirety of bits and a few
other product lines are based more on callout and other things. As far as the pricing goes, it is a 5-year type contract.
Martin, you want to comment about the pricing?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: David, I don't know if it's indexed. I know
there is a component of the volume. This is split with another major service company, but there is a share-driven –
performance-driven share allocation as well, but in terms of the indexing, I've got to tell you, I don't know the answer
to that.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We end up with 80% of the drilling and completion
work and 30% of the pressure pumping, and the other company, as Martin commented, gets the 20% and 70%, and then
there's a bunch of auxiliary type products that are bought as the project goes forward.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: And safe to say you wouldn't have gotten this contract if you hadn't had BJ?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't know if you could say that. I think it
obviously helped in the sense that the customer saw that this was eventually going to be one company, and I think they
– but we went after these contracts individually. We couldn't negotiate or discuss with BJ until after they did that on
their own and we did our – the rest of it on our own, but the client obviously knew that this process was going to
eventually conclude, and we'd be one company.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Okay. One last question, if you don't mind. I guess I'm last, so I can take the liberty here,
but one of the drivers behind the BJ deal was to compete better internationally, particularly on the IPM contracts.
Nobody has been talking about that much this quarter. I was just wondering if you could kind of articulate a bit what
you're seeing on that front. Is bidding activity heating up anywhere? Do you expect to see any contracts announced by
yearend? Or are the economic concerns and oil fundamentals keeping those activities on hold for the foreseeable
future?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think there's been a little wind down in project
management type projects for a couple reasons. One is probably the Gulf of Mexico probably got everybody looking at
how much risk you would want to take, definitely not much deepwater as a service company, but I think that just made
you look at oil projects around the world a little bit.
And then, of course, what's happened in Mexico has not turned out to be the best project for anybody who geared up
for it. So I think that slowed down a little bit. Now I do think by the end of the year and into next year that will
probably resume. Algeria was a big place where there was a lot of work going on in project management.
I don't think that stopped because of a concern about project management. It stopped because of a change in
management at Sono-Trak. And we are seeing the guys sat down, as Martin said, internationally between the BJ and
Baker Hughes folks and identified some $2.3 billion worth of opportunity over the next 12 months of going in together
to tender on projects. Yeah, some of those you'd win without pressure pumping. In some cases you're able to get pull
through. So it's hard to break it out, but I think without a doubt we see the future internationally with the cementing, the
coiled tubing, the pressure pumping, a lot of pull through and opportunity.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Great. Thanks, Chad.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You bet.
