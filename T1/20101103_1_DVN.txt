MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Devon Energy's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being
recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Investor
Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Devon's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Call and Webcast.
Today's call will follow our usual format. I'll begin with some preliminary housekeeping and compliance items and
then our President and CEO, John Richels, will provide his perspective. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our
EVP of Exploration and Production, will cover the operating highlights. And then finally, following Dave's comments,
Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results and our outlook. At that point we'll open the
call up to your questions. Our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols, and other senior members of the management team
are with us today for that Q&A session.
And as a courtesy to the other participants, we ask that each of you limit your questions to one initial inquiry and one
follow up. We'll limit the call to about an hour and we will be around for the rest of the day to answer questions after
the call. A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on Devon's homepage.
During the call today we will provide some color on some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results
for the first nine months of the year and our outlook for the balance of 2011 and 2012. We will not be issuing a revised
8-K today because our outlook for the remainder of the year falls within the updated ranges we provided in the Form
8-K that we filed last August. To access a comprehensive summary of our current guidance which includes any
refinements we make today, you can go to devonenergy.com and click on the guidance link found within the Investor

Relations section of our Web site.
Please note that all references today for our plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates are considered forward-looking
statements under U.S. Securities Law and while we always strive to provide you with the very best data possible, many
factors could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. You can find a discussion of risk factors related to
our estimates in the Form 8-K that contains these forecasts.
One other compliance note, we'll refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these
measures we're required under securities law to provide certain additional disclosures and those are available for your
review on Devon's website.
By now most of you are aware that our decision to sell our international assets triggered the accounting rules for
discontinued operations. We have therefore excluded international production volumes for all periods presented as well
as the revenues and expenses associated with those; those are collapsed into a single line item at the end of the
statement of operations. That line item is labeled discontinued operations. For those interested in a more detailed view
of our international results you will find an additional table in today's news release that includes a detailed statement of
operations and the related production volumes that are attributable to the international properties.
As a reminder, the third quarter is our first reporting period without financial or operating results from the Gulf of
Mexico. While the international divestiture properties are considered discontinued operations, the Gulf of Mexico
divestiture assets are included in results from continuing operations for previous periods. For that reason, we are
providing supplemental information in our press release that isolates the results from Devon's North American Onshore
operations or in other words the go-forward business. As far as Street earnings estimates go, the majority of analysts
chose to report estimates to First Call that included only our North American Onshore operations. The mean estimate
from those analysts that focused on continuing operations was $1.25 a share for the quarter that compares to our
non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.31 per share. So our actual results beat the Street estimate by
$0.06 or about 5%.
With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO, John Richels.
John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2010, Devon delivered another very solid
performance both operationally and financially. Production from our North American onshore properties totaled
613,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, a 4% increase over the third quarter of 2009. This
production growth was driven by an 11% increase in oil and natural gas liquids production. In the current environment,
oil and NGLs now account for roughly half of Devon's total oil, gas and NGL sales revenue.
Strong realized prices for our oil production and improved cost efficiencies resulting from the repositioning drove our
adjusted earnings from continuing operations up more than 40% over the year-ago quarter to $571 million or $1.31 per
diluted share. Cash flow before balance sheet changes climbed 47% over the third quarter of last year, and combined
with the divestiture proceeds, Devon's total cash inflows for the third quarter approached $4 billion, far exceeding our
total capital demands for the quarter. As a result, we exited the month of September with an enviable position of $4
billion of cash on hand and a bulletproof balance sheet.
And on the operations front, we continued successful execution of our focused North American onshore strategy as
evidenced by quarterly production records at our liquids-rich Barnett and Cana shale plays and a multiyear production
high from our Permian Basin properties.
We also continued to make significant strides during the quarter towards completing the strategic repositioning that we
announced just one year ago. In the third quarter, we completed the sales of our interests in the ACG field in
Azerbaijan and our remaining assets in China. So to date we've received aggregate pre-tax divestiture proceeds of
approximately $6.8 billion.

The only significant divestiture package remaining, that's our Brazilian assets, is under contract for $3.2 billion. This
transaction is pending approval by the Brazilian government, and all indications are that this transaction will close as
expected around year-end. Following the closing, we'll have realized total proceeds from our divestiture program
exceeding $10 billion or roughly $8 billion after tax.
As we have always said, our objective in redeploying the divestiture proceeds is to optimize growth on a debt adjusted
per share basis. To accomplish this objective, we've taken a balanced approach by directing $1.7 billion of sales
proceeds to reduce debt and by allocating $1.2 billion to capture acreage opportunities across our North American
onshore property base, principally in oil- and liquids-rich areas.
In addition, we initiated a $3.5 billion share repurchase program last May. At today's stock price, $3.5 billion equates to
approximately 12% of our outstanding common shares. Through today we've purchased over 15 million shares for right
around $1 billion. This puts us on pace to complete the buyback within the 12- to 18-month timeframe that we
originally announced.
Buying back Devon stock is an especially attractive alternative given our current stock price. Our shares currently
priced in the mid-60s translate into a net enterprise value of under $10 per proven barrel. And this analysis attributes no
value to the thousands of unproved locations that we have within our 13 million net acre resource base in North
America.
Now before I turn the call over to Dave, I just want to address a subject that we've received a number of questions
about, and that is our capital budget and our production profile for 2011. Given the significant divergence of oil and
natural gas prices, similar to what we did in 2010, we expect to focus more than 90% of our 2011 capital on oil and
liquids-rich opportunities within our existing portfolio. Although we're still in the process of finalizing our 2011 capital
budget and have not yet submitted it to our board for approval, directionally we have a pretty good idea of where we
want to go.
First, recapping 2010, we previously indicated that we expected full year E&P capital to total roughly $5.4 to $5.8
billion for our North American onshore business. We're still comfortable with that range, but taking into account
continued upward cost pressures in the sector, we now expect to be in the top half of that range.
This level of CapEx, I'll just remind you, includes a total of $1.2 billion of acreage capture that includes the $500
million that we invested to acquire the Pike oil sands acreage, and about $700 million of additional leasing primarily in
oil- and liquids-rich plays in the Permian and Mid-Continent. We would not expect to repeat this spend rate for
leasehold acquisition in 2011.
Adjusting for that gets you to a normalized spend for 2010 of roughly $4.5 billion for our go-forward North American
Onshore E&P capital budget. Based on this starting point and assuming a similar level of drilling activity in 2011, with
some inflation for service costs, I would expect our 2011 E&P capital budget to fall between $4.5 and $4.9 billion.
When you take into account Midstream and other capital, our total 2011 capital demands should be somewhere in the
neighborhood of $5.5 to $5.9 billion. And with that level of spending, we would expect overall production growth of
6% to 8% led by a roughly 20% growth in oil and NGL volumes.
I want to make this very clear, our asset base has the capacity to grow at a much higher rate next year but top line
growth is not what we are optimizing. We're focused on optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share. We simply
refuse to get caught up in the growth at any cost mentality. Given the current environment, we can deliver optimum
results through investing in our liquids-focused capital program, buying back our stock and taking a disciplined
approach to our debt balances. In 2011 we expect these actions to boost production per debt-adjusted share growth into
the mid teens.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. David?

Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We
exited the third quarter with 67 Devon-operated rigs running, and during the quarter we drilled 407 wells. This included
384 development wells and 23 exploration wells. All but three of the wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North American Onshore operations were 1.4 billion
for the third quarter, bringing our total through the first nine months to 3.5 billion excluding the Pike acquisition. This
level of activity increased third quarter production from retained properties by 4% over the third quarter of 2009, led by
an 11% increase in oil and liquids production over the 2009 quarter.
Moving now to our quarterly operating highlights, first at our Jackfish thermal oil project in eastern Alberta, our third
quarter daily production averaged a little over 21,000 barrels per day net of royalties. As we indicated in our last
quarterly call, Jackfish was taken down for three weeks during the third quarter for scheduled maintenance. Following
the turnaround, plant operations were restored on September 30th. However, it will take a few weeks to fully restore the
steam chambers and climb back to plant capacity. Accordingly, fourth quarter production at Jackfish is expected to
average about 23,000 barrels per day net of royalties.
Construction of Jackfish 2 is roughly 90% complete and continuing to trend under budget. We expect to begin injecting
steam in the second quarter of next year delivering first oil in late 2011 with production ramping throughout 2012.
Our third Jackfish project, Jackfish 3, has now been sanctioned and we filed a regulatory application during the third
quarter. Pending regulatory approval, we could begin site work by late next year, with plant start-ups targeted for 2015.
Detailed engineering work is already underway and we have locked down prices on roughly 85% of the major
equipment orders. Devon operates the Jackfish projects and owns 100% working interest.
At Pike, this is our SAGD oil sands joint venture with BP that we formally called Kirby, we have begun the appraisal
drilling required to determine the optimum development configuration. We expect to complete appraisal drilling this
winter with a goal of launching the regulatory process for the first phase of development around the end of 2011.
Between Jackfish and Pike, we expect to grow our SAGD oil production to between 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day
by 2020. In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 53 new wells in the third quarter, holding production
steady at roughly 40,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter.
Moving to the Permian Basin, our net production averaged just over 44,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third
quarter, up 18% over the third quarter of 2009 and 6% over the second quarter of 2010. Our third quarter oil and NGL
production in the Permian was up 23% over 2009 and accounted for roughly 70% of our total Permian volumes. The
growth in liquids speaks to the quality and flexibility of our property portfolio. As we mentioned last quarter, we are
adding to the depth of this portfolio with approximately 200,000 additional acres in several oil and liquid-rich plays
leased this year. We have ramped up activity in several of our key oil plays and now have 17 rigs running in the
Permian.
One of these projects is our Wolfberry light oil play where we recently added a fifth rig. We drilled 27 wells during the
third quarter including one of our best wells to date in the play which had a 30 day IP of 500 barrels per day. Our net
Wolfberry production has increased nearly 150% since the beginning of the year to approximately 9,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day. Our focus over the coming months will be to continue the continued evaluation of our 200,000 net
acre Wolfberry position.
Also in the Permian Basin, we have four rigs running in the Avalon Shale play. Devon has assembled over 200,000
prospective net acres in this condensate and liquid-rich gas play. So far this year we have participated in 18 Avalon
wells and have production data on a total 30 wells, covering a wide geographic area. While we are still in the early
stages of evaluation of this play, the data support EURs of 400,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
depending on location within the broader play area, lateral length, et cetera. We expect to participate in 14 additional
Avalon wells this year. We're encouraged with the results we have seen and we'll keep you updated as we gain
additional information.
Another focus area in the Permian is the Bone Spring oil play where Devon has 170,000 net acres. The Bone Spring is
an oil play historically developed by vertical drilling. However, with the application of today's horizontal techniques,

we have recently seen some outstanding wells. In the third quarter we drilled and completed the Strawberry 7 Federal
4H that we brought on line at more than 700 barrels of oil per day. Earlier results from the six horizontal wells we have
drilled to date in this play indicate EURs could have average of around 300,000 barrels equivalent at a cost of 3.8
million per well. We currently have three rigs running in the Bone Spring and expect to drill approximately 20 wells in
the play this year. We are also running five additional rigs in the Permian targeting various conventional formations,
primarily with horizontal wells.
Moving north to the Texas Panhandle where Devon has approximately 58,000 net acres in the Granite Wash play, we
stepped up drilling activity during the quarter with the addition of a third rig that was relocated from the Barnett Shale.
In the third quarter we brought three Devon operated wells on line with average IP rates of 4,290 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, including 605 barrels of oil or condensate and 1,450 barrels of NGLs. With the attractive rates of
return generated by these wells, it's likely we will add additional rigs in the Granite Wash as we head into 2011.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford Shale in western Oklahoma, we continued to add to our acreage position during the
third quarter and now have approximately 240,000 net acres focused in the best parts of the play. This has increased our
risk resource potential at Cana to more than 10 trillion cubic feet equivalent. In order to continue to de-risk our position
and secure the term acreage that we acquired this year, we have significantly ramped up our drilling activity over the
past few months. We currently have 19 operated rigs running, and expect to add two additional rigs by year end. We
continue to see outstanding results from Cana.
In the third quarter, we brought 11 operated wells online, with average 24-hour IP rates of 5.3 million cubic feet
equivalent per day including an average of 175 barrels of NGLs and condensate. Third quarter net production from
Cana averaged a record 117 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day including 1,300 barrels of condensate per day
and 4,000 barrels of NGLs. This is a 12% increase on a sequential quarter basis. By year end 2011, we expect to drive
our net Cana production up more than 100% to 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day including 14,000 barrels per
day of condensate and NGLs.
In addition to enhancing upstream economics, the liquids-rich portion of the Cana field also create opportunities from a
midstream perspective. To capture this value just as we have in the Barnett and Arkoma, we are building a gas
processing facility. Construction of the Cana plant is essentially complete and we expect to begin processing next
month. The facility will have an initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and will be capable of
extracting up to 15,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The plant's processing capacity is expandable to 600 million a day as
our volumes from the field grow.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in north Texas, in the third quarter our net production reached the previous all-time
high of 1.2 Bcf equivalent per day, including over 40,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. This illustrates the
depth of our inventory in contrast to that of many of our peers. With virtually no lease expiration issues and thousands
of remaining high quality locations, we have considerable capital flexibility in the Barnett. It is likely that we will
choose to run a 12-rig program in 2011 with a focus on the liquids-rich portion of the play. This level of activity should
allow us to maintain our current production level. With most of our activity in the Barnett now focused on drilling
multiple wells from a single pad, we are finding that we are able to achieve even greater levels of efficiency.
We have also continued to improve drilling efficiency and recently set a new record of eight days from spud to rig
release for three recent Barnett wells. We are currently running 16 operated rigs in the Barnett but will relocate four of
these late next month.
Moving to the Haynesville Shale, after de-risking much of our held by production acreage in the Carthage area during
2009, our 2010 activity has focused on our term acreage in the southern area. However, given the rising service cost
environment in the Haynesville and the deep inventory of other attractive opportunities in our portfolio, our term
acreage in the Haynesville does not currently attract capital within our portfolio. Therefore, we are continuing to bring
in industry partners that are interested in developing this acreage.
Keep in mind the Haynesville drilling we did in 2009 in the Carthage area confirmed that we have a repeatable
economically attractive play under a more normalized gas price environment. Since this acreage is held by production,

we have the luxury of pursuing this resource when the gas price and the cost environment is most favorable.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of northern British Columbia, we have now drilled all seven horizontal wells that
we planned for this year. Four of these wells have been completed and we expect to have them tied in and producing by
year-end. Our producing wells at Horn River continue to perform better than expected, supporting an average EUR of 7
to 8 Bcf equivalent per well. Given that the Horn River is dry gas, we plan to spend minimal capital there in 2011.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?
Jeff A. Agosta, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today I will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that shaped our
third quarter financial results and review how these factors impact our outlook for the upcoming quarter in 2011.
As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities and results of operations from our international
assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. Since we completed our exit from the Gulf of
Mexico during the second quarter, our third quarter results from continuing ops represent just our North American
onshore operations, or in other words, the results of the repositioned Devon.
Looking first at production, in the third quarter, we produced 56.4 million oil equivalent barrels or approximately
613,000 barrels per day. This was in line with the production forecast range we provided during last quarter's call and
about 1% less than last quarter's production for our North American onshore assets. You may recall that during last
quarter's call, we told you that production from the second quarter had benefited from a 9,000 barrel per day royalty
adjustment related to prior periods.
Also, due to a scheduled plant turn around, Jackfish was offline for three weeks during the third quarter. As a result,
average daily production from Jackfish was 8,000 barrels per day lower on a sequential quarter basis. Removing the out
of period royalty adjustment, and the impact of Jackfish maintenance, sequential quarter production was up almost 2%.
On a year-over-year basis, third quarter production from our North American onshore assets increased 22,000 barrels
per day or 4%. As mentioned before, an 11% increase in oil and NGL production drove the favorable comparison.
Looking ahead, our high quality North American onshore assets remain on track to deliver full year production of 223
to 224 million equivalent barrels. This implies fourth quarter production of 625 to 635,000 BOE per day or roughly
10% over fourth quarter 2009 production.
Moving to price realizations, starting with oil, in the third quarter, the WTI index averaged $76.08 per barrel, an 11%
increase over the third quarter of 2009. Company-wide oil price realizations were near the top end of our guidance
range at 82% of WTI. The most notable regional performance was the narrowing of heavy oil differentials in Canada.
On the natural gas side, the third quarter benchmark Henry Hub gas price averaged $4.38 per Mcf. Our third quarter
realized gas price before the impact of hedges was 84% of Henry Hub or $3.67. Cash settlements from our hedging
position and regional basis swaps increased our overall price realizations by $1.00 bringing our all-in price, including
hedges to $4.67.
For the fourth quarter of this year, we've remained well-hedged with approximately 60% of our natural gas production
locked in at a weighted average price of $5.87 per Mcf. We also have roughly 70% of our fourth quarter oil production
collared with an average floor of $67.47 per barrel and an average ceiling of $96.48.
Looking to 2011, we recently added 300 million per day to our gas hedge position, bringing our total up to 525 million
cubic feet per day for the year, swapped at a weighted average price of $5.56. As part of these recent additions, we sold
call options on 12,000 barrels of oil per day for 2011 and '12 at $95.00 per barrel and call options on 300 million cubic
feet per day of gas for 2012 at $6.00 per Mcf.
Also for 2011, we have collars in place on 33,000 barrels of oil per day with a floor of $75.00 per barrel and an average
ceiling of $109.00. We will be posting a schedule on our web site after the call with all the details of our hedge
position.

Looking briefly at NGLs, our price per barrel in the third quarter averaged $29.01 or about 38% of the WTI Index
price. This compares to average realizations of about 40% of WTI in the previous quarter. We expect seasonal factors
to provide a modest boost to NGL prices in the fourth quarter.
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream division, they continued to deliver impressive results. For the third
quarter, our operating profit totaled $125 million, a 20% increase over third quarter 2009. Increased throughput and
higher commodity prices drove the improvement. For the fourth quarter, we expect our Marketing and Midstream
operating profit to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million. This would bring our full year operating profit to
roughly $500 million.
Looking now at the main expense items for the quarter, as we move forward with the strategic repositioning, we are
seeing the efficiency gains flow through to our reported results. On a sequential quarter basis, most expenses decreased
during the third quarter on both an absolute and a unit of production basis.
Lease operating expenses totaled $415 million in the third quarter or $7.35 per BOE. This represents a 3% decrease
from last quarter. This rate is indicative of what we would expect for the fourth quarter.
Shifting to G&A, G&A expenses continued to be well contained in the third quarter, totaling $131 million. For the first
nine months of the year our G&A costs have declined by $73 million or 15% when compared to the same period of
2009. Based on the actual performance for the first three quarters, we now expect our full year 2010 G&A expense to
be near the bottom end of our previous forecast range of 580 million to $600 million.
Turning to interest expense, for the third quarter it came in at $83 million, right in line with our expectations. When
compared to the third quarter of 2009, interest expense decreased by 8% due to lower debt balances. Looking to the
fourth quarter, we expect interest expense to approximate $80 million.
DD&A expense for oil and gas properties declined by 7% from last quarter to $397 million. The improvement in
DD&A resulted from the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets. For the fourth quarter we expect DD&A expense to range
between $7.00 and $7.25 per barrel.
The final expense item I will touch on is income taxes. After backing out the impact of items that are typically excluded
from analysts' forecasts, our adjusted third quarter tax rate on earnings from continuing operations came in at 33% of
adjusted pre-tax income. This tax rate consisted of deferred taxes equal to 40% of pre-tax income and current taxes of a
negative 7% for the quarter. This atypical distribution of current and deferred taxes was due to an adjustment related to
the filing of our 2009 tax return.
Essentially our 2009 tax return indicated more carryover benefits available for 2010 than we had previously estimated.
The cumulative impact for the first nine months of the year was recorded in the third quarter. In spite of the unusual
third quarter tax rate, our adjusted tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 was similar to what we now expect for the
full year, with a total rate of 33% of pre-tax earnings composed of a 6% current tax rate and a 27% deferred tax rate. In
today's news release we have provided a table that reconciles the effects of items that are typically excluded from
analysts' estimates.
Moving now to the bottom line, non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations totaled $571 million or $1.31 per
diluted share. Higher oil and gas revenues along with strong cost controls increased our adjusted earnings from
continuing operations by over 40% when compared to the third quarter of 2009. As Vince mentioned earlier, this result
also exceeded the comparable First Call mean number by $0.06.
Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to conclude with a quick review of financial position. During the third
quarter, Devon generated cash flow before balance sheet changes of $1.8 billion, a 47% increase over the year-ago
quarter. Additionally, we've received $2 billion of cash from the sale of assets in Azerbaijan and China. After funding
our total capital demands for the quarter of $1.8 billion and repurchasing $499 million of common stock, our cash
balances increased by over $1 billion during the quarter, reaching a total of 4 billion. With that level of cash and total
debt of roughly 5.6 billion, we clearly maintain a great deal of financial strength and flexibility.

Overall we believe our measured approach to the business and our balanced high-quality property base place Devon in
an advantageous position during this period of uncertain gas prices. Our deep and diverse inventory of oil and liquids
opportunities provides us with great flexibility in allocating capital in response to market conditions. We remain
committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength, and
optimizing our growth per debt-adjusted share.
At this point I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A.
Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Operator, we're ready for the first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Your line is open.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the detail this morning. A couple of things from
me. On the CapEx guidance for next year that you laid out, can you give us an idea as whether or not you're
anticipating living within cash flow or if you're – obviously the strength of your balance sheet would give you a little
more flexibility should you choose to pursue your oil investments a little more aggressively. And related to that, if you
could give us idea what you expect your rig count trajectory to look like through the course of 2011. And I have one
quick follow up if that's possible.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Doug, let me take a crack at the first part of that. You'll
recall a year ago when we announced our repositioning, we indicated that as a result of the fact we had kind of starved
our North American asset base for a couple years, we would take some portion of the proceeds from our asset sales and
invest them in both 2010 and 2011 in our capital programs. So depending on what kind of a price forecast you look at
for next year, that will result in some investment next year that's in addition to our cash flow for the year. And that was
always intended.
What the exact level of that turns out to be, as I mentioned, will depend on what commodity prices are next year. But
we clearly have the financial strength to do that and it's an appropriate thing for us to do given that we're investing in
very solid return projects. And then I'll ask Dave to maybe answer the question on the ramp-up.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yeah, I can give you an idea, and
again we haven't finalized and have board approval on our budget, but we do have some ideas here on what we think
the rig count may look like. It's actually pretty steady through all of our divisions with the exception of Canada where
of course you have increased drilling activity in the winter, and so you have a higher rig count in Canada during the
winter months. So Canada first quarter will probably have on the order of around 20 rigs working, about 11 or so we're
anticipating in the thermal type activity, primarily at Pike where we'll be doing strat wells and then we'll have a couple
of rigs at Lloydminster and then about seven or eight working on other various plays throughout Canada, some
Cardium oil plays, some Deep Basin plays, et cetera, but around 20. And then that will fall off in the second, third,
fourth quarters to around an 8 to 10 range on an overall basis.
The other three divisions we have, Central, Southern and Western, will be pretty constant. Let me just give you some
numbers for that. At Cana we mentioned we're going to be up around 21 by year-end. We're actually planning to
average around 23 rigs in Cana next year. And we mentioned in Barnett we plan to run about a 12-rig program which
would keep production flat there. We have about three to four rigs working in the Granite Wash area.

Then down in our Southern division, down in Haynesville, we mentioned that we are really going down to essentially
no activity there. We will have a total of about five rigs working various opportunities throughout our south Texas area
total for the year. Then we'll have about 20 rigs in what we call our Western division with about 17 of those rigs
working the Permian Basin area, about 17 of those – about three of them in the Rockies area, a couple working oil
opportunities up in the Powder River and one working Washakie.
If you want a little further breakdown on the 17 rigs in the Permian that we're going to have working there next year,
we'll probably have about five rigs working in the Wolfberry play, about three working the Avalon, four working Bone
Springs and about five working other opportunities we have in the Permian including Delaware, Wolfcamp, Tub, other
conventional plays we have there. So hopefully that gives you all the details you need on a not yet approved budget but
kind of a planned out budget for 2011.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: That's pretty thorough. Thank you. I guess my follow-up is really related to your comments
around the Haynesville, but I guess it applies to the wider portfolio. We haven't seen Devon participate or try to
participate in bringing joint venture partners in to pursue some development in areas that might not be top of the list for
your capital right now. Can you give us some thoughts on why perhaps Devon hasn't chosen to go down that route and
maybe what your outlook might be for divesting some acreage that doesn't fit the portfolio as you go forward? And I'll
leave it there. Thanks.
<A - Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Doug, this is Vince. I would comment that we
have actually brought in some farm-in partners in the Haynesville on our term acreage. And we really have a focus on
managing our overall inventory. So we think that rather than being focused on just maximum acreage capture that we
need to manage our inventory to optimize present value. So we are considering outright sales, farm-ins, JVs, any kind
of – anything that we're not going to get to in the next few years we're looking at a way to bring that value forward.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great stuff. Thanks, Vince.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.
<Q - David Heikkinen>: Good morning, guys, and thanks for all the details on your capital plans and drilling plans.
As I think about the Granite Wash and your current acreage position, how much of that do you think is prospective for
horizontal development? How much has already been drilled? Just trying to get an idea of real inventory and path
forward for that.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Hi, David. Yeah, we think we have
roughly 350 locations in the Granite Wash play, about 150 of those would be in the two upper formations where we've
targeted our work so far in the Cherokee and the Granite Wash A and about 200 locations in the lower Granite Wash
formations. Where we haven't drilled yet and frankly we're not sure the economics will be quite as strong, I mean, these
wells we're drilling right now you can imagine at these kind of rates we're getting are just incredible rates of returns, in
excess of 100%. And so we're not sure these lower Granite Wash locations, these 200, will be quite as good but they
could be extremely – we think they're still going be very, very attractive and we'll probably have a learning curve to go
through and we'll get good results from those as well.
So I'd say overall we're giving it – about 350 locations that we think we have, and as far as a net resource potential, it's
still early on. We need to know a little bit more about the lower Granite Wash, I'd say on a non-risk basis, could be as
much as 500 million barrels on a non-risk basis, maybe more like 150 million barrels or so on a risk basis.
<Q - David Heikkinen>: That's helpful. As you think about the lower Granite Wash, that's the Atoka – are you seeing
liquids component or is it pretty dry, is one of the...
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: We haven't actually drilled the
lower Granite Wash...

Your next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - David Kistler>: Good morning, guys.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - David Kistler>: Real quickly, with most of the leasing behind you in terms of capital being spent for picking up
additional acreage in the Permian and other plays, can you give us a sense maybe across the Bone Springs, Avalon,
Wolfberry, what the actual cost is on an acreage basis for you guys?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Well we're still actively – most of
it's behind us, but I think we're still doing a little activity. I'm a little reluctant to say too much on the costs overall. I can
say that on the Texas side of the Avalon play, it has been less because there's more frontier area out there. Where you
get on the New Mexico side of the play, it's been a little bit more expensive. I might also add that we have a huge
position out there that's already held by production. And so we aren't relying just on spending a lot of money that we
haven't on new leases. We have a nearly a million acres in the Permian in total. And so we have a lot held by
production that's contributing to our resource opportunities there.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And, Dave, it's John. Let me make one other point
about our asset base in general. When we're bringing new properties in, we've got – our asset base has some very
common characteristics. We have tried to stay away and, gosh, we haven't been perfect, but we've tried to stay away
from getting into paying really high amounts and giving high royalties in areas of our operations. So as we're getting
into new areas and we're bringing those properties in, we got to make sure they continue to compete against an asset
base that, instead of 20,000 bucks an acre, tends to have a cost of a couple hundred to a couple of thousand dollars an
acre and a 20 or less percent royalty burden. So that's one of the considerations that we're taking into account all the
time as we go into new areas, make sure that we keep that really low-cost economic asset base.
<Q - David Kistler>: Great. That's helpful. And then jumping over to the services side for just a bit. Thematically,
pressure pumping increasingly, and completion services are increasingly getting tighter and tighter. We're seeing
people have production delayed as a result of that. Can you talk a little bit about whether that's impacting you guys at
all in terms of are there some delays with wells being tied in? Are you building an inventory of drilled uncompleted
wells? And then probably more importantly, how are you planning on managing that and avoiding cost inflation in the
upcoming budget?
<A - Jeff A. Agosta, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I don't know that we can totally
avoid cost inflation in the upcoming budget. When we look at the cost, what we believe is going to happen looking at
an average of where we were midyear 2010 versus what we expect to happen for 2011, a raw service cost increase we
think is going be probably around 14%, 15% in 2011. Now we think that we can have increased efficiencies in our
operations that's going to lower that and we're planning in our budgeting process for about a 10% increased cost
environment versus 2010.
An important thing to remember is we are a very strong player in a vast majority of the plays where we are active,
whether it's the Barnett, or the Cana or even out in the Permian Basin. And so we command to a large degree, I guess,
attention you might say in that we can – we've had good luck with our – because we have a strong position of getting
good cooperation with the service companies to lock in our particularly the pressure pumping side. So in those areas
that I mentioned we really aren't having a significant problem.
The only area we've had much of a problem with delays on frac dates I'd say would be in the Haynesville where we are
not a large player compared to others and we don't want to become a large player because we think the economics are
not attractive there compared to other areas of our portfolio. And so we've had some delays. We do have frac dates

locked in for about our eight remaining wells in the Haynesville between now and the end of the year, but it's just not a
big problem for us overall to get frac dates locked in, although we obviously are, as I said, we're planning on about
10% cost increase, '11 versus '10.
<Q - David Kistler>: Great. Thank you so much for those clarifications, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman with Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Guys, good morning. Hey, Dave, can you give us an idea what kind of lease expiration picture
you're looking at in the East Texas Haynesville Bossier play in the term acreage?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Well, Mark, where we think we
have the large repeatable play identified that would be economic under a more normalized gas price environment, we're
talking there probably around $5.50 to $6.00 type prices, would be in Panola County. And that's all held by production.
And we have 110,000 acres held by production there. We have about 47,000 acres or so just to the south in Shelby and
San Augustine counties that we do not think, again, are meeting our return requirements for investment. That's why
we're dropping our rigs. We are talking to some people, whether they might be attractive to someone else. And so we're
talking to some companies to see if they're interested in pursuing that. That's around 47,000 acres or so with expirations
throughout 2011, 2012.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Dave, my follow-up, per the Barnett program for 2011 that you talked about, at what well
spacing will you be drilling on?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: We're drilling a lot of our wells
primarily on either 80's or 40.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: And that'd the basis of the 2011 program as you understand it now?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yes.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Robert Christensen with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Christensen>: Thank you. Jackfish 2, how quick a ramp will we have? Or will it be just identical to what
we saw in Jackfish 1?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: It's going to be very similar to
Jackfish 1 and it's probably going to take the better part of a year to ramp up to a full production rate.
<Q - Robert Christensen>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Polak with Scotia Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Polak>: Good morning, guys. A question for you on Jackfish 1, I'm just curious what kind of steam-oil
ratios you guys are seeing in the third quarter?

are top 10%. John, do you have the number?

<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we'll find out, Mark. Remember in the third
quarter we had the turn around going on so. . .
<Q - Mark Polak>: Right.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That's a little bit – that's not a great quarter to look at
from that point of view. But we are trending down to somewhere below 2.5 in our steam-oil ratio. And when it comes
back up to full production here in the next 30 days we'll expect to get back to that kind of level.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yeah, and our cumulative is down
around that level as well
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, cumulative is as well.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: So this quarter won't throw the cum
out much and we'll continue to be in the 2.5 or less range.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, the cum is around 2.5. I think we're actually on a
quarter basis, ongoing basis, probably even better.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Right. Low twos.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Mark Polak>: Thanks. And Vince already covered up my question on JVs, maybe just one more then on Horn
River. Just curious how you're completing those wells, how many stages and what kind of cost structure you seeing on
those wells.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yeah. What we're doing right now
is we haven't really optimized the number of stages that we think are going to be necessary once we go to full
development. What we're seeing is a recovery of about 1 million cubic feet per day per stage. And that's what we
wanted to see. We've been doing them so far on the order of four to eight stages, although we haven't really decided
what the optimum number of stages will be when we go to full development. Those wells, they've been costing on the
order of about $8 million per well completed.
<Q - Mark Polak>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Brian.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian Singer>: When you consider the 20% liquids growth next year, what contribution are your U.S. assets and
particularly the Permian contributing to that? Is that the major driver relative to Canada or is it relatively equal?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Well, there's two big pieces on the
U.S. side that are really driving the production growth, and that is going be Cana and the Permian assets, and they're
both going to be growing substantially. We mentioned that we're going to be doubling our overall production in Cana
to about 250 million equivalent per day including 14,000 barrels of liquids there, and we'll probably have about a 25%
growth or so in the Permian. And that will be roughly split equally between gas and oil and liquids. So those are the
two big drivers in the U.S. and then of course our Jackfish ramp-up in Canada as well.

<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, although for 2011, since we won't have the
second project ramping up for most of the year, most of our oil growth is coming from the U.S. in 2011.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Thanks. And then you mentioned much less acreage acquisitions next year. Do you think you
have the bulk of the acreage you want or need in the Permian and Cana plays? And do you see the potential for any
new liquids exploration plays to warrant capital to build acreage? And perhaps you could touch on activities in the
Powder River Basin oil drilling since you brought it up earlier.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me make a kind of a general comment first, Brian,
on the acreage that we have. We think we've got a very good acreage position, and we constantly have to in order to
deploy our capital really effectively and drive the most value for our shareholders, we've got to constantly balance this,
the notion of acreage capture with resource development. And so we don't want to just continue to add and frankly we
don't subscribe to the idea that the world of leasing is over. We think that there are going to be a lot of plays that come
around the next few years and we're focused on them.
And as I've mentioned to you before, it's not unlikely that you're going to hear us talking about a couple of plays that
have not had a lot of publicity over the next while. So with regard to the Powder River, specifically, maybe let Dave
answer that question.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yeah. And I'd just say we could
have strong production growth really living within cash flow over the longer term without adding any new acreage.
And so but we think it's always important to see if we can optimize, add new opportunities that may even be better and
move some of the poorer things at the bottom of the portfolio out. So that's just part of the ongoing process. But it's not
out of need so much. We have a very strong acreage position with a lot of opportunities right now.
With regard to the Powder River, we've got a couple ideas working up there. I don't want to go into a whole lot of detail
about them but we have ideas around some deeper oil in there and we're going to be testing out some of those ideas in
2011.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - David Tameron>: Thanks. A couple questions. Powder River, can you talk about oil, Frontier, Mowry, what
you're seeing there? And just give us some more color there?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yes, we just addressed that very
quickly. We see some opportunities in those type. I'd just prefer not to go into a lot more detail until we have more
results. But we're going to be drilling a few wells to test out some of those ideas and those type plays in '11.
<Q - David Tameron>: Okay. So – okay. Fair enough. Same question – Canadian Deep Basin?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yeah. We have a lot of running
room obviously up in the Canadian Deep Basin. If you look at it overall in the – we have about 6 million net acres of
land in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. And we're looking at plays in the fractured oil shales and the
carbonates in Deep Basin. We're looking at tight oil classics in Saskatchewan. Specifically on the Deep Basin, we have
about 600,000 net acres where we are currently evaluating some Cardium light oil plays with horizontal wells.
Additionally, we're going to be pursuing a number of other zones with horizontally with multistage fracturing, targeting
liquids-rich oil, and liquids-rich gas and light oil. We're also drilling some light oil plays in the Cardium, in the Ferrier
area of central Alberta. Testing the Viking light oil play where we have about 900,000 acres of fee lands in
Saskatchewan. So we have a large number of oil and liquids-rich plays in Canada that we're pursuing and they're in the
early stages most of them but they could grow into something material over the longer term.

Your final question comes from the line of Phillip Dogue with CDT Capital. Your line is open.
<Q>: Yeah. Getting pretty close there. Good morning, everybody.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q>: Could you bring us up to date on the sale of the properties in Brazil? As I understand it you haven't received the
money there, whether that looks any closer after the election or some other variable.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Phil, we've had no indications through the year that, that
wasn't moving ahead. It's exactly as planned. We always thought that, that was going to take some time given the
regulatory process that ANP goes through. The election, having the election behind us is a positive thing because it just
created some delays in that whole process, but the candidate who was elected is one that has been a supporter of this
industry and we still expect that to close somewhere around year end. So everything is on schedule and on course the
way we expect it.

and I heard you mention $1.2 billion and $700 million, two figures. My question is just clarification, is the 700
included in the 1.2 or is it separate?
<A - Jeff A. Agosta, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Yes. Yeah, it is. What it is, the
$1.2 billion that we allocated to undeveloped leaseholds this year included $500 million for the acquisition of the Pike
heavy oil lease immediately adjacent to Jackfish. That was part of our overall deal with BP during the repositioning.
And the other $700 million was invested in liquids and oil leases primarily in the Permian Basin and also some in the
Mid-Continent in our Cana play.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
That concludes our call. Thank you for joining us today. And as we said earlier, we'll be around for the rest of the day
to answer any follow-up questions.
