Michael G. Morris
Thanks a lot, Chuck, and good morning everyone. Thanks for being here with us for the update on the second quarter
activities at American Electric Power Company.
I'd move you to page three, the second quarter 2011 highlights and try to give some granularity about these small
statements. First, we're really quite satisfied with where we are through the second quarter of 2011. We really got off to
a bit of a slow start in kilowatt hour usage as you may remember early in the year, but things have improved in our
entire footprint since then. Clearly stronger in the West than in the East but acceptable in both of those areas.
Commercial sales in the East still are lagging from what we forecasted they might be but we're really seeing very
strong industrial sales throughout our Eastern footprint. In fact, if you remove the impact of Century Aluminum still
being offline we're at about 95 plus percent of the overall industrial send-outs that we saw in the pre-recession time.
And that really stays in line with the things that we talked to you about during 2008 and 2009. Very different from the
recessions that we saw in our Eastern footprint back in the '80s and '90s where plants actually were shut and shut
forever. What we suggested in the 2008, 2009 timeline was that people were laying their plants up with the intent to
come back and clearly that has come to be the case.
We are seeing additional shopping in Ohio beyond what we had forecast for our retail customers but as you might
imagine, American Electric Power retail operations have been successful, not only in AEP Ohio's footprint, but in the
other opportunities that present themselves here in Ohio and of course any gigawatt hour sale that doesn't go to the
retail market does go to the off-system market and I think you know from our press release that off-system sales results
have been quite solid.
So when we look at the net, net of the effect of switching in Ohio, we've always been an advocate for that. We didn't
think that would affect us quite as deeply as it has but we're reacting to it in a very constructive way and net, net the
impact is acceptable and we are satisfied with where we are with AEP retail and some of the things that we see. So
based on all that we look at, throughout these first two quarters we feel very comfortable with our $3 to $3.20 range
and reaffirm our earnings strength forecast for calendar year 2011.
We have a couple of interesting litigation developments to talk about. We couldn't be happier with the way that the
Texas Supreme Court ruling came out just a couple of weeks ago. I know that many have had a chance to digest that
and of course many of you have seen the impact that it had on CenterPoint and continues to have for them as they go
through the remand cycle of what the Texas Supreme Court has decided.
For us, as you know, it justifies the way that we went about auctioning off our assets, the way that we characterize
stranded cost going forward and it has a great potential upside for us, not only in a one-time event, which we'll talk
about, or Brian will talk about a little bit more here in 2011, but an ongoing basis as well.
And one of the things that you may not have appreciated and we surely do about the Texas Supreme Court decision is
that it also removed potential downsides that were argued by other petitioners in the case and made it quite clear that
the approaches that AEP Texas took to that endeavor were exactly in compliance with the law and we're very satisfied
with that as you might imagine.
We're also over the top satisfied with the ability to remove a number of the litigants in the overall activities in Arkansas
as they pertain to the John W. Turk plant. We are grateful that our team at SWEPCO was able to bring to resolution
with the Hunt Club folks as well as many of the other interveners in that case and I can assure that the political folks in
Arkansas as well as many of the judges that we reported the settlement to were quite pleased with what they had come
to learn about those activities.
As you know there are two NGOs who did not participate in the overall dialogue, although invited, and that is
interesting and we'll continue to carry on our dialogues with them to see if we can find some resolution. But more
importantly, the underlying environmental issues that those parties have raised were addressed in the overall settlement
with the other parties. So we think that we have the potential to bear fruit in those discussions with the two NGOs and

we'll continue to do that.
When we look at our regulatory plan, as you know we've already had some success in calendar year 2011. $220 million
of our overall rate stack already accomplished. There are a few cats and dogs out there that may help us get there, but
we're in pretty solid shape the way that we see it. The open proceedings in Ohio, Virginia and Michigan are there, some
may be resolved yet this year and they'll have a constructive effect, we would hope in that sense.
So let's spend a few minutes talking about Ohio because surely as you know we have a number of open cases in front of
this jurisdiction, all of which are important to us, all of which are important to our customers and clearly all of which
are very important to the economy here in Ohio.
We continue to have what we believe to be constructive dialogue with the many parties to the cases including the
commission staff. We will continue to work toward that end on all of these outstanding matters. As you know, the
merger case has been approved by the FERC. We would hope that that will come through here in Ohio in the not too
distant future.
A couple of important filings to be made in the not too distance future. Obviously today we expect that the staff will
file their testimony in the overall ESP case. Like all staff testimonies or testimony filed by any party, it will have some
parts that we agree with, there will be some other parts that I'm sure we don't agree with. Net, net testimony is never the
end result of where a case may end up but nonetheless, we, like you, look forward to reading that and hopefully we'll
find a few things in there that will be encouraging for as but are well aware that we may read things in there that we
don't necessarily agree with, as well.
At the end of the day, we feel very comfortable about our position in Ohio. We feel comfortable as I mentioned about
the dialogue that we've had with the parties to the cases. This is a new and different commission, surely up to the task
of resolving these many cases and we would hope that that happens.
We also will be filing our view of the 2010 review of the SEET activity pursuant to Senate Bill 221. As before, we
think Ohio Power is in the safe harbor zone and based on the way that the staff dealt with the activities at Columbus
and Southern in the 2009 review SEET activities, we feel comfortable at that we will not be impacted at all by the
SEET activities in the review that will go on.
Like all my other colleagues, let me move then to the environment update – I should say all my other colleagues who
are coal-centric producers – I know that you've had a pretty good walk through the way that we all see the impact of the
things the Environmental Protection Agency continues to do.
CSAPR came out, the industry spoke in a solid voice of we understand end game here, we think that we can get there
efficiently, financially and electrically if the dates would be extended from 2014 to 2016. Much to our dismay and
others, they moved those dates from 2014 to 2012, and of course as you surely read frequently, the state of Texas was
included for the very first time in the final rule that came out now called CSAPR.
Notwithstanding that, we feel very pretty comfortable at American Electric Power with our overall view of what we
think the EPA's rulings, not only that which are issued, but those that which will be issued, will have on our overall
system. We stay committed to the notion that we'll be shuttering 6,000 megawatts prematurely. I know there has always
been some confusion whether they were part of an overall settlement on New Source Review, New Source
Performance Review, some years back. About 700 of those megawatts were included in those timelines, however the
rest of them have all been moved forward because of the current activities going on at the EPA.
Closing some of those facilities over time will of course have an effect on our ability to have gigawatt hours available
for us in the off-system sales market. But throughout the footprints where we are very active with off-system sales we
expect other facilities will be shut as well and that clearly will have not only a constructive impact on the capacity fees
that we receive going forward but it will also increase the amount of money recognized on gigawatt hours of energy put
into the marketplace. At it doesn't take much of an uptick in those two numbers to compensate for the megawatts that
will be coming offline because as you well can imagine those were higher-priced plants at the top of the stack which
didn't dispatch as early as those on the lower cost portion. So we feel as though there will be some impact. It surely

won't be a devastating impact.
Nonetheless, we will continue to do what we can politically as well as in general dialogue with the EPA to try to put
greater rationality in what it is that they are trying to accomplish. I know that some of the more principled NGOs are
concerned about the approaches that we have taken to this, particularly in the legislative arena. But our position we
think is reasonable, it gets us to the same environmental footprint by 2020 instead of 2016 or 2017 and it's done in a
much more financially and electrically rational and beneficial way.
So we will continue to put as much as pressure on the EPA as we can. I am happy to see that today they decided to put
another cap on oil and gas drilling. That will bring some additional folks in the fray of trying to discuss about the
incredible aggressiveness that the EPA is taking. All in keeping with what they think is their challenge, but nonetheless
in our view unnecessarily over the top and a bit aggressive. I don't think there's a corporation in America that doesn't
want to get to the right place, it's just a matter of trying to get there in a cost effective and energy effective way.
Lastly, let me talk a minute about some disappointment, for us anyway, from the carbon capture and storage project
layup at our Mountaineer station in New Haven, West Virginia. I know that many of you have had the opportunity to
be there. You know how amazingly impressive it was that we were able to capture and store the only integrated project
anywhere in the world with a coal fired power plant.
But going forward without a carbon legislation or without an appropriate approach to carbon and its impact, it was
simply not able for us to go forward and continue that project. It has been completed or will be completed through the
base engineering drawings and activities and laid up for another day. We are encouraged by what we saw, we're clearly
impressed with what we learned and we feel that we have demonstrated to a certainty that carbon capture and storage is
in fact viable technology for the United States and quite honestly for the rest of the world going forward.
So with that, let me simply close by saying we, as I mentioned at the outset, reaffirm our view of our earnings strength
in 2011. And of course stand by our $3.25 forecast for 2012.
With that, I'll turn the microphone over to Brian.
Brian X. Tierney
Thank you, Mike. This morning I'll review quarterly and year-to-date reconciliations through the second quarter,
discuss load trends, review customer switching data and provide an update on the company's capitalization and
liquidity. Then we will get to your questions as quickly as possible.
On slide four, you will see that second quarter earnings for this year were $352 million or $0.73 per share, which was
$3 million less than last year's second quarter results of $355 million or $0.74 per share.
Here are some of the highlights for the quarter-on-quarter comparison. Operations and maintenance expense net of
offsets was unfavorable by $56 million or $0.08 per share. This number is largely explained by an increase in storms
expense of $52 million. Much of this variance is attributable to Appalachian Power, where in the second quarter of
2010 they were able to defer $25 million related to a 2009 storm. This year Appalachian Power had storm costs totaling
$17 million for the quarter.
Other costs net accounted for negative $0.04 per share, or $34 million and primarily consisted of a decrease of $10
million net of tax, from the sale of shares of the IntercontinentalExchange in 2010 and year-on-year increases in other
taxes.
Customer switching accounted for an unfavorable quarterly comparison of $24 million or $0.04 per share. We will
discuss this in more detail on slide seven. Rate changes accounted for positive $66 million or $0.09 per share and came
from multiple jurisdictions.
Off-system sales net of sharing were positive $37 million or $0.05 per share. This result was driven by a significant
increase in physical volumes and a widening of spark and dark spreads. Physical volumes were up 81% due to an 11%

reduction in planned and unplanned outages and the fact that more of our units were in the money since around the
clock prices were up 14% while natural gas prices were only up 1% and delivered prices for coal were only up 3%.
Weather accounted for a positive $0.01 per share or $5 million in improvement over last year and was favorable $47
million versus normal weather. Driving this result for the quarter was the fact that our Western service territories
experienced the hottest June in the last 30 years.
Turning to slide five you will see that for year-to-date and 2011, AEP earned $744 million or $1.55 per share. Which is
$24 million more than last year's $720 million or $1.50 per share. Highlights include operations and maintenance
expense, net of offsets which compared negatively to last year by $30 million or $0.04 per share similar to the quarterly
comparison, this difference was largely driven by an increase in storm costs of $36 million.
Other cost net decreased $0.05 per share or $35 million and similar to the quarterly comparison was primarily driven by
the absence of the $10 million net of tax gain on ICE shares and from higher other taxes. Customer switching was a
difference of $43 million or negative $0.06 per share and again we'll discuss this in more detail later.
On the positive side, rate changes were responsible for a year-to-date gain of $110 million or $0.15 per share versus
2010. Again, these rate increases were for multiple jurisdictions.
Off-system sales net of sharing accounted for a positive comparison to last year of $49 million or $0.07 per share
year-to-date. The story here is similar to the quarterly explanation, though it's not as dramatic. Physical volumes were
up 45% and spark and dark spreads widened with around-the-clock prices for electricity increasing 5%, while natural
gas prices were actually down 10% and delivered prices for coal increased 1.4%.
Finally, in contrast to the quarterly comparison, weather was a negative variance to last year for the year-to-date period.
Although unfavorable by $0.02 per share or $15 million to last year, this year is actually favorable $67 million when
compared to normal weather.
Turning to slide six. We will take a look at the normalized load trends as promised. It's important to remember that this
data has been adjusted to exclude the effect of weather and represents our total connected load. In the bottom right hand
side of the slide you will see the total normalized retail sales were up 1.9% for the quarter and are running at a positive
2.2% for the year-to-date. This improvement is primarily in the residential and industrial classes. Although the
residential class is up 4.4% for the quarter, it is up 0.9 of a percent year-to-date which we believe is more indicative of
growth in the class. Economic recovery for our commercial class of customer remains slow.
The improvement in the industrial class has been aided by the return to full production of one of our large aluminum
customers. Mike mentioned that with the exception of another aluminum customer who remains closed, our industrial
sales volumes now stand at 95% of their pre-recession levels. Slide 19 in the appendix provides more detail on our top
five industrial sectors.
Finally, all customer classes have benefited by the Valley Electric Membership Corporation acquisition and our
SWEPCO operating unit. As a reminder, as part of our guidance for 2011 we were expecting sales volumes to exceed
the prior year by 1.7%. Although the mix of customer sales continues to shift somewhat between the classes we remain
confident that our original guidance remains sound.
On slide seven we can examine AEP Ohio customer switching. For clarity let me describe the graph. The bars show us
the 2011 cumulative percentage of load lost as compared to AEP Ohio's total load. The line shows us how much
generation margin was lost associated with the customer switching, $46 million in total.
At the bottom of the page you can see how this activity is split between our two Ohio operating units for the
quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods. As we have previously discussed, the more significant activity is occurring in
Columbus and Southern Power. In aggregate, about 7% of 2011 total AEP Ohio load has switched through the end of
June. The level of switching to date is running ahead of the pace assumed in our guidance and we expect that to
continue for the remainder of 2011.

It is important to note that we are experiencing positive offsetting margins associated with the freed up energy and
capacity through off-system sales and capacity sales to competitive retail suppliers. Given the net effects of increased
switching and positive margin offsets, we remain confident with the 2011 earnings guidance.
Finally, on slide eight I would like to update you on our balance sheet and renewal of our recent credit facilities. You
will see that AEP's debt to total capitalization strands at 56.6%. This is the lowest level for this ratio in the last five
years and reflects a commitment by the company to maintain a strong balance sheet and solidly BBB credit ratings. Our
cost reduction initiatives from last year and our capital expenditure discipline reflect that commitment and are direct
reasons for the strength of our balance sheet.
Also on Wednesday, we issued an 8-K which contained important announcements about our two core credit facilities.
On July 26 we renewed and upsized the $1.45 billion facility that was due to expire in April of 2012 with a $1.75
billion facility that will expire in five years. In addition, we were able to extend the $1.5 billion facility that was due to
expire at the end of June of '13 by two years, now with an expiration in June of '15. We were also able to reprice that
facility to reflect current more favorable pricing. These assumptions improve the capacity of our credit facilities by
nearly $300 million to $3.25 billion and extend the tenor of these facilities considerably.
Also as Mike mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the decision of the Texas Supreme Court to reverse the PUCP's
decision to deny recovery related to the capacity auctions and to remand the issue back to the PUCP. As a result, TCC
will be entitled to recover $420 million plus carrying costs dating back to 2002. We expect the total to be about $900
million. This capital infusion will further strengthen the balance sheet of the company.
In summary, the company is in a strong credit and liquidity position as we enter the next several years where the
company will see increased demands for capital investment for environmental, maintenance and reliability needs.
As Mike mentioned, we are affirming our guidance for 2011 and 2012. As you know, our point estimate guidance for
2012 is $3.25 per share. This guidance assumes a reasonable outcome in Ohio, manageable impact to off-system sales
from the CSAPR Rules and continued growth in our transmission business. In the coming months if the Ohio and EPA
pictures become clearer we will be able to provide more specific guidance than the point estimate we affirm today.
We appreciate your time today. And I will turn the call now over to the operator for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] And first, we will go to the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Greg.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Good morning.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So when we look at – when looking at the numbers, clearly as you explicitly stated, the
switching numbers are tracking ahead of what you had told us your budget was for this year but you're also at 70% of
the targeted gross margin for the year in your off-system sales businesses and we're not even in the third quarter yet. So
is there some way maybe in the future you could give us what the net impacts to margins is by sort of carving out the
benefits that are accruing to the OS, off-system sales margins as you, as energy and capacity move from the retail
bucket to the wholesale bucket?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: We'll surely try to craft something like that, Greg, to give you guys at least some directional
view. The offsetting positive effects as you already mentioned showing where we are with off-system sales with just
two quarters moving into what as you know is usually the most productive quarter, we feel very, very comfortable
about where we are.

And as you know, inside of the ESP, there are some rate design issues as they pertain to the commercial rate class,
which is the high impact class at Columbus Southern we expect will get resolved. And so going forward, some of the
off-system benefits will continue to be there and some of the on-system switching might slow down a bit, but we'll try
to give you a better picture of that so you can get a feel for it. But rest assured, we feel extremely comfortable with
where we are, we're capturing about 25% of our own market share in that sense through AEP retail, having success in
the other areas both – all three really, FE, Dayton and Cincinnati. So switching in Ohio is interesting. I think we've
reacted to it in a constructive way and the impact on it, although more than we had expected has been very tolerable.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: And the CSAPR Rule, some of the other companies that reported yesterday indicated they
thought there was a chance that the implementation could be delayed by the courts. Are you presuming that happens or
are you presuming that doesn't happen? And when you look at the amount of credits you've been allocated, are they
sufficient to mitigate the potential increase in customer bills? Or do you have enough credits to mitigate having to
increase what you charge in the system agreement? So when you look at the balance of – so your long-short position,
how does that play out in terms of where those credits get allocated. And is that going to be a '12 impact or do you
think perhaps it will be delayed?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, I, like everybody else, will continue to push for a delay because there's just no way in
the world you can make a rule final in November of 2011 and expect people to comply with it on January of 2012. It's
as close to lunacy as you can get. But having said that, we will continue to plan to address those issues. We continue to
look at the options that are available to us.
Your question on the credits is interesting, we're long in some jurisdictions, short in other jurisdictions. Some of the
controlled trading will allow us to address much of it, but maybe not all of it and we're going about the process of
trying to satisfy that shortage as we go. But as you know in a regulated world, those kinds of activities are recoverable
from our customers and it's going to have some unfortunate dislocation. When you think about CSAPR and the
timelines, we'll all be able to manage our way through it. If we end up spending a certain amount of money in the
regulated footprint as you know that will turn into earnings as we go.
The really devastating effect though, will be in those communities were plants are prematurely closed, jobs are lost,
property tax bases are affected. And in many of those regions, Greg, as you know we're the only game in town. So
when the power plants go, so go the communities and that is truly the unfortunate impact. And no one on the coast
cares about and I understand that, whether it's East or West coast. But we care a great deal about that in our footprint,
we sure do.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: The final question on the $900 million in pre-tax cash you'll hopefully be getting sometime next
year. Is there – you know what the uses of that cash are going to look like at this point?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah. We do, Greg. We're going to obviously take some of that and re-securitize TCT by
retiring some debt. And just there are going to be some requirements that we're going to have in Texas to retire debt
and refinance that company. But there will be a component of that that should be a significant dividend up to the
parent. And of course, we'll use that for the other capital needs that we have and we've sort of laid some of those out for
you. The environmental needs that we have, building the transmission business and others.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you, guys. Good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Thanks a lot, Greg. And happy to see you back in the game.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Me too.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah. I bet.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: I can hear you well, Paul. How are you doing?
<Q - Paul Patterson>: All right.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: First on the tax rate for the quarter, I'm sorry if I missed this, but it did seem a little bit lower
than I think normal. Could you tell us what happened there and if there is any change or opportunity for lowering your
tax rate on a going forward basis?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: I'm trying to end up looking like Jeff Immelt, but I'll let Brian answer that question.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah. Thanks, Paul. Tax rate for the ongoing – the AEP Utility segment was about 33.27%
compared to the prior year and about 35.55% and it was lower as a result of lower pre-tax booked income and a larger
favorable flow through and permanent book to tax differences. We're always looking for opportunities to try and get
that down as low as we possibly can and we're engaged in a number of tax planning activities to try and get that as low
as possible. We're pleased that it's below what we had in guidance of a 35% range for the quarter and the year. But
we're always planning and trying to find ways to reduce that tax burden as much as we possibly can.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: You're not going to change the – we shouldn't change our outlook on the tax situation going
forward, right?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: I think it's always wise for you to assume a 35% rate and if we come in lower than that, that's
a benefit to our shareholders.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. With respect to customer switching, I guess, Greg asked this question, you guys are not
providing any – I mean, that's the gross margin that you guys had on that slide as opposed to the net margin. Could you
just give us a little bit of a flavor as to what you think the net margin would be roughly speaking?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: I'd rather give you some accurate data as best we can down the road, Paul. Again, I will tell
you that it's considerably smaller than the gross margin impact.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. The Ohio situation, we've seen the interveners file their testimony and it was all over the
map, I guess, different industrials at different positions and what have you and the OCC and what have you. Is there
any possibility that we're going to be getting a settlement. I know that others have suggested that, like Duke, and I'm
just wondering whether or not – what you see the – I mean, is this just going to be a fully litigated case and that's just
what we should expect?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, I would hope not. As I mentioned in my opening comments there, we continue to
have what we think to be constructive dialogues. As you know, and I mentioned this as well, people file testimony to
lay out what they think is their most preferred position, frequently knowing that they'll never get there, but nonetheless
they do, and each and every time, people do that, it does have an effect on settlement discussions, so. But I have every
reason to believe based on what we're hearing in the give-and-take discussions with folks that these cases lend
themselves to settlement and we'll continue to work diligently toward that end.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And then just finally on the staff, you mentioned that it's coming out today and with the old
ESP, it came out and it didn't really say much. It sounds like you guys are expecting them to give a more defined
position as to where they are actually – what the sort of full ESP format should sort of be like, is that what you guys are
sort of sensing?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Not necessarily. What I tried to say in my comments was just – if you see something there
that looks draconian, you can react to it as you'd like. But again, that won't be the end game and the dialogue with the
parties, staff included have been constructive. I think we're better than Congress at debt ceilings and cost reductions but
some of the conversations every now and again get a little worrisome. So we'll see what we'll see. I don't think it will
be a crystal clear path of, here is what we think the commission ought to do. It will lay out some of their positions on

various issues, some that may be more aggressive than we would like and others that may be more supportive than
others would have thought staff would have been. So, it's really hardly to forecast. I assure you, they're not sharing with
us any drafts of what it is they intend to file. We'll get it the same time you get it.

Operator : And next we'll go to Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Mike, I was wondering if you could just share your thoughts kind of on the – you added big
plan for the capital spending for environmental and kind of plans for retirement versus keeping. Could you share a little
color on, what was the regulatory response and the stakeholder response to investment and closure decisions by states
and whether you're going to see any changes or inducements maybe to change that plan?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: That's an interesting question, Dan, because the granularity that we provided have allowed
us to, be on the point and to catch any one of a number of arrows coming our way. But, I will tell you this, we have not
had a meeting with anyone in any of the states and/or in Washington, including the EPA where there wasn't serious,
thanks for telling us exactly what your picture looks like.
You can rest assured at the state level, the governors and the house and senate members as well as the local community
folks are eager to see us change the plans. I had an opportunity to speak to about 500 people at the Kentucky Chamber
where the speaker of the house of the state, the Commonwealth of Kentucky who serves our Big Sandy area stood up
and said whatever you do, don't shut Big Sandy down. Go about whatever it is you need to do, whether you're going to
retrofit it, which would be their preference and/or convert it to gas and they'll be with us as we go to the PSC in
Kentucky to adjust the rates accordingly.
I think what we're seeing in our Eastern footprint for the most part, are state leaders who are suggesting that they do not
want to be at the whim of the market, nor do they want to be a net energy importer because each of those seven
governors have already staked out that jobs and economic development are the plans for their success. So we see a
great deal of encouragement.
I must tell you I had meetings with the FERC, with the Department of Energy's Electricity Group, with the EPA, with
the various NERC players and the RTOs, the [ph] NAIRU (35:03) folks, everyone is saying thanks for the granularity
and the honesty of your data. And we can see what you mean by there may be pockets of reliability impacts and
someone really needs to aggregate all that data, so that you can see that going forward. And as you know the Energy
Commerce Committee in the House of Representatives has suggested in the TRAIN Act that that's exactly what the
government does.
So this is far from over with, it really is, and again, we are not in any way, shape or form, and although I know many
NGOs don't agree with us in this regard, we're not trying to change the environment nor effect the environment in a
negative way. We're trying to balance the environmental benefit that will come from retrofitting and changing the
generation fleet here in the United States with the economy of the United States, which we think is every bit as
important.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And I guess to another question. If you look at the usage patterns in the quarter, it looked like
residential had a pretty nice pop relative to what trend had been coming out of the recession. Was there something
unique to the quarter, was there some weather adjustment data that makes it a little squirrely or are you actually seeing

a real change in usage out of that customer class?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: You heard us say this in the first quarter, one of the few things that is in a constructive
sense. Their heating bills went down a lot because natural gas prices continued to dampen compared to what they saw a
year ago. And the cost of transportation went down some, so I think that they probably were turning on some of the
lights that they had turned off in the first quarter.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah, you bet.

The next question is from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Good morning, how are you?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good. Good. Thanks.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: How should we think about the tax rate on the securitization proceeds?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We are going to be setting up a tax deferral associated with that. So we're going to take at the
time that we recognize the transaction, we're going to take the $420 million plus the applicable interest and the debt
only portion and we'll record that as a regulatory asset with a related deferred tax expense of about 35%.
And then of course, as the reg assets amortize, the deferred taxes will be amortized to match the current income tax
expense and the equity portion that we'll be realizing will be recognized as the amortization happens as well. And we
anticipate over the 14 year securitization period that equity carrying cost of between $20 million and $185 million to be
recognized in current period earnings.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Paul, I can't tell you how happy Brian is you asked that question.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: My head's still spinning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: As is mine.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: The $0.04 to customer shopping in the quarter, is that net of what you might have picked
up or where does your retail margin as you and go and competitively shop your power, where does that show up and
where does the margin on that show up?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, that is not a net number. That's the actual impact of those who have chosen other
suppliers. As you might imagine, the retail margin on sales from AEP retail are less than the margin you'd see had those
customers stayed on the system. Brian, where exactly -
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: In terms of the EEI line on pages 11 and 13 it's line 18, generation of marketing.

<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Good morning. Just some more questions on customer switching. What customer class I
guess, had the most switching, and my assumption is commercial and I guess, where would the loss of gross margin go
if you saw all your Columbus Southern commercial customers switch?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, so that is right. It is the commercial class of customers and primarily at Columbus and
Southern Power Company and the place where you would see that margin occurring is in the Ohio companies, line 2,
on pages 11 and 13.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: And I think it's almost inconceivable to imagine that the entirety of the commercial load at
Columbus Southern would move away from us. And as I mentioned before, as you know inside of the ESP a lot of that
activity has to do with the arcane concept known as rate skewing. Our commercial customers typically pay more than
the cost to serve them and in the filings that we made inside the ESP, one of the things that actually is getting some
pretty solid support is adjusting that rate skewing to better balance customer bills to customer costs. So there are some
self correcting activities that will go forward in that sense.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: What percentage of commercial customers have switched already?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: I don't have the percent of total commercial customers that have switched. We can get that
for you.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Okay. Great. I'll follow up offline with it.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: That's fine. Thanks, Anthony.

And we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. A few questions. First of all off-systems sale, second quarter the levels, the new
normals when we start thinking about the same quarter for next year or is it something slightly different?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: It's hard to say at this point, Michael, because of the impact of what CSAPR might have on
that. I would obviously expect that people might have less volume to go in the shoulder periods and we'll be trying to
optimize what they have available to go in the winter and summer months as load and pricing is higher. So it's really
hard for us to tell what the new normal is going to be when we have the situation changing as much as it's going to
under the CSAPR regime.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Second, O&M I know up for the quarter given the storm cost. What are you
assuming in '11 guidance and in '12 guidance meaning back – second half of '11 and in your $3.25 for '12 in terms of
O&M growth?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Second half of '11 we anticipate being very similar to the first half being, darn close to flat,
consistent with what our guidance is and I'd anticipate that although we haven't come out with '12, we're going to be
very conservative on O&M growth there as well. Really the bulk of what we're trying to show in any growth at all in
O&M is trying to have as much of that as possible picked up in trackers and as little of that as possible flowing through
as a net against revenue hitting the bottom line.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah, I think that's an important point, Michael that Brian makes. I think it doesn't – it
surely isn't missed by you or your colleagues. The fact of the matter is some of the increase in O&M has to do with the
magnitude of the storms that we've experienced so far this year. They don't hit that threshold that you go in for recovery
in the normal course of business in the various jurisdictions. And the other part of it is simply O&M authorities that
have been granted to us by various commissions where you're recovering dollar for dollar for the increase in O&M. As
you know we've been very aggressive to try to build more trackers and riders in our cases.

So take Indiana as a perfect example, or I guess PSO may be a better example. They gave us a certain amount of money
to underground activity. So that the Tulsa region didn't see the same amount of interruptions on the system. And every
single dollar that they authorized to be spent was spent for that goal. As you would expect us to do. So net, net the
O&M discipline at American Electric Power continues to be strong. The head count numbers continue to be right
where we thought that they would be. So we keep a very, very close eye on that as we go forward. So when you see
those increases, I want to make sure, and your question has given us the opportunity to put some granularity to what's
driving them.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Last question. Just in terms of rate filings, rate cases underway. I mean, I think
we're up-to-date on the ones that are underway now. But in terms of what you expect to file in the back end of 2011 for
future rate increases either in 2012 or beyond?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: So when we look at – there probably aren't any more that we would file yet this year. In an
impact of this year, but are there will be a few and we'll give you some granularity on that. There will be some active
cases as you might have imagined. As you know the Virginia case will mature in '12, the Michigan case will mature in
'12, although it has the potential to settle in '11. So we'll see how it goes, we've got cases probably in Indiana as well
and other jurisdictions. But net, net we'll let you know what else we're looking at in the back of the year.

And we'll go to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Quick question. As we look at your baseline historical emissions of the fleet in say 2010, is
that a reasonable proxy for where you are or were you operating your existing controls as much as you could? Could
we get someone else on fuel switching? Just something – should we think of that as a static starting point or not?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: That would probably be inappropriate. We will begin to operate the fleet a bit differently.
We're looking at some fuel selection differences. As you know we're, although not by a tremendous amount because
we're getting more gassy but – at American Electric Power because of the size of our coal fleet adding the gas facilities
that we have will have some impact. We have moved Dresden up in much more aggressive construction cycle. It will
come to play in 2012. So it's probably inappropriate to use that as your base because the mix will change, the fuels will
change. And the footprint will go down some.
Having said that, and I know that there's been some concern about how scrubbers are operating across the U.S. fleet.
We're really operating at peak performance 98%, 99% capture. So we're quite satisfied, we're looking at remedial
action and changes to some of those scrubbers as we go and that's all working out quite well as well.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: In terms times of how the scrubbers are performing, 2010 you'd consider to be a good base?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Oh, we do indeed.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: And then, I know you said you're studying the CSAPR Rule and the impacts. Is there any
expectation that you will update your compliance plan sometime later this year as you work more on studying or are we
– what sort of timeframe we can think about a change?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: No, I think what we did earlier on is pretty accurate. The only difference that we may see is
that we are taking a real hard look at the dry sorbent approach to it rather than the major capital investments that felt we
might have to put on, but I think that as you know what we get on HAPs MACT is going to have probably a much

And our next questions are from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Ali.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Mike, as you mentioned there is a lot of activity going on in Ohio, could you also give us a quick
update and remind us where you stand on the remand proceedings that are going on there and also the distribution rate
case?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: They are all moving along apace. The discussions that we're having on the ESP of course
include the magnitude of all of the filings. So the merger docket, the remand case, as well as the overall distribution
rate case. So they are all there, they all have schedules established for the most part. And the commission staff and the
commission, as well as the parties are working through all of them as quickly as we can.
I don't know – I don't want to leave you with the impression that there is some overall global settlement concept that
may wrap them all up. If that were doable, we will happy to do it. But there are uniquenesses to each of the cases and
some of the interveners would rather see some of them process to their conclusion, while others of them may yield a
better opportunity to settle.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay, but on the remand, as far as I recall, Mike, there were hearings held and then was there a date
set for a decision or was that still an open item?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Still an open item.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And separate question, as I recall, when you had laid out your plan, your big environmental
plan. Had you assumed that there could some delays in these proposals coming down the pipe from the EPA or was that
based on what the existing proposals were laying out and just remind us of that?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah, it was based exactly as the proposals were and to the only update again, as I
mentioned, we're looking at different technologies in response to the opportunity to address CSAPR. So we've not built
any delay in there. What we tried to do was show a straightforward verifiable view of the effect of the draft rules as
they stood at the time and the rules that we think will come out over time and the effect that they'd have on our fleet.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And last question, Mike. In the past you folks have – in the recent past, I should say there have
been rumblings, musings from AEP, you're looking at your entire portfolio. There may be opportunities to monetize
some of the assets if it makes more sense. Could you just give us an update on your current thinking there and could we
expect something before the year is up?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: No, I would think not, as we always do, we look at the assets and the opportunities that are
in front of us. A couple of the jurisdictions continued to lag from what we would like to see them do, but they are
catching up in a hurry and we're encouraged by that. We are equally encouraged by the activities that we see from the
FERC on their Transmission Final Rule 1000. I don't want to take too much time on this call, but I must say that Susan
Tomasky who has headed that Transmission Group for us for the last handful of years was instrumental in pulling
together the comments that American Electric Power made to the FERC and a number of those comments were very
much evident in the final rule as it was brought forth.

So we're encouraged by what we see in transmission, the opportunity to do that. Lisa Barton who has managed many of
our negotiations with our joint venture partners in transmission will take Susan's role. We'll miss Susan a great deal, but
the whole notion of having her responsible for transmission during that period of time worked out exactly as we had
hoped that it would. So we see a lot of investment opportunities with the assets that we have but we'll always look at
monetizing anything if it seems better in the hands of another player.

Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Hi. Good morning, Mike. A couple questions. First, I believe most of your states have fuel
clauses that recover emission allowances, so if CSAPR brings these back, are you able to pass through emission
allowances in your fuel clauses?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Every one of the states. Yes, that's correct.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then secondly, in Ohio, I guess one potential outcome given that it's kind of –
it seems like it's almost happened with Duke is that they just don't get a plan done by the end of this year. What
happens then and if you just kind of kept your current plan and had your fuel clause and et cetera is that really – how
big a problem is that or not?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: I don't think that would be a big issue at all. If that's way it ends up. I appreciate the point
you make about Duke because they've kind of gone from one footprint, one approach to another and then kind of
morphed in with a hybrid of the two and that may be a bit troubling but we have every reason to believe that we'll come
to some resolution before the end of the year. I think you know, if – I think everyone knows, that the executive
administration in the State of Ohio is in different hands, very aggressive hands, Governor Kasich is a let's get it done
kind of person. I expect we'll see an order before the end of the year. One way, shape or form. If that doesn't happen
we'll just continue on with where we are and that's not a bad news story for us at all.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Justin McCann>: If after the 2012 election, the political scenario plays out in which a climate bill was passed in
say 2013 or 2014, and you were able to get regulatory approval for CCS cost recovery, how long would it take to pick
up from where you left off and complete the remaining three phases needed to realize commercial operation?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Quite honestly not that long of a period of time, because again, as I mentioned, we're taking
it to the original engineering design. Now that would have to be brought up to date, Alstom, and around the world there
are still a couple of projects going forward. As you know, Southern Company is working on some of the amine
technology down in Mississippi I believe. So we all continue to look at that as a constructive undertaking.

But you've asked a very important question, having spent a great deal of time in the international dialogue on these
issues through a number of facilities that American Electric Power is involved with, it would appear to me that a carbon
intensity plan is about as far as you're going to see China or India go and so if we had legislation that really was driven
toward carbon intensity in the United States going forward that may cause some of the carbon capture and storage
projects go forward. We always thought we could get the final design in about a year or less, bid and construct in a year
or more, so it would stay on those kinds of timelines. What we thought originally was a 2014, 2015 date. If you had a
piece of legislation by 2013 you may be looking more at a 2017 or 2018 timeline.
<Q - Justin McCann>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: You bet.

And next we'll go to Ashar Khan with Visium Capital Management Please go ahead.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Ashar.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Just wanted to get a – I guess you mentioned, what would be the use of proceeds? You said it
would be all for debt reduction is that what I heard?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: No. There will be some debt reduction at TCC, and perhaps some rebalancing of the capital
structure of that company but there will be a considerable dividend up to the parent.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: And so what will the parent do with the dividend then?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We have some significant capital needs that we are going to be embarking on. As we've
talked about our capital plan and what we need to do in terms of environmental retrofits and the like and we have some
pretty significant needs for that capital in our transmission business as well in addition to our underlying utility
businesses. So we have plenty of uses to put that capital to work and have it earning for the shareholders of the
company.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: And I think if there is anyone who had concern over one-time equity issuances at the
parent, I think that these kinds of activities surely lay those over.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: I understand. But you have not baked that into your point estimate, am I correct? I guess, the
benefit of lower interest expense that's the way I look at it. That's not really baked in into the $3.25 is that a fair
conclusion or no?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, this was not incorporated in our point estimate when we came out with it. We've since
incorporated that in there and are there have been number of in's and out's and so I wouldn't just assume that there is
some significant upside associated with the capital infusion.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. So you're saying there's some – the positive has been – from this has been there have been
some negative, so it's been like matched even and the $3.25 does incorporate this outlook now?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It does.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. Thank you so much.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: You bet.
<A - Charles E. Zebula>: John, we have time for one more question.

And that will be Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Hi. You mentioned DSI. Southern Company, obviously another big coal burner, has their
doubts about whether DSI is really kind of the silver bullet that a lot of people claim it is. What are your concerns
around DSI?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, I don't want to misrepresent because the EPA laid that out as the ultimate silver bullet
that would make life go on without anyone ever having to pass away. It isn't quite that good. What we're saying is that
when we look at particularly some of our Western plants, we may be able to use that technology there with a
combination of some fuel blending in our Western stations. And that that will have an effect of one, maybe being able
to do it more rapidly than we thought because they aren't as massive a construction project. And two, not as expensive
because they aren't as massive a construction project.
But we, like Southern Company, actually see these things very much the same. We kind of lay on top of each other
with understanding the impact and we don't think that it's a silver bullet, but we do think it's a technology that may lend
itself to use there. And our engineers are pretty far along the line with those conclusions. And in fairness, as you might
expect, we and Southern Company do dialogue on these issues frequently. So, we will share with them what we think
we see but of course as you know, they don't have the same lignite based fleet that we do out West.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: I would tend to trust your and Southern's combustion engineers more than the EPA.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: As would I. As would I.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Going back -
<A - Michael G. Morris>: They probably pay more than we do, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Going back to Ali Agha's question about M&A, could we expect to see you get smaller
before you got bigger?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: No, I don't think so.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: You bet.
