MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 NYSE Euronext Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Carris and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be
facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. For the Q&A session, we ask that callers
limit their questions to one to allow for broader participation.
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor relations at NYSE Euronext. Please go
ahead, sir.
Stephen C. Davidson
Thanks, Carris. Good morning and welcome to the NYSE Euronext third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Before

superior to GAAP measures.
Duncan Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter, update you on key business
developments on our businesses and conclude with his outlook on various regulatory and macro issues. Michael
Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer, will then review the financial results for the quarter. We will then open the line for
your questions. Also in the room for the Q&A session is Larry Leibowitz, Chief Operating Officer.
We are incorporating slides for the call today, which are available for viewing on our website and Duncan and Mike
will refer to the slides during their remarks.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Duncan.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining today's call on such an important day in the U.S. here,
Election Day. Do try to get out and vote. Our town doesn't have any power, so I guess we're going to be doing it old
school today, but we're going to make sure we do that tonight.
Before I get into the results, I do want to take a few minutes to talk about the Hurricane Sandy. It was a pretty
challenging week for our community here at NYSE Euronext and many of the communities in and around the East
Coast. However, I couldn't be more proud of our teams that worked here non-stop over really the last week or 10 days.
As usual, we led the industry from the front in helping to build a consensus to close the markets last Monday and
Tuesday, which I firmly believe was the right thing to do.
Then with Wednesday's historic reopening, I can attribute that to the result of truly heroic efforts on the part of many of
our key people. Not only did we reopen the market smoothly, when the entire surrounding area was still in darkness,
but we had three IPOs come to market last Friday, which is a testament to the resiliency of the U.S. markets.
But now, let me focus on the third quarter. During the quarter, we made significant progress with new product
development and our key initiatives that will drive future growth and we'll highlight those throughout the presentation
that Mike and I will do. We're focusing on those levers of our business model that are in our control and that we can
influence to deliver value for our shareholders over the long term, well beyond the current lackluster trading
environment.
As you know, we've made a lot of headway over the last few years in diversifying our business model. A large portion
of our – although we've made a lot of headway, a large portion of our revenues remain linked to trading, and our
derivatives franchise in Europe has been especially impacted by macro conditions in deleveraging, driving lower levels
of hedging and speculation.
But contrary to what many are saying today, this is not a structural shift in the market, in my opinion, and we see the
current climate as an opportunity to focus the company for growth when macro conditions return to normal. At the
same time, we need to remain focused on further diversification into our technology, data and post-trade businesses.
In some respects, I feel that NYSE Euronext the way I feel about the U.S. economy, well-positioned to grow under the
right conditions. But for the moment, we are still facing strong macroeconomic headwinds and our results for the third
quarter reflect this. We reported $0.44 for the quarter on $559 million in revenue compared to $0.71 on $704 million in
revenue in the prior year third quarter.
Please turn to slide four. On slide four, I thought we'd share some year-on-year comparisons of the past few third
quarters. The third quarter of 2011 was characterized by event-driven volatility in the U.S. and Europe, which drove
strong trading volumes across all of our venues setting new records for orders and executions. Fast forward to the third
quarter of 2012 and we were at multiyear lows in terms of volatility.
In conjunction with this decline in volatility, off-exchange trading has increased more than 4% as dealers internalize
more client flow in these lower volatility markets. We continue to be frustrated with this trend and are troubled that the

U.S. equity markets have gotten more opaque while the value of the public markets continues to be diminished.
Moving to the upper right quadrant, we illustrate the decreased need to managed risk on the short end of the curve with
rates at or near zero and no indication from central banks that rates will be going up before 2014. Open interest is down
in the front four quarterly packs compared to 18 months ago, but as you move out on the curve, we see more favorable
trends in open interest.
Lastly on the lower right quadrant, while our principal trading venues have faced challenging operating conditions, our
market share across U.S. equity options, European cash, and U.S. cash has actually remained fairly stable and, in the
case of European cash, has even increased. U.S. equities market share is also relatively strong given the aforementioned
increase in off-exchange trading.
So, in summary, market share on our primary venues has remained stable or improved, but this has been overshadowed
by deleveraging in a more typically seasonally slow summer quarter.
Please turn to slide five for me. At the same time, there is plenty within our control, and slide 5 illustrates the progress
that we are making in executing against our strategy. First of all, we need to find areas for growth and diversification.
We have several new product developments and growth initiatives underway that should improve the company's
position in the near future. We are working to launch a full service CCP by June of 2013, more on that in another slide
or two.
Our listings franchise continues to build momentum, especially in terms of technology market share. We are in the
process of revamping our global data agreements, which we expect will result in additional revenue beginning in 2013.
The Bank of China agreement that we recently signed is not just another MOU, but a wide ranging partnership that
will, among other things, make Bank of China, a general clearing member of NYSE Liffe.
We are continuing to launch new products and expand participation on NYSE Liffe U.S. with the on-boarding of two
new clearing members. And lastly, we are continuing to roll out new futures products like the Russell Europe SMID
300 Index, the new mini MSCI contracts and three-year mid-curve options on Sterling and Euribor, which we launched
in July.
Secondly, we need to enhance our operating leverage. We continue to show cost discipline as illustrated by our results,
which Michael will outline in more detail later. Additionally, having unwound NYSE Blue previously, we have now
agreed with our partner, Caisse des Dépôts in France to unwind our 60/40 joint venture, BlueNext. We are also moving
ahead with our shoring initiative, which will lead to opportunities to rationalize our global real estate footprint.
Thirdly, we remain committed to deploying capital in a shareholder-friendly way. In addition to the 2012 dividend and
buybacks that Mike will touch on, we are continuing to look at opportunities to shed stakes in businesses that do not
support our strategic objectives. We will be looking to divest all or at least a portion of our stakes in LCH.Clearnet and
MCX at the appropriate time.
Please turn to slide six for me. On slide six, we go a little deeper into our derivatives business. On the top half of the
slide we show the development of the MSCI Index futures on Bclear. Year-to-date average daily volume is around
7,000 contracts a day which is 82% above last year and open interest is over 200,000 contracts and up 91% versus the
prior year.
On the bottom half of the slide, we highlight selected trends in our fixed income businesses we are beginning to see
some semblance of improvement while the market remains challenging. STIR futures open interest is showing good
growth of 35% since the lows of December of 2011. The long-term growth trend in long gilt futures volume continues
with ADV up 6% year-over-year and trading in short gilt futures is also picking up with ADV in the third quarter of
29% sequentially.
Turning to our Swapnote product, the new market maker program is fueling growth of strong volumes in Q3. ADV is
up 30% quarter-over-quarter and is up 26% year-over-year with open interest up 9% versus the third quarter of 2011.
We also launched three-year mid-curve options on Euribor and sterling in July as I mentioned a minute ago. The
Euribor three-year mid-curve option is one of the fastest growing new products for NYSE Liffe on record. In the first

few months of trading, open interest is approaching 385,000 contracts and ADV of 23,000 contracts.
Lastly, I thought I'd give you an update on NYSE Liffe here in the U.S. We're launching new products and expanding
the number of clearing members on NYPC. Our mini MSCI futures continue to be a strong growth story since NYSE
Liffe U.S. was granted the exclusive license.
Volume and open interest in the products have more than doubled since last June and new end users are participating in
our emerging need for products as a result of the increased liquidity. Due to customer demand, we launched new
features on the MSCI World Index, MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America Index and the MSCI Canada Index, all in
Q3.
In July, we launched futures on the DTCC GCF Repo Index, which continues to gain momentum with a diverse range
of new market participants. ADV since launch is just over 3,000 contracts a day and more recently has grown to over
5,000 contracts a day and open interest is rapidly approaching 50,000 contracts.
Finally, as I alluded to earlier, JPMorgan and BNP went live as NYPC clearing members during the third quarter of
2012. As members of NYPC, they will be able to realize savings to the innovative single type cross margining model
that is unique to NYPC and its members.
Please turn to slide seven. On slide seven, we provide you with an update on our NYSE clearing initiative. We filed the
application for our new London clearing house with the FSA and are well into the build phase for a fully in-sourced
clearing house with a targeted completion date of June of next year. This will generate cost savings from June and
revenue synergies from early 2014.
With EMIR's new regulatory guidelines in place, all CCPs within the EU are put in a challenging position in terms of
financial resources and operational requirements. In addition to anticipating a consolidation of existing CCPs, the key
differentiator for NYSE clearing is that our full service CCP will be "new to market." We are building our clearing
house from the bottom up so, from the start, it will reflect the new EMIR guidelines.
With all CCPs working to change their current systems to the revised principles, we certainly believe that building our
CCP with all the initial requirements from the very beginning gives us certain advantages and flexibility over the
competition. In the future, our newly built platform should allow us to innovate faster on new products as well.
In the second quarter, we selected and established third-party risk and collateral system provider. This third party has
consistently been recognized as a leader in derivative software development, risk management, and processing for both
CCPs as well as investment banks and users. We are now working on system integration with them. We also completed
the delivery schedule of key IT releases. This sets a timeline which our clearing and technology teams are working
diligently to meet.
Lastly, before year end, we will be engaging with all the clearing members of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We have already
circulated a detailed service description of our CCP and the proposed business model. Once we've completed the
insourcing, we can then extend our clearing offering, which will include migrating our continental derivatives markets
in early 2014 and launching OTC clearing services in late 2013. Expanding the clearing offering will generate
incremental clearing fees for us; but will also provide significant offsets in capital savings for our customers as well.
The single pan-European clearing platform will be able to deliver considerable operational benefits for all of our
clients.
Please turn to slide eight. We're going to shift here to the IPO market, and on this slide, you'll see that the IPO market
continues to be strong with NYSE Euronext leading the way in capital rising. The listings franchise has continued to
strengthen with a great showing in the number of IPOs and a pipeline which continuously builds momentum. We are
proud of how our brand has been able to extend its footprint both in the U.S. and into the global community.
I'd like to share with you some of the noteworthy accomplishments that we've had recently. We're number one in global
IPOs and follow-on proceeds with over 30% more IPO proceeds and nearly four times more follow-on proceeds than
our nearest competitor. In the third quarter, we priced 19 IPOs, raising almost $10 billion collectively, while our U.S.
competitor priced 17 IPOs with a little less than $2 billion collectively. Year-to-date through October, we have

captured 55% of the U.S. technology IPO market share and welcomed two new technology IPOs in the third quarter of
2012 and four new tech IPOs in the month of October.
The IPO market had slowed after the Facebook debut, but it has picked up again quite nicely. October was the most
active month for IPOs in the U.S. so far this year and we won more than two-thirds of the deals. These included some
of the biggest and most successful IPOs of the year Workday and Realogy. We are also the leading exchange for
international offerings year-to-date with $6.3 billion in proceeds raised. Some of the largest international players are
choosing our market in addition to their own local markets including Santander Mexico and Banco BTG Pactual.
Please turn to slide nine. On this slide, we have an update on our technology services business. Over the last few years,
we have assembled a superior portfolio of assets and the long-term strategic plan has been to evolve the commercial
technology business from a product and service provider to a client-focused solutions provider. Unfortunately during
this transition, we hit a period of compression in financial technology spending as client's cost containment initiatives
were prioritized over technology innovation and footprint expansion.
Our commercial technology business has been making slow incremental progress, but underperforming relative to our
expectations. However, we do have enough visibility into the business that we expect to return to top and bottom line
growth in 2013. These plans notwithstanding, however, the challenges this year have taken us off track for the $1
billion revenue target, which we previously announced as being a 2015 goal.
Given the softness in revenue generation, we have been focused on managing our costs effectively. The silver lining of
declines are in a transitional state, which will eventually result in moving their model to an outsourced solution. We
expect to create a much greater opportunity that we are well positioned to capture.
With the new leadership of Jon Robson, I am confident that we have the right person in the seat and one who shares our
vision for the future of the business. In the meantime, Jon and the team are working on a detailed plan to return us to
growth and Jon will be joining us on the earnings call in February to provide you with his insights as to the future of the
business.
In the third quarter, we signed a landmark deal with Russell Investments to fully managed Russell's RussellTick
platform content and distribution. More recently, we have begun revising global data agreements, which we anticipate
will result in more data products and higher market data revenue. And lastly, we announced yesterday that we have
formed a new company with the Americas Trading Group in Brazil to develop a new liquidity center targeting the
Brazilian market. NYSE Technologies will provide the technology for the company on commercial terms and we will
have an equity share in the venture but contrary reports overnight, we will not be contributing capital.
Lastly on slide 10 before I turn it over to Mike, I wanted to update you on a few regulatory and macro issues that are
affecting our industry and many of our issuers. As always we are leading our industry from the front on these issues. I
won't address everything on this slide but let me touch on a few important highlights.
First in Europe, with regard to MiFID and MiFIR, while there are many more milestones ahead in the process, we are
pleased with where things currently stand in the European Parliament. Of particular note, Articles 28 and 29 have been
restricted to the cash markets only, which makes sense given where the cash markets are in terms of maturation. In
terms of the financial transaction tax, the proposed EUI tax was rejected in June. However, 11 member states have
since expressed an agreement to work together on a potential FTT.
Scope, territorial region, and technical characteristics of that proposal are not yet known, but we are continuing to make
our voice heard on the issue. In France, an FTT was implemented on August 1 and while we've seen some reduction in
volumes, it has been manageable, but we continue to monitor it.
Turning to the right side of the slide in the U.S., as you know, U.S. market structure has become a widely debated topic
in recent months. In my view, this is an appropriate conversation to have as investor confidence remains at record low
levels. This is in part due to macro uncertainty, which has caused a lot of investors to move to the sidelines, but it's also
at least partially driven by a lack of confidence in the underlying market structure.

Markets appear too complex and fragmented to individual investors and there has been a dramatic rise in off-exchange
trading, which we believe harms the price discovery process. We believe the right thing to do is to engage in a holistic
review of market structure with all participants to more closely examine some of the unintended consequences of the
framework under which we operate.
At the same time, we remain committed to demonstrating leadership in the industry. One example of this was the
industry's response to Knight Capital this past summer which we helped spearhead. Wherein a letter to the SEC dated
September 28, we outlined the collaboratively designed concept of a kill switch that would allow an exchange to
suspend or drop order flow from a member firm or trading partner whose trades exceeded a preset risk limit. The
second more recent and obvious example of our industry leadership that we demonstrated was in response to Hurricane
Sandy.
Finally, we're continuing to use our platform to advocate on important issues like the fiscal health of the United States
and job creation, the latter of which we think is really about access to capital for small and medium-sized companies.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of the quarter's financial results. Mike?
Michael S. Geltzeiler
Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 11 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter of 2012. Our
GAAP EPS of $0.44 per share was the same as our non-GAAP for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported an $18
million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, mostly related to P14 efficiency initiatives. This was mitigated by
some discrete tax benefits related to the reduction in the UK tax rates from 25% to 23%. A review of our financial
results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and discrete tax items.
Slide 12 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. Our financial results were impacted by
the dramatic decline in trading volumes compared to the third quarter of 2011, which benefited from the spike in
volatility as Duncan discussed earlier.
Net revenues on a reported basis were down 21% year-over-year and were 14% lower year-to-date. Transaction or
volume based revenues declined 35% year-over-year, which were somewhat offset by the late Q2 acquisition of
Corpedia and slightly higher listing revenues.
Costs were lower by $28 million or 7% for the quarter, and are 5% lower year-to-date on a constant dollar, constant
portfolio basis. For the third quarter, 38% of our other operating expenses were denominated in either euros or pounds,
61% in U.S. dollars and another 1% in other currencies.
Based on the current projections for profits and changes to UK tax rates, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be
24% for the full year 2012. The 21% effective tax rate in the quarter was the result of a tax rate true-up to adjust the
year-to-date tax rate to 24% from 25%, adding $0.02 in EPS to our Q3 results. Diluted share count was reduced by 16
million shares to 247 million this quarter.
Slide 13 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this
quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound by 12% and 2% respectively.
In the third quarter, 43% of our net revenues were denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact on net
revenue for the quarter was a negative $20 million versus prior year and unfavorable by $4 million versus the previous
quarter. Foreign exchange contributed an unfavorable $10 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year.
On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were down 18% and operating income decreased 37% versus the
third quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings businesses decreased
26% and 17% respectively, while commercial technology revenues were down 6%.
Slides 14 and 15 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivates revenue in the third quarter of
$164 million was lower by 27% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially, mostly attributable to lower trading

volumes. Expenses on a reported basis were essentially flat, but were actually lower when you adjust for the investment
we are making in our UK clearing initiative.
Derivatives accounted for 29% of our consolidated net revenues and 35% of our operating income. Revenue capture for
NYSE Liffe was lower both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decline year-over-year was primarily due to
modified pricing in the fourth quarter of 2011 for the trading of individual equity options and index futures in
Amsterdam and Belgium.
The decrease compared to Q2 was principally due to declines in single stock futures, Bclear revenue, which is
seasonally stronger in the second quarter due to the dividend arbitrage rates. These revenues are included in the revenue
capture calculation, but the Bclear volumes are not.
Capture for the U.S. options business was also lower. Decline in capture was principally due to the penny pilot pricing
changes on arc of this quarter. The decline quarter-over-quarter was principally due to the penny pilot pricing changes
and a mix shift weighted by higher market maker participation on Amex which has cap fees. We have eliminated caps
on dividend trades beginning November 1.
Similarly, slides 16 and 17 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash trading
and Listings accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the third quarter.
Cash Trading and Listings net revenues were $282 million, down 20% versus the prior year period and down 6%
compared to the second quarter of 2012.
European cash market share across our four primary markets, which excludes off-exchange trading volume increased to
68% in the third quarter, up from 66% in the prior year and the second quarter of 2012. In U.S. cash equities, our
market share across all tapes increased slightly sequentially but is down 200 basis points year-over-year.
Non-exchange traded share or TRF share remains elevated at 32% of the U.S. equities market, up from 28% in the prior
year. In response to the growth in off-exchange trading, we have launched the retail liquidity provider program in Q3,
which currently trades about 6 million shares a day and has shown promise.
Revenue capture for U.S. cash decreased to $0.04 per hundred shares traded handled for Q3, favorable to the $0.038
recorded in the third quarter of 2011 but below the $0.043 in Q3 2011. The increase year-over-year was driven by a
favorable mix in selected pricing changes. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due to client mix with certain large
clients hitting volume tiers with favorable pricing. Strong second quarter also benefited from the Russell rebalancing in
June. We are implementing several initiatives, which should increase the capture for Q4.
Revenue capture for European cash on a per transaction basis decreased to $0.54 from $0.64 in the third quarter of
2011, but increased from $0.52 in the third quarter of 2012. Decline year-over-year was primarily driven by foreign
exchange and declines in average daily value traded and average trade sizes, which has resulted in an increase in the
number of transactions per day, artificially depressing our revenue capture on a per transaction basis. The increase
compared to the second quarter of 2012 was driven by favorable mix over the platform.
Slide 18 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. This
segment accounted for 20% of our net revenues and 12% of our operating income in the third quarter of 2012. Segment
revenue was $113 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $12 million from Q3 prior year. At constant exchange
rates, revenues were down $7 million or 6% on prior year. Prior year third quarter did benefit from $5 million in
one-time platform sales to Warsaw and Tokyo Stock exchanges.
As expected, technology expenses were below second quarter and prior year levels as a result of proactive efforts to
manage costs given the macro headwinds. The top line growth in this segment, as Duncan discussed earlier, has been
below our expectations due to the constricted technology spending environment. While we do not expect real growth
this year, we do expect Q4 revenue and operating margins will be nicely above Q3 levels and look optimistically
towards 2013.
Slide 19 illustrates the progress we've made toward the Project 14 efficiency stream. Costs are below $400 million for
the first time in years. Current period expenses of $388 million are down 7% year-over-year and down $8 million

quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, we have saved $82 million of our Project 14 efficiency goal, representing 33% of
the $250 million in annualized savings.
We continue to be disciplined and diligent with cost by reviewing our portfolio, streamlining our business model, and
simplifying our technology architecture. Looking forward, we've received regulatory approval to consolidate and
redefine our market operations, functions and themes. The new approach is aimed to utilize our expertise in
multimarket operations and trading, product oversight as a competitive advantage in our business model.
We have plans to integrate corporate board member and Corpedia into a unified corporate services offering. We're
unwinding BlueNext and evaluating other non-performing products in the portfolio. In the IT area, we continue to
explore shoring opportunities, system architecture harmonization and ways to more efficiently utilize our datacenter
capacity. And lastly, we are also exploring a series of initiatives to rationalize our global real estate footprint.
Slide 20, provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and updates our 2012 cost guidance. Due to the reported
expenses of $388 million, which at the P14 currency rates resulted in a rebased cost of $393 million in Q3 and $1.2
billion year-to-date.
We spent a total of $11 million in growth initiatives during the quarter and $31 million year-to-date. This translates into
third quarter core expenses of $382 million and $1.169 million year-to-date. Expenses in the quarter included $5
million related to our settlement with the SEC on issues related to exchange market data. We also had several one-time
expense benefits, which mitigated the impact.
We're updating our full year expense guidance for strategic initiatives as follows. As our clearing house bid builds
begins to take shape and accelerate, it has become clear that we'll be incurring highly anticipated costs for the build out
of our lending clearing house. This is due in part to the complexity of the build, more regulations on client separation
and the new EMIR standards, and preparing for the OTC opportunity. We now expect to spend $20 million of
operating expense this year on our clearing efforts. Capital spending will pick up significantly in Q4, as we are now
well into the buildout phase of this initiative.
Corpedia is a 2012 acquisition and our second half spending is all incremental to pre-acquisition guidance. Of course,
this acquisition also contributes incremental revenues. And with NYSEs second half growth curtailed, we have taken
actions to ensure the costs and are also reduced to levels below last year. As a result, we expect no incremental variable
spending for NYSE beyond what was reported in the first half.
As we move through the end of the year, we will also begin to incur some transitional costs in concert with our IT
shoring activities. These transitional costs will be segregated and reported separately, particularly as efforts accelerate
into 2013. We'll provide more quantification in February on our fourth quarter earnings call.
We're reviving downward our full year 2012 guidance to between $1,603 million and $1,612 million on a constant
dollar basis, using rates of $1.35 to euro and $1.60 to the Pound. We also expect our core expense base to be between
$1,559 million and $1,568 million, which is about $100 million below our 2011 expense base of $1,666 million.
Slide 21 details our cash and debt position as of September 30, 2012. Gross debt at September 30, was $2.5 billion, and
we had about $350 million in cash. Our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2.4 times, reflecting weak
EBITDA generation, share buybacks and the traditional weak Q3 cash flows driven by the biannual section 31 fee
reimbursement.
We're pleased with the outcome of our recent refinancing. In total, we raised $815 million in a new five-year note with
a 2% coupon. This was comprised of refinancing of our $750 million U.S. bond and $80 million of our Euro bond that
was tendered during the refinancing process. This will result in approximately $15 million and $24 million in interest
expense in 2013 and 2014 respectively.
Capital expenditures were $41 million in the quarter and $125 million year-to-date. Despite this low level of
nine-month spending versus our prior full year guidance of $200 million, we do expect a significantly higher level of
capital spending in Q4 as we accelerate the build out of our clearing facility and complete the redesign of our New
York trading floor.

We executed $120 million of stock repurchases in the third quarter retiring 4.7 million shares at an average price of
$25.46. Year-to-date, we have retired 15.9 million shares. Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash
dividend for the fourth quarter of 2012, which is payable on December 28.
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Thanks, Mike. So, just before we open it up for your questions, just a quick review of what we've talked about. So, a
very tough macroenvironment for us, but we remain proud of the progress we've made during the quarter and
year-to-date against the Project 14 commitments. We have launched several new products. We'll continue to launch
more and we will continue to execute on other ongoing initiatives that will drive our future growth.
We also remained focused and disciplined with regard to our cost base and, as Mike just articulated, we are well ahead
of our savings commitment for 2012. And finally, we will continue to look at opportunities to redeploy capital through
the divestment of non-strategic stakes. In summary, we're doing everything within our control to set the table for a
return to growth and I am extremely optimistic about the future.
And with that, we'll turn it over to you guys for a few questions. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Just a real quick one to start on the capital return. Obviously, you've been buying back stock here
at a pretty aggressive rate and from the – I guess, with the $128 million remaining, I guess looks like you could be done
at the end of this quarter. So just curious how you think about going into next year, your recommendations for the
board, when the board is meeting again in terms of timing and any sort of capital return or buybacks for next year?
Thank you.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Okay. Hey, Alex, I'll take that. So really at this stage, we're focused on the $550 million
authorization. We're not in the position to report on any future uses of free cash flow. Given that our leverage is also at
2.4 times now, we are likely to delever a little and as Duncan mentioned, we also as we prepare for clearing, will be
putting a little more capital on hand, consistent with the requirements for clearing. So this type of guidance, we'll give
on our February call, but I would expect us to, once we complete this repurchase, to be delevering of it.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: In the February call, Alex, just to be clear, we'll follow a end of January board meeting
that we have where I'm sure the topic will be discussed because remember that $550 million is the end of a $1 billion
authorization that was initially done. So, I assure we'll be discussing it at the late January meeting and then we will
reflect the board's desires at that time on the February call.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: All right. That's helpful. Thanks.

<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Yeah. Good morning. First, Duncan, I want to congratulate you making a tough decision
to close, Monday and Tuesday, but then having the – being standup and taking full accountability for the decision as
well. Anyway, so my question is on expenses, Michael. So, you appear well ahead of the Project 14 expense target for,
not only for 2012. If you look at your guidance, it looks like you got a pretty nice uptick in 4Q expenses to the number
of about $14 million at the midpoint. So, I guess the question is, can we expect incremental savings beyond what
you've laid out in Project 14, and can you – I know you've talked about the 4Q run rate, but is that all from sort of the
extra clearing cost being built in?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Yeah. I mean, at this stage, we are sticking with our guidance of $250 million of the
three years. We've laid out the timing of which we are definitely ahead of the plan as we speak. We're in that time of
year where we're also doing our budgets and sitting down with management and going through our initiatives. You're
accurate in your assessment of the fourth quarter. We expect the savings to continue and, as I indicated, we expect it to
be about $100 million favorable for the year against the $250 million.
So again, I think we'd like to defer that to the February call where we provide a little more guidance about the
upcoming year. But I think the goal as it's always been here is to aggressively go after the cost and to reduce them as
we're able to do it. We're not just trying to adhere to the plan.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: And if you we're going to the change the guidance or accelerate the timing, Rich, we'll
be fully transparent on that in the next call if we plan to do that.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Okay, thank you. I'll follow up offline. Thank you.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Thanks.

And your next question comes from the line of Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Jillian Miller>: Thanks. You guys mentioned that you're currently revamping the global data agreements and
should result in higher market data revenue. Just want to get some more detail there, like what products are you
repricing? When in 2013 does the new pricing come into effect and if you could give us an idea for potential magnitude
of the revenue impact we're looking at?
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Sure, this is Larry. I'll take that one. First, it's important to remember that our market
data revenues consist of a bunch of things mushed together. There's the consolidated tape revenues. There's the
propriety data. There's U.S. versus Europe and we don't actually break down where those individual pieces are. So part
of the reason for our market data weakness has been that TTA is down as volumes have been weak and more goes to
TRF.
What we're looking at is some consistency with what our competitors are charging particularly for example in Europe
for some non-display things. Remember in Europe, the tradition has been you charge by terminals. The terminal
numbers have gone down as investment banks and our customers, in general, have decreased the number of terminals,
but a lot of our competitors are charging for non-display, which is meaning direct data feeds, sort of more consistent
with what happens in the U.S.
So some of this is just consistency. Some of it is enforcing of compliance, which I think has been a challenge
particularly in Europe due to ambiguous policies that we are cleaning up. And some of it is for things that we don't
charge for that our clients do charge – that our competitors do charge for. So we expect that some of those fees will go
into effect very shortly. I think some of them went in, in November, so you'll start to see partial results in the fourth
quarter. I don't know, Mike, that we're not going to give specific granular guidance on it.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: I mean, a lot of this upside will show up in the technology segment because of its
proprietary nature. So I think when we have Jon [Robson] on in February and talk about guidance for the technology
segment in February that would be an appropriate time to talk a little more about market data expectations, but then...

<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Then we also have some new products that we've just recently rolled out like the
Global Index Feed, the Arca Integrated Feed. And we have some distribution agreements like Xignite, where there's
going to be some white label distribution. So I think, we actually have a lot of initiatives going on in market data, a lot
of it is around consistency, better compliance, of charging for things that we may not have charged for in the past,
where we probably have lagged our competitors, but I think you're going to start to see the catch up. But I think Jon
will give better guidance in the first quarter.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: And to add one more thing, it's Duncan, we haven't probably lagged our competitors,
we've lagged our competitors, right. I mean we know we've been behind the curve on this so part of this is just catching
up, and then level setting and we will give a lot more granularity on that, as Mike and Larry have indicated, in the
February call.

And your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi, good morning, folks.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Just following on that question. I know, we'll get a lot more detail in February in the
technology business, but I think, Duncan, you mentioned you'd be off track on the $1 billion revenue goal in 2015. I
guess if you can talk a little bit about sort of the long term vision of whether that goes appropriate to keep and whether
you think acquisitions obviously will be a bigger part to get to that goal if you're extending it more into the future. And
then also a little bit about the market data impact on technologies. Is that most of the balance that you're talking about
in the fourth quarter from third quarter levels? Thanks.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: I'll try to take that first part of that, Brian, then I'll let Larry and Mike articulate a little
more on the market data piece of that. So first to start at the 30,000 foot level, I think the long-term vision hasn't
changed in terms of what the business can be. Secondly, I do honestly believe that as so many of the clients are in a
state of their own transition as they reinvent their own business models and they think about managing their own
expense basis, obviously the complexity of their infrastructure continues to be something that we hear regularly about
from them, that is something they would like to manage more efficiently and most cost effectively. So I think we're
well-positioned to do that.
What's a little more difficult to predict is when the decision making as some of the potential target customers will take
place. As we alluded to in our remarks, the reason we're backing away from the previously stated objective that we
thought we could achieve by 2015 is that when we made that statement, we do not anticipate capital markets spending
for technology being down 15% to 20% this year like it is. So I think we have to reevaluate that. Jon and his team, Jon
Robson and his team are going through all of that. We do believe in the long-term vision.
We've said from the beginning that it would probably be augmented by some acquisitions. So we're not going to
hesitate to look at a few things like that and we'll be thoughtful about that. So, I think we'll give a more detailed outlook
for what we think that business can be in the next call. In the meantime, in terms of some of the immediate impact,
anything you want to add to what you said to the previous question about kind of when some of this will start showing
up in our results [indiscernible] (47:36)
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: I think I could jump in. So, we did indicate that the Q4, we expect the results to be higher
for this segment than what's the case in Q3, I mean that's mostly the ATG sale. We discussed the Russell sale, which
Duncan discussed earlier, some higher software sales. So, the market data opportunity is more for 2013. In fact a lot of
these pricing changes and other changes are being filed as we speak. So, they will not be effective until 2013. So, it's
more the managed services as this is driving the better fourth quarter.

And your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Daniel T. Fannon>: Hi, good morning. I guess just in terms of capital, if you could talk about your cash balances
today kind of what is your mark for regulatory capital and then as you – what your estimate as you think about the
clearing requirements in the UK, what you might need to if you quantify that as well, please.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: So Dan, thanks for the question. Mike, will take the frontend of that. Then, I will take
the backend of that- with the specificity on the lending clearing house side. So, Mike, why don't you start?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: So, traditionally, if you look at our results over time, we keep – we've kept about $400
million of cash on hand, $350 million to $400 million. We got $350 million at the end of this quarter. The regulatory
required piece is probably about two-thirds of that and most of it is in Europe and sometimes it's the Section 31 fees
that we're collecting on behalf of the SEC from clients. So, that has been historically what we need for our business
today, sort of moving at the clearing and talk about the incremental piece that we think will be required above and
beyond that for clearing.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: And to be very clear, I mean, I know everyone on the call knows this already, but we
are already viewed by the regulators in the UK as a self-clearing registered exchange, because we do clear our own
products. Now, the piece that we're building for June of 2013 is the treasury and risk management piece, where we
already provide clearing services for the products that we trade now in the UK.
So because of that status, we already have a good bit of capital set aside. It's roughly $180 million, about a third of
which is for clearing activities and two thirds of which is for our exchange activities. Having worked with the FSA and
having interpreted the new requirements that will be in place as we add the functionality in the clearing house and the
rules change around that, our expectation is that $180 million number will go to something that looks like $350 million.
And of that increase of $170 million, the majority of that will come on the clearing side.
So if today it's $180 million and its one-third, two-thirds clearing exchange, we expect it will be around $350 million
by this time next year and it would be a little more than 50% of that dedicated to the clearing side and a little less than
50% dedicated to the exchange side. So if you thought that the capital we set aside that is specific to the expansion of
our clearing services, if you thought that that went up by $100 million to $150 million, that would be correct.
<Q - Daniel T. Fannon>: Great. Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Niamh Alexander with KBW. Please proceed.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Hi, thanks. On the high frequency trading, we've had some first round of votes on the
[indiscernible] (51:17) and some of it came – I think it was net-net more positive than negative getting through, but
there is still some kind of negatives for potentially high frequency trading volume. And some of your competitors had
helped us kind of quantify maybe the portion of the revenue and the earnings coming from that business, not just
trading, but in terms of access fees and market data. Is that something you could help us quantify, too, at NYX, what
proportion of your business is coming from that group? And even better, what's Europe versus the U.S.?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Sure. We haven't broken it out. We actually think that those analyses are very tough to
do because there's an interaction between the high frequency side, for example, and the other side. So, for example, we
actually write checks to most of the high frequency traders because of the rebate model. So we actually lose money on
the transaction side with those guys, and then we have sort of market data fees, and co-lo and other things like that, but

that's not different than almost any other big broker participants because they also use co-lo and direct feeds.
So we're somewhat skeptical about these numbers, and we've seen these studies that are actually not consistent, even
among themselves. So what we do believe is that any of the proposed rules that we have seen would not have any
material effect on our finances. In summary, Mike, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: I mean, I think, sort of echo those points and one thing we'll continue to try to emphasize
deeply, all of our U.S. cash trading, in aggregate, is only 7% of our revenue. That's all of our trading, not just high
frequency. And as Larry said, it's not just the volumes, it's what the revenue capture is, which, of course, those clients
are getting the best pricing as well. And when you look at it from a P&L point of view, they're also driving up
messaging and technology spends. So, when you look at it from a profitability point of view, we don't think it would
have a significant impact.
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Right. Our main emphasis is just make sure that the mix of different types of clients on
the platform is well diversified, because the market takes investors of all different duration in their horizons to have a
healthy market quality. And so, we just want to make sure that we don't use punitive measures that actually end up in
worse market quality [ph] are even worth (53:38) driving even more high frequency activity into the dark rules, which
is where they seem to be going right now.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Okay. Fair enough. So, I guess that's the U.S. side. We're seeing a bit more now. So
essentially, I infer from what you're saying that in Europe is the rule kind of as the second round proceeds and it
wouldn't really have much of an impact on your business, so it's minimum exposure times and the restriction is kind of
that survived the first round, that wouldn't affect your business?
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Yes, that's correct. And to be honest, we're skeptical about whether the minimum
exposure times are actually going to make it through because they actually are asymmetrical in the way they apply even
to high frequency. There are high frequency firms that are takers, not just providers, and all they're really doing is
penalizing the providers. I think that'd be very damaging to the market. It's not clear that that will make it through
anyway.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Okay. I'll get back in line. Thank you.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] (54:30) with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q>: Hey, good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on the capital question. To what extent I guess do potential
divestitures play into your capital plans for next year? So you talked about the potential unwind of BlueNext, there's
MCX, there's a couple of other things. So, maybe you could help us think of A, size, if you kind of put all of these
things together how much that would potentially add to your capital position, and B, what's the appetite to divest some
of these things next year given the fact that it feels like there's going to be a little more cash out that you need to set
aside for UK clearing? Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Sure, I'll take that. The unwindings of BlueNext and things are not going to generate
capital. It will save us operating expenses because these are businesses that are in a loss position. I think what Duncan
alluded to is the potential dispositions that could generate capital are the sale of our stake in MCX as well as we have a
9% stake in LCH and as part of the LSE transaction we've agreed to tender a portion of that. So, if that transaction was
completed, we would get cash back for that. So, these are not significant numbers, probably aggregating about a little
more than $100 million of capital.
So, we generate a lot of our free cash flow in the first two quarters of each year. So, I think it's appropriate, as Duncan
mentioned, for us to allow our board to thoroughly discuss the budgets and the business plans for next year and decide
what we're going to do with the excess cash above and beyond what we pay out for our dividend. We are saying that
clearly one of the things we have to factor in, there is a little more cash for going live with our clearing.

<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Right, and I think to provide – to put a little finer point on it if I can, we get asked a lot
when people are reading about some of the new rules in terms of how much more we have to set aside for the
additional clearing services in the UK. If you listened to my answer to Ed's question earlier, I think it was Ed's question
or Dan's question rather, sorry. I'd say if it's $100 million to $150 million, the sale of MCX, the scaledown of the LCH
position and the money that we will not be putting into the Cutter investment by having reduced that stake from $20
million to $12 million collectively more than cover the additional monies we have to set aside for clearing.
We expect to be able to – we've already made the Cutter decision and we expect to be able to divest those other two
positions early in 2013. So if you add all that up, by the time we have to set more capital aside, we will have had – we
will have more than accounted for that capital. So it shouldn't necessitate a change in other – it shouldn't make any
harder decision to think about other shareholder friendly deployments of capital, I think, is the easiest way to say it.

<Q - Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning, Patrick.
<Q - Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy>: So how do you guys view the competitive landscape in European derivatives right
now? You've had a few folks who tried to launch trading in some of the fixed income products and I think of the equity
derivative side of things, the order machine seems like it's been stepping up the competition. So where do you see the

you didn't get to ask a question, Mike and team will follow up with you guys throughout the day. So thank you for your
attention on the call this morning.
In terms of the competitive landscape, let me start with the derivatives, with the interest rate derivatives first. As we've
learned firsthand, it's pretty difficult to dislodge an incumbent's liquidity and I think, we're trying to do that here in the
U.S. and we're not just competing on price or technology alone. We actually think we have a pretty unique value
proposition, given the capitally efficient clearing model, and in spite of that, it has proven difficult to dislodge the
incumbent's liquidity. Having said that, we take all of these approaches seriously and we pay close attention to them.
We monitor them closely. We listen to what the clients are looking for and – but the experience in the industry tells us
that competing only on price or technology tends to be a losing proposition.
In terms of the order machine, with some of the equity options on the continent, we have been in dialogue with some of
the other market participants. I think there are different ways we can approach that one. We have responded earlier this
year by adjusting fees on some of those products and I think that is an initiative that needs to be taken seriously and you
can safely assume we are in dialogue with market participants and the purveyors of that alternative as well as we try to
find ways perhaps to work together instead of against one another. So, more to come on that at a future date and
hopefully that addresses the question.

So, thanks, everybody, for dialing in this morning. We're going to let you all get back to work and we're going to do the
same here, and as I said, Mike and Steve and the team will follow up with any of you who want the one-on-ones
throughout the day. Thanks again and I hope everyone is, in this area at least, is slowly but surely recovering from
Sandy. Thanks a lot. Bye.
