MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. Welcome to Devon Energy Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
After the prepared remarks we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This call is being recorded. At this time, I'd
like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Vincent W. White
Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Devon's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call and
Webcast. As usual, I'll begin today's call with a few preliminary items and then turn the call over to our President and
CEO, John Richels, for his perspective. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our Executive Vice President of
Exploration and Production, will provide the operations update; and then Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will
finish up with a review of our financial results. We'll conclude with a Q&A period and will hold the call to about an
hour. A replay will be available later today through a link on our Home page. That's devonenergy.com.
During the call today we're going to provide some minor updates to our 2011 forecast based on the actual results for the
first half of the year and our outlook for the remainder of the year. In addition to the updates that we're going to give in
today's call, we'll file an 8-K later today, as is our usual practice, that will provide details of our updated 2011
estimates. These updates can be accessed using the Guidance link on the Investor Relations section of Devon's Web
site.
Please note that all references in today's call to our plans, forecast, expectations, estimates and so on are considered
forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities Law, and while we strive to give you the very best estimates possible,
many factors could cause our actual results to differ from our estimates. We'd encourage you to review the discussion
of risk factors and uncertainties provided in the Form 8-K that we are filing today.

Also, in today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP performance measures. When we do that we are required to
provide certain related disclosures and those disclosures are also available on the Devon Web site.
With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO, John Richels.
John Richels
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone.
Let me begin by stating the obvious. Devon's second quarter 2011 was an excellent one. Our North American onshore
production reached an all-time record, averaging 660,000 equivalent barrels per day, that's a 5% increase over the first
quarter. Continued focus on efficiency and cost control mitigated industry inflation and the impact of a stronger
Canadian dollar, in fact, our pre-tax cash cost per equivalent barrel were essentially flat compared to the previous
quarter and the year-ago quarter. With production above our guidance, higher realized commodity prices and effective
cost management, our second quarter adjusted earnings climbed 10% over the prior-year quarter to $1.71 per diluted
share and that exceeded the First Call mean by $0.17.
Cash flow before balance sheet changes reached $1.6 billion, or $3.81 per diluted share, surpassing the Street mean
estimate by $0.48. Net earnings including the gain on the sale of Brazil totaled a whopping $2.7 billion for the second
quarter, or $6.48 per diluted share, and during the second quarter, we repurchased 7.1 million shares for $548 million.
To date we have spent $2.6 billion of the $3.5 billion current authorization to repurchase 35.1 million shares. This
represents almost 8% of our outstanding shares, and those shares were acquired at an average price of roughly $74 per
share. We remain on track to complete that repurchase program by the end of the year.
In May, we closed our $3.2 billion sale of our Brazilian assets, which essentially completes the strategic repositioning
of Devon to a company focused entirely onshore in North America. Our total pre-tax divestiture proceeds exceeded $10
billion, with after-tax proceeds estimate at $8 billion. Currently, we have more than $6.5 billion of cash and short-term
investments outside the U.S. that we have not repatriated. However, it's important to note that our after-tax estimates of
proceeds assumes full payment of the taxes triggered by repatriation of most of those funds under current U.S. tax law.
If a more favorable tax situation develops for the repatriation of these funds, or if we redeploy the proceeds in Canada,
we will have up to $900 million of upside. Until we have better visibility into potential repatriation tax legislation and
determine the optimal long-term capital allocation between the U.S. and Canada, our divestiture proceeds will remain
outside the U.S.
Devon has emerged from the repositioning in a truly enviable position. We have a deep inventory of low-risk drilling
locations including years of high-margin oil and liquids-rich developments in our cornerstone project areas. These
includes the Barnett, the Cana and our steam-assisted gravity drainage projects in Canada. We're drilling our most
economic wells ever in the liquid-rich portions of the Barnett. Our first-mover position has provided us with the largest
and best acreage position. Furthermore, our low entry and royalty costs enhance the economic returns across our
inventory of thousands of undrilled Barnett locations. In the liquids-rich Cana, we're taking advantage of opportunities
to increase our working interest and are continuing to delineate our condensate-rich acreage to the Northwest.
We could continue for years at our current pace of development without any additional inventory. However, in order to
bring forward the value embedded in our existing acreage positions, we're pursuing a wide range of exploration
opportunities across North America. In the Permian and Western Canadian sedimentary basins for example, we're
accelerating oil and liquids-rich exploration drilling. Given the recent advances in drilling and completion technology
and the stack pay nature of these basins, we're pursuing more than 20 oil and liquids-rich plays that have emerged in
these two basins alone. Our inventory represents more than $3 billion oil-equivalent barrels of net un-risked resource
across our more than 5 million net prospective acres. These substantial positions provide Devon with thousands of
potential locations representing many years of additional growth.
We're also moving forward with the testing of our new venture plays. These include the Tuscaloosa, the Niobrara, the
Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma, the Ohio Utica and the A1 Carbonate and Utica in Michigan. We've been successful

with our strategy of acquiring sizable positions in these oil and liquids-rich plays where, for the most part, competition
had not yet driven up prices. Instead of leasing large blocks of trend acreage and then figuring out where the play works
best, we've taken a more targeted approach. Similar to our approach in the Cana play, we've attempted to identify the
best parts of the plays and specifically focused our acreage acquisitions in those areas.
Utilizing this approach, we've secured 1.1 million net acres at very reasonable costs in what we believe to be highly
economic parts of these five plays. While each of these plays has risk, it's likely that several will turn out to be highly
economic, large-scale, development plays. The second half of this year is shaping up to be an exciting time for Devon
with the initial drilling results anticipated from a wide range of exploration opportunities.
In summary, the repositioned company has all the attributes necessary to deliver highly competitive per share growth.
We're generating excellent full cycle returns, we have superior financial strength and we have a deep inventory of
economic, low-risk development projects and promising exploration projects in emerging plays and new ventures.
So with that overview, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?
David A. Hager
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. We continue to see outstanding results from our 2011 E&P capital program.
Our key development plays including the Barnett, Cana and Jackfish are all performing very well. We also remain very
active in evaluating and de-risking the upside potential in our various emerging and new venture plays. With more than
90% of our 2011 E&P capital allocated towards oil and liquids-rich projects, and with the solid results we have seen so
far this year, we are well on our way to deliver liquids growth in the high teens in 2011.
So let's take a look at some of the highlights for the quarter. Starting with our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta,
Jackfish continues to deliver industry-leading performance. During the second quarter, Jackfish 1 production averaged
31,000 barrels per day net of royalties. At Jackfish 2, we began injecting steam in the second quarter. All four pads are
currently in the circulation phase of the process. As some of you may recall from our recent SAGD [Steam Assisted
Gravity Drainage] school, this is the initial stage where steam is injected into both the injector and producer wells to
begin warming the reservoir. Later this month, three of the pads will move into the partial SAGD phase and production
will continue to ramp up. We exited the second quarter producing about 1,000 barrels per day net of royalties at
Jackfish 2.
At Pike, with data from nearly 400 wells and some 60 square miles of seismic, our SAGD team has begun engineering
work on a 105,000 barrel per day facility for Pike 1. This would be essentially three Jackfish-size facilities from a
single plant site. You might recall we completed the resource evaluations for two of the three projects with last winter's
stratigraphic drilling. Planning efforts are already underway for our 2011/2012 winter drilling and seismic programs
that will focus on defining the third 35,000-barrel per day project in the Pike 1 complex. Ultimately, we believe that
Pike can support four or five Jackfish-sized projects, and when combined with Jackfish we expect to grow Devon's net
thermal oil production to between 150,000 and 175,000 barrels per day by 2020.
Moving now to the Permian Basin, we currently have 19 operated rigs pursuing targets in numerous play types across
our roughly 1,000,000 net acre position. Our second quarter production from the Permian increased 17% over the
second quarter of 2010 to 49,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Oil and natural gas liquids accounted for 75% of the
quarter's production. In the Permian and our Wolfberry light oil play we currently have five operated rigs running as we
continue the evaluation and development of our 160,000 net acres. Through the second quarter we had drilled
approximately 50 of our planned 135-well program for this year. We recently initiated a four-well 20-acre infill pilot
program and will be testing the application of horizontal drilling in certain areas as well. We have significant running
room in this high return light oil play with more than 850 net risked locations remaining.
On our roughly 200,000 net acres in the Bone Springs oil play we currently have five operated rigs running. We
continue to have great results from our horizontal programs on both the New Mexico and Texas sides of the play. In the
second quarter we completed eight wells in the second Bone Springs interval in New Mexico with 30-day average IP

rates of 665 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This included one exceptionally strong well, the Diamond 1H, that was
brought on line with an average 30-day IP rate of more than 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our Bone Springs
well costs in New Mexico are running about $5 million per well with EURs averaging 400,000 barrels equivalent.
On the Texas side in the Bone Springs play we completed our third well targeting the third Bone Springs interval. The
100% Devon-owned Talladega 65 2H was brought online recently. After 15 days of production this well has averaged
1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Although our Texas Bone Springs production history is limited to just a few
wells we are encouraged with the shallow declines we have seen to this point. With average EURs exceeding 600,000
barrels equivalent and with well costs running about $7 million, these wells offer outstanding returns. We plan to add a
third rig in the Texas side of the play later this year, bringing our total number of rigs working in the Bone Springs up
to six.
Also in the Permian, the Delaware is another conventional oil formation that we are targeting with horizontal drilling.
We completed three wells in the second quarter including the Laguna Salada 6H that came online with a 30-day IP rate
of more than 800 oil equivalent barrels per day. We now have three operated rigs drilling Delaware horizontal wells.
Elsewhere in the Permian Basin we are targeting two operated rigs in the Avalon Shale play. Our activity is now
focused on our 65,000 net acres in the eastern portion of the play where condensate yields are higher. We currently
have three wells in various stages of drilling or completion and should have those results for you next quarter.
And finally in the Permian Basin, we have assembled approximately 65,000 net acres in the southern end of the
Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp Shale oil play. We are currently running two operated rigs, with our first three wells
in the play in various stages of drilling or completion. We hope to have results for you next quarter. This is a hot play in
the industry, and with the positive indications we have seen to date we now plan to drill eight Wolfcamp Shale
exploration wells in 2011.
In addition to the Midland Basin acreage, we have about 200,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin that is prospective for
the Wolfcamp Shale and we're currently drilling our first well to test this formation's potential in the Delaware Basin.
Moving north to the Texas panhandle and the Granite Wash play we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee
and Granite Wash A wells. We are running five operated rigs here and brought eight operated Granite Wash wells
online during the second quarter. The 30-day IP rates from these wells averaged over 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day, including 200 barrels of oil and 730 barrels of natural gas liquids per day.
Moving now to the Cana-Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma. As everyone is well aware by now, our Cana gas
processing plant was damaged by a tornado on May 24. It is worth noting that we have both property and business
interruption insurance that Jeff will cover in more detail later. Work is underway to repair the damage and we expect
the plant to be fully repaired and operational during the fourth quarter. We are confident of our year-end exit rate target
for Cana of 275 million cubic feet equivalent per day net to Devon's interest. In spite of the plant interruption our
second quarter net Cana production averaged 17% over the first quarter to a record 189 million cubic feet equivalent
per day, including nearly 9,000 barrels per day of liquids.
To keep pace with our Cana-Woodford growth and capture the additional value from the liquids-rich portions of the
field, we plan to begin the first expansion to our Cana gas processing plant later this year. The facility's initial
processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day will be expanded to 350 million cubic feet a day, and will be
capable of extracting up to 27,000 barrels of NGLs per day. The $125 million expansion is expected to be operational
in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas, this field continues to be a significant and highly economic resource
for us. Our 2011 program has yielded the best wells we have ever drilled in the Barnett. We have seen average EURs
increase to 3.2 Bcf equivalent per day. We ran 13 operated rigs in the Barnett for most of the second quarter.
Subsequent to June 30 we dropped one rig bringing our operated rig count back to 12, where we expect to keep it for
the remainder of the year. In the second quarter we brought 114 Barnett wells online with average 30-day IP rates of
approximately 3.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day including an average 125 barrels of liquids per day.

In the second quarter our net production reached a record 1.28 Bcf equivalent per day, that is 1 billion 280 million
cubic feet equivalent per day, including 46,000 barrels per day of liquids. This represents a 5% sequential quarter
increase and a 13% increase over the second quarter of last year.
With the high liquids yield we are seeing from our Barnett drilling combined with our outlook for gas and NGL
products spreads we recently made the decision to expand our Bridgeport gas processing plant for the seventh time.
The 140-million-a-day expansion will provide an additional 11,000 barrels per day of NGL production capacity. The
$160 million expansion is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2013. Upon completion, the Bridgeport
facility will have an inlet capacity of 790 million cubic feet per day with an NGL production capacity of 65,000 barrels
per day, making it one of the largest gas processing facilities in the Lower 48.
On the exploration front, as John indicated, we are continuing to actively evaluate the oil and liquids potential on
acreage within our portfolio that spans numerous play types across multiple basins in the U.S. and Canada. This
includes several new ventures areas in the U.S. where we have assembled 1.1 million net acres. In the Niobrara we
have approximately 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin, and 100,000 net acres in the northern part of the DJ
Basin. This is a very active industry play right now with about 30 rigs working.
Many of the industry wells drilled today were drilled without the benefit of 3-D data, making it difficult to target,
identify and land in the appropriate zones. Our initial focus in the DJ Basin will be to utilize 3-D to improve upon the
lack of consistency demonstrated to date in this play by the industry. We are currently drilling our first wells in both
basins. We plan to drill or participate in six Niobrara wells in the Powder and four in the DJ Basin in 2011.
In the Mississippi, an oil play located in North Central Oklahoma, we have secured over 200,000 net acres. This is a
play originally established by vertical production years ago but is now being pursued with horizontal drilling. We
drilled our first vertical well to gather data in the second quarter and we're currently drilling our first horizontal well. In
total we plan to drill or participate in 12 to 15 Wells in 2011.
There has been a lot of discussion lately of the Ohio Utica Shale. As most of you know Devon was an early mover. We
have established 110,000 net acres in what we believe is the heart of the oil window. Your primary risk to a shale play
is of course the ability to move fluid through a very tight reservoir. However, we have now analyzed a core from our
first Utica well and are highly encouraged by the positive permeability indications seen in our first well. Based on these
early results, we believe the oil window could offer some of the best economics in the play. We plan to drill three
additional Ohio Utica wells this year.
Just to the north is our 300,000 net acre position in the Michigan basin that's prospective for both the Utica shale as
well as the A1 Carbonate. As you may know, this has historically been a prolific basin. We're particularly excited about
the potential of the A1 Carbonate, which was a source rock for the Niagara reef play in Michigan. We drilled our first
two vertical core wells and are currently evaluating the data.
And finally in the Tuscaloosa shale play located along that Louisiana and Mississippi border, we recently completed
drilling, coring and logging operations on our first well, the Lane 64-1. This is a vertical well that we drilled to obtain
data. The rig has now moved up depth to the Beach Grove 68-1H, where we plan to gather additional core and log data
before drilling a lateral and completing it as our first horizontal in the Tuscaloosa.
Another exploration play that has recently caught the Street's attention is the Smackover Brown Dense oil play located
in North Louisiana. We have about 40,000 net acres prospective in the play and expect to spud our first horizontal well
in this play next month. As I mentioned, we also have a significant exploration effort underway in Canada, targeting the
deep basin where we have Cardium and Lower Cretaceous drilling programs underway, as well as Cardium program in
the Ferrier area of our Central Alberta and our Viking program in Saskatchewan.
Although wet weather has delayed a portion of our Canadian exploration program, we expect to – still expect complete
our 2011 program. However, at our Viking light oil play in Saskatchewan, we did complete two wells in the second
quarter. One of which IPd at 90 barrels of oil per day. We expect this play to be economic with well costs in the $1
million to $1.2 million per well range. IPs of approximately 40 barrels per day and EURs of 50,000 barrels. While these
results are encouraging, we're still in the early stages of evaluating the potential on our 900,000 net acre position. If

successful, we could have more than 1,000 Viking drilling locations.
In summary, all of our key development projects are delivering excellent results, supporting our production growth
targets. Growth is being driven by liquids growth in the high teens. In addition, we are entering a very exciting time on
the exploration front as we get our first wells down in a variety of different plays.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook.
Jeffery A. Agosta
Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before we move in to the financial review for the quarter, I would like
to remind everyone my comments will be focused on results from continuing operations. In other words, our North
American Onshore business. With the close of Brazil, this will be the last quarter that contains significant activity
within discontinued operations. For those of you interested in a more detailed review of our discontinued ops, we have
provided supplemental tables in our news release. For today's call, I will limit my comments to those items that require
additional commentary or were outside our forecasted guidance range.
The first item I will cover is our production for the quarter. In the second quarter of 2011, our reported production
totaled 60.1 million oil equivalent barrels or 660,000 BOE per day. This result set a quarterly production record for our
North American Onshore operations and represents a robust 5% growth rate over the first quarter, and a greater than
6% increase over the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our production exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by
roughly 10,000 barrels per day, in spite of deferring production from Cana due to tornado damage at our plant there.
Our out-performance was driven by strong results from our core properties. Also, a gas royalty adjustment in Canada
boosted reported second quarter production by about 7,000 barrels per day. Looking specifically at the liquids side of
our business, our oil and natural gas liquids production averaged 220,000 barrels per day for the quarter, a 12%
increase over the year-ago period. The most noteworthy year-over-year growth came in the U.S., led by strong growth
from the Barnett, Cana and Permian Basin we increased our second quarter U.S. oil and NGL production by 22% over
the second quarter of last year.
Looking ahead, we expect downtime at our Cana processing facility to curtail third quarter production by roughly
10,000 BOE per day. In spite of this temporary curtailment, we still expect third quarter production to range between
655,000 barrels per day and 665,000 barrels per day. Our sequential quarter production growth for the third quarter will
be masked by the tornado- impacted Cana volumes and the 7,000 BOE per day royalty adjustment in Canada that we
reported in the second quarter.
For the full year, we're now raising the bottom end of our production forecast by 2 million barrels to a range of 238
million barrels to 240 million barrels. When compared to 2010 the midpoint of our updated guidance range implies a
top line production growth rate of more than 7% for our North American Onshore properties. This growth will be
achieved in spite of deferring approximately 2.5 million barrels of production due to severe weather, principally the
damage to the Cana plant.
Turning to hedges, in the second quarter cash settlements from oil and gas hedges totaled $59 million. These
settlements boosted our company-wide average price by about $1 per BOE in the quarter. Since our last conference call
we have continued to bolster our natural gas hedge position. In the second half of this year we now have a combination
of swap and collar contracts covering approximately 980 million cubic feet per day, at a weighted average protected
price of $5.28 per Mcf.
We have also more than doubled our natural gas hedge position for next year. For the full-year of 2012 we now have
hedges covering 815 million cubic feet per day, with a weighted average protected price just under $5 per Mcf.
However, 60% of these hedged volumes are done using collars therefore we still maintain upside on these volumes
should natural gas pricing improve. We will post an updated hedging schedule in our 8K filing, and on our website, that
provides a detailed view of our 2011 and '12 hedge positions.

Turning now to our Midstream business, in addition to our strong upstream performance Devon's marketing and
midstream operations also delivered outstanding results. Operating profit for the second quarter came in at $148
million, well above the high end of our implied guidance range. Strong NGL prices and increased throughput drove the
increase. Looking ahead, we expect the downtime at our Cana processing facility to reduce our third quarter marketing
and midstream operating profit to a range of $120 million to $140 million.
However, for the full-year, in spite of the setback at Cana, we now expect our operating profit to come in between $515
million and $545 million. This represents an increase of $20 million from our previous guidance. It is worth noting, as
Dave mentioned, that we are well insured for both the property damage and business interruption that has occurred at
our Cana facility. Our policy deductibles are $2.5 million for property damage and a 30-day wait for business
interruption. After the 30-day waiting period, our business interruption coverage pays for the loss of production, not
only from the wells that were producing at the time of the storm but also for the ramp-up of volumes that would be
occurring from the wells that we are drilling. Consequently, our risk management has mitigated most of the financial
impact of this incident.
Looking now at our expenses, in the second quarter most expense items came in the bottom half of our guidance range.
Our focus on controlling costs combined with our high graded asset base has helped offset both industry inflation and
the headwinds of the strengthening Canadian dollar. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year we anticipate
continued upward pressure on costs. However, we are confident that our scale in key operating regions and consistent
focus on cost management will allow us to mitigate much of the impact of inflation.
Looking at our income taxes, Devon's reported second quarter income tax from continuing operations came in at $1.2
billion. This implies an 87% tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing ops. The most significant item that influenced
our quarterly tax rate was a $744 million charge related to the assumed repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. This
is essentially a non-cash charge which results from a required accounting exercise that assumes that we will repatriate a
substantial portion of these funds under current U.S. tax law. However, as John mentioned earlier in the call, we have
not repatriated these funds and they currently reside outside the U.S. In any case, after backing out the assumed
repatriation charge and the impact of other nonrecurring items, you get an adjusted tax rate of 32%, which is right in
line with our guidance.
Going to the bottom line, Devon's solid second quarter performance and the profitable sale of our assets in Brazil
translated into record GAAP earnings of $2.7 billion. After backing out the non-recurring items, our adjusted earnings
totaled $726 million, or $1.71 per diluted share. Our cash flows before balance sheet changes totaled $1.6 billion. As
John mentioned earlier, this was a solid beat on both earnings per share and cash flow.
Before we go to the Q&A, I would like to provide a quick update on our financial position. In the second quarter,
Devon's cash inflows totaled $4.8 billion. After funding all capital demands for the quarter, repurchasing $584 million
of common stock, and paying out $72 million in dividends, our cash and short-term investments increased by over $3
billion during the quarter, reaching a total of $6.7 billion. As a result, our net debt declined to just $1.2 billion and our
net debt to cap ratio declined to just 5%. Following the end of the quarter, in the month of July we issued $2.25 billion
of senior notes through a combination of 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year offerings. This allowed us to take advantage of
today's attractive market conditions to fund our upcoming $1.75 billion of debt maturing in September as well as
reduce our outstanding short-term borrowings.
In summary, we're excited about Devon's future and believe that we are well positioned to compete effectively. Our
financial position provides us with significant strength. As importantly, our assets are performing very well. We remain
focused on maximizing our operating margins, exercising capital discipline and optimizing growth per debt adjusted
share.
At this point I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?

Thanks. [audio gap] (35:27) Q&A session today, we have not just the speakers, but also our Executive Chairman, Larry
Nichols, is with us, and as usual, we'll ask each participant to limit his or her questions to one initial inquiry and one
follow up. Operator, we're ready for the first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Your line is open.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Hopefully you can all hear me okay. Congratulations on a terrific quarter. I guess I'll
direct this one to John. John, you've got an awful lot of options on the table in terms of your – what is a pretty exciting
exploration program going forward. Assuming that at least several of those work, what would your capital priority be in
terms of future capital expenditure? In terms of obviously you're still maintain a lot of capital in the Barnett in
particular. How would you look to flex the capital program? Would the capital program go up? Or would you
reprioritize within the portfolio? And I'll have a quick follow up, please.
<A - John Richels>: Well, Doug, certainly with our financial position where it is, we've got the ability to pursue a lot
of opportunities. I think what we'll have to do is – we're really excited about these new opportunities that we're
pursuing. We'll have to see when we have more data how they stack up one against another. Over a longer period of
time, having – that's a high-class problem to have, or high-grade problem to have if we have that many opportunities.
But we'll just have to see exactly what the economics look like. We are, as you mention, we're getting great economics
and great returns out of our Barnett shale program. Even at $4.50 gas this year, that plays going to have cash flow of
somewhere around $1.8 billion on a $1 billion investment of capital, and we're getting great results out of Cana and
some of our other development programs. So we'll just have to see how they all stack up and how much we want to
invest to bring the value forward on these new opportunities.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great. My follow up is actually kind of a related question. This may be one for David, but the
rig count, could you give us some idea as to how you see the trajectory, let's say through the balance of this year? And I
guess included in that question, did the drilling efficiencies that you're seeing from the existing rig count, is that
improving? Because it looks like we're seeing some kind of significant change in the context of your very strong
production numbers? I'll leave it there. Thank you.
<A - David A. Hager>: Doug, I would say that for the rest of this year we see our rig count staying essentially flat, and
we're still finalizing our plans as we look forward to 2012. So I don't want to predate our process, internal process, here
too much, but probably we're going to be looking at somewhat of a flat program next year also compared to this year.
And on the efficiency side, yes, we are continuing to see increased efficiencies throughout our program, and we're
continuing to see it in the Barnett, we're seeing it in Cana, and obviously that's part of the reason we actually had a
capital increase here we announced a few weeks ago, because we're drilling so many more wells and we're keeping the
rigs for the full year, that we're getting more wells drilled than we originally anticipated. But that is the good news, and
we are taking those learnings on how to do that throughout our entire program including in our New Ventures area.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great. Thank you very much for the answers.

<Q - Scott Hanold>: Looking at the Utica shale, obviously a lot of chatter around that you guys indicated you saw
some pretty encouraging things [indiscernible] (39:24) your vertical core. Can you just generally just talk about what
specifically you see within that core that gets you excited, and how you kind of – maybe compare some of those
attributes versus some of the other liquids-rich plays you all are involved in?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, I don't want to get too much in to the specific analysis of it, but I can say obviously that
we have a lot of experience in looking at a lot of shale plays throughout the U.S., and we understand what we need in
terms of what type of permeability is necessary, especially in light of the fact that we are primarily in the oil window
and it is a normally pressured oil window. It is not over pressured so obviously you need a little bit higher perm in
order to move the oil through, but I think we understand that and we know where the permeability is and we're
encouraged. The ultimate test obviously is to drill some horizontal wells out there, and we don't have any horizontal
wells, but we think we have a pretty good understanding from our vast number of horizontal wells we have drilled
throughout North America that we understand the relationship pretty well and we're optimistic.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. Thank you for that. And then turning to the Permian, obviously it seems like you continue
to step up activity and you're seeing some good things there. What is your rig count specifically in that area? And how
many rigs do you think you can be operating in the Permian as you're looking at 2012?
<A - David A. Hager>: We're currently running 19 rigs in the Permian, and I can break those, that rig count, down for
you in a little bit more detail. We have 5 rigs – I think I pretty well did it in the prepared remarks, but there are 5 in the
Bone Springs, 5 in the Wolfberry, 3 in the Delaware horizontal program, 2 in the Avalon, 2 in the new Wolfcamp Shale
play that I described in the Southern Midland Basin where we have assembled 65,000 acres, and a couple others are
drilling conventional oil plays within the basin. We see that program staying pretty flat going in to next year, but we're
very excited with the results that we have achieved with that. We'll have to see.
If we do have continued success we might move the rig count up a little bit. We're limited a little bit by the
infrastructure availability out there, and just as we need to mature the play. So it's possible it might move up a little bit
as we move into next year. I wouldn't look for a doubling or anything like that though of the rig count, but it's probably
perhaps a small increase in the rig count moving into 2012.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman from The Benchmark Co. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Guys, good morning. Just a couple of quick things. Dave, you may have done this, but frankly
you were just going too fast for me to possibly keep up. But I didn't hear you talk about any kind of recent drilling
results in the Avalon.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes, I didn't go through that in a lot of detail, Mark. I would say that what we're finding in the
Avalon so far is that we are seeing strong gas rates in the Avalon, we're seeing as we move from west to east in the
Avalon that we get – that it becomes more liquids-rich, and we haven't drilled as many wells in the central and eastern
part of the play as we started our program in the Western.
So right now we are moving in to the part of the play that is more liquids-rich and the most economic part of the play,
and we really need to get some completions on that part of the play before I can talk in any more specifics.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Dave, my follow up relates to what you think in terms of the liquids content of the
program going forward in the Barnett and the Cana? Obviously the more recent wells are yielding a much higher
liquids content than you've seen in your base production in the areas. Do you have any thoughts on what that looks like
going forward?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we talked about plant expansions in both those areas. And so obviously that gives you an
idea the we have a deep inventory of liquids-rich opportunities in both of those areas. In the Barnett we probably have

about 2,000 locations in the liquids-rich part of the play, and we're getting outstanding economics in the liquids-rich
part of the play, both in the Barnett and in Cana. And so we see – and frankly in Cana we have not drilled as much in
the core of the Cana as we have around the core. That's the only area in the company where we have had to drill some
wells in order to get it held by production, and we focus part of our program on that versus infilling in the core which is
very liquids-rich. So we see tremendous opportunities there also to infill the core. You've seen how our down spacing
projects have worked well, so we anticipate that we're going to have a strong liquids growth, and that's part of the
reason why we're expanding the plant in Cana as well.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: If I could just follow up. What I'm trying to get a handle on is at the margin do you think the
liquids rates that you're seeing in both those plays can be sustained at what we're seeing right now? Can they go higher?
Are they likely to back off?
<A - Vincent W. White>: Mark, this is Vince. I'd give you a couple of observations. About 22% of the BTUs coming
out of the Barnett right now are liquids. We are focusing our activity on the liquids rich portions of the play, so if the
relative economics continue to favor the liquids rich portion we would expect the percentage of our BTUs in the
Barnett that are liquids to go up. Following the de-risking of the Cana if the market conditions are similar to what they
are now that highly favor liquids-rich drilling over dry portions, then we would expect to increase the liquids yield as a
percentage of the total BTU stream out of the Cana just like in the Barnett.
<A - John Richels>: And, Mark, we've talked from time to time about the fact that we are not going to increase our
processing capacity in those areas for a short term because we want make sure that we efficiently allocate that capital.
And the fact that we're expanding our processing capacity in both of those plays shows you where we think that liquids
volumes are going here in the next while.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay, guys. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - John Richels>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Following up on some of those Permian questions, with regards to the various Delaware basin
horizontal zones you seem to be getting good results out of the second Bone Spring in New Mexico, the third Bone
Spring in Texas, and you just discussed the Avalon here. Can you provide a bit more color on the first Bone Spring in
New Mexico, and then whether you see any of the three Bone Spring zones along with the Avalon commercially
overlapping on your acreage?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, the first Bone Springs is also prospective. It's prospective a little bit further to the north.
Basically as you move from north to south it's – you go from the prospectivity of being in the first Bone Springs to the
second Bone Springs and then once you cross the New Mexico-Texas line there then the third Bone Springs is
primarily prospective on the Texas side. But there is some overlap though between the first and second Bone Springs.
And so yes, the first Bone Springs is prospective as well on the New Mexico side.
It's not – I don't want to give you the idea that it's strictly a resource play type though. The first and second Bone
Springs are more channel sands, and so you have to make sure that you stay in the channels, and then as you move
down into Texas those channels essentially splay out and they become like a deep water depositional system when you
go off the shelf edge, and that's where you get the really high rates in the third Bone Springs, is once those channels
splay out on the Texas side.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Great. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, when we look at the cash currently outside the
U.S., can we talk a little bit more about potential capital allocation? How does your ability to repatriate that cash into
the U.S. versus move it towards Canada impact your willingness to expand new venture acreage position versus buy

back additional stock versus make larger acquisitions?
<A - John Richels>: Well, there's a lot of questions there, Brian. Let me take a crack at that. I mean right now
obviously, as Jeff mentioned, we're still trying to sort out the income tax rules to see whether we can bring it back to
the U.S.
What it does do is, to the extent that we allocate some of those funds in Canada, we've got a lot of projects there as
well, we've got a very ambitious program for our thermal heavy oil and excited about the growth there. It allows us to
invest some funds that will create a higher return because they're not – as opposed to bringing them back and paying
the tax. So that's something that we're trying to work out, trying to figure out the optimal capital allocation between the
U.S. and Canada. And with regard to share buy-backs, unfortunately – I thought at one time it would be clever if we
bought our shares back through our Canadian subsidiary but the folks at the IRS have that all figured out as well and
we can't do that with any advantage.
But in terms of buying back our stock we're going to do what we always have, and looking ahead determine what's
going to create the best debt-adjusted share returns and best DAS metrics for our shareholders, and allocate that capital
appropriately between our E&P opportunities and buying back stock. And as you know, we haven't been shy about that.
We've bought back about 20% of our stock in the last six or seven years. So we'll have to see how all of that sorts out
over the next while. We're certainly hopeful that we're seeing at least some modicum of acceptance or positive
indication of maybe being able to bring some of those funds back. Jeff, do you have any other comments?
I would just add, Brian, we're not inhibited in bringing that cash back, we're just really wanting to see how any
potential changes to U.S. tax law may play out over the coming months to see if we can bring that back at an enhanced
tax rate.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: You bet.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Wilmoth from Simmons & Co. Your line is now open.
<Q - Scott M. Wilmoth>: Good morning, guys. You guys mentioned infrastructure constraints in the Permian. Can
you give us more details on that, and what your outlook is for the remainder of the year and 2012 in terms of Permian
infrastructure?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we see the infrastructure continuing to expand throughout next year and the following
year. There is, particularly on the New Mexico side, there is really a lack of natural gas processing capability from the
region and so you really can't ramp up the liquids-rich plays significantly in the area where you're talking about the
Avalon potential of New Mexico. So that is a constraint. The rest of the areas I would not characterize really as being
infrastructure constrained. I'd say it's more it's just how quickly we can mature those plays and feel comfortable that we
have properly de-risked the plays.
<Q - Scott M. Wilmoth>: Okay. Thanks. And then just following up on your 2012 rig count assumption, you said
probably flattish for next year. Is that assuming a ramp up in some emerging plays? Or is that if you have success could
that go higher?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, it potentially could go higher with success, yes. And so we're committed obviously to
balance though, to stay – to balance our opportunities against our staying very strong financially also. And so we've got
put all of that together, and if we have significant success in these plays we'd have to see, as John mentioned, just how
we handle that situation. But there are a lot of options for us to bring value forward in the event that we have success in
these plays through partnering relationships, et cetera. So there's a lot of different ways to solve that problem if that
does occur.

Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Hi. Morning. Yes, nice quarter.
<A - John Richels>: Thanks, David.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: A couple questions. Canadian – or I guess I got two questions. Canadian exploration, can
you talk – you talked a little bit about the Viking, the Cardium and some of the Cretaceous stuff you're doing, but can
you talk – give us a little more color what you're most excited about? Any horizontal potential? Are you going
horizontal? Can you give us some more detail on that up in Canada?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes, well we're excited about all of them. Frankly, we're excited about the fact that we have 4
million acres in the Western Canadian sedimentary basin and we have done very little exploitation of those for
liquids-rich and oil type opportunities. So we see a very large number of opportunities that could emerge from there.
The three that we've been traditionally highlighting so far this year are the Viking light oil potential that I mentioned,
where we're going to have 1,000 to 2,000 locations across our acreage, 9000 acres in Saskatchewan. The Cardium light
oil play where we have drilled some wells in the Ferrier area, but more importantly up in the deep basin, we think that
we have at least 80,000 prospective acres for the Cardium.
And then, also in the deep basin, we're going to be start drilling this fall what we call our Vertizontal Program, where
we are going to be taking wells that would go actually horizontal in the deepest zone, which would be the Cadamom,
and then also complete simultaneously in some of the vertical zones and some of the stack pay areas.
But in addition to that, we're drilling a number of different wells in a number of different play types up there that, with
success, all of which could be amount – could be significant. And I've got a whole list of ones we could go through, but
it's not probably worth going through all the details on all of them. But there's just a large number of opportunities, but
we're just at the front-end of evaluating all of these.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Okay. All right. The let me burn my follow up on something else. John, can you...
<A - David A. Hager>: If you really want the list, I can give you.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: No, no, no. We'll get that a different time. John, you kind of alluded to it, but didn't directly
answer a question. Or didn't answer the question I was looking for. What's the plans for 2012 share buyback?
<A - John Richels>: We haven't made those plans yet, Dave. As we get in to – as we've talked before, what we're
trying – what we're doing is – there's kind of a level of activity we have to have in the company, right? Which is just to
maintain our organizational capacity, our service sector capacity to meet our throughput commitments, our processing
facility optimization, all of those things. After that, we want to be very thoughtful and dispassionate, frankly, in our
views as to whether we're better off allocating funds to share buybacks or our capital programs. And we want to
allocate it to those areas that are going to create the best returns and the best debt adjusted share returns for our
shareholders.
Now as we get further through the year, and we haven't obviously finalized or even come close to our 2012 capital
budget, there are a lot of moving parts. And our view as to whether we ought to be buying our stock back rather than
investing in our E&P programs is dependent on our stock price, on our view of commodity prices for the future, on our
view of costs in the future, and how that influences our per debt adjusted share metrics.
So we'll have to – we'll have to see how we – what we do in 2012. 2011, we were really happy to be able to do a lot of
each, and as Vince has mentioned before, we sold roughly 8% or 10% of the company for 23% of the enterprise value
and significantly shrunk our balance sheet, and that's creating some very good returns and good per share accretion for

our shareholders. So we'll just have to see. I can't give you a more definite answer than that because we're still in the
early stages of determining what 2012 looks like.

Operator
Your last question comes from the line of Rehan Rashid of FBR Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Rehan Ahmed Rashid>: Thank you. Just a quick one. Can we compare the Powder and the DJ Niobrara? Is it
going to the same kind of variability do you think?
<A - David A. Hager>: It's a little too early to say on that. I think that as you are in the DJ/Niobrara, you probably
have a little bit more chalk in those, which would give you greater confidence that it's going to be brittle and will frac
easier. So we think that's certainly a positive. There haven't – the activity is slowly moving north in the Powder River
basin and there have been some positive results in the Powder River basin, but it's still a little too early to know just the
fracability of the reservoir is probably the biggest risk that exists up in the Powder River basin. And as we and others
drill more we'll learn more about that. But we think overall it will work, but that's probably the biggest risk that sits out
there is just how much – when you have less chalk you have other material in the Niobrara that will allow it to frac to
the degree that it does in the DJ Basin.
<Q - Rehan Ahmed Rashid>: Got it. And a follow up if I may. Just the new ventures activity as you pick up acreage
all across the country. Is there a common geological theme that you are focusing on that you can share?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, I'd say a common theme is that we want to get in, not so much geologically but we want
to get in, we want to make money with these plays, is probably the most common theme, and so we get in early in these
plays, we get very reasonable lease terms, we get very low – we get low royalties, we get positions of scale so that if
we have success we can apply economies of scale and get the well costs down, and we can create a lot of values. But
our organization has the capability to evaluate a lot of different plays, so I don't think I'd generalize as much on the
geology as that we're focused on making money.
<Q - Rehan Ahmed Rashid>: Okay. Thank you.
Vincent W. White
Okay. It's the top of the hour. We'd like to thank everybody for participating in today's call and remind you that the
Investor Relations staff will be around for the remainder of the day for any follow up, or for those that we didn't have a
