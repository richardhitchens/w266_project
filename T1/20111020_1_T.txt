Before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly call your attention to Slide 4, which provides a financial summary.
Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61, a 13% increase over last year's earnings per share, excluding one-time
gains and up 3.5% year-to-date. This includes pressure from storm and T-Mobile transaction-related expenses in the
third quarter. Our consolidated revenue was stable and consolidated operating margin was up 260 basis points
year-over-year and stable sequentially, thanks to our best Wireless Service margins in six quarters and continued
strength in Wireline business.
Cash flow was superb. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $10.4 billion and free cash flow was $5.1
billion, which brings us to $12.4 billion for the year. That's even with the increased investment in capital expenditures
that we told you about last quarter.
With that quick overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?
John J. Stephens
Thanks, Brooks, and good morning to everyone on the call.
Before I cover results, let me provide a quick comment on our planned T-Mobile merger. The FCC review is
continuing and on the DoJ front we're hopeful that we can reach a solution. We have a trial date in less than four
months. The benefits of the combination are both significant and unchanged and our expectation continues to be that
we will reach a successful conclusion.
Now let me turn to results and comment on the quarter overall. The highlights are on Slide 5. We are very pleased with
what we've accomplished in the third quarter and year-to-date and we continue to see impressive strength in all our
growth engines. Mobile Broadband leads the way. Ralph will give you more details in a moment, but we had a great
quarter. Sales were strong across the board, with gains in every subscriber category. Smartphone sales were robust,
even in a quarter where you might expect sales to slow.
Branded computing devices were also strong and we turned in impressive Service margin results with our best
performance in six quarters. There also is good news from our Wireline business, where, for the first time in three
years, we posted sequential growth in total and business revenues. IP Data continues to be the driver for business and in
Wireline Consumer, where we continue to see positive results.
The thing I'm most encouraged by is that, in addition to solid earnings, we delivered excellent free cash flow. In fact,
we had our strongest free cash flow in two years. That comes even with making significant CapEx investments. So
you're seeing solid execution in every area of the business, which puts us in a great position heading into the fourth
quarter.
With that as background, let's take a look at detailed results, starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 6. Third
quarter consolidated revenues were stable sequentially and year-over-year, but when you look at our results
year-to-date, we've seen revenues increase. Our growth drivers continued to be strong: excellent Mobile Broadband
growth, solid U-verse gains and improved business trends. This was partially offset in the third quarter by declines in
voice and directory.
We also had an iPhone launch last year, which provided a lift to 2010 third quarter equipment revenues. Of course, we
didn't see this in third quarter revenues this year. So when you factor out equipment revenue, consolidated Service
revenues actually grew 0.4% versus a year ago.
Our overall revenue mix has continued its transformation. Year-to-date, 75% of our revenues come from Wireless and
Wireline Data and Managed Services. That's up from 72% a year ago and 66% just two years ago. Revenues from these
areas were up 7% year-to-date, so they're growing at a very good clip. We expect this mix shift to continue and it's one
of the reasons we have such a positive view of our business.
With that, let me turn it over to Ralph de la Vega, who will provide an update on Wireless results. Ralph?

Ralph de la Vega
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you again. As John mentioned, we are excited
about the incredible growth that we're seeing in our Mobile Broadband business.
As you can see on Slide 7, the third quarter continued the strong sales momentum that we have seen throughout the
year. Smartphone sales have been strong, 4.8 million this quarter and 16 million sold so far this year, exceeding even
our most optimistic forecast coming into the year. We're also seeing strong sales of data-only branded computing
devices coming close to our best quarter ever.
But you know what? We believe the best is yet to come. In the third quarter, we took steps to make the AT&T network
experience even better. First, we surpassed our end of year enhanced backhaul target and we see this as a major tipping
point for speeds on our network. Our enhanced backhaul now carries more than two-thirds of our data traffic. When
you combine this with the advanced technology of HSPA+ devices, such as the iPhone 4S, we're seeing some
incredible speeds across our 4G network.
We also launched our first LTE cities in the third quarter. By the end of the year, we expect to have LTE service in at
least 15 cities covering 70 million POPs and will be turning up Boston and Washington, D.C. next.
On the smartphone front, we have several new wins this quarter. We're off to a very fast start with the iPhone 4S. In
fact, it's been our most successful launch in history, activating more than 1 million iPhone 4S's through Tuesday. Only
AT&T's networks let the iPhone 4S download twice as fast and surf and talk at the same time, and customers just love
those features.
We also have some really great Android devices that we announced last week, including the Motorola ATRIX 2, and in
the fourth quarter, we plan to launch our first LTE handsets. Customers will love the state-of-the-art LTE smartphones
we plan to introduce. They will be fast. They'll have super-bright screens and long-lasting batteries.
These new devices, along with an expected seasonal push we get from the holiday, sets us up for a really strong fourth
quarter. In fact, we expect the fourth quarter be one of our strongest smartphone sales quarters ever.
So before we look too far ahead, let me drill down and cover third quarter Wireless results, and there's no better place
to start this quarter than in our net adds and churns. The details are on Slide 8. We hit a benchmark this quarter when
we passed 100 million subscribers, adding more than 2.1 million this quarter alone.
We also continued a trend that we have been seeing so far this year, with growth across the board in every customer
category. That includes postpaid net adds of 319,000 or about the same number we had in the second quarter.
Excluding the impacts of the Alltel and Centennial integration migrations, postpaid net adds were 384,000. Prepaid net
adds were 293,000, more than twice as many as we had in the second quarter, helped by a strong GoPhone sales, and
we had another solid reseller quarter, with 473,000 subscribers added. We also added 1 million connected devices in
the third quarter. This is a terrific business for us with lower ARPUs, with good margins and low churn, plus, most of
these devices have little or no subsidy. And speaking of churn, total churn improved both year-over-year and
sequentially. Postpaid churn was stable, and we saw iPhone churn decrease, a tremendous vote of confidence in a very
competitive environment.
It seems like a long time ago when the issue of how we would perform with iPhone competition was top of mind. Well,
I think and believe that our results speak for themselves. These results speak volumes about our Wireless business.
New customers are choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with us.
Now let's look at revenue and postpaid ARPU on Slide 9. Our track record of postpaid ARPU growth is unmatched in
the industry. This is our 11th consecutive quarter of growing postpaid ARPU, and we grow it from a much larger
ARPU base than anyone else. Last quarter, our postpaid ARPU was more than $7 higher than our closest competitor. In
the third quarter, our postpaid ARPU was almost $64 per subscriber. Postpaid ARPU for the third quarter grew 1.4%
year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect ARPU to increase to the 2% range in the fourth quarter, thanks to expected
positive impacts from higher smartphone activations in the quarter and from the pressure of the Alltel integration being

fully behind us.
Total Service Wireless revenues were $14.3 billion, up $600 million, or 4.3%, from the year earlier. This is driven by
subscriber gains and strong adoption of data plans, which was offset somewhat by the lack of an iPhone refresh in the
quarter. And we continue to bring in more subscribers onto our network with tiered data plans. 18 million, or nearly
half of our smartphone subscribers, are on tiered plans, with most choosing the higher-priced data plan.
Our lower-priced plan continues to be a good entry point for many subscribers, and now that we offer a free iPhone
with a two-year contract for the first time ever, the iPhone 3GS, we expect to broaden the smartphone base even more.
You can also see the benefits of Mobile Broadband sales in our Wireless Data results, which are on Slide 10. Data
revenues were $5.6 billion, up more than $850 million from the third quarter a year ago. Data revenues are now a $22
billion annualized revenue stream for us, growing at 18% year-over-year. Compare that to just four years ago, when the
Mobile Broadband was just beginning to emerge. Back then, it was just a $7 billion annualized revenue stream, so we
have tripled that number in just four years. We've come a long way, yet we're still just getting started.
We also hit a significant smartphone milestone this quarter. Smartphone subscribers now make up make up more than
half of our postpaid subscriber base, 52.6% up from 39.1% a year ago. At the same time, smartphones continue to be
nearly two-thirds of our postpaid sales during the quarter, showing more opportunity for growth. ARPU for
smartphones continued to be strong, 1.9 times that of other devices, and customers tend to be sticking, with churn
below our average.
We also delivered another strong quarter for branded computer subscriber growth. This is a new growth area for us that
includes data-only connections, such as tablets, tethering and air cards, and as you can see, the results continue to
impress. We increased sales by 505,000 to reach 4.5 million. We are really excited about the opportunities here. There
are a lot of exciting new tablets and new data-driven products on the horizon, and we have the right business model, the
right products, and the right network to really grow this business.
Now let's take a look at Wireless margins. The details are on Slide 11. In addition to subscriber and top-line growth,
Wireless margins expanded this quarter. In fact, we had our best Wireless Service margin performance in six quarters.
This comes even with another strong smartphone sales quarter. Our third quarter Wireless Service EBITDA margin
was 43.7% and, when you factor in Alltel and storm pressures, margins would have been more than 44%.
I think it's worthwhile to take a moment and compare this quarter's results to the second quarter a year ago. That's the
last time we had a quarter before an iPhone refresh. What you see is interesting and promising. Our Service margins
this quarter were actually better and we sold almost 1 million more smartphones than we did the second quarter a year
ago. And I think this really speaks to our long-term goal of building a strong smartphone base, while working to
improve margins. It's important for us to keep our long-term strategy in mind as we plan for the fourth quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, we expect blockbuster smartphone sales in the fourth quarter. You've seen the early response to
the iPhone 4S and it's been tremendous. Plus, when you factor in a great line-up of other smartphones, new devices
from our LTE launch and traditionally strong holiday sales, you start to get an idea of the kind of quarter this is shaping
up to be. Obviously, this will impact margins in the fourth quarter but the benefits are clear, including lower churn,
higher ARPUs and strong data growth, and the opportunity to create long-term value is substantial.
That covers Wireless. Now I'd like to turn it back to John Stephens to discuss Wireline and consolidated results. John?
John J. Stephens
Thank you, Ralph. We always appreciate you being on the call, especially when you bring such great results.
Now let's take a look at our Wireline business, where we had our first sequential revenue growth in four years. Let's
begin with Wireline Consumer and U-verse. Slide 12 has that information. We believe we have the best video
experience in the business, but you don't have to take our word for it. J.D. Power has once again named U-verse highest
in overall customer satisfaction, and that's in every market that we serve where J.D. Power measures us. But I strongly

believe the best is yet to come. Our goal is to take the best video experience and make it even better.
Earlier this week, we announced several connected TV apps that will further integrate our TV and Wireless platforms,
and there are several other really great new features that are coming soon. As U-verse has transformed the viewer
experience, it has also transformed our consumer results. IP Data, that's U-verse plus other Consumer Broadband, now
represents an annualized revenue stream of almost $11 billion, growing over 19% year-over-year and making up more
than half of our Consumer revenues.
During the quarter, we added 176,000 U-verse subscribers to reach $3.6 billion in service. Our subscriber numbers
were impacted somewhat this quarter by a technology upgrade and storms in some of our U-verse service areas. This
caused us to pull back on some installations to handle those situations, but sales remain strong and we feel confident
that our subscriber net add levels will improve in the fourth quarter. We're also seeing Broadband and U-verse
Voice-over-IP attach rates remaining solid. More than three-quarters of U-verse subscribers have a Triple or Quad-Play
Bundle with us. ARPU for these customers is about $170, up 6% year-over-year and penetration continues to grow. We
now have 25% penetration in areas marketed to for 36 months or more and we believe there's a lot of room for growth.
U-verse high-speed data also had another great quarter, adding more than 500,000 subscribers. Our U-verse Broadband
net adds were more than twice our TV additions, with many of these subscribers buying our newer and faster IP DSL
Broadband service.
Now let me provide a quick update on improving trends we are seeing with our Wireline business customers, which
you can see on Slide 13. Thanks to robust growth in our strategic business services, we had the first sequential growth
in our Wireline business revenue in three years. That's sequential growth for the first time in our Wireline business
revenue in three years. And what makes this even more impressive is that this growth is occurring while we're still
seeing pressure from the weak economy, slow employment and the transformation of our business to next-generation
IP products. So while business continues to work their way through the economic downturn, they are still investing in
services that help drive productivity and efficiency.
Business service revenues were down 2.2% year-over-year on a reported basis and 1.7% when you adjust for last year's
sale of assets in Japan. But when you look at sequential results, revenues were actually increasing. Much of this success
is attributable to continued strong growth of our strategic business services, revenues from products such as Ethernet,
VPNs and application services, which is an almost $5.8 billion annualized revenue stream and growing at 19.3% in the
third quarter, and 19.1% year-to-date. So we're not only growing the revenue, but continuing to grow it at a slightly
larger rate.
We are seeing data growth across a variety of industries and customers, both large and small. Global IP data and
integration services are growing at more than 10%. Wholesale had its second sequential quarter of revenue growth and
we had our first quarter of Broadband growth in two years in small business. Our wireless bundles are also increasing.
These are very encouraging signs and we plan to build on the success as we go forward.
Now let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 14. We said in January that we
expected to deliver stable to improved consolidated margins this year, with Wireless margin expansion and a
disciplined focus on cost initiatives. Through the third quarter, I think it's fair to say we're delivering. Our consolidated
operating margin was 19.8%. That's up 260 basis points versus the third quarter a year ago and up sequentially. And
when you adjust for the storms, the technology upgrades and the Alltel costs, we would've had margins of over 20%.
Our reported Wireline operating margin was 12.1% in the third quarter, down both sequentially and year-over-year.
While we remain focused on cost initiatives, our results weren't pressured from declines in voice revenues, storm
expenses, technology upgrades. As we mentioned earlier, if you take those costs into account, our margins were in the
mid-12% range.
Our One AT&T initiatives are continuing to make progress. We continue to target cost efficiencies and simplify
product offerings to deliver best-in-class services while also achieving cost savings. These initiatives are going well
and help us sustain solid margins while also serving customers with a best-in-class operation.

Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flows. Our cash summary is on Slide 15.
Through the first nine months of the year, cash from operations totaled $27.2 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Capital
expenditures were $14.7 billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $12.4 billion, with our third quarter free cash
flow at its highest level in two years and up 7% for the year. And dividend payments totaled $7.6 billion.
In terms of uses of cash, net debt is down more than $8 billion over the past five quarters and our net debt-to-EBITDA
ratio is 1.41. Our balance sheet is solid, our debt metrics sound and we have more than $10 billion of cash on hand. Our
strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in our business, to retire debt and to continue to return substantial
value to shareholders.
Let me close with a quick recap on Slide 16. First, we are seeing great execution across the business, strong gains in all
our major growth drivers: Mobile Broadband, U-verse, strategic business services. Second, as Ralph said, Mobile
Broadband growth has been terrific and the fourth quarter is shaping up to be one of our best yet. Data revenue growth
is strong. Churn is down. Smartphone sales continue to grow. And maybe the biggest news this quarter is the first
sequential revenue growth from Business Wireline customers in three years.
Overall, these results produced another solid quarter for us, with double-digit adjusted earnings growth and strong free
cash flow, allowing us to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And as I mentioned earlier, we
continue to move ahead with our efforts on the T-Mobile transaction.
Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. I think we're ready for Q&A.
Brooks McCorcle
Great. John, I think we're ready to take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And first go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Ralph, good Wireless results, given all the headwinds out there.
Can you talk about at the LTE roll out? You've had it for a few weeks now. What are you seeing from that? And how
should we think about LTE over the next few quarters? To what extent are you going to be able to sort of drive
incremental revenues, incremental ARPU from this app, as well as driving better efficiency gains from your sort of
experience so far? I know you've made some comments about your upcoming smartphones and how they would have
improved battery performance and so forth. So some color around those issues would be great. Thank you.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Yeah, thank you, Simon. I am thrilled about what we're seeing with the LTE launch. I have
been a part of many network and device transformations and this technology, quite frankly, is the best I have ever seen
in my career. The network technology is fantastic. The devices are fast. They are thin. They have great battery life. It's
the first time that I think a network transition is going to be a home run right off the bat. As we launched 3G, it took us
about six months to a year to really get some really, really cool handsets. This is happening right now with our launch.
So I think we've timed it perfectly. And when you complement what we're doing with HSPA+, I couldn't be more
happy. What I see happening with LTE and data, Simon, is just a huge growth opportunity.
We mentioned today, that our smartphones now make up 52% of our postpaid base. But I think the way we need to
think about smartphones in the future is the smartphone is going to equal the phone in the future. It will be 100% in the
next two or three years. These devices are so good and the costs are coming down so much that I think in the future you
could look at close to 100% penetration, not two-thirds like we're selling today, huge opportunity in smartphones.

And then you add on top of that these new devices like tablets, and MiFis and e-readers and telematics and the growth
opportunity is off the charts on this. And then you add to that the cloud, the fact that all these devices in the future are
going to want connectivity to the cloud, which means they need to have great bandwidth, great data capability and this
is not just the demand that we're seeing in this country, but all around the world. And so our business enterprise can go
and pitch products to them that are based on the worldwide standard today of HSPA and LTE in the future.
So I see huge growth opportunities as more smartphones penetrate our base, huge opportunity with tablets and a huge
opportunity to provide a worldwide capability on a standard technology platform that is probably the best the world
has. And the great thing about doing all of that is that we're doing it with a technology, LTE, that provides a reduced
cost per megabyte. That is, we can produce a megabyte a lot cheaper on LTE, and it's also more spectrally efficient, so
lower cost, lower spectrum requirements and great revenue potential. I'm very bullish on what we're seeing in data and
I think we've only seen the tip of the iceberg because customers love the devices that are coming out and they love
using high-speed data.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, thanks. Good morning, guys. The – I thought the Wireless quarter was strong. I think
the one surprise was the deceleration you saw in the postpaid ARPU. Maybe either for John or for Ralph, are there any
sort of incremental things you could call out with that 1.4% number that maybe fallout? Or is it just a function of
people waiting for the new iPhone and that reversing in the fourth quarter that drives the reacceleration?
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Yeah, John, this is Ralph. While there are several puts and takes, I think the primary driver of
ARPU in the third quarter was slower smartphone growth and they're very closely correlated. And so we expect that as
smartphone growth continues in the fourth quarter, the third quarter was slower than normal because we didn't have an
iPhone refresh in the third quarter, but the fourth quarter is going to be unbelievable. And so we expect to probably
have the best fourth quarter smartphone sales we've ever had. And so we expect that growth to pick up and we expect
ARPU to pick up just as well. We're very confident of that. That's why we commented that we think hitting 2% is what
we expect to see in the fourth quarter, which is right in line with what we have been seeing.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Next, we go to Craig Moffett with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Hi. Good morning. Given the decline in interest rates and sort of tepid returns in the
market, John, can you just comment on what you expect in terms of cash contributions to the pension at the end of this
year and then a related issue on the reversal of stimulus or cash taxes?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure, Craig. Let me tell you first of all, with regard to the pension funding issue, there is
some processes that we have to go – that every company has to go through between now and the end of the year, not
only seeing how our investment results and discount rates and so forth change and results are come out at the end of the
year, but also to make some decisions on funding elections that are available to companies today. We'll make those
decisions at the end of the year and make our determinations on funding at that time. I will tell you, with that being
said, we commonly follow and review this process and in all our business plans and processes going forward, we have
assumptions for pension funding and believe that we can handle those in normal course of our business within the
normal course of cash flows that we are now generating.

And quite frankly, they're also tax deductible, so while the funding dollar's going in at 100%, we get the tax benefits
that come back at about $0.40 on the dollar. So that's the issue with the money. We'll have more knowledge about that
as the results come in for the plans and as we make our elections on funding.
Second piece on cash taxes, certainly, the bonus depreciation rules have provided us some benefit this year, as tax
planning has provided our company benefits for a number of years. This quarter is a great example because in
comparing year-over-year results when we show a 13% growth in earnings per share, that's after taking out a significant
tax gain out of last year's results.
So my point being, though, is as with the bonus depreciation rules that provide us benefits, we continue to plan for that.
That payback period is a couple of years out for us and we expect to have other opportunities to offset some, if not all,
of that cash pressure.

Our next question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks. Let's switch over to the Wireline a little bit. Can you talk about how we should
think about margins going forward and what you expect for the Consumer business? In terms of promotions around
Broadband and DSL, I assume that we had some techs that were allocated to different areas in the third quarter. How
should we look at that going forward? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: First of all, on the margins, on a – if – I like to look at the Wireline margins from an
operating income perspective and from – and an EBITDA perspective. But if you look at this quarter, we came in
around 32% for our EBITDA margins. If you adjust for the storms and the technology upgrade costs, then we came in
around 12.5%. If you do those same adjustments on an operating income basis, I think on a full-year basis, we're
probably in the 10 to 20 basis points lagging on an operating income basis the last year's operating income margins for
Wireline. So we're hopeful that we can make that up in the fourth quarter. We'll see if we can or not but we're hopeful
about that.
So we continue to believe that we have an opportunity to sustain margins at this level or even slightly better than we've
done in this quarter and we're working hard to do that. It is a challenging endeavor, specifically when we're, as you well
know, transforming the business from high-margin legacy products to these next-generation U-verse, IP and other
services.
With regard to our DSL, the most encouraging piece of the DSL story, and while our net adds for the quarter were
about in the 5,000 range, the most encouraging piece of it was the fact that we had 500,000 high-speed
U-verse/IP-DSLAM net adds. So we were able to convert a huge piece of our legacy DSL base into
U-verse/IP-DSLAM and we saw gains in small business with that IP-DSLAM product for the first time. We'll continue
to focus on transforming those DSL lines into high-speed. We get great speeds, great service to our customers, good
ARPUs.
On those areas where we don't have U-verse, I think our plans have been very fairly clear. We expect to have an LTE
rollout to 97% of the country and, as Ralph talked about, we're getting great results where we have it, so we believe
that's going to be able to provide a wireless solution at a high-speed, good quality, good cost on a profitable basis for
us. That's the long-term solution to the non-U-verse areas.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: And, Phil, in terms of your question about promotions, in the third quarter, we based our
promotions on a market-by-market basis only where we had installation capacity. And so we expect that some of those
markets will be opened up in the fourth quarter. Now that we've got the technology transition behind us, you'll see a
broader number of promotions in the fourth quarter back to the way we were kind of in the second quarter and prior to

Our next question's from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two, one to follow-up on the
margin side, it looks like as we look at the third quarter out-performance in the margin, a significant portion of that
came from slower device sales, partly related to the iPhone. Can you talk about your expectations for getting to a
mid-40s margin while having a more normalized rate of device refresh? Given that as time goes on and more people
have smartphones, they'll replace those devices with smartphones. Second quick question was just to get your initial
expectations out of the pending FCC proceeding to reform intercarrier comp in USF where the vote is scheduled to
come up in, I guess, a little over a week. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Mike. Let me take a shot at the margins. I understand your comment about handset
sales impacting margins and they clearly do, and they clearly will in the fourth quarter. But with that being said, I think
Ralph covered it, where our margins for the quarter on a reported a basis of 43.7% when you adjust for the merger
costs, close to 44%. That included almost 5 million smartphone sales. And when you compare it to the prior quarter
before an iPhone launch, our margins are not only 60 basis points higher, but we have almost 1 million more
smartphone sales.
And so our point is that, while someone may jump to the conclusion that it's a handset-driven, and certainly the
handsets have an impact, the reality of it is there was a lot of good hard work by the entire management team on all
fronts to generate these great margins. It wasn't just a differential on handsets because I sold 900,000 more handsets
this quarter than I did in the last pre-iPhone launch. That's the first point and, I don't know, Ralph, did I miss anything
with that?
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: I think you did a good job.
<A - John J. Stephens>: The last thing, Mike, with regard to the FCC, the intercarrier comp process is important and
the issue is important to us. We've continued to participate and provide our input to it. If you – I think you're aware
we're a net payer in that environment, so some movement of those costs to more of an economic base could have a
positive impact on us. So we're supportive of the efforts, trying to participate in a constructive way for the entire
industry and we look forward to seeing what the Commission comes out with and, as you know, the Devil is always in
the details, so we're going to really be careful to make sure we do a good analysis of it. But generally speaking, we're
very positive towards the idea of getting a refresh of those rules based on current economic conditions.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks very much.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.

Our next question is from Michael McCormack with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great. Thanks, guys. Ralph, can you just give us maybe a little more detail on expectations
for this sort of 2% type level in ARPU growth in 4Q? Just thinking about – thinking about maybe more

non-smartphone to smartphone or iPhone upgrades, a change in the upgrade versus new customer ratio, maybe some
color around the Alltel impact that's going away in 4Q and then on the iPhone 4S, whether or not we should be thinking
about that more as a front-end loading versus more of a holiday, which has been the case, I think, historically. And then
lastly, just more detail around the U-verse technology upgrade, was that also including IP-DSLAM or was there
something else involved there? Thanks.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Okay. Mike, concerning the 2% in the fourth quarter, what we typically see when we have a
strong smartphone growth quarter is a lot of customers who are on feature phones and what we call quick-messaging
devices, step up to the smartphone category and that's what we expect is going to happen in greater numbers in the
fourth quarter. Third quarter was simply slowed because we didn't have an iPhone launch in the third quarter like we
did a year ago, but we think that's going to dramatically change and get us back in the 2% range.
I also mentioned in my notes that we have another device that I think is going to dramatically change those people that
are on smartphones and quick-messaging devices, the 3GS, which is free with a two-year contract. We've seen a
tremendous demand for that device, even though it's a generation old, and actually, we're getting more new subscribers
coming on the 3GS, on the average, than other devices, so we're also out of inventory sold out on that device. And so
I'm very, very optimistic on what the fourth quarter is going to look like in terms of smartphone growth and that's what
typically drives ARPU growth, Mike, so we feel very, very confident. The Alltel impact was in the range of about 23
basis points, Mike.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Okay.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: But the majority of it was driven through smartphone growth and we are very confident that's
going to pick up in the fourth quarter.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Technology upgrade.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Okay. The other question on the technology upgrade, typically, when we provide new
upgrades to U-verse, we required a few more dispatchers, so we planned for that this time. We reduced promotions so
that we could provide good service intervals to customers when they reported any issues with the transition. It worked
extremely well. That work is behind us and now we'll go back to the regular mode of business in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Ralph, the technology upgrade, though, is that just getting higher speeds as a competitive
response to DOCSIS 3.0 launches or something else?
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: No, it's more feature related. A whole slew of new features and you're going to see that, that
was the basic upgrade platform. You're going to see us now roll out new features in the next two or three months of
how to connect your smartphone to your U-verse TV, connect your iPad, watch complementary content, all kinds of
new connectivity options that are going to become available now that the platform has been upgraded.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great. Thanks, guys.

Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, just to start, could you just revisit kind of
the CapEx outlook that you kind of see for 4Q? Obviously, we've had a number of companies that are suggesting that
things are slowing down quickly at AT&T. If you could kind of just – but yet year-to-date spend seems to be pretty
healthy. So I just wanted to kind of see if you could give us a peek into the rest of the year for the CapEx plans.

And then second, if I could, Ralph, just take another kind of crack at this topic, you guys are talking about half the
smartphone base on tiered plans, which means that half the smartphones are still paying you kind of $30 a month. And
as those guys upgrade their phones and as their lifecycle evolves, they'll probably move down the curve. And you've
already gotten more than half your base on a smartphone, so the next 47% of your base is going to be taking cheaper
smartphones and maybe cheaper plans and maybe not taking a smartphone at all if they can afford it. So as you look
down the track with this pressure on the existing smartphone base to lower ARPUs to the existing tiers and the next
half of the smartphone base being the lower tiered customers, are you still optimistic that the ARPU can grow in the
face of those forces? Thanks a lot.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Hey, David, let me break the questions between Ralph and I and I'll take the CapEx question
first. I think our guidance remains unchanged. We're in that mid-$20 billion range. I think we're just under $15 billion
year-to-date at $14.8 billion or so. So we're kind of on a run rate that's consistent with what our guidance is. That's the
first thing. The second thing is our free cash flows allow us to make this investment. I mean, our operating cash flows
are great and they're what's funding this. Third, we're going to continue to invest and, quite frankly, push for investment
in our LTE, in all of our successful growing products. So we'll continue to make that. And I expect our CapEx will run
in that $20 billion range. I don't expect it to be certainly any expectations of anything other than continuing and, quite
frankly, we'll ramp it up a little bit just to get to that mid-$20 billion range.
<Q - David W. Barden>: All right. Thanks, John. Great.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: In terms of the capability to grow ARPU, I think that, as I mentioned before, we're going to
see customers use more data, not less. I don't see a environment going into the future where customers are going to use
less data. These products are too good. There's an incredible amount of streaming content that's available. So we're
going to continue to see customer data usage increase. We have not seen a decline and I don't see it any way to decline.
That's why I feel so bullish about our position of having 50% of our base already on tiered plans and we plan to make
available more tiered options for customers in the future so they can enjoy the data services that they want. So I – what
I see is exactly the opposite of the scenario you suggested, is where everybody is actually using more data. I see it
across every product category we sell and the more handsets that we get into a customer's hands that are smartphones,
the more data that they use, not the less.
<A - John J. Stephens>: And, Ralph, to add to that, I mean, we continue to add to that tiered data plan group of
customers. It's over 18 million now and if you think about it, we built that 18 million base in not much more than a
year. And so we've got a lot of levers with that and it's working well. You've seen what our churn has been like in the
last year after implementing that and, quite frankly, I don't think you've noticed any harm, certainly, if not a benefit to
our churn levels. So we feel like we're really positioned for that growth and not only from a network capability and
quality of service, but also from an ability to capture the revenue.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Okay. That's helpful. If I could just ask one quick follow-up, Ralph, then from a usage
standpoint, what is overage from the tiered plans contributing to ARPU today?
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: I can't give you an exact number, but we do have overage from both plans so they're actually
small right now.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yes.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: I think that they're not significant overages, but, like I said before, we plan to make available
more options to customers that may need higher usage categories in the future so they can feel comfortable in stepping
up, but not feeling that they're having to pay an exorbitant amount. We want to encourage customers to use more and
incur a little more cost, if that's what they want to do, or stay with the plans that they have. But we're going to have lots
of data options.
The other thing that I feel so bullish about is what is happening in the tablet arena. I mean, it's very obvious to me that
this tablet revolution is going to continue. I don't see anything in the horizon that stops it. And I think customers are
going to want both some smartphones and a tablet, and they're going to see their content on the tablet in ways that's

going to make them use more and more data. So I think the future of computing – tablet computing is going to be very
good for our industry.

Next, we go to Jonathan Chaplin with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the Wireline margins a little bit. So, John, I'm sensing
a sort of a shift in the rhetoric and I just want make sure that I've got it correctly. I was under the impression that you
guys had made tremendous progress on costs in the Wireline business so that when we saw that ramp in revenue
growth in Wireline, we'd start to see a sort of meaningful margin expansion. And we've got the revenue growth this
quarter but the margin expansion didn't come through. And you attributed some of it to storms, some of it to just a
negative mix shift. I'm wondering if you can pull those two issues apart a little bit and – and just give us an update of
whether we should start to see margin expansion as revenues continue to grow in the Wireline business or whether this
mix shift is just bigger than expected. Thank you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Okay, Jonathan. I guess just real quickly, I do believe that the margins for the quarter were
impacted by the storms and other things. So I think that 12.5% and more of a 32% range for the EBITDA margin for
the Wireline is appropriate for this quarter. With that being said, I still believe that there is an opportunity to grow
revenues, as we're showing, and then to have that impact on margin.
Quite frankly, the distinction for this quarter is while we did grow revenues and I am thrilled about our total Wireline
and our Business Wireline revenues growing, the growth was not dramatic. I don't think anybody would have expected
it to be dramatic in this economic environment. And so it's going to take time to get more significant growth. And also,
we're still feeling the pressures of the legacy products, whether it be the legacy access lines or high-margin products
transitioning to lower margin things like U-verse, but I still think there's that opportunity. It's going to take some time.
Right now, we feel like we're doing a good job of managing those expenses, getting focused on them, and holding
margins in line with what were our expectations for this year. So I hope that's helpful, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Yeah.
Operator
Our next question is from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a couple on Wireless, just, sorry, one more on
ARPU, but I think a lot of the questions have focused on data, maybe I'll angle it towards voice. And if we can just talk
about the opportunities to sort of level out voice ARPU, certainly on the phone plans. We're still seeing deterioration. I
think that was probably the bigger surprise this quarter because Data ARPU was in line with expectations. Voice
ARPU was a little bit worse. What's going on there? Is that people still trading down minute bucket plans and maybe it
has a bit of a macro component? Is it still Family Plan penetration that's riding that curve? Maybe just give us a little bit
more granularity there and help us think about when that can level out because that's still 60% of the postpaid ARPU.
And then second, just on handset upgrade rates, you had 7% this quarter. That's the lowest rate we've seen in a while,
obviously contributed to very strong margins. Help us think through this. Is this tied more to changes in upgrade
policies which you guys made, which – you lengthened some of the windows or more tied to just lack of new handsets
and hence, we should expect this to move back to the 8% to 9% range? Thanks.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Jason, this is Ralph. Let me address both of those issues. In terms of the voice ARPU, what
we saw in the first quarter it wasn't a major impact. We had a smaller impact, as a result of us implementing the Mobile
to Any Mobile plans in the third quarter. We think that those migrations that happened in the third quarter will not

happen in the fourth quarter because those plans have already been implemented and are reflected in third quarter
results. But the biggest impact to the third quarter ARPU number was still data. It wasn't voice.
In terms of the upgrade, the changes in upgrade policy do not impact this year. They'll impact next year and what we
saw was just simply the fact that the iPhone refresh is taking place in the fourth quarter this year compared to the third
quarter last year. The big unknown is what happens when you have an iPhone refresh in the fourth quarter, which is the
busiest quarter of the year and this is the first time that happened. So we expect that it'll be a little higher than average
upgrade number in the fourth quarter, but it's hard to estimate because we've never seen this event before.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Brooks McCorcle>: John, we have time for one more question, please.
Operator
And that will be from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Thanks for getting me in. You guys had a pretty good prepaid quarter. Even if we adjust for
some of the prepaid tablets, it looks like you might have had over 100,000 net adds in your traditional products that we
haven't seen that in a very long time. You've actually been losing customers in that category for a while. So I was
hoping you could just give us a little bit of color on why we've seen such a swift turnaround in that segment of your
business?
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Yeah, of course, that's a very good observation. We launched a new $50 GoPhone plan. We
put in that plan also some handsets that are very attractive. They're low-cost, but they've been a huge hit in the
marketplace. So we've seen that business surge for us and I'm very pleased with what we've seen in the GoPhone and
we're just getting started. We have a very strong fourth quarter line-up so I think we're going to continue to do well
with GoPhone sales in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Yeah, that was going to be my follow-up, because seasonally, that's one of the best quarters of
the year. I mean, so should we expect that type of a seasonal improvement or do you think maybe it'll be a little less so
just because you got something really right in the third quarter?
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: I think they're going to be cumulative. I think the third quarter is a preview that I think we
have a good product that should actually play out stronger in the fourth quarter. It's always very competitive in the
fourth quarter in the prepaid market, but we have a great product. We have a great price and we think we're going to do
very well.
