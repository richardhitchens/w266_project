As noted on slide 1 of the presentation, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's
operations, and actual results may differ materially. So refer to our Form 10-K for 2009, Form 10-Q for the third
quarter, and our most recent press release for information on potential risks.
Also, this discussion may contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our press release
and on our website. This call is being record, and a replay will be available shortly following the completion of the call.
Christine Ieuter and I are always available to answer any additional questions you may have after this call ends. Now
I'll turn it over to Tom Wilson for his perspective on the quarter.
Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time to hear about Allstate and the progress we're making to deliver
value for shareholders.
I'm going to start with a quick overview of results for the quarter. Then Bob will go through each business unit and Don
will cover our investment performance, balance sheet, and capital positions. Then we'll open up for your questions.
In the third quarter, we were again successful in executing a strategy that creates shareholder value despite a weak
economy. So why don't we begin? Go to slide 2. In total we generated $367 million in net income on $7.9 billion of
revenue. That was an increase in net income of $146 million. That was primarily due to less realized capital losses this
quarter than in Q3 2009.
Operating income was 452 million or $0.83 per share, which was $86 million below the same quarter last year. And
that's the result of lower operating income from Allstate Protection, our Property-Liability segment. Property-Liability
had an underlying combined ratio of 89.2 for quarter, bringing the full year – or the nine months – up to 88.8. That's
squarely in the middle of our annual outlook of 88 to 90 that we provided in February. We did experience an increase
in frequency in the third quarter but remain comfortable with loss trends.
Growing Allstate Protection is critical to our success. While we were able to largely maintain revenues from prior-year
levels, we need to generate more unit growth. The standard auto policies in force to clients, from 17.8 million last year
to 17.5 million this year, as strong growth in new business in most of the country was offset by declines in several large
states where is we've taken action to improve profitability. These actions also had a negative impact on improving
customer loyalty in the quarter. Since our major competitors also had declines in customer loyalty this quarter, it was
really a missed opportunity for us to improve our relative position. Efforts to improve returns in homeowners and the
Encompass independent agency business also had a negative impact on growth. New business growth was the result of
several things. It was up 2.4%. Increased advertising, the successful addition of the Mayhem campaign to our
marketing programs, and targeted pricing actions to improve the auto competitive position.
Homeowners profitability remains a concern, though progress is being made as our rate actions work into the numbers.
Catastrophe losses this quarter were low relative to other third quarters, but we had no major hurricane losses. The
amount of non-model cat losses remained at high levels. We continue to see price and tightened underwriting standards
while we deploy better risk management tools in order to generate accessible returns.
Allstate Financial continues to strategically reposition its business while raising returns. Operating income of 108
million was below the last few quarters due to several positive one-time items earlier in the year. Premium deposit
volume was down as expected as we shift from spread-based businesses to mortality and morbidity products. Allstate
Financial did grow both the worksite and Allstate agency businesses, where premiums and deposits on underwritten
products were up 33% and 2% respectively compared to Q3 2009. Allstate Financial also completed its Focus to Win
cost reduction efforts.
Investments had another great quarter from a total return perspective as the portfolio continued to generate substantial
cash and a proven value. The net unrealized gain on the portfolio rose to $2.7 billion. This gain reflects lower interest
rates and improved valuations on structured securities. While lower interest rates do translate into higher valuations, it

puts pressure on operating income. We've continued to reduce our municipal bond and real estate holdings, which also
puts downward pressure on operating income. Don will cover the impact of that in a few minutes. The net results of
this operating performance was to raise book value per share to $35.48. That's up 6.7% over the last three months and
is almost 10% higher than a year ago.
And now let's have Bob go through the results in greater detail.
Robert Block, Investor Relations
Turning to slide 3.
Here are the Property-Liability premium and underwriting income results. In the third quarter, we produced a net
premium written of almost 6.8 billion, which was a slight decline from Q3 2009. Total net written premium for the
Allstate brand increased slightly but was more than offset by a decline in our Encompass brand. Within the Allstate
brand, our standard auto net written premium fell by 0.5% after small increases in the first two quarters of the year.
Increases in new issued applications of 2.5% and average premium of 1.4%, both compared to prior year's quarter,
were more than offset by a decline in retention resulting in the premium shortfall. Total units also fell 0.3%
sequentially and 1.7% from third quarter 2009.
Homeowner net written premium increased quarter over quarter by 2.4%. Increases in average premium, driven by
approved rate increases and retention, were more than enough to offset the 4% decline in total units. The recorded
combined ratio for the third quarter was 95.9%, 1.2 points higher than third quarter 2009. The underlying combined
ratio, which excludes the effects of catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve reestimates was 89.2, right in the middle
of our annual outlook range we provided at the start of the year.
Catastrophe losses for the quarter were $386 million on a recorded basis. This result was made up of 371 million of
current-quarter losses in 29 events, 57 million of additional losses from events occurring earlier in the year, primarily
second quarter hailstorms, and a $42 million reduction of prior-year reserves. While the catastrophe loss was much less
than the first two quarters, it was still relatively high for a third quarter given the absence of a major hurricane loss.
A few words on prior-year reserve reestimates. Besides the $42 million reduction in catastrophe loss reestimates, the
third quarter included a $22 million increase for discontinued lines, primarily for environmental reserves, as we
completed our annual reserve study for the discontinued lines and coverages. It also includes a $70 million litigation
accrual charged to homeowners.
On slide 4 we provide a look at auto loss cost trends, which in total remain within our expectations. On the left-hand
side of the exhibit, we provide the quarterly frequency results for bodily injury and property damage. In both cases, the
level of frequency is elevated relative to the previous five years. In the upper right-hand corner, we display the paid
severity change over time. Here the results remain very good with only slight increases in the quarter. When these
results are combined with those of the remaining coverages in auto, the result is a combined ratio that is fairly flat for
the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009.
On slide 5, we show similar loss information for homeowners. On the top half of the exhibit, you can see the frequency
excluding catastrophe losses was 2.3% less than third quarter 2009 results. The paid severity, excluding catastrophe
losses, increased 2.1% compared to the third quarter of 2009. With the increase in average earned premium from rate
increases working into the results, the underlying loss ratio, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve
reestimates, improved again this quarter. We continue to execute on our profit improvement actions designed to get
homeowners to an acceptable level of profitability.
Shifting to Allstate Financial, slide 6 displays the top and bottom line results for the last two years by quarter. The
trends continue to reflect positive momentum in our efforts to produce higher returns, shift our focus to underwritten
products versus spread-based products, and serve our customers through Allstate agencies and the Allstate Workplace
Division. Premium and deposits on underwritten products increased 8.6% compared to the third quarter 2009, while
annuities declined, consistent with our strategic direction.

Operating income for the quarter was 108 million or 13 million more than the third quarter of 2009. I would describe
this quarter's results as relatively clean in terms of one-off items. When we adjust the first two quarters of 2010 for
these kinds of items, the operating income drops back to a range of 110 to 115 million for those quarters. The benefit
spread was slightly lower due to higher but typical immediate annuity benefits this quarter compared to the third
quarter of 2009, which had favorable results for that product. The investment spread increased to $127 million,
reflecting decreased interest credited to contract holder funds, partly offset by lower net investment income. Operating
costs were slightly elevated this quarter due to higher marketing costs and certain acquisition-related expenses
associated with growth in the Workplace Division premium.
The expense reduction actions associated with the Focus to Win program initiated in 2009 are now substantially
complete, and the program has met our target. For the quarter, Allstate Financial recorded net income of $85 million
versus a net loss of $38 million last year. Realized capital losses were significantly lower this quarter compared to the
third quarter of 2009.
At this point I'll turn it over to Don.
Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Bob. I'm going to cover our investment performance for the quarter and the status of our capital position at the
end of September.
As you can see on slide 7, the value of our investment portfolio increased to $102.2 billion in the third quarter, largely
reflecting the benefit of the decline in interest rates during the quarter. We continued to be proactive in risk
management activities, and again this quarter we reduced exposures in our municipal bond and commercial real estate
portfolios, while also protecting against an increasing rate environment. We reduced municipal bonds by $2.4 billion of
amortized cost in Q3. The reductions targeted specific sectors and higher-risk geographies. Commercial real estate
reductions totaled $484 million of amortized cost, and this was accomplished through a combination of maturities and
pre-payments, with some offset due to refinancing activity.
The total portfolio maintained a defensive position against interest rate increases. Reinvestment proceeds were placed
in shorter-duration instruments with derivatives being used to further manage the overall duration. That said, the
continuation of lower rates, in combination with our risk mitigation and duration management, continues to adversely
affect investment income.
On slide 8, you can see that net investment income fell to $1.0 billion, a 4.2% sequential drop, and a 7.3% decline from
Q3 2009. Property-Liability investment income dropped 8.4% sequentially and 12.9% from Q3 2009 on reinvestment
of the proceeds from our risk mitigation, rate management, and investing activities and lower-yielding and
shorter-duration securities, as well as the timing of equity dividends.
Allstate Financial investment income dropped 2.2% sequentially and 5% from Q3 2009, primarily the result of a drop
in average portfolio balances. Our return optimization program included purchasing high-yield corporate and
asset-backed securities, which have only partially offset the significant decline in interest rates. We continue to focus
our investing activity to optimize both risk and return opportunities.
Net realized capital gains and losses, shown on the bottom of the slide, improved this quarter. We posted a pre-tax loss
of $144 million compared to a loss of $519 million in Q3 2009. Other than temporary impairments were $167 million
in the third quarter, less than half the amount experienced in Q3 2009. And they were concentrated primarily in the
RMBS and CMBS portfolios.
Trading activity and risk mitigation actions drove net realized capital gains from sales of $319 million in the quarter,
118 million more than last year's third quarter. Most of the gains came from the fixed income portfolio, in particular,
public-corporates, municipal bonds, and agency paper. Equities contributed about a third of the gain. The derivatives
loss for this quarter at 285 million was slightly better than the loss in Q2 2010 and 76 million better than Q3 2009.

We added additional breakout on this page to show our derivative experience by key risk. Our interest rate hedges
produced a loss of $181 million this quarter, 100 million less than Q2 2010 and 219 million less than last year. These
losses reflected the continued cost of protecting our portfolio from rising interest rates. Our equity hedges lost $115
million as equities rallied about the same as last year's Q3. All this detail can be found in our 10-Q filing.
On slide 9, you can see that our unrealized net capital gain position improved by $2.3 billion on a pre-tax basis from Q2
2010 and is $5 billion better than Q3 2009. After tax and DAC, we stand at $1.3 billion, $964 million better than Q2
2010. Virtually every asset class participated in this improvement, as we benefited this quarter from the decline in
interest rates and higher equity markets. The improvement in the portfolio valuation more than offset the cost of our
risk mitigation programs. While our net unrealized gain position is clearly a substantial improvement from levels over
the past two years in terms of our book value, the current low-rate environment that create this unrealized gain is also
the reason we've been actively working to reduce exposure to increases in rates.
Finally, on slide 10, we provide you with a look at our capital position on both a GAAP and STAT basis. Our overall
GAAP equity climbed to $19.3 billion in the third quarter, a little more than 15% increase since year-end. Our current
estimates of statutory surplus for Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company show stable to
increasing capital levels in these companies. During the third quarter, the holding company received a $400 million
dividend from AIC, bringing the total for the year to $600 million.
With that, I'll turn it back to Tom.
Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Before we move to your questions, let me summarize the quarter, really with six items. One was disappointing,
one was mixed, and four were, hey, we had strong performance.
Let me start with the disappointing. Our auto retention was down as we started managing profits in a couple of big
states. That offset the benefits from more marketing, and the result was that items in force in our standard auto business
did not grow this quarter. That's the disappointing part.
The mixed – homeowners is making progress, although we saw the high level of cats.
In the good category, our Property-Liability combined ratio was in the middle of the range that we gave to you in
February for both the quarter and the nine months. And this is – our auto combined ratio has been in the positive zone,
that's below 100, for over a decade. Investment results, we had great investment results, risk mitigation making a lot of
progress on that, and our return optimization, obviously we stayed in the right stuff, as we had a good increase in the
value of our portfolio. Allstate Financial's Focus to Win program is done, and it's got a balanced approach to raising
returns. And book value is up 7% for the quarter and 15% for the year.
So that's a summary of the quarter. Let's turn to your questions.
Robert Block, Investor Relations
Okay, Matt, do you want to start the question and answer session?

<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Couple questions. First, just with respect to the policies
in force and retention, could you give a little bit more color maybe on those states – if not specifically, maybe generally
– that are affecting the retention? And also just would continue to be curious how much of the PIF decline you're seeing
is also tied to – would also be a customer that potentially is leaving because of the homeowners underwriting actions?
The second question I had was just on the G&A. Was curious whether or not there was a pickup in ad spend just
because it's the fall, and college football is picking up and baseball playoffs, et cetera.
And then the last one quickly was just – there's obviously – it's in the press that Bank of America is potentially looking
to sell Balboa. You've been mentioned. I don't know if that's realistic or not, but be curious what the strategic rationale
would be for that given that it's predominantly property.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, thank you, Matt. Good morning.
And I'll take three of those, even though we're, I think, 50% over Bob's request. But I can deal with the last one easier,
and then I'll get Joe to take on the question of the states' retention, what's happening with homeowners both as we
improve profitability and as we seek to increase cross-line sales.
On the B of A Balboa, we obviously don't comment on acquisitions. And if we were to buy it, we would have a
strategic rationale for it. Given that property's not a high focus area for us in terms of growth right now, I wouldn't put
that at the top of anybody's list.
In terms of ads, we're doing quite well there. Not only has it just been fall football season, we've increased our spend to
be more competitive as Geico and Progressive increase their spend.
And Joe, do you want to take the retention and growth?
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Yeah. From a retention and growth perspective, Matt, we've talked a couple of times in the
last couple of quarters about some specific states where we've been targeting profitability focuses, and I think we give
you a little bit of an outline of it in the Q. But we've seen some issues in the states, we've pushed prices up a little bit.
Some underwriting actions. We see some of that rippling through new business in Florida and California. We see some
of that rippling through retention in California and a couple other states. It's driven, again, by trying to get our selection
mix from an underwriting perspective in the right spot and getting our pricing where we want it to be.
From a homeowners perspective, there is some impact but not a big impact on the homeowners actions that we're
taking. We've talked before about a preferred package discount that we've used from a pricing perspective that makes it
more attractive to have your auto and home with us, and that helps mitigate some of that issue.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: Well, I guess, just to follow – it sounded like even though we've talked about some of
the actions, that PIF, in your comments at least it sounded like maybe was a little soft relative to what you would had
hoped it would have been. So I guess if that – one, is that true? And if it is, I guess what types of accounts, or I guess –
where is this – is it just a general across-the-board issue where it maybe slipped a little bit more, or is there some more
specific kind of type of customer?
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: I'm trying to hone in on the part of the follow-up question. If you're reading that it's below
our expectation from comment this quarter, I'm not sure that's exactly where I'd say it is. We're seeing a little more of a
retention impact than we'd seen in prior quarters. And we're seeing consistent trends on new business with what we've
seen in the past. And it's not a huge change in the retention impact. It's a little bit.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Matt, let me just add one thing to that,
which is we believe in talking about our results in total. We'll be happy to give you the components of it to make sure
you know we understand and you can have a better understanding of it. On new business, while it's up 2%, there are
many states where it's up double digits, so we think our marketing programs are working, back to the ads program. It's
just, we give you the number in total.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: No, that's fair, and I guess I would also argue that margins are important, too. So.

Operator
Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel from Langen McAlenney. Your question, please.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Good morning. I guess if I could follow up the Balboa question. You're up to 3.5 billion of
cash at the holding company. Does acquisition and corporate development factor into where you would stand on
initiating a buyback program?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I don't know where this Balboa
drumbeat's coming from, but it wouldn't be us. Let me start with capital, Bob, because we all probably talk about it.
We obviously have been doing a good job of building capital, whether that's statutory capital or book value from a
GAAP basis. We feel good about that. As we've said, the first thing we use with capital is to make sure our business is
sound and stable and in a good position. And given the economy and investment markets over the last year and a half,
we've done everything to keep ourselves in the right position and fully capitalized.
Second, then, we obviously try to deploy that in growth of the business. The easiest place to do that would be to do it –
or the most opportune place would be do it by growing our business organically, and we'd love to do that. We've also
said if there are acquisitions that we think fit, we'll do those. You've seen what we've done over time on acquisitions.
We're not in the market all the time buying all kinds of stuff. We do try to buy stuff we think will grow us at the
Workplace business. It was number three when we bought; it's number two now, and we're liking its trend. So we try to
be smart about what we buy.
And obviously then we return it to the shareholders. We've talked before about our dividend policy, which I have my
board look at every quarter. We do that based on sort of a percentage of earnings. And I think you should expect us to
continue to set dividend policy based on the amount of money we make. And then if we have capital above that, then
we've always bought back stock. We've not announced a stock buyback program today. I'm not about to, because I'm
feeling we're in pretty good shape. But if you could look at our track record on returning capital to shareholders, it's
been great. So I think you should expect that same philosophy to apply going forward.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Okay, if could just follow up. Your STAT capital went up by I guess 600 million if we add
back the dividends, which was a decent bit more than your GAAP income this quarter. What were the key drivers of
the differential between STAT and GAAP?
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Are you talking about – which entity?
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: The insurance companies.
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Oh, the insurance company had an
improvement in the unrealized position as well.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Okay. And that drew the STAT capital on the unrealized?
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Remember, we pick up the
improvement in equity at AIC.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Keith Walsh from Citi. Your question, please.
<Q - Keith Walsh>: Hey, good morning everybody. I guess first for Joe, I saw the press release a few weeks back
about the Idaho service center and I just wanted to know if this is more indicative of maybe a more aggressive push into
direct marketing. Maybe you'd put a little color around that, why you're opening that up? And maybe just update us on
direct. And then I've got a follow-up.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me maybe talk first about the call
center. We obviously opened a call center in San Antonio; we opened one in Idaho just recently. That's in part because
not only do we do direct business, but we handle all kinds of the service-related work on behalf of our agencies,
because people want to be there 24-by-7.
And we've an opportunity; we could open those anywhere in the world. We've been seeking to opening them in the
United States at this point because we think it's just the right thing to do. When you look at our customers, they'd say
they will think higher of a company – or better of a company that puts jobs in the U.S., even if it costs a little more
money. Now, of course everybody wants a good price, so we have to make sure we continue to use the right kind of
labor around the world, which we've been very active in.
Joe, maybe you want to make a comment about the growth of direct and how it fits in.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Yeah, and I'll echo the same things. We use all our service center capabilities to service
multiple channels. So this is not purely related to direct. We are growing our direct business, are enthusiastic about
those prospects, and continue to do so. I think we gave you a little bit of information in the Q. As you can see, that
business was growing north of 15% for us in the quarter. And we feel good about it, and we'll continue to keep our
marketing and our operational capabilities lined up to facilitate doing that more so. We want to service customers in the
way they want to be serviced and meet their needs and the value propositions that resonate with them, and that will
continue to be a focus for us as long as it is for customers.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Keith, it's Tom Wilson. I think
sometimes – I'm going to underline and expand a little bit on something Joe said. The key thing is to look at the
customer segment and say, what is it that they want and make sure you're delivering. So there's a whole bunch of
customers who want a personal touch from somebody, want a relationship, and we obviously seek and do that quite
well with our agencies. There are other people who are more self-direct and want it through direct. So we try to deal
with customers as to how they want to be. A lot of times people get focused on distribution without focusing on the
customer. We think you got to focus on the customer first, then figure out what distribution works for them.
<Q - Keith Walsh>: Okay. And then, Tom, my second question, just more broadly. The inconsistency in the results is
clearly an outlier to your peers. Can you help us understand why that is, because I'm just having a hard time with that?
Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Maybe you could give me a little
clarification on "inconsistency."
<Q - Keith Walsh>: Well, inconsistency – you've got weather-related losses this quarter. I didn't see that out of TRV
or PGR. The PIF numbers are clearly up and down sequentially when we look at it. The overall earnings results just
pretty inconsistent across the board. We can go on and on offline if you want, but maybe we can start there.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, it sounds like you're frustrated,
and I'm sorry for that. But what I can tell you is that we give you a combined ratio for the year that's ex cats and
prior-year reserve releases, which of course are impossible to forecast, and we've been dead in the middle of that for as
long as we've been doing it. So I feel good about 89.2.
As it relates to catastrophe losses, when you are as broad as we are and across the country, you're subject to all those.
So some of the companies you mentioned have had a more narrower focus in terms of where their homeowners
business is.

Our next question is from Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America. Your question, please.
<Q - Alison Jacobowitz>: Hi, thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the frequency in auto this
quarter? It sequentially seems to spike up a little bit, was 7% in a couple areas. And also if it's possible, could you give
us some color on the growth? I know that several states are holding you back. Can you clarify a little bit as best you can
where you are in that process or where you think you are and when that pressure might start to ease up?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Joe, why don't you take both of those?
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Relative to the frequency, Alison, we are seeing a bit of an uptick in frequency. We
continue to look at it. It's generally spread across a broad set of geographies, across a broad set of customer vintages, if
you will, the tenure that we have with customers, and across most ways that we can look at it. We are seeing a little bit
of that spike be an increase in claims that are closed without payments, which might be a little bit of a tail impact on
some of what we've seen in prior periods. We made a big shift in our claims system over the past couple years, which is
done basically, but it does impact some of the prior-period claim practices. So a little bit of that frequency we think
might be some noise out of that, but even if you take the noise out, there is a bit of an uptick. We've seen increases in
gas purchases and miles driven, which may be some correlation to that. I'm not sure we're at a point where we'd declare
it a long-term trend, but we're watching it.
Relative to the growth question, we don't give forward-looking growth guidance or production guidance. What I will
tell you is that we're focused on, over the long term, growing our business. We are focused on preserving a strong track
record of having very powerful margins. And we'll keep those two items in mind as we march forward. And I think the
comments we've given you is that we've got new business up double digit in states other than California and Florida,
where we've seen new business decline year over year. We focused on some specific profitability actions in those
geographies. And that will work its way through the system, at least the new business relativity year over year, we've
been talking about this for three quarters so you don't have a year-over-year problem in another quarter or quarter and a
half. That's just algebra.
But in terms of where we project it going forward, I'm going to avoid doing that.
<Q - Alison Jacobowitz>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: Great, and good morning. I apologize if I missed this, but the little litigation charge that was in
home insurance, what was that? And maybe you could talk about the A&E charge as well?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Paul, this is Tom. I'll give you a quick
uptake on the lawsuit, and Don, maybe you want to take A&E.
As it relates to the lawsuit, it was a potential class-action suit filed in a state court. You'll remember the they changed
the – there's Class Action Fairness Act, which removed class actions from state courts to federal courts because we
know that federal courts deal with them in a more balanced approach. This is one of the ones we had left that was from
a state court. It was down in Texarkana, Arkansas. It was related to the way in which we calculate the amount paid to
fix homeowners claims. A number of other carriers that were before us down in that court had settled their amounts at
what we think are amounts higher than that. This actually would cover 48 states because we've won this issue in many
other states. It's just in this particular state court we felt it was better to settle and move on.

<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And on the A&E, Paul, we do an annual
analysis of those reserves, and we – as in previous years we did it this year – and added about $18 million.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: Any reason for that?
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No particular reason, no. No specific reason.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I mean, it's not like we got some big
claim out there or something we're worried about. It's just – as you remember, in the environmental thing, I think about
65, 70% of it's incurred but not reported.
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So of the amount we have up for
environmental, we don't actually have specific claims. But you look at the trends, what comes in, what you have to pay
out, and you make changes. And in this day and age, you put up when you see it.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: I like to – if you could focus on the Encompass brand and the efforts that – a little bit more on
the efforts you are trying to make to make that more profitable and maybe talk a little bit about sort of the long-term
viability of that operation. It has been, I believe, certainly not less profitable than the core business for as long as I can
remember.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Paul, let me have Joe take that,
as to where it is today. But let me just say, from a standpoint – you remember, we bought that business back in 1999.
We've looked at it every which way to Sunday, and we've had a food return on that business because we bought it so
cheap.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: Cheap is good.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: So when we look at it, Paul, I would encourage you to think about the Encompass business
right now as having sort of two parts in it. There's a core target that has long been its target of a bundled auto and home
targeting sort of a mass affluent customer base below the real high end that you see in some high-value homeowners
players. And we do well in that product. It's positioned well inside agencies. They like the product. They like its
performance. We fit into a well-defined niche there, and broadly are happy with the performance. On any given day,
any given quarter, we might want it to be a little bit better, whether it's growth or profitability.
Then there's a second part of the business. A couple of years ago, we tried to expand our targeting to produce more auto
business through that brand. We ended up adding groups of agencies that were more specialists in auto, broadened the
product capability to target that monoline auto, and found that our approach both through a combination of distribution
and a combination of how we priced and structured the product and managed the underwriting wasn't effective in that
marketplace. And it hurt us from a profitability perspective.
What you're seeing right now running through the numbers is the impact of unwinding that latter part of the book of
business. Now, as we do that, it's had a little bit of a ripple-over effect into the core. So that's getting splashed with the
cleanup, if you will. As we move through that, we will continue and are continuing to focus on the core niche where
Encompass has been effective. I'm very confident that we can be effective in that space, grow that business, make
reasonable returns on it and that it's something that's desired by independent agents as distributor and has a good
customer proposition. We just have to finish the cleanup of that auto specialist strategy.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: Is this split 50/50, or how big is one versus the other?
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: It got as big at one point as close to 50/50. I'm going to decline to give you the specifics on
exactly where it is right now.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from Cliff Gallant from KBW. Your question, please.
<Q - Clifford Gallant>: Good morning. Two questions. One, the ad spending, the elevated level we saw in the quarter,
should we expect that going forward? And then two, during the quarter, State Farm had an announcement regarding
drywall lawsuits, and it looked like they were trying to move toward some kind of settlement. And I was wondering if
you have any update on that issue.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Cliff. In terms of the ad
spend, you've seen us increase it this quarter because we felt it was worthwhile to take the risk and see what kind of
growth we get out of it. As long as we keep getting growth out of it, we'll keep doing it. When we think it's not
economic, then we won't do it.
As it relates to drywall, we don't really have anything to talk about other than what we said publicly before, which is
we don't think there's exposure – if you're talking about Chinese drywall, we don't think there's exposure. We think
that's a product liability issue, not a homeowner issue.
<Q - Clifford Gallant>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Meyer Shields from Stifel Nicolaus. Your question, please.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Thanks. I want to drill down a little bit into a comment that Joe made about wanting long-term
growth in Allstate brand. I know – as we look back about a year, year plus – that capital was really constrained, and I
think that translated into a focus on maximizing current underwriting profits, probably at the expense of growth. If I
understand you correctly, is that concern now abating so that you can focus more currently on growth?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It's really a capital question, Meyer.
Let me take it – which is if you have follow-up as to what Joe is doing, we should go there as well.
But as it relates to capital, you're correct in the assumption that we – I don't know that we felt capital was constrained.
Everyone's got their own word around that. But we weren't comfortable with the economic or investment outlook,
really starting in 2008. So at that point, we chose to protect margins at the expense of growth. You are seeing the
consequences of that both in '09 and '10 as we try to work through that because this has long trends in it. You can't sort
of – because so much of our business is renewal, it's hard to kind of turn that thing on a dime. But you are correct in
sort of what you see today.
Do you have anything more specific on the growth that you want Joe to answer?
<Q - Meyer Shields>: I think so. In the past you've given ratios of competitor rate increases to decreases in auto, and
how you feel that's playing out. And I'm wondering whether that's still trending positively.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Can you expand on that a little bit? Because I'm trying to make sure I understand how
you're asking the question.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: I guess what I'm wondering is whether your expectation for the next, I don't know, short term,
call it 12 months, is that your competitive profile will improve due to other companies' rate increases.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: That becomes a hard one for us to sit here in this environment and forecast for you, both
what we're going to do from a pricing perspective and what other folks are going to do from a pricing perspective. I'd
love it if they'd forecast it, because we'd find that to be useful, but from a competitive perspective, I think that's a
conversation that's going to be tough for us to have here.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your question, please.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Yeah, good morning. I guess just quickly here, the underwriting expenses are, in the
property-casualty area, up about 10% in the quarter, up 12% last quarter. Is that the ad spend coming through, or was
there anything else running through there?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Pension cost, too.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Pension cost, okay. How much is that pension cost addition?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't think we disclose it, but if you
want to follow up with Bob, I'm sure he'd be happy to give it.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Okay. Great. And then just quickly, if I take a look at average written premium per policy, the
year-over-year growth kind of decelerated in the quarter. Is that just a function of just getting more competitive out
there from a rate perspective at Allstate? Is there something else that I'm missing?
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: If you look at the – it's almost a follow-up to the prior conversation; now we're looking
through the back window as opposed to the forward one.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Yeah.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Yeah. We've talked about it before, and we have been a little more focused on being more
competitive. Sometimes – in some cases that's been taking rates down. In other cases it's been not taking them up at the
same rate we have before. And that's the bulk of what's driven through there.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Got you. Got you. And then the last one, Tom, you made reference to the customer loyalty
kind of being down a little bit in the quarter. Can you talk about initiatives right now that you've got in place to try to
keep that kind of moving up or headed in the other direction?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Brian, they're the same things
we've been doing, which is – first, it was down a little.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So you get into – I just think it was a
missed opportunity because everybody else was down, too. And we need to move it up, because if we move it up,
retention will go up. If retention goes up, growth will go up, and that'd be good for all of us.
The programs we have in place, just to refresh your memory, we changed the reward system, so both our agencies and
our employees benefit from higher customer loyalty: agencies in that some of their bonus is paid on retention, our
employees in that the profit sharing plan is down – we've switched it from profits to customer loyalty, so people's
401(k) match is dependent on getting it up. So we have the reward side.
On the accountability side, we've continued to increase the accountability for results. And if people don't take good care
of our customers, then they can't be part of our team. We also have a number of programs underway underneath that to
help us improve loyalty, everything from calling people, doing protection reviews, calling them when their bill is late,
to having better and clearer communication. We've launched some stuff called Insurance Made Simple. So there's a
whole bunch of things we do along the way which support both that accountability and recognition.
One of the challenges we had this quarter was the benefit of all those programs, rewards, accountability, and new
initiatives did not offset the impact that reasonably large increases in price had in a couple of the big states. So as price
goes up, obviously people get unhappy, and you have to make them even more happy, and we just didn't accomplish
that. That said, we didn't make as much progress in the other parts of the country as we need to, so it will stay a big

Our next question is from Vinay Misquith from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Hi, good morning. The first question is on the capital position. Your STAT capital has
increased nearly 2 billion since the end of 2008, and your GAAP capital has increased 1 billion. Just curious about
whether the fact that you've not announced a buyback, has that been held back by the S&P negative outlook, and are
you waiting for that to be removed before you make some sort of announcement on that front?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Vinay, I'll make a quick comment,
and Don may want to make a comment as well. We are appreciative of the recognition that capital has gone up, and we
think it is a big thing and should be driving shareholder value more than it is. And at current book value multiples, we
are, in my estimation, a bargain. But as it relates to capital levels, we run it based on what we think, not what other
people think. So we set up capital, we look at economic capital, and we think we have plenty of economic capital. S&P
can have a negative outlook – I'm not sure why, given that we think we have excess capital, as do obviously you and
other people on this call. So their outlook is not keeping us back from doing anything. I don't need their approval to buy
back shares or pay a dividend or do anything else.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Fair enough. So what's holding you back from buying back stock right now?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Just where we've started, which is all
things at the right time.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay. The follow-up question is in terms of the actions taken to improve profitability. I think
it's had a negative impact on our retention in California, Georgia, New York and North Carolina, and also in Florida.
Can you give us a sense for what inning are we in terms of rate increases or in terms of these actions taken to improve
profitability?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think Joe answered that, which is we
don't look forward. We increase prices when we think we need to. There's a number of trends that are – each of those
states is different. You'll remember in California we had to take some big decreases I think in 2008. And so we're not
even back to where we were when we got started with this.
In some of the bigger states that have personal injury protection, you're seeing a number of industry things going on
where fraud is way up in places like Florida and New York. So it's hard to predict what inning you're in. I can only tell
you that our approach, and what Joe and his team do, is when they see a problem, they go to fix it. And we try to keep
balance. We try to keep rate increases small as opposed to large and infrequent. And we'll continue to do the same thing
in the future.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: All right. And on the homeowners side, these trailing 12-month rate increases seem to be only
6%. Do you think that you would like to take a higher rate increase, given that the combined ratio was 100% this
quarter in homeowners?
<A – Thomas Wilson I've been consistent in saying we need to get a better return from that.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay, and what's the timeline that you propose to take rates up in that line?
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: We're not going to go with -
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We don't give projections on what
we're doing in it.

<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay, all right. Thank you.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: It is useful, Vinay, to remember that the homeowners had the litigation settlement that ran
through that number this quarter, so that's a significant number running through it.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Oh, yes, that's 4 points of the combined ratio, and the combined ratio was 104.7. So even if
you take that out, that's 100%. This quarter I don't think was a really bad quarter in terms of tax. So I'm a little surprised
that it was 100%. And so I was just wondering whether you plan to take rates up, say, maybe 10% in that line to get it
more to the high 80s, low 90s combined ratio.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Vinay, we've been very
consistent in saying we need a lower combined ratio, a higher return in homeowners. I think actually when I
summarized the quarter, I said that was in the – it wasn't in my disappointing category, it was in my mixed category.
Wasn't the four positives. But we're not there yet. But it isn't like you can just wave a magic wand and all of a sudden
charge people a lot more money given the regulatory structure and the customer relationships we're trying to manage.
So we try to do it in a balanced way.
Joe talked earlier about the success we're having with giving larger discounts on auto insurance to monoline
homeowner customers. That's working quite well for us. So we want to do this in a way that accelerates the overall
growth of the company both in terms of the size of the company, as well as improved returns.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.

Our next question is from Greg Locraft from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
<Q - Greg Locraft>: Hi, thanks. Wanted to cover a couple things. Number one, how are you feeling on the pension at
this point in time? It was underfunded by over a billion at the end last year.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We obviously have plenty of capital,
so first how we feel on – we feel good about the pension in it that's an obligation to the company. We put a lot more
money into it this year, and we obviously have plenty of capital to keep the pension whole. So depends what you mean
by "feel" about the pension. We obviously would like returns to go up on that portfolio, and we've had good returns so
far this year. But we're like everybody else; we still suffer from the downturn in equity values that happened over really
the last three or four years.
Don, do you have any other comments you want to -?
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No, I think that's -
<Q - Greg Locraft>: Okay, great. And just if you could refresh – how much will you put into the pension this year?
And then how are you thinking about funding from a company contribution perspective next year?
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You know what? Let us follow up on that,
Greg. I just don't remember.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We fund it when we need it. There's
obviously a tax advantage to putting money in early and letting it roll, but then the downside to it is you lose a little bit
of investment income at the company. But you're talking about – our contributions have usually been in the hundreds of
millions of dollars. So I wouldn't – it's not a meaningful number in terms of the overall operating income of the
company.
<Q - Greg Locraft>: Okay, great. Second is the debt level of the company. You guys have done a nice job
deleveraging for several quarters now. How low do you think this could go? I mean I think your target is low 20s, and
seem like you guys are getting pretty darn close to that right now.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I guess if you do the math on GAAP,
that's how it gets to deleveraging. If you do the math on economics, we've been right where we've always been. And on
GAAP, it's 23.5, and we've always said that feels about right. We obviously don't have need for extra capital today, so
we don't need to go out and borrow. Don's also looking at how he wants to optimize our capital structure, and both
that's within the existing $6 billion of debt or whether he wants to move other things around. You've seen us do that
over time, everything from issue preferreds to debt and tie it to the overall capital of the company. But we don't have
any plans – we're not announcing anything today as to what we're doing differently.
<Q - Greg Locraft>: I guess I was just wondering, is that 23.5 – I mean, is there a governor below which you guys
would I guess take out more debt in order to kind of hold the ratio flat? Or do you not – do you look at it more or less –
you don't look at it as much on a GAAP basis, is kind of what you're implying.
<A - Robert Block, Investor Relations>: That's right.
<Q - Greg Locraft>: Okay. Okay, great. Last is on the investment income line, that was one of the ones that we were
sort of surprised on. And I'm just wondering, how do we think about modeling that going forward? How much is
coming due or maturing, and what does the new reinvestment rate look like?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Judy is so happy she got a question -
<A - Judy Greffin>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: – because she's been sitting here
patiently waiting for someone to jump on it. We thought maybe Don had just done such a good job of explaining it to
you, you didn't have any questions. Judy?
<A - Judy Greffin>: So maturities are, I believe, disclosed on page 8 of the notes. So you can take a look there and see
what we've got coming off over the next several years.
With regard to income – and there are many factors affecting investment income. First, we're in a low-rate
environment, rates are down, as everybody knows, 100 to 150 basis points, 50 basis points in the quarter alone. And we
also have our proactive stand on risk mitigation, and we've been doing that for a couple of years. We think it gives us a
lot of flexibility in the portfolio, better positions us going forward. We've been focused largely on commercial real
estate and municipals for the past year or so. And I'd say that those programs are largely complete.
We've also done some duration shortening or duration management within the portfolio, and this quarter in particular
we took a hard look at the cash duration in the property and casualty portfolio and made some moves to shorten the
cash duration, because we felt we were using a derivative to a great extent, more than we needed to in that portfolio,
and decided to bring down the cash duration, and that impacted income as well. And then just normal trading activity in
this low-rate environment also impacts investment income.
When you look at how to manage it going forward, you talk to any portfolio manager that has fixed income in their
portfolio, you've got a situation where rates are low, they could stay low for an extended period of time, and then you're
looking at less income as a portfolio manager. Rates could decline further, which the value of the portfolio would go
up, but you end up with earning less. And then if rates rise, the value of the portfolio could fall – would fall, but you'd
earn more income. And I guess the actions that we're taking put us in a position where we feel that we have the
flexibility to be proactive in managing the portfolio and driving shareholder value.
<Q - Greg Locraft>: Okay, thanks. Very thorough. A follow-up on that, is the increase in the expense line that goes
into this – and this is just on the P&C side – is that because of the unwind of derivatives, or -? I didn't fully explain how
the lack of using derivatives caused this number to step down so much.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: What expense line are you – are you
talking about underwriting expense, or are you talking about investment expense?

<Q - Greg Locraft>: I'm talking about investment expense. It went up, I think, $3 million year over year, which was a
heck of a jump if you look at the last several quarters in the supplement.
<A - Robert Block, Investor Relations>: This is Bob. Why don't you and I talk about that offline, and we can get
behind those numbers.
<Q - Greg Locraft>: Okay, okay. So the number you put up, though, is much more indicative of what the future run
rate is going to be out of investment income, and we can model the maturities and reinvestment rate per your guidance.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You can model it. I would take out the
per our guidance. I mean, look, as Judy said, what we're trying to do is manage for total return in an environment that
could go flat out, go up, go down, and with shortened duration we're staying on the balls of our feet so that we can
move quickly but – and harvesting gains when we get them. So we're not just riding it down and have the gains go
away up if interest rates go up. We're trying to protect ourselves if they do.
<Q - Greg Locraft>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

And our next question is from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
<Q - Josh Shanker>: Yeah, thank you. Given the pace of frequency trends in auto, I'm wondering if the rate actions
you've taken prior are anticipating these frequency increases, or where we stand in terms of your current rate outlook
related to what frequency is doing.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: I'd love to tell you that we can look forward six or nine months and figure out what
frequency's going to do. But we don't. The actions we've taken in the past are functions of what we thought was going
on in maybe a very short-term view of where we think frequency might be headed. My comments before suggested that
we're seeing some of these increases in the relatively recent periods, parts of them.
When we look period over period, we think are a little bit attributable to the claim system changes we made over the
past couple of years, and parts of it appear to be more broad and environmental. And we're going to watch and see
what's happening with those trends to see if, in fact, they are trends or if they're a near-term anomaly. And we'll factor
that into our pricing approach, which will include all the things we talked about, in terms of managing margins and
thinking about how we run this business relative to the entire impact of the corporation.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Josh, it's Tom. On a longer-term
basis, I think for 20 years, if you look at 20 years, frequency came down as we got safer cars and better drunk-driving
laws, older drivers, more cars per household – a whole bunch of things drove that trend. As if you look over the shorter
period of time, it looks much flatter. So that puts Joe's comments in perspective. 2010 looks like 2007.
<Q - Josh Shanker>: That's good. And so thinking then about the competitive nature of the market with the rate
environment where it is, coming into the new year I'm sure you're doing some budgeting. Given the seasonality of
shopping behavior – and I know you guys have a new ad campaign out there that's running a lot – are you planning on
increasing the budget for advertising for first quarter '11?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That would be a competitive piece of
information we wouldn't want to give out.
<Q - Josh Shanker>: Okay. Well, thank you very much.

<Q - Sarah DeWitt>: Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up about your appetite for M&A. Can you elaborate on
this and talk about if you have any desire to expand internationally? Because there have been some reports about
Allstate being interested in RBS's P&C business. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Sarah. This is Tom.
I'll come back to what has been our stock answer with that, which isn't going to be very specific to what you asked,
which is we look at everything that comes across the market. Sometimes we go out and proactively look for stuff. We
tend to be relatively conservative in the price we will pay and try to only buy things where we think we can add lots of
value. So when we bought the Workplace Division a decade ago, we thought we could expand it geographically across
the country; we did that. We thought we could expand it through sales of Allstate agencies; we did that. We thought we
could expand it from small companies to large companies, and we did that. When we bought CNA, its business had a
combined ratio of 117. And while Joe is not happy with its combined ratio at 100, it's been substantially below 100
since we bought it, and we've made good money on that.
So that's kind of the approach we have. To answer your question about international versus domestic, much more
interested in seizing the opportunity available in the domestic market than international, but if something was
appropriately priced and we thought we could add value, we'd always look at it.
<Q - Sarah DeWitt>: Great, thanks for the answer.
Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Thank you all for taking the time. We're sticking with our strategy of being focusing on the customer, and it's
driving all of our activity, both with Joe and his team at Allstate Protection, with Matt and his team at Allstate
Financial, and we're being active in risk mitigation and return optimization with Judy and her team.
So all that productivity has created more shareholder value, so book value again is up this quarter, and we feel good
about that. We have a great management team. We'll continue to work successfully to increase the value of your
investment. Thank you, and we'll see you next quarter.
