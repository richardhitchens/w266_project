Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Mike Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Altria Group
Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong financial results in the first quarter, with
adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4.8%, as our businesses navigated through high unemployment, low consumer
confidence, and a competitive business environment. As we anticipated, adjusted EPS growth comparisons for the first
quarter were challenging, but our results exceeded our initial expectations and give us confidence in our ability to
achieve adjusted diluted EPS growth within our forecasted range for the year.
In the cigarette segment, PM USA reported strong adjusted operating companies income growth, with margin
expansion. We are particularly pleased with these financial results since, in the comparable year-ago period, the
cigarette segment's adjusted operating companies income growth was also quite strong.
Timing of new product launches and trade inventory changes impacted year-over-year comparisons for retail share
volume and income in the cigarette segment. New product launches this year and in the first quarter last year had a
significant impact on both PM USA's and Marlboro's retail share comparisons.
PM USA shipped two Marlboro Special Blend SKUs at the beginning of the first quarter last year. The success of this
launch significantly benefited Marlboro's retail share results in all of the first quarter of 2010, creating a challenging
retail share comparison. Two additional Marlboro Special Blend SKUs were shipped toward the end of the first quarter
this year, with minimal impact on the quarter's retail share results.
Trade inventory changes also impacted quarterly year-over-year cigarette segment shipment and income comparisons.
PM USA believes the trade built inventory from the beginning to the end of both comparable time periods, but the trade
built less inventory this year than in 2010. Trade inventory build on the first quarter could negatively impact volume
and income results for the cigarette segment if depleted in the future.
PM USA's reported cigarette shipments declined versus the comparable year-ago period and, after adjusting for trade
inventory changes, were estimated to be down slightly more than the cigarette category. PM USA's adjusted cigarette
shipments declined more than the category due to a decline in retail share. This retail share decline occurred primarily
due to the timing of the Marlboro new product launch, as I mentioned, and retail share losses on some of PM USA's
other brands, primarily discount, as PM USA optimizes the long-term income of its portfolio of brands.
PM USA is pleased with Marlboro's first quarter performance. The brand gained retail share as the quarter progressed,
showing increased momentum, and turned in an excellent profit performance. Although PM USA faces a particularly
challenging second quarter retail share comparison, as Marlboro had a record retail share result in the second quarter of
2010, we expect quarterly retail share comparisons to improve significantly in the second half of the year, both overall
and for Marlboro.
Overall, PM USA delivered solid cigarette segment business results in the quarter. Although competition remained
intense and comparisons were tough, operating companies income continued to grow, operating companies margins
continued to expand, and Marlboro is well positioned for the balance of the year.
In the smokeless product segment, USSTC and PM USA reported solid business results in a competitive environment.
We are particularly pleased with the smokeless product segment's operating companies income result, as it had a
challenging comparison to the first quarter of 2010. As in the cigarette segment, there were a number of factors in the
smokeless product segment impacting year-over-year comparisons for income, volume, and retail share.
Last year's results benefited from the 2009 fourth quarter launch of Copenhagen Wintergreen. Given the timing of this
launch, the first quarter of 2010 represented the first full quarter of shipments for this very successful new product.
Second, 2010 first quarter shipments of two new Copenhagen products, Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural;
and the national launch of four Marlboro Snus products; and the Skoal Slim line can pouch promotion in the first
quarter of 2010.

USSTC and PM USA shipped several new smokeless products in the first quarter of 2011, although these launches did
not benefit this quarter's results as much as new products and promotions contributed to last year's first quarter results.
This year, Marlboro and Skoal each launched two new Snus products, and Skoal shipped eight new Skoal Xtra products
toward the end of the quarter.
As a result of the year-over-year changes in new product and promotional activities, reported smokeless product
shipments declined versus prior-year period. However, after adjusting for these factors, USSTC and PM USA estimate
that their combined smokeless product shipment volumes grew slightly below the smokeless category's growth rate for
the quarter.
The smokeless product segment's retail share declined versus last year, as the segment had a challenging comparison
due to the new product activity in the year-ago time period, as well as Skoal's year-over-year retail share performance.
On a sequential basis, however, USSTC and PM USA grew their combined retail share of the smokeless category due
to sequential retail share growth for both Copenhagen and Skoal.
Copenhagen's retail share increased both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis due to continuing marketplace
momentum from its new products and strength in its core natural business. Copenhagen plans to build on this
momentum and help drive future growth by launching Copenhagen Wintergreen pouches nationally in the second
quarter of this year.
Skoal grew retail share on a sequential basis, as comprehensive brand-building initiatives positively impacted its
performance. USSTC expects the new Skoal Xtra products shipped toward the end of the quarter will contribute to the
brand's future growth. Overall, USSTC and PM USA delivered solid first quarter smokeless product segment results.
Copenhagen and Skoal both grew sequential retail share, and adjusted shipment volumes on operating companies
income grew on a year-over-year basis. USSTC and PM USA believe they're well positioned to continue delivering
solid results in the smokeless category as the year progresses.
In the cigar segment, post-FET increased marketplace dynamics continue to impact Middleton's reported income
results. Middleton is working to resolve these issues but expects that a resolution will take some time and that these
marketplace dynamics will continue to have an impact on Middleton's income results for the year. In response to these
dynamics, Middleton invested in promotional initiatives to defend Black & Mild's marketplace position, which
benefited Middleton's volume and retail share results for the quarter. Middleton's reported shipments and Black &
Mild's retail share both increased versus the comparable year-ago period.
Middleton has several brand-building activities planned for the balance of the year designed to continue enhancing
Black & Mild's performance. These activities include introducing nationally two untipped cigarillo varieties in the
second quarter of this year to expand Black & Mild's position in the untipped cigarillo segment, where it historically
has not competed widely – this is the largest machine-made large cigar segment, representing over 50% of the category
share in 2010 – and introducing Black and Mild Shorts as competitively priced tipped cigarillo alternatives in a number
of high-volume geographies. Middleton believes these and other actions planned for the balance of the year should
enhance Black & Mild's marketplace position and improve the company's financial results as the year progresses.
In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle reported solid results, with strong growth in adjusted operating companies income,
due in part to Ste. Michelle's focus on improving its mix with higher-margin products. First quarter reported wine
shipments were essentially the same as the prior-year period, and Ste. Michelle believes that shipments in both time
periods were impacted by wholesale inventory movements. Ste. Michelle's retail unit volumes continue to grow,
helping position the company for solid business results in the balance of the year.
Overall, we are pleased with our results through the end of the first quarter, as our businesses successfully navigated
through a challenging environment and faced some difficult comparisons. The underlying strengths of these businesses,
in conjunction with solid first quarter results, gives us confidence that we can deliver adjusted diluted EPS growth of
6% to 9% for the full year and a range of $2.01 to $2.07 off an adjusted base of $1.90 per share in 2010. Given that first
quarter EPS results outperformed our expectations, in part due to trade inventory dynamics that will play out as the year
progresses, we expect some unevenness in adjusted EPS growth on a quarterly basis, with more growth toward the back

half of the year.
I will now turn the call over to Howard Willard, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's
business segment results in more detail.
Howard A. Willard III, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Mike. Good morning.
In the cigarette segment, reported operating companies income increased by 9.5%, to $1.3 billion, due primarily to
higher list prices and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by lower volume and higher FDA user fees. When
adjusted for restructuring costs, first quarter operating companies income increased by 7.1%, to $1.3 billion, and
adjusted income margins increased by 2.5 percentage points, to 39.6%. As Mike noted, we are particularly pleased with
these results since, in the first quarter last year, adjusted cigarette segment operating companies income grew by a
strong 6.7%.
Reported cigarette segment shipments declined by 6.4%, but after adjusting for trade inventory changes, declined by an
estimated 5%. The trade increased cigarette inventories from the beginning to the end of the first quarter, benefiting
reported cigarette segment volume and income results.
PM USA estimates that the overall cigarette category's adjusted volume declined by approximately 4% in the first
quarter, which is in line with historical price elasticity. PM USA's first quarter cigarette segment retail share declined
by 1.2 share points, to 49%, due to retail share declines of 0.7 of a share point on its portfolio brands and half a share
point on Marlboro.
Marlboro's retail share was 42.2% in the first quarter. Marlboro Menthol performed well in the marketplace, as its retail
share grew by 0.1 of a share point, to 6.1%, based in part on the introduction of Marlboro Skyline Menthol in the fourth
quarter of 2010.
The smokeless product segment's reported operating companies income increased by 8.4%, to $193 million, due
primarily to higher pricing and lower restructuring cost. When adjusted for restructuring and UST acquisition-related
costs, operating companies income increased by 3.2%, to $194 million. Reported smokeless product shipments
decreased by 1.3%, but when adjusted primarily for the timing of new product launches, increased by an estimated 6%.
USSTC and PM USA estimate that the smokeless products category grew 7% in the first quarter.
USSTC and PM USA's combined retail share of the smokeless products category decreased by 0.6 of a share point
versus the comparable year-ago period, to 54.7%, but increased by 0.2 of a share point on a sequential basis versus the
fourth quarter of 2010, due to share growth for both Copenhagen and Skoal. Copenhagen grew 0.3 of a share point
versus the fourth quarter of 2010, to 26%, and also grew by 0.4 of a share point on a comparable year-over-year basis.
Skoal also grew 0.3 of a share point on a sequential basis, to 22%, but declined 1.1 share points on a comparable
year-over-year basis.
Middleton's reported operating companies income decreased 53.2%, to $22 million, primarily due to promotional
investments made to protect Black & Mild's marketplace position. Middleton's overall retail share grew by 0.6 of a
share point, to 29.1%, driven by Black & Mild's retail share performance. Black & Mild grew its retail share by 0.8 of a
share point, to 28.9%.
When adjusted for integration costs, operating companies income decreased by 54.2%, to $22 million. Middleton's first
quarter shipments grew by 1.9%. Increases in imported machine-made large cigars have made trade inventory volumes
difficult to determine accurately in the short term. Consequently, Middleton is only providing its reported company
shipments.
Ste. Michelle's reported operating companies income increased by 71.4%, to $12 million. When adjusted for UST
acquisition-related and restructuring costs, operating companies income increased by 25%, to $15 million. The wine
segment's shipment volume was essentially the same as the prior-year period, but shipments were impacted primarily

by wholesale inventory changes. Ste. Michelle believes that, in the first quarter of 2011, wholesalers depleted inventory
built during the fourth quarter of 2010, while in the year-ago period, wholesalers increased inventories. Ste. Michelle's
retail unit volume increased by 2.3%, while the wine industry's volume grew 3.2%.
The financial services segments reported operating companies income of $21 million was the same as last year. At the
end of the quarter, the allowance for losses was unchanged versus the end of last year, at $202 million.
Altria continued to deliver shareholder value by managing its cost structure. Altria delivered $35 million in cost savings
across its family of companies in the first quarter of 2011. We are confident that we can achieve the remaining $110
million in cost savings from our $1.5 billion program by the end of this year. Since 2006, we have delivered nearly $1.4
billion in cost savings.
Altria also delivered value to shareholders by returning cash to them. In the first quarter, the company paid almost $800
million in dividends, reflecting our intention to return 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in the form of
dividends. Based on our annualized dividend rate of $1.52 per share, our closing stock price of $27.01 on April 15th,
our yield of 5.6% makes Altria stock an attractive investment. Altria intends to complete its previously announced 2011
$1 billion share repurchase program by the end of this year, but the timing of any share repurchases depends upon
marketplace conditions and other factors, and remains subject to the discretion of our board.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping
items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest-effective-priced cigarette was 35% in the first quarter. Marlboro's net
pack price in the quarter was $5.70, while the lowest-effective-priced cigarette was $4.21. The cigarette discount
category's first quarter retail share was 27.6%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of
the first quarter was $1.36 per pack. There were no cigarette excise tax increases in the first quarter.
Copenhagen's first quarter net retail price was $4.17, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was
approximately 40% in the quarter. As of March 31, 2011, 20 states and the District of Columbia use a weight-based
smokeless tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 32% of the smokeless tobacco category's volume.
CapEx was $13 million in the first quarter, and depreciation and amortization was $60 million. And on April 15th, PM
USA made its annual 2010 MSA payment of approximately $3.5 billion. The amount includes approximately $267
million that PM USA disputes it owes as a result of the 2008 Non-Participating Manufacturer Adjustment.
Operator, do we have any questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Investors, analysts, and media representatives are now invited to participate in the
question-and-answer-session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question is coming
from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Thanks. Good morning. Mike, just starting with a little bit more question around just the Marlboro
share performance, clearly I understand that there is obviously the timing of the new product launches and the
promotional timing that affect the market share performance on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But maybe you can give us a
little bit more perspective on your strategy to use these line extensions to go after the fringe Marlboro users. If you
think about just the core Marlboro franchise, so when you X out some of these new products, can you tell us how much
retail share of the core Marlboro franchise is up or down? And then, as some of these new product launches got into the
retail this year, can you tell us how the share is performing for Marlboro?
<A - Michael Szymanczyk>: Well, yeah. Let me talk about the Marlboro share just a little bit because I often remind
investors that quarter-to-quarter comparisons, due to the amount of activity either we have in the marketplace or
competitors have in the marketplace, can not be indicative of underlying trends in the business, and I think the first

quarter of 2011 is a case in point.
If you go back to 2010, the Marlboro share grew for the year up about 0.8%, well ahead of what had been its average
growth rate over the past few years, and that was substantially more than was necessary to offset the growth of our
other premium brand share loss, which is something we like to cover with Marlboro. And that means that the rest of
that share was largely garnered from promotion-sensitive consumers and discounts consumers who, as I've talked
before, shop. And every brand – even though Marlboro has a very high loyalty factor relative to other consumer
products, every brand has some percentage of its business that's price-sensitive. So we have some share points that are
like that.
If you look at the first quarter of the year – or actually the first half – what you'll see is that we had a major product
launch, very successful, behind Marlboro Special Blend. So, while most of that share is sustainable share, some of it,
due to promotion activity when you launch a new product, comes from these more promotion-sensitive or discount
shoppers. And that activity wasn't replicated in the first quarter of this year. And if you look at the total year last year,
during the period that we had that launch activity, we saw a very strong share, actually a record share in the second
quarter for Marlboro. And then we saw – as the launch activity abated, we also saw some of that what I'll call
temporary share slip away.
And so as we lapped that quarter the first quarter this year, we didn't have the same kind of activity. We expected to see
some loss of the share. And during the same time this year in the first quarter, you had some other products that had a
high level of activity that was price-related – Newport non-menthol, Camel continued low price activity on Pall Mall –
that can cause some of this more promotion-sensitive or discount business to shift around.
So I think more indicative of the Marlboro business right now is its comparison March to December. We showed some
nice share growth during that period of time, even without that extraordinary support that we had in the year-ago
timeframe. So we think Marlboro is actually in pretty good shape, and we're going to face a tough comparison the
second quarter, but as we move into the back half of the year, the comparisons will be more favorable. And we tend to
look at the brand's performance on a longer-term basis rather than on a quarter-to-quarter basis or even a half-to-a-half.
So I think it's doing fine. We don't break out the various pieces, but the franchise continues to show good strength.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Okay. And then just some color around the new Marlboro leadership program that you've
implemented with the retailers, where you're suggesting max price for Marlboro in given markets. I guess just
wondering, so far, what the adoption rates have been in terms of the retailers agreeing to that program. And then, in
general, if we think about Marlboro's average pricing, how much pricing would come down if majority of the retailers
agree to adopt this program; and then, finally, any risk that, as the pricing of Marlboro comes down as a result of this
program, again, is sort of maybe risk of the brand equity question here?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, first of all, just some context.
Marlboro has for a while had a program available to retailers that wanted to use Marlboro as a means to draw traffic
into their store, so this is really a redesign of that program. Because all programs kind of become less relevant over
time and their structure as marketplace conditions change, and that's the case with this one, that we will look at these
programs periodically and update them. So we updated this program effective April 1st. It's designed to be cost neutral
with the old program, and beyond that, the response rate, it's not a program that's designed for every retailer,
necessarily, based on their strategy, nor were the ones in the past, but the response rate to this program has been, I
think, very positive by many retailers. And some retailers won't choose to do it. That's what we expect. We'll see what
the impact is in the marketplace, but we expect to see some positive impact on the brand's performance, as we have in
the past with programs like this when some of our customers get [ph] behind it (29:07).
<Q - Judy Hong>: Okay. And then just finally, your decision to put the MSA [Master Settlement Agreement] (29:14)
disputed payments into the escrow account this year, which is different than what you've done in the past, can you just
give us a little bit of color in terms of the rationale?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: This dispute is now in full arbitration, and
so we felt like that was the appropriate decision this year.

Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with UBS.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Howard Willard>: Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Just following up on Judy's question on the MLP program, Mike, is this – I'm just trying to think of
the P&L impact here, and it strikes me as this is just basically a reallocation of monies within your existing trade
agreements within the various customers that you deal with. Is that kind of a fair characterization? Is it just the – will
you be outlaying incremental dollars and cents to help fund the back-end incentives for folks that sign up on the option?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We would expect it to be neutral.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Okay. So it's just effectively a reallocation of dollars.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. That's right.
<Q - Nik Modi>: And then the other question is on the state excise tax environment. The wording in the press release
and your commentary continues to suggest a really cautious tone. Obviously, we've had limited activity thus far.
Several states have looked to reduce excise taxes. How should we think about this? It seems like the environment is
actually a little bit better than what most folks in the industry thought at the beginning of the year. Any thoughts on
that?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's still early in the year.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Okay, and do you...
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We never get overly optimistic about this.
We will continue to be paying close attention.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Okay. Great. And then just the last question quickly on the ad valorem to weight-based and
smokeless, are there any other states that are considering a conversion in terms of tax methodology?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think there may be some activity there.
Off the top of my head, I can't detail it for you, but, yeah, I think we expect – as the subject of excise taxes comes up in
states, I think you can expect in those where ad valorem exists, that this subject will come up. And sometimes it comes
up where ad valorem doesn't exist, as somebody tries to propose to go to ad valorem. So I think you're going to
continue to see activity there.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Okay. Thanks very much.

what we said in January to that subject. I don't think what occurred was much different than what generally I think
people thought would occur, and I think obviously the FDA will take that under advisement. But then, as we have
continued to say, we think they'll operate based on the science and the evidence and make their regulatory decisions
accordingly.
So we haven't felt like we'd see some dramatic impact. So we'll watch and see how it unfolds.
<Q - David Adelman>: Okay. And then secondly, Mike, I wanted to ask you about your characterization of the
elasticity, the price elasticity of the U.S. cigarette category. This quarter and in the past, you've commented that you see
no changes versus historical elasticity.
But my question is, pricing to the consumer was probably up about 5% or 6% Q1-on-Q1 last year, and it looks like
consumption was down about 4%. So is what's happening, in your view, that the structural decline in industry volume –
in other words, the decline that would occur in the absence of pricing being higher – is higher than it might have been
in the past?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I wouldn't draw that conclusion. I think
your timeframe probably is too short to really determine any trend, David. We generally would have to look at that on a
longer timeline to understand whether or not there was any trend line change. And, boy, the history's pretty long on
this, and it seems to support a pretty stable elasticity.
<Q - David Adelman>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Christine Farkas with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Christine Farkas>: Thank you very much. Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Christine Farkas>: Mike, I had a question related to MLP, but maybe not. We've seen or heard about some
reduced discounts on some of your other Marlboro brands, the Special Blends or the 72s. And given your comment
about MLP program being cost-neutral, I'm trying to understand if that's a statement based on the MLP program itself,
or if you're also including some of the changes to discount plans on the other – or other parts of the Marlboro franchise.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Well, you know, we regularly
change promotion activity in various states and relative to various SKUs, so you should expect to see that separate and
apart from the MLP program.
The MLP program's cost will vary a little bit based on take rate versus estimates, but in general, we think it will be
about cost control. And our expectation is that that won't have an impact on our overall performance or spending
performance for the year.
<Q - Christine Farkas>: Okay. Great. And then moving to cigars, this is clarified in the prior quarter, as well. We
have a strong competitive environment here, and there was some discussion about the imports and the impact that's
having on the environment.
Has there been any update on that? Is there some way to close that loophole, or will this remain as tough for the rest of
the year?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's an issue we'll have for the
remainder of the year, but during that period of time, we will have taken the appropriate steps to get that playing field

<Q - Christine Farkas>: Okay. And then just finally for me, just to understand, given your statements in the press
release about the IRS development or just clarification or disclosure, I just want to understand if, in fact, that program
impacts your buy-back program for the year. Does that change your potential timing or even occurrence of the
buy-back for the year?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, we don't see it impacting either our
dividends or our announced buy-backs.

Thank you. We will now take questions from the media. Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with
Citigroup.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: I was just wondering if we could – if you could come back to the Marlboro franchise just quickly
one more time. And just clarify, is there a floor to the Marlboro price gap that you're not willing to cross, to the extent
that the MLP program does indeed reduce Marlboro's price gap at retail?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm not sure I understand what you're
asking me.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Is there a minimum price gap that you're just not willing to go below? Is it 30%, and at 30% you
have to hold Marlboro's pricing?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, generally, it would be difficult to
articulate something like that. That number that you're referring to is kind of a national number, but reality is that it's
made up of a lot of different pieces – or different price gaps in different states, based on both activity in those states and
excise taxes in those states. And then competitive pricing moves with some regularity, so it's always changing that
number.
So we're – in terms of our activities and the actions that we take, we take those on a more precision basis. We wouldn't
be looking to some total national number to drive our decision-making. So it's much more surgical than that.
So I guess the general answer to your question is no. What we do is we deal with the business issues in the
marketplaces as we see trends develop or opportunities develop.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Okay. Understood. I guess what I was just trying to get at, though, is with Marlboro's kind of
status as a premium brand, do you think that, at some point, you lower Marlboro's price gap so much that it erodes that
premium brand equity.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we really haven't seen that occur.
Actually, the dollar gap has expanded on Marlboro over time, but the percent gap has narrowed somewhat because of
the excise tax increases. So I don't think that that's an issue.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Okay. Fair enough. And just in terms of kind of the delay in terms of some of the FET activity, has
that at all improved your outlook for cigarette industry volumes for the year – or the absence of any [indiscernible]
(39:10)?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We don't get predictive of it, but as I
commented on David's question, I don't think we've seen any evidence that the normal elasticities have changed any.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi. I just had two questions for you. The first one, in relation to the cigarette division,
you'd mentioned how inventories are built throughout the quarter. Is there a certain number of sticks or days or how we
could look at it – that you think maybe would be a little extra within that division that could be worked out in the
future? I'm just trying to get a sense of what that could do to volumes in the future.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I'm not going to try to segment that
out. All I'm going to say is that we saw some inventory building in the quarter, but less than we had in the quarter a
year ago. So I'm just going to leave it at that.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And then I wanted to ask you about the promotional levels in the smokeless
division, your smokeless business. You had pulled back a little bit on those in the fourth quarter. You had a lot of work
going on at retail. Would you characterize promotional levels in smokeless back to more normal levels in the quarter?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think we had pretty normal levels. We
had a lot of activity in the first quarter last year because we launched a number of new products. And we had less of
that. And the Skoal Xtra launch was really at the tail of the quarter.
I don't think there was anything unusual about the activity in the quarter this year. Maybe a bit less than there was last
year.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: [indiscernible] (40:54) And then, I guess, somewhat related to that, you've done a lot of
the shelf resets in your smokeless business. Is that – I assume that's always work, but is that pretty well complete now
and that we've seen like an expanded space for smokeless? Is that all sort of in place now where you wanted to initially
get that done?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the work regarding – the physical
work regarding resetting these sections is pretty well complete. There's still some tweaking and adjusting going on. I
think it's now really the ordering procedures and getting at retail the same kinds of practices relative to ordering that
maintains a really high in-stock condition with fresh product to occur in the smokeless business as is the case in the
cigarette business.
So there's still more work to do to take advantage of now having the space allocated in a better way in terms of the
impact on the consumer.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: And in that change – or that increase in space, would a product launch like the new Skoal
products be incremental to your shelf space, or are those replacing other products in your shelves then, on average?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, that depends on the geography. Skoal
has a lot of SKUs, but the distribution on those SKUs isn't consistent across the country.
So in each geographic situation, we've accommodated how to position Skoal Xtra in the store based on the
circumstance. So that would really vary by store and by development of particular SKUs on Skoal.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. Thanks for your time.

Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Ann.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: Just wanted to know why there is more disclosure or discussion in this quarter's release in the
financial services section. That seems to be a change. And should I read there's a change in timing coming of a
decision, or anything I need to know?
<Q - Christopher Growe>: No. We added that disclosure. I think that kind of completes it. There was a ruling in a
case on some of these similar kinds of leases; LILO/SILO called the Wells Fargo case not too long ago, the other day,
so we just decided to add this additional disclosure.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: And then, Mike, I'm always interested in your opinion of the consumer, and since January to now,
is there any change in consumer behavior or expectations for consumer behavior, challenges of the environment? I
would love your update on your view of the consumer.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think, as we look at it, our
consumers still face high unemployment and still are expressing low confidence. So that doesn't seem to have changed
a lot, and I think you can add to that, geez, they've got increased fuel cost pressures now. So I don't think the situation
has changed a lot for the general consumer out there. As much as you'd like to say that, and you may see some strength
to the stock market, I don't think that the general consumer is getting that same outcome out there right now. So we're
still cautious about that.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo & Gardner.
<Q - Thomas Russo>: Hi, Mike. Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Tom.
<Q - Thomas Russo>: Question about any victories, any progress underway with the illicit trade or the counterfeit
channels that you might share with us.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, that's an ongoing activity for us, and
so much of what goes on there is work that we do with law enforcement, so we don't talk about that. Generally, you
read about that after it's over. Okay? But that kinds of activity continue to occur, and I think that – I don't think there's
anything new to report relative on that subject in terms of impact on the business, but it's also something that I think
you have to keep constant pressure on because, certainly, the dynamics in the marketplace are such that if you don't,
you can see it expand.
<Q - Thomas Russo>: Thank you. And then just an observation from you, what reads do you have from duty-free or
from parts of the U.S. where there's heavy international traveling about the separation of the Marlboro brand equity for
those who are non-U.S. consumers in light of what they're seeing abroad in their home markets versus the U.S.? Has
any kind of brand equity effect started to surface as the two product offerings diverge over time?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I don't think so. U.S. duty-free has
been U.S. duty-free now for a while, and the rest of it has been in PMI's hands for a while. That was the case before the
spin. And so I don't think that anything meaningfully different is there. We've had products in those different
environments that are manufactured in different places for some time now. So there's nothing new there.
