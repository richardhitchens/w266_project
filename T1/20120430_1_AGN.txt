Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us this morning.
Watson is off to a great start in the first quarter of 2012. Net revenues increased 74% to $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP
earnings per diluted share were up 84% to a $1.64 per share, adjusted EBITDA increased 70% to $367 million in the
quarter. If you exclude the $0.52 contribution from the sales of generic Lipitor this quarter, non-GAAP earnings per
share were up 26% from last year. We also had a very busy quarter in terms of strategic global expansion of our
company.
We are aggressively integrating the Ascent business acquired in late January, which made us the fifth largest generic
company in Australia and a leader in Southeast Asia. The integration is progressing very well and many financial and
IT related items have already been completed. Last Wednesday, we announced the further expansion of our global
generics business with the agreement to acquire Actavis, when completing this acquisition will transform Watson. We
will more than double our reach outside the U.S. and we will have access to new markets with exciting growth
trajectories. In addition, the acquisition will expand our range of product offerings in all markets, into semi-solids,
liquids and injectables. We are pleased to have been able to capitalize on this opportunity and look forward to working
with Actavis leadership to complete this transaction and then move rapidly to execute the integration of the combined
company.
Among other highlights in our Global Generics business, we saw continued strong U.S. sales of generic Concerta and
we launched three new products in the first quarter including generic versions of Lovenox, Yaz and Prometrium and in
the second quarter launched generic Vancocin. All of our key international markets experienced growth in the quarter
including U.K., France, Greece and Australia. We continued to expand our pipeline globally with six new patent
challenges in the U.S. and 28 new product submissions globally.

In our Global Brands business we had strong sales of key promoted products including Rapaflo, Generess Fe, Gelnique
and Crinone. We also launched last week Gelnique 3% pump, the new product is available in a convenient metered
dose pump that has been shown to be effective and a safe treatment for OAB.
We initiated a Phase III U.S. trail of Esmya for treatment of anemia associated with uterine fibroids. The trail is
expected to be completed by early 2013 and we also plan to submit the NDS for the product in Canada by mid-2012.
We continue to made great progress on our global development program for our rFSH product and have created a
development timeline for the products related to our collaboration with Amgen.
We announced strong revenue growth during the quarter for our Anda Distribution business. Additionally Anda's
relocation of our Ohio distribution facility to Mississippi is in the final inspection stage. We expect to begin shipping
from this location this quarter. The expansion into Mississippi allows us to provide our customers enhanced ability to
move products rapidly to pharmacy shelves around the country.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd to take us through some financials. Todd?
R. Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul and good morning everyone. I will now review our results on a consolidated and divisional basis.
Watson's net revenues for the first quarter were $1.524 billion, an increase of 74% over the prior year, reflecting strong
growth in all three divisions.
In our Global Generics Division, net revenues were $1.116 billion, up 86% year-over-year, which includes sales of new
products, including generic versions of Concerta and Lipitor and the generic version of Lovenox, which was launched
in January. The addition of Specifar and Ascent also contributed to the year-over-year revenue growth.
Sales of extended release products were $350 million, up 91% as a result of the addition of generic Concerta, partially
offset by lower sales of metoprolol and potassium XR due to competition.
Sales of oral contraceptives were $97.3 million, up 4% compared to the prior year as sales of new products more than
offset declines in our base oral contraceptive franchise. New products in the current year include the generic versions of
Yaz and LoSeasonique launched in the first quarter and sales of the generic version of Seasonique launched in the
fourth quarter of last year.
Ex-U.S. net revenues were $171.7 million, up 58% from the first quarter of 2011. International net revenues increased
as a result of the acquisition of Specifar last year and Ascent in January.
Global generics adjusted gross margin was 45.1%, down 6.7 percentage points year-over-year primarily due to lower
margins on sales of the authorized generic versions of Concerta and Lipitor.
Moving to our Global Brands Division, net revenues were $110 million, up 13% on higher sales of promoted products
including Rapaflo and the addition of new products including Generess Fe. Global Brands gross margin was 76.5%,
down 5.1 percentage points due to a favorable product mix in the prior year period.
Finally, net revenues from our Anda Distribution division were $299 million, up 66% on higher new product sales and
revenue from logistics services provided to certain chain customers. Anda's gross margin for the quarter was 11.5%,
down 5.7 percentage points year-over-year on lower margins from logistics services.
Turning now to operating expenses, consolidated GAAP R&D for the first quarter was $88.5 million, up 19%
year-over-year. Our GAAP results for the current year period include $11.8 million in development milestones related
to our U.S. Phase III study initiation on Esmya and our recombinant FSH program and costs related to our global
supply chain initiative, including the closing of our R&D facility in Corona.
SG&A for the first quarter was $283 million. SG&A for the current year period includes a $59.8 million charge related
certain litigation matters, as well as $14.6 million in acquisition costs related to the acquisition of Ascent and the

pending acquisition of Actavis. Excluding these items, SG&A on a non-GAAP basis increased 27%, primarily as a
result of higher international expenses related to Specifar and Ascent, higher global brand sales and marketing expenses
in the U.S. and Canada and higher corporate G&A expenses primarily as a result of higher legal costs.
Amortization expense for the first quarter was $131.9 million, up from $56.6 million in the prior year period due to
amortization of our atorvastatin product rights and amortization of intangibles related to our Specifar and Ascent
acquisitions.
On a non-GAAP basis, our income tax rate for the quarter was 35.5%, down from 36.1% in the prior year period. Our
income tax rate on a GAAP basis was 43.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization and impairment
charges and other charges detailed in Table 4 of our press release, earnings for the first quarter were $1.64 per share, up
84% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings for the first quarter includes $0.52 per share contribution from generic
Lipitor. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $0.43 per share.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $367 million, a 70% increase. Cash flow from operations for the first
quarter was $100 million, and cash and marketable securities were $182 million at year-end.
At quarter end, our revolving credit facility balance was $315 million.
Our existing capital structure will provide us the ability to finance the acquisition of Actavis at favorable rates and
future cash flow from the combined business will provide us the cash flow to delever quickly, as Watson has done with
acquisitions in the past.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2012 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. I'll now provide an update on Watson's forecast for 2012. As a reminder, we have not included any
potential sales for generic Lidoderm.
Our forecast includes certain assumptions for increased competition on our oral contraceptive and extended release
products with the exception of Concerta. We still do not anticipate competition on Concerta in 2012. Date certain
launches included in the forecast are generic versions of Actos and Xopenex, as well as other undisclosed launches.
Due to the recent District Court decision in favor of Bayer on generic Yaz, we have now removed any contribution
from generic Yaz, for the reminder of our full year forecast. Watson's non-GAAP forecast for 2012 excludes any
pre-acquisition costs or post-acquisition earnings from Actavis. We expect to complete the acquisition of Actavis in the
fourth quarter of 2012.
Our updated forecast is as follows. Our estimate for full year net revenue increased to $5.5 billion. We continued to
expect our Global Generics revenue to be between $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion. We continue to expect Global Brand's
net revenue to be between $500 million and $525 million. And in the Anda Distribution business, we've increased
revenue projections to $950 million to $1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.310 billion to $1.375 billion.
Based on our strong first quarter, we've pulled up the bottom end of our range of our forecast. We now expect
non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $5.55 and $5.80 per share.
I believe that 2012 will be another historic year for Watson. Within Global Generics the proposed acquisition of
Actavis is consistent with our strategy to grow this business globally. For Global Brands, we continue to pursue
development of new products including biosimilars. In Anda, we're taking steps to expand in the area of specialty
distribution for future growth.
I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication in helping us achieve a very
successful first quarter of 2012. And I look forward to continued growth in 2012 and beyond.
With that, we'll now take questions.

Thanks, Paul. Therese, we can open up the call for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Faerm with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I have got two revenue questions; one on the
distribution revenues. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the sources of the strength there, you mentioned logistics
services and also any color you could give on the outlook for that going forward, to what extent that strength is
durable? And secondly, on the branded revenues, the – sequentially they were down a bit. If you could give any color
on perhaps sources as to why that might have been down?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay. Al, you want to take the first one?
<A - Albert Paonessa, III>: Sure. On the distribution revenues, we're doing a lot more with the chains and working
with manufacturers, part of the other business that continues to grow is our new product launches. We've expanded that
and our capabilities which will also get enhanced in our move to Mississippi, the Memphis area. So we do consider this
to continue to grow, but they are a quarter-by-quarter opportunities that come to us, so, so far about three quarters in a
row it's been steadily growing. We do assume it will continue the rest of the year.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Fred?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Okay. And on the Brand revenues, I think what you had was a simple issue of
product mix. We have two products that we're in the process of preparing for launch, one was the Androderm 2/4
replacing the 2.5, so you had some inventory adjustments that were going on within the trade environment as they
pulled the 2.5 out and put 2 and 4 in. Second is as they prepare for the pump, same thing was going on with Gelnique,
so Gelnique 3% and Gelnique regular form. So there was nothing else that was really moving around the Brand
business.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Randall Stanicky with Canaccord Genuity.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks guys very much for questions.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Randolph.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Hi, Paul just maybe I missed it, but did you talk about the growth target for 2013? You've
talked about 10% and can you just remind us what is in there? I think you have generic competition for Concerta, but
no Adderall and then I have a follow-up.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. We did speak about our growth targets on a year-over-year basis. We've consistently said
on a Watson standalone basis, we would anticipate double-digit, our target was to achieve double-digit growth between
2012 and 2013. We stand behind that double-digit growth rate and you're right, there was, I believe we had said that we
didn't anticipate any – you know as we do our modeling you know how we handle products that have questions around
them like patent challenges or more citizens petitions and the like. As we get clarity we tend to put them in.

I think we said in 2013 it did include a contribution from Lidoderm and I don't believe we included a contribution from
Adderall XR in that 2013 number, but again those two things balance each other. If things move around, we have the
opportunity to – if Adderall XR accelerates that will be good, if Lidoderm accelerates that would be good for 2012. So
it's a moving target for sure.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: And then – that's helpful. And as you think about spending trends for this year and
obviously Actavis is going to have some level of influence at some point, but how do we think about your R&D and
SG&A look, are there any parts to those components over the next several quarters?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'll start and then I'll have Todd, jump in. I mean, from a macro perspective we will
continue to operate as a standalone company, we'll continue to file our and move forward with our R&D program as
anticipated. So we don't expect any changes from that perspective. SG&A I think the same issue, we'll continue to
move forward with our sales force projections that we have in place. We'll continue to drive our brand revenue through
the sales force, the sales team we have, plus the launches up in Canada where we've launched four products so far and
we've got a team on the ground there. So no anticipated change on a macro level, Todd, do you?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Sure, on a non-GAAP basis, our estimates for the year really haven't changed. On a GAAP basis
we have had – we did take a litigation charge in the first quarter. We also had the integration costs associate with
Ascent and Actavis and we will, we'll have additional charges throughout the year for pre-integration work with the
Actavis acquisition.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Okay, great. Thanks very much guys.
<A - Patricia Eisenhaur>: Thanks, Randall.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Hi, thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hey, Tim.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: So Paul, could you just comment a little bit about generic Lovenox, how is that product doing for
you?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'm going to turn that one over to Siggi. Let him answer that one.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, Tim. It's Siggi. I think it's going all right. We're getting much better supply now.
We were building up supply in the beginning. I think where the issue is, just to remind you, we only have the retail part
of the business versus the non-retail. There were challenges in the beginning to only sell to the retail because many of
our customers supply both retail and non-retail, including the hospitals. I think we have sorted those technical issues
out pretty well and we are steadily getting more market share. I think the prices have gone a little lower than we
expected. We clearly see that both Sandoz and Sanofi have reacted to the market. But overall, we are quite pleased with
where we are with the Lovenox product.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Okay, great. And I just had one follow up, maybe Fred, you could address this. Just – what's the
future pathway for Crinone and Prochieve, I mean since the FDA decision? I mean, are you guys still going to pursue
Prochieve for preterm labor?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah. We've had some – we're in active discussions with the Agency. We've
already had a couple of discussions with them and have a few more coming up. There is a pathway, we're probably not
going to comment on it until we really kind of see the whites of the eyes as to how they're going to proceed. And we – I
think as Paul has described, we will give you a good update when we see there's a positive discussion. But yes, we are
pursuing.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Corey Davis with Jefferies.
<Q - Corey Davis>: Thanks very much. First question would be, has there been any change to your enthusiasm, even
more enthusiastic or more negative about your ability to get generic Lidoderm approved prior to the 30-month stay
expiration in July?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, Corey, I think our enthusiasm is still where it was before. I had – we'd spent all the
money we needed to spend to increase our capacity in Salt Lake City. The capacity is complete. We've got all the raw
material we need to launch the product. We've got validation completed and we're working with the Agency at the final
stages of getting what we hope will be a tentative approval and then on to a final approval. So we're moving everything
we can to go forward. Obviously there is still the Citizen's Petition overhang, which sits out there, and of course we're
waiting for a trial decision. But we are doing everything we can to be ready to go at the earliest possible time.
<Q - Corey Davis>: Okay. Thanks. And second and in fact I missed it in the press release and your prepared remarks,
but could you break out any of the generic products like Concerta, Lipitor, the OCs, extended release?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, Corey, I think we've only – I think we gave some numbers around the OCs and the
general category of extended release. Todd, do you have those handy?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Yeah, I do. The OCs were $97 million for the quarter, extended release was $350 million for the
quarter.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, and I guess the other product we gave specific numbers for was Lipitor, which was $0.52
contribution for the quarter.
<Q - Corey Davis>: Got it. Thanks a lot.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: You bet.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Good morning. So first for Paul on 2013, can you walk us through the 2013 versus 2012 growth
drivers that we should know about? I know that you know more than we do on what could come in, thankfully. But
other than – we know you have some Lidoderm, you clearly have a full year of Xopenex. Can you walk through a
couple of the pieces that the market should know about, so that we know how much is sort of how the trust Watson
factor on 2013 growth versus 2012? And then I have a follow up for Al.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I kind of like the trust Watson factor personally. One of the growth – all of those things that
you mentioned there are included in the growth trajectory. We do anticipate additional new extended release products
being launched, but we also expect greater contribution from our international franchises as we integrate – fully
integrate the Ascent and continue to drive new product launches in our key markets around the world, so that's an
additional growth driver. We continue to expect to see growth in our branded franchises with Rapaflo, Generess Fe,
and Crinone, even in its current form, continuing to see some growth.

We had the new Gelnique pump of course and all of these projects will continue to, we think, to drive the growth rate.
We have 130 ANDAs pending. So we do expect to launch a fair number of products in 2013. So all of those things
combined give us comfort that we can hit this double-digit growth rate plus we have a number of patent challenges that
are sitting out there that some, as I said the Lidoderm is included, but others are not. So the general way we've always
forecasted and modeled is the way you should think about it and we have a number of shots on goal that can achieve
that growth rate.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: If you kept your model exactly as is and removed Lidoderm, could you still grow in the year?
Or would you still grow...?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I think it – well, I'm not sure it would – yes, but I don't believe it would be double-digit.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Right, I get that. Okay, and then the second question is for Al. What's the right margin structure
to use for Anda in the future given some of the tweaks to your business model and removal of some of these what
sound to be one timers? And can you also comment on any opportunities presented by the Actavis transaction? It seems
to me that there could be some low hanging fruit on the revenue front. Thanks.
<A - Albert Paonessa, III>: All right, Gregg. Thanks for the second question. I usually don't get this many questions,
but caught off-guard to get the first one. But, Gregg, first-off on the Actavis piece, there will be some limited upside
overall and kind of well-diversified amongst the vendors outside of Watson. We did look at the overall product line that
Actavis has and we've never been in a situation where we try to move products directly to Watson, and it'll be the same
situation for Actavis. So we'll look at those on a one-by-one basis after the integration and it'll be business as usual until
then.
As for our overall margin, one thing I'd hoped to get out when Michael asked the question, the first question that I
didn't mention, is that our overall margin on the base business that we have has been consistent year-over-year and
quarter-after-quarter, and the business has also grown nicely those three quarters also.
Now as to the overall margin, as you mentioned, these are – we do have more new product launches that will happen
this year, a huge year for product launches. We've worked some agreements with some of our partners that we will be
doing more product launches than we had anticipated going into this year. And those have already shown up in the first
quarter. They will continue in the next three quarters, but – and they are low margin, there's no question, but over the
next three quarters they'll continue. But even though there's $38 billion that's supposed to come off-patent this year,
there's a lot of these are "Me too," so we will be doing a lot of launches at not as high of dollars for the rest of the year.
As for these one-offs that we're doing quarter-by-quarter, those are opportunities that continue to come to us. They will
be low margin, I really can't put a number on that. So the overall margin, we know we were quite low, in the 11%
range. This time, I believe it'll go up slightly, but I don't believe it will be back to the 17% range that – 15% to 17%
over the next couple of quarters.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thanks very much. First question, just coming back to Lidoderm, I know obviously you
remain very confident in approval here. Does the recent Actavis acquisition change your priorities in terms of the terms
that you would potentially look to get out of a settlement, if you chose to go down that route, or is this really viewed as
a really independent discussion on that product or decision on that product?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, Chris, that's a good question. I think people have thought about that. But we think of it as
a standalone opportunity much like we pursue all of our opportunities. There are – we will evaluate any offers and
discussions and possible settlements based on the risks that we perceive to getting the product launched. So it really is a
standalone decision. It is not related to our moving forward with the Actavis Group. So I hope that covers it for you.

<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Okay, great. And then, just a second question, while we're – I appreciate the comments
on Anda, but in light of this – again, this transaction that you're contemplating here, is there any thoughts on
monetizing Anda at some point down the line? I know in the past you've talked about this is a core asset, but again, is
that thinking changed at all with this transaction?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: No, Chris, it really doesn't. I think Anda is an integral part of the Watson Group and it is
becoming more important to us, particularly as we look for, as the world develops and specialty distribution develops,
as we look at biologics, as we look at additional brand products, as we look at direct to physician distribution, all of
these things, I think, will make Anda a continuing high value asset for Watson. So we do not have any plans to divest
that asset.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Okay, great. Thanks very much. And then if I can slip in one final question here,
generic Lipitor obviously getting – the post-exclusivity period becoming a very near term event. Any updated thoughts
in terms of how you see the dynamics of that market shaping up, kind of post-exclusivity? Thanks very much.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, it's Siggi here, Chris. It's going to be a tough market. We have said before we
expect around at least four to six players in the market. Our estimation is that the price will probably be lower than 4%
of brand drug price. So it's going to be tough on day 181, for sure.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from David Buck with Buckingham Research.
<Q - David George Buck>: First on generic Concerta, can you give us a reminder of what the step up is going to be in
terms of gross margin for 2012 and 2013? And then for Siggi, can you talk a little bit about what you saw in terms of
international pricing, Europe and what was the level of sales from acquired businesses year-over-year? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. Hi, David. I'll take the Concerta issue. We've that said when a first new launch – when a
new generic launches on Concerta, our royalty does increase and we've said substantially but we've not given the
specific numbers. So that's about the best I can do there. It's consistent with our agreement with J&J. But, Siggi, you
want to handle this?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, I think on the international business, we saw basically price erosion in line with
our forecast. I think the average price erosion in France was probably between 8% and 10%. That was the worst
market. You have to look at the markets individually. U.K. was better this quarter for us. In Australia, I think January
was fine, but obviously, 1st of April, there was this PBS reform on the price erosions. We had built that into our
forecast when we acquired Ascent and the price erosion that we saw 1st of April for Australia did not surprise us at all.
It's even a little bit better than we have built into our forecast.
I think for Greece, there is enormous price pressure in Greece, but there's also a volume increase at the same time. The
Greek government is working very hard to lower the healthcare cost overall and we are hoping that they're finding that
increasing volume is a much better way than pushing down the cost all the time. So we feel that overall, there is a price
pressure in Greece, probably to around the 10% figure at the moment, but we also see some significant volume increase
in the Greek market. In terms of revenue, we don't breakout the new market from the international revenue.

<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Hi. How are you?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: So if I take the midpoint of your guidance range this year, $5.55 to $5.80, tack on 10% for
standalone Watson 2013 and then add another 30% for Actavis synergies, I'm getting about $8.10. Is that the sort of
right way to look at that? And then secondarily, if you could talk about what the swing factors are to the high end of the
range this year, it seems that it's mostly in the brand – in the Global Generics business. If you could talk to some of the
specific swing factors, that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. I think I'm not going to comment specifically on the question about the number for 2013.
I think a number of people have done the math on this. We will provide you with very specific – or try to provide you
with specific numbers for 2013 and then guidance for 2014, when we close the transaction. We're going to try to avoid
giving specific answers around a dollar figure.
Regarding the swing factors, I mean some of that is the swing factor question, and the clearest, the biggest swing factor
of course is Lidoderm for 2012. We have Adderall, and obviously Actavis has an Adderall. So we've got – that's a
second swing factor that would affect overall accretion in 2013.
And then I think the other – the next biggest swing factor probably is growth in our international businesses. If you
look at the Watson business, it would be continued growth in Australia, U.K., France to a lesser extent, because it's
been such a challenging pricing dynamic there. Canada, we expect to see continued growth from the Actavis side. I
think their growth will come from a number of markets, but Central and Eastern Europe and Russia would probably be
the single biggest swing markets for them. So there's a lot of upside, a lot of upside levers in the combined company,
which is why we're so excited about it.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: So just, Paul, as a quick follow-up, remind me, I don't think your 2013 guidance – I think your
2013 assumes that there will be another generic Concerta on the market.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes. It does.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Early in the year. Okay.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes. It does, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: You bet.

Thank you. Your next comes from Frank Pinkerton with SunTrust.
<Q - Frank Henry Pinkerton>: Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question. Just have one on the branded pipeline. Can
you please outline for us kind of what you have there in development? I know you made some comments on Prochieve
earlier, but outside of Prochieve, what's there and ultimately how do you see that business? Does some capital need to
be deployed there to bring in some additional products or do you have enough kind of internal capacity to generate
R&D and sustain that business longer-term? Thank you.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Well, I think the most exciting project right now that's new is the Esmya project,
which is a product for reduction of uterine fibroids and the related bleeding problems. We started Phase III in the first
quarter. Paul mentioned in the opening remarks we should be completing that in early 2013 and then filing shortly
after. I think the larger change though with Esmya is that we intend to file it in Canada in the second quarter of 2012.

We'll be able to file it off of the European data, which should allow us to actually introduce the product in Canada prior
to when we introduce in the U.S.
Beyond that we have a vaginal contraceptive ring that is in the works. We have a progestin-only patch that has
completed Phase III. We're just having a lot of patients coming out over the next quarter and a half, and then we'll be
filing. We obviously have a line extension for Crinone and a series of other things and that's before we get to the
biologics. So I think there is a significant lineup here that puts us both in urology and in women's health and then
beyond that, the biologics, which we start to participate in very aggressively through both FSH, which we're doing, and
the Amgen relationship, which we're managing together.
<Q - Frank Henry Pinkerton>: Thank you for that – I am sorry go ahead, Paul.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. Frank, I was just going to talk about capital deployment, I was going to – consistent with
our desire to pay down our debt and de-lever quickly, available cash – well, we do expect to have available capital to
deploy and we would look to as a priority to look to continue to focus on our brand franchise. I think there is one
product that Fred missed that the Actavis Group is bringing to us and that's the MoxDuo product, which could be an
interesting opportunity for 2012 and well mostly 2013 as it probably will hit its stride in the launch cycle in 2013.
<Q - Frank Henry Pinkerton>: And then I guess just as a follow-up, thinking about the pipeline, because I know that
Actavis brings some things that were, like you mentioned with MoxDuo, but also they've historically had things like
some branded pain medications, some other things. Can you talk about what they potentially could also bring over and
would that change the way in which we've looked at – a long-term kind of contraceptives, women's health, urology
portfolio being larger? Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. I think as we look at our brand franchises, we continue to focus from a Watson
perspective on urology and women's health; however as Actavis brings, as you mentioned the – or as we discussed the
MoxDuo product, it's an opportunity to look beyond those two therapeutic categories and we will do that. Also the
Actavis Group brings some legacy brand products, some – I believe they are antibiotic products from Roche that they –
maybe, it's not Roche.
So yeah, you will remember that, but anyway some older products that are worldwide rights, we have worldwide rights
too. And those will be nice products to add to our franchises around the world. But, this does give us an opportunity to
look again maybe at the pain franchise and see if there is an opportunity there to get beyond just one product. Watson
was historically very strong in pain product development. You may recall we have NORCO and a few other brand
products. So a lot of thinking ahead to do but we're very excited about our brand franchise overall.
<Q - Frank Henry Pinkerton>: Thank you for the color.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: The only thing to add to that is that I think now we'll have a footprint where the
output from the R&D effort will make it so we have fileable applications and potentially commercial structure to be
able to put some of these products that we're developing on an international basis into the marketplace. We will be
evaluating those as one-offs as they come along, but before we didn't have that structure, so we have license, now with
the Actavis acquisition we should have that structure and should be able to put some of these products into the
marketplace more effectively.

<Q - Gary Nachman>: Just following on the brands, we saw some margin pressure in that business with a 3% segment
margin. Now that the biologics development will be in there for R&D, what's a reasonable target to think about for
margin in brands? Just remind us of the impact from increasing spent on biologics?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: The spending in the biosimilars on the R&D side will impact the margins going forward. I think
as you have seen in the past quarter our margin was down to 13.4%. We actually for the full year 2012, we're expecting
somewhere around 18%, 19% contribution margin from the brand business and then as we expand that – as we expand
our biosimilar spending going forward it will be further impacted by that spending, that R&D spending.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Okay. And then just for Siggi, could you talk about the expected contribution from the Ascent
deal and how much more will that business benefit from the Actavis portfolio leveraging a presence both in Australia
and Southeast Asia. Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. I think the Ascent we haven't broken up directly what Ascent delivers to Watson
numbers, but I think there is quite a significant synergies both in Australia, but also in Southeast Asia. I think Actavis
has a growing business in Australia, mainly focusing, they're also focusing on the hospital business, we own a company
in Australia called Willow. I think there is an opportunity between the two companies to have the whole range of
injectible oncology products.
In Southeast Asia, that's probably the fastest growing market for Actavis, they have a strong presence in Indonesia with
a manufacturing plant and quite a large portfolio, which we would see the opportunity of taking into the market we
acquired with the Ascent acquisition. But they also have been building presence in markets like Vietnam, where we
have a small presence through agencies, but they have their own up and running sales and marketing vehicles. So we
feel that this will help us both in Australia, but also in the South East Asian markets in terms of portfolio, but also in
term of low cost manufacturing from the Indonesia site.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.

Thank you. Your next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. Good morning guys.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: A couple of things here, I guess first of all with respect to Lipitor, Todd, can this help us
with what we should be expecting for the second quarter and also is the full year EPS contribution guidance still $0.75?
And then the other financial question I had is, with respect to tax rate expectations, is there anything changing for the
year? The first – the reason why I ask this is the first quarter was a little bit below what we were expecting.
And then, with respect to Prochieve, just wanted to get a little bit more of a framework for thinking about it, so when
you're meeting with FDA next, what are the realistic scenarios, both the positive scenario and the negative scenario,
just so we understand what's being considered here? Thank you.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: David, let me start on the Lipitor and then hand it over to Todd. I think what happens in
second quarter is that all the customers will start to lower their inventory and the anticipation of the further generic
competition on day 181. I think that day is around the 28th of May, roughly. So we see already that they're looking to
the inventory, to have as low inventory as possible at the end of the month to be able to take in inventory at the lower
price by the end of May.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: And we did give guidance of $0.75 for the full year as the contribution from generic Lipitor, we
haven't changed that view of the contribution from that product. It is going to be heavily weighted towards the second
quarter. We do expect some very minimal contribution in the second half of the year from generic Lipitor.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Tax rate?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Oh, in terms of the tax rate, we're looking it on a non-GAAP basis in the 36%, 37% range for
the full year.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: So your question on Prochieve is a good one, unfortunately we're not going to
give you good answer to that. We've kind of gone radio silent here, because we are in a good active discussion with the
agency. We think that's probably better handled behind the scenes with – between the sponsor and the agency. I think
you've seen the downside, which is, we've got a complete response. I think, obviously we're working to resolve that
issue and try to find the way for the market – for the product to get to the marketplace.
You have seen however some guidance changes that have happened out there, both the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Group
and ACOG [American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists] have put out guidances related to the screening
and then the use of progesterone for women with short cervix. So, the market is moving a little bit and now it's really
just a matter for us to find a way to have a product we're participating with.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. Here are my two: so with Actavis coming into the fold, does that change in any
way your long-term goal regarding getting brand revenue to near or over a $1 billion long-term and now with a
re-exploration of the pain space, are you looking at potentially any other therapeutic areas?
And then secondly, can you just remind us what key U.S. generic opportunities that, other than the obvious ones that
you're excited about for 2013, either date certain launches or cases where you think there is a high probably of launch?
Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. On our brand – on the brand question we do still have a target of $1 billion of revenue.
We might give Fred a little bit of a breathing space here and give him another year to get there, but we do anticipate
continuing to grow our brand franchise. I think it's critical for a company like us to have a balanced business model and
we need our brand franchise to continue to see growth that it has seen.
As to reexamining additional spaces, we will take that on, David. It is hard to – probably the hardest thing to do is find
the right brand opportunities, they are few and far between, there is a lot of people chasing these kinds of opportunities.
So we've been working very hard to identify the right kind of candidates, in the right areas. We still of course are
interested in oncology products that would overlap with the women's healthy and urology and any sort of ancillary
products that would fit within the hospital business as we now prepare for our biologic franchise to see the light of day
hopefully as early as 2015, 2016, 2017 in that range. Frankly, that's not that far away now. So, we've got lot of work to
do between now and then, but we think we're pretty good about that. As to – I'll hand it over to Siggi for additional
upside.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I think what we have – we haven't discussed in detail the pipeline for 2013, but we have
a significant pipeline both in the U.S., but also internationally. We feel that internationally we will have a good year
from esomeprazole; that will be the biggest single product internationally. It will be launched this year for sure, but it is
growing next year.
The portfolio in the U.S. is benefiting from the investment that was increased like four or five years ago. We have
pending quite a few of ophthalmology products, which we are working on, we haven't named them. But we think there
is an opportunity for ophthalmology. We also have quite a few other Paragraph IV, but we don't point out anything in
addition to the Lidoderm for next year.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay. When will you start pulling back the curtains on 2013, when should we expect that?

now a bigger group of products to discuss, so probably at the close.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yeah. Can you give us a little more color on the oral contraceptive business, both the branded
product, Generess? I mean, are you happy with the ramp so far and just how much effort are you putting behind that,
just give us the flavor there and how that is relative to the competition out there in branded OCs?
And then, on the generic side, I mean, the numbers seemed to be hanging in there pretty good, except, you know, you
keep guiding to the business kind of deteriorating more. We're seeing products getting approved by competitors, but
your numbers are hanging in pretty well. So just give us a little flavor on what's going on behind the scenes.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Actually, we're very pleased with the Generess launch and we've got a 6%
growth curve while the OC marketplace is actually going – the branded OC marketplace is actually going down a bit,
we've been able to steal substantial share from almost all the different players out there. I think we ended up being the
fourth largest brand OC out there at this particular point. The effort that we put behind it, as you've seen, has been your
traditional sales and marketing effort along with a whole lot activities that are going on in the social network. You have
not seen us on TV and probably will not and I think we're very, very pleased with the uptake of our Generess today.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I think Marc, on the generic OC, we obviously we are a little bit reacting to what other
companies are saying in the market. I think, quite a few companies are expecting approvals, they have been much,
much slower than we expect, that they expect and we expect. I think Glenmark has had the few approvals, obviously
Lupin, Sandoz and Qualitest have been in the market, but there clearly hasn't been any approval for Mylan at this point
in time. We've been hanging in there and we are doing quite well. We are obviously we are the leader in the OC market
with Teva and that gives us benefit. We have a much, much broader product range and that helps us in the completion
in the market, but clearly molecule by molecule we have seen price erosion when a new approval comes to the market.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Elliot Wilbur with Needham.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Elliot.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Question for Paul and Siggi, just switching gears a little bit maybe turning to the Actavis
business. One of the things I don't recall being discussed in the conference call announcing the acquisition is what
percentage of that business may be dossier based and thus an opportunity to transition manufacturing to internal means,
much as you plan to do with the Specifar business.
Then a second question for Todd, back on your Analyst Day, you talked about total R&D spend being up roughly 10%
or excuse me, the generic business being about10% and total being up 20% which would imply something like 40% or
50% for the brand business. I'm just curious within that brand spend, how much of that sort of ongoing spend versus
milestone based? Thanks.

<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Elliot, let me start to talk about the Actavis third-party business, they have a third-party
business under the name Medis. This is roughly about 10% of their overall revenue. They have quite a strong business.
They have about probably 70 active molecules, we have a license from them, but that also includes most of the biggest
generic companies in the world. This business, as we have said before, it's not growing. But it's flat, it's usually not
growing very fast.
So what you bring in is that you bring in new molecules, but at the same time there are some other older molecules that
are falling off on the other side at the same time because usually you get with the new development, you have a supply
agreement with the customer for a number of years. This is quite synergetic with our Specifar business. We acquired
Specifar last year and this was quite a significant portion of that. We see an opportunity for the combined company of
Medis and Specifar going forward, although probably not the fastest growing business of the combined company.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: And in terms of the R&D spend, for the full year on the brand side, non-GAAP R&D is roughly
in the range of $110 million, $115 million, and so the milestone based component to get to the GAAP numbers would
be another roughly $15 million for the full year.

And your next question comes from Shibani Malhotra with RBC Capital.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I've just got a couple. First is I was going through
your filing on the Actavis transaction and I noticed that you did have details on two products: suboxone and more
important, Adderall, in terms of contingency payments etcetera. I was just wondering why you highlighted these
products as potential for market entry in 2012 or 2013. And Paul, just based on the diligence you guys have done, how
confident are you that Actavis' Adderall can actually be approved and how does that compare with your filing? If you
could, just discuss that.
And then second on Lidoderm, do you expect the FDA to – to kind of provide us with some sort of response before
May 13 or do you think this is something that will drag on longer than that. Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. On the Lidoderm issue, I don't think we can predict what the Agency is going to do. I
think as I've consistently said, Shibani that if we have our application in a position where a tentative approval would
have been granted but for the Citizen's Petition, the Agency has maintained that they will not – they will toll the
exclusivity. So we won't – we won't get hit or dinged because we didn't get a tentative approval because of the
outstanding Citizen's Petition. And I also have consistently said, I think we're going to be in that position. So whether
we have a formal announcement from the Agency, I don't know, but if we do, we'll certainly pass it along and we'll
keep you updated on that.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Regarding the two products, as you look into the SBA you will see that the earn-out is an
EBITDA based earn-out, it's built off of a percentage increase year-over-year 2011 versus 2012. And as we were of
course in the process of negotiating these things, people then come to realize that it's very difficult, as we've always
said, to predict the timing of approvals. And you mentioned two products that are called out specifically. If in fact, the
way the things works out is it's based on 2012 EBITDA number, however, for a very short period in the 2013, if just
due to timing, those to two products got approved and launched, they would count toward achievement of the objective
for the earn-out.
So it was just a way to reconcile really the problem that we all have with – trying to figure out exactly when approvals
are going to come. So again, I wouldn't read too much into that, it was just a negotiated arrangement between the
parties with those two particular products, because obviously if they're both – if either one of those are approved, it
would be a fairly big deal for the Actavis Group in 2012.

<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Can I just push you a bit on that? Is there – I mean how different is their filing from yours, I
guess, how confident are you on their product versus your, if you're willing to comment on that?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well. I – sorry, I can't comment on it.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: We're still too early in the process, so that probably has to wait until we get closer to close.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. You bet.

Thank you. And your final question comes from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Co.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi Ken.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Good morning. Hey. How are you Paul? Thanks for taking the question. I just had a question
on generic Concerta and one of the competitors, CutCo, have you ever seen the PK profile for that product? Is J&J
allowed to share that with you during their litigation at any point?
And then also, I was wondering if you could set the baseline for us on Lidoderm and discussions in terms of where
they've been and are there any more going on? So I know, around Analyst Day, it sounded like there were discussions,
maybe you could just set baseline to where we are today if there is – if it's just radio silent? Thanks a lot.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. On the CutCo product, we have not obviously have not seen anything and Johnson &
Johnson has not shared anything with us. So that's an easy one.
As to discussions with Ando, we've had discussions with them, we continue to have discussions with them. As – well,
so far, they've not been fruitful, but we will continue to discuss as long as we can until something comes up, like an
approval or court decision and that's sort of stuff. Obviously one of those events would obviously further change the
dynamics of the conversation, but we will continue to have discussions with them as long as they are prepared to do so.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: You bet.
