Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone.
Thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. If I can ask you to turn to Slide 4.
This morning we announced another quarter of strong results, both on the top and bottom line. Virtually every financial
measure is up: price, volume, EBITDA, operating rate, cash flow, and earnings. All demonstrate continuing
momentum.
We remain firmly on the path we laid out at the beginning of the year, and we are delivering the financial performance
we promised.
The best proof-point that our strategic agenda is the right one is the continued strength in our performance businesses,
which delivered more than 70% of the EBITDA for the quarter. And we believe this performance will continue as
momentum continues in a positive direction for a sustained global economic recovery.
Here are some high-level takeaways from the quarter. Operating earnings were $0.54, up more than 10-fold from the
year-ago period and up more than 25% sequentially. This was driven by sales gains of 26%, with significant increases
in both price and volume. EBITDA increased to 1.9 billion, up more than $300 million.
And EBITDA year to date is up nearly 50% compared with the same period last year. Our performance businesses
again showed strength, and continuing momentum with EBITDA up $175 million sequentially, excluding Health and
Agriculture. A number of these businesses delivered EBITDA margins at or above our normalized targets, and are at
pre-recession or better levels, including Electronic and Specialty Materials which has now surpassed 30% for four
quarters running.
Others include Architectural Coatings, which achieved 19% EBITDA margins in the quarter. Elastomers delivered 16%
EBITDA margins. This was the largest piece of our Performance Systems segment and has delivered at levels between
15 and 18% for the last five quarters.
Our Epoxy business, driven by continued growth in Electronics, and our continued shift to higher margins, specialty
grades in Asia delivered 20% margins; and Polyglycols is more than 20%, to name a few.
At a division level, our Advanced Materials earnings in the first half are nearly back to the pre-recession levels of first
half 2008.
For the entire company our overall EBITDA performance is particularly notable given a $1.6 billion increase in
purchase feed stock costs, and a $100 million increase in planned turnaround costs. We also had several major
unplanned outages that were completely unforeseen, and this cost us an estimated lost sales opportunity of more than
$300 million or at least $0.07 in earnings per share.

While we clearly lost sales and earnings opportunities in these unplanned events as well as in our turnarounds, we did
not compromise the safety of our operation, and took the necessary time to repair them, despite the difficulties created
in our supply chains and our customer base. We operate a safety first/production second mindset at Dow, and our drive
to zero global safety goals will always come first. The good news is that these outages and turnarounds are now behind
us, and we have returned to normal levels.
And specifically in our Coatings business, our performance was dampened by severe global industry supply constraints
coupled with our own previously mentioned unplanned outages. This limited our ability to fully capture volume
growth. These results were clearly disappointing to us. Even so, the segment showed double-digit sales gains in the
quarter and our outlook is very positive moving ahead.
When you exclude the impact of turnarounds at outages, we surpassed the $2 billion-mark in EBITDA, bringing our
first half run rate to nearly $4 billion.
These are levels not seen since the pre-recession period in 2008.
In terms of demand, emerging geographies posted volume gains at a rate nearly double that of the total company.
Performance segments led the way overall driven in particular by Electronics Materials which was up 27%. This
demand improvement pushed our global operating rate higher as well, up year-over-year and sequentially, to 86%,
excluding planned turnarounds.
Turning to the balance sheet, we delivered a more than $1 billion improvement in operating cash flow. Also notable,
our net debt to EBITDA run rate exiting the quarter was 2.4. This represents a 14% decline sequentially, and is less
than half the level of April 2009.
We are well on the way to achieving our balance sheet goals by year-end.
If you can turn to Slide 5 it brings me to milestones. We are making tremendous progress on these on both a
year-over-year, and sequential basis.
Financially, the earnings power of the new portfolio is already here today. Our performance businesses comprised
nearly two-thirds of sales and three-quarters of EBITDA for the quarter. Operationally, we delivered synergy and
structural cost reductions of $325 million.
In just six quarters, we have achieved more than $1.8 billion in cost savings, significantly improving the company's
operating leverage, again, well ahead of our commitments.
And strategically we achieved several note-worthy milestones. We are forming a chlor-alkali joint venture, securing
critical raw materials for our downstream performance businesses at a lower cost and with less capital outlays. We have
now shed more than $5 billion of non-strategic assets, well ahead of schedule, and we achieved a stair-step reduction in
our net-debt to total capital ratio, moving from 49% to 46.5%, and we are now well on our way to achieving our goal.
We did all of this while maintaining our focus on growth, investing more than $400 million in R&D in the quarter.
And today, together with Saudi Aramco, we announced that our proposed joint venture project to build a world-scale
integrated manufacturing facility for performance products, plastics, and performance systems businesses is now
entering the final stages of the FEED study. We expect this work to be completed in mid-2011.
Together, we have also confirmed that the planned site location for the project will move to Jubail Industrial City, the
largest industrial complex of its kind in the world. This new venue provides the benefit of extensive existing
infrastructure, and significantly enhances the capital efficiency of this project. It also provides the perfect platform for
us to deploy our successful value power concept, like we have at our Dow central Germany facility and other large
Dow locations. This project aligns perfectly with our strategy to invest in key emerging regions, and ensures our
downstream businesses have the competitive building block products they need to grow.
If you can turn to Slide 6, speaking of growth, I also want to highlight that we have achieved a run rate of $684 million
in growth synergies from our transformational Rohm and Haas acquisition. This represents a 30% increase versus last

quarter, and we continue to make great progress towards our 2012 target of $2 billion.
Let me mention a few examples achieved in the quarter. Dow Coating Materials recorded new wins with surfactants in
Asia. We led a new business with a leading multi-national consumer products company, delivering new innovative
formulations for hair care applications. We won new business in the oil and gas sector in Latin America. A leading
consumer products company has adopted our new household cleaner technology. A world-class petroleum additives
company is now using our enabling chemistry to bring new technology for automotive lubricants to market.
Now I would like to turn to a high-level view of the geographic and market demand trends that drove our performance
in the quarter. Please turn to Slide 7.
We saw broad-based recovery in global demand in a wide variety of end markets as momentum continued from last
quarter. This was evident in our volume growth across the entire company, led predominantly by the combined
performance businesses, which were up 12%. Emerging geographies collectively posted volume gains nearly double
that of the total company.
Here are a few examples of why our portfolio is well positioned to capture this momentum. Electronics end markets
continued to perform well, driven by demand for flat-screen technologies and semiconductors. Automotive end markets
further strengthened in North America and Asia. Our Specialty Materials and Adhesives and Functional Polymers
businesses benefited from strong demand in Latin America.
From a geographical perspective, both North America and Europe continued their growth. And finally, we saw
continued demand gains in Asia, particularly in our Electronic and Specialty Materials segment, which was up more
than 30%. As you can see, fundamentals remain strong across a wide variety of high-growth sectors.
Of course, we also experienced some challenges in the quarter, notably the unplanned outages, especially in the
Coatings value chain, as well as the unfavorable weather patterns in North America and Europe, which impacted results
in Dow AgroSciences. Overall, these challenges have been more than balanced by the broad-based positives we're
seeing.
Now Bill is going to give you some more detail on how these trends drove our results in the quarter. But as I reflect on
the quarter, I would say there are a number of areas in which we excelled, and clearly a couple of specific areas where
we could have done more. Putting it transparently, we were firing on seven of our eight cylinders in the quarter. We
know where the issues were for the eighth cylinder, and we now believe we have them fixed, so we can go even
further. We remain firmly on the earnings trajectory we laid out at the beginning of the year.
So let me now turn the call over Bill, who will provide more details on our results.
Bill Weideman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Andrew.
Turning to slide 8, reported sales were 13.6 billion, an increase of 20%. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales
were up 26%, driven by volume growth of 7% and an increase in price of 19%.
EBITDA excluding certain items was up 327 million to 1.9 billion. Earnings, excluding certain items that totaled $0.04,
were $0.54 per share.
Before I discuss results at a segment level, let me cover Dow's operating rate and the impact of turnarounds and
outages. Our operating rate continued to improve, reflecting sustained demand growth. Excluding the impact of
planned turnarounds, it was up 8 percentage points year-over-year.
The second quarter is typically a high period of turnarounds, but this quarter was unique in several ways. As Andrew
mentioned, we had more planned turnarounds than usual in the quarter, up 100 million versus the same quarter last year
and up 150 million compared with the first quarter.

We also faced a number of unplanned outages, particularly in the coatings value chain. This resulted in lost sales of
more than 300 million. The estimated EPS impact was about $0.07 per share.
Now let me turn to price and volume. Overall volume growth was 7% with our combined performance segments
delivering a 12% increase. Volume grew in all segments except Basic Plastics, which was down 7%. It also grew in all
geographies except Latin America, which was down 3%. Both of these declines were primarily due to an unplanned
outage at our facility in Bahia Blanca.
Excluding Basic Plastics, volume was actually up 9% in Latin America. We experienced particular strength in North
America and Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and this marked the second consecutive quarter of growth in these
geographic areas.
Turning to Slide 11, we also achieved price gains across most operating segments in all geographies. In total, price was
up 19%. Again, North America and Europe, Middle East, Africa, delivered the strongest performance as price was up
20% and 21% respectively.
Now turning to our segment overview on Slide 12. In Electronic and Specialty Materials, recovery continued in
Electronic end markets, particularly in Asia, where the business saw volume growth of 25% or more across all its
business units. This was driven by sustained high utilization rates at chip foundries, strong demand for consumer
electronics, and high operating rates at major flat panel display manufacturers.
Our Electronics business recorded several wins in the quarter and placed its next-generation vision pad technology with
a large Japanese customer. Our Water business also continues to achieve volume growth in all geographies in its
ion-exchange resin and RO membrane business lines.
Turning to our Coatings and Infrastructure segment, Dow Coating Materials grew sales 10%, and expanded margins
sequentially due to price increases and lower raw material costs, despite monomer supply issues in the quarter. We also
saw a double-digit sales increase in our Building and Construction business, with particular improvement in insulation
products led by our STYROFOAM brand insulation.
And finally, our Adhesives and Functional Polymers business achieved double-digit volume growth, with the strongest
improvement seen in Asia and Latin America.
Moving to Health and Agricultural Sciences, this segment experienced solid volume improvement due to ramp up of
new Ag chems as well as gains in seeds, traits and oil business, which included the successful launch of SmartStax
technology. This segment continues to hold significant growth potential going forward, and Antonio will provide more
detail shortly.
Performance Systems saw improvement across all geographic areas and in every business unit. We are benefiting from
a strong rebound in automotive end markets, particularly in Asia and North America. And demand for our technology
differentiated products used in acoustics and body-structure applications grew in excess of 25%. And in Formulated
Systems, energy efficiency and infrastructure applications drove growth in the quarter.
Finally on this slide you see the primary drivers in Performance Products. Volume growth was recorded in all
geographies except Asia, where our performance Polyurethanes business shed low margin sales.
Other key drivers of this segment included strong demand in electronic laminates in our epoxy business, and demand
growth in our polyglycols, surfactants and fluid business for heat-transfer fluids used in solar power applications. In
Basic Plastics on Slide 14, double-digit price gains in all geographies drove performance. Notably strong industry
demand for polyethylene continued, primarily in North America and Asia.
However, our overall sales were negatively impacted by the previously mentioned outage in Latin America. And
finally, in Basic Chemicals, recovery continued in the alumina and pulp and paper industries, which drove price up
year-over-year.

Now turning to our joint ventures. Equity earnings were up significantly. This was driven by our joint ventures in
Kuwait and by Dow Corning, where demand in silicones and polysilicone segments has returned to pre-recession
levels. Equity earnings were down sequentially from the record levels of last quarter, due to planned turnarounds at
MEGlobal, EQUATE and Kuwait Olefins Company. Before I wrap up, I would like to highlight our tight control on
working capital. DSO was 46 days, down 1 day versus the same period last year. DSI was 67 days, down three days
from a year ago period.
We reduced inventory units by 3% versus the same period last year.
Our CapEx spending was under 400 million, and we remain on track toward our $2 billion goal for 2010. Cash flow
from operations was 1.3 billion, and free cash flow was 650 million, up nearly 1 billion versus the same quarter last
year. Our net debt to total cap declined 250 basis points to 46.5%. Progress here reflects our 1.9 billion decrease in net
debt driven by proceeds from the Styron divestiture and our operating cash flow generated in the quarter. Please note
that for modeling purposes, you should expect a $1 billion quarterly impact on revenue from the Styron divestiture. Our
net debt to EBITDA multiple improved to 2.8, and we are at a run rate of 2.4 exiting the quarter.
Finally our progress on cost synergy and restructuring goals. We have now surpassed our 1.3 billion run rate target for
cost synergies associated with the Rohm and Haas acquisition two quarters ahead of schedule.
That wraps up my review, now I would like to turn it over to Antonio for a discussion on key growth and profitability
drivers for Dow AgroSciences.
Antonio Galindez, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow AgroSciences
Thanks, Bill.
And I'm glad to be here today to talk about Dow AgroSciences, growth strategies and our technology progress. First, let
me discuss the quarter, where we encountered some short-term headwinds our growth strategy remains on track. We
predicted early in the year that crop protection market conditions would reach a normalized level this year, meaning
that 2010 would look a lot like 2007, which was a more stable year in agriculture versus the two previous years.
The good news is that the first half of 2010 we increased EBITDA by more than $90 million, versus 2009. And
compared with the same period of 2007, our EBITDA was over $40 million higher.
This takes into account more than $150 million of additional growth investments we have made in R&D and SG&A.
And these investments are paying off.
For example, our new product launches illustrate our technology power as sales from new Ag chemicals are up more
than 40% in the first half of 2010 versus last year. Another area of progress is our seeds portfolio. We reported a 15%
increase in first half sales over last year's.
These gains are a direct result of new products such as SmartStax, our biggest biotech launch ever, as well as our
outstanding cotton varieties, the strength of our germplasm in Latin America, and the performance of acquired seed
companies. However, these wins were masked in our results for the quarter due to the price pressure in commodity Ag
Chem products and poor weather conditions in the northern hemisphere, which limited some product applications. So
while the quarter was not well respected, we did improve our results versus last year, and 2007, and we believe the
long-term fundamentals of this industry are strong.
Why? Because growth in this sector will be driven by the need of an increasing amount of feed, feed, and even fuel.
The agriculture industry must produce more food with limited land, less water, and fewer resources to feed the
population that will reach 9 billion in 2050. There is a global consensus among leading institutions about the challenge
of feeding the world. Here is a fact from the Coalition of a Sustainable Agricultural Workforce (sic) [Coalition for a
Sustainable Agricultural Workforce] , I quote: over the next 40 years, we must produce more food than has been
produced over the past 10,000 years combined.

Technology is one of the answers, and it is a critical one. Where we expect some short-term market challenges as
supply/demand dynamics balance out for commodity crop protection products there is no doubt the need to enhance
farmers' productivity is a critical challenge.
Please turn to Slide 19. So let me talk about our Ag Chem pipeline, which is the best we have ever had. We continue
launching new proprietary agricultural, chemical solutions that contribute to our growth objectives and generate cash
flow. For example, sulfloxaflor insecticide will open new markets for us in 2012, and we have new herbicide and
fungicide solutions coming next that are very promising.
In total we expect new product sales to reach $500 million this year. It's up 25% from our original estimates of $400
million. And we are projecting this number will grow to $800 million by 2013.
Our portfolio strategy is one of balance between biotechnology and crop protection, and our seeds and traits advances
are truly exciting. Today we have SmartStax which is the only, I repeat, the only commercially available product
approved for a 5% reduced structure refuge requirements for both below and above ground pest. We had a very
successful launch. In fact we sold out everything we had planned to and more. Our SmartStax Refuge in a Bag concept
will extend this leadership by providing the convenience that growers want, combined with the best technology. And
we have the next industry break through with our DHT family of traits. We already submitted DHT stacked corn for
regulatory approval in September of last year, and the soy bean trait was submitted in December.
We will continue hitting all of our technology milestones while increasing channel access through licensing,
collaborations, and bolt-on seed acquisitions. Combined with the launch of SmartStax and both Refuge in a Bag and
DHT on the horizon, we are on our way to reach our goal of having a $1 billion global corn business, and achieving
double-digit share of demand in North America. And our collaborations in key row crops will capitalize the growth of
the seed, traits and oil platform. We will move the mix in our portfolio closer to our 50/50 vision, versus its 15% level
today. We will do this not by making Ag Chem smaller but by making seeds and traits larger. In summary, we are on
track to deliver our targets as we continue growing the top and bottom line in an industry where long-term
fundamentals are compelling. We are achieving our new product sales targets, and most important, key R&D
milestones while investing in a strong pipeline products and capabilities. Thanks, and back to you Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Antonio, for sharing your insights regarding Dow AgroSciences growth. The long-term fundamentals for
this sector remain strong, and we will continue to execute our build and collaborate strategy.
In the time that remains, I would like to provide some granularity on our expectations for the back half of the year, so
let me first start with the ethylene chain. If you look at Slide 22, there has been a great deal of discussion recently
regarding the supply and demand dynamics of ethylene. From our perspective, fundamentals have not changed. We
have long discussed that margins would likely contract in the second half of this year, as new capacity comes online,
thereby defining the trough. The reality is this new capacity is not ramping up as quickly as some predicted, and this
effect, plus unplanned outages, which always occur in this industry, coupled with 2010 GDP forecasts that continue to
project stronger growth than expected, makes for a better than expected scenario, and we are seeing that today,
evidenced by the strong first half our Polyurethanes business delivered.
On slide 23, you can see that this growth is due to real underlying demand, and can be seen in North America at
different places in the value chain. At the converter level, railcar days at destination are down about 20% versus the
long-term average. And at the producer level, the ACC June data confirmed a 200 million pound draw down, which
dropped inventory by five days. Both are strong proof points that industry inventories remain at low levels. .
As I mentioned this underlying demand was evident in our tremendously strong performance in the first half of the
year, where we averaged $700 million of EBITDA per quarter. On Slide 24, we had the most competitive ethylene and
polyethylene business in the industry. Plus as mentioned last quarter, our U.S. assets will continue to benefit from the
unfolding and positive domestic shale gas dynamics. We expect other factors like new fractionation capacity that is

coming online this year and next to the tune of 7% each year will even further improve the competitiveness of our U.S.
cost position.
So while we continue to expect some margin contraction in the second half, we believe these positives will mitigate the
downside. As a result, we could see profitability in the polyethylene business decline by only about $150 million in the
third quarter. Our view is that our PE business will be entering peak-margin territory over the next few years, and that
the exiting from the trough will occur late 2010, early 2011.
This decline in polyethylene in the second half, as modest as it is, will be more than made up by our new portfolio of
businesses which will capitalize from the ongoing positive macroeconomic fundamentals and increasingly gain market
position with new technology offerings, and will continued pricing power.
On Slide 25, I turn to our overall outlook. With another quarter of top and bottom line growth delivered, we are
confident that momentum continues to build in the global economic recovery. Our U.S. macroeconomic view remains
guardedly optimistic, and we see continued demand growth from both business spending and a slow return of the
consumer albeit at a tempered pace.
In other industrialized regions, particularly Europe, monetary stimulus continues to provide support against headwinds
such as tighter fiscal policies. And in the emerging world, especially Asia, we will continue to see strong growth.
From a sector perspective, there are many areas of strength; electronics, consumer staples, food, pharmaceuticals, and
personal care, are all showing signs of growth. And in electronics, global tech spend willing continue to be robust,
benefiting from a combination of increased business investment and consumer-led demand as we ramp for the
end-of-year buying season.
Transportation has been robust and should see a more typical seasonal decline as the industry once again prepares for
new model launches.
The good news is year-over-year, we expect continued strength.
In construction, while the commercial sector remains challenged, we expect programs in the U.S., such as Home Star,
to provide incentives that will boost residential improvements and drive demand higher. We continue to see this sector
as a key indicator to a robust recovery.
If you turn to Slide 26, placed on these aforementioned strong geographic and sector fundamentals, we expect high
demand for our products in our downstream market-driven businesses, as well as in our polyethylene business. As you
can see the vast majority of our portfolio is perfectly positioned to capitalize on these trends.
And just to mention some specifics for you. Our momentum in electronic materials continues. We recently started up a
new OLED facility and are building a new R&D center, both in Korea.
Asia is the largest market for coatings in the world, and we are investing in additional emulsion plants that will meet
growing demand. Our new STYROFOAM brand insulation continues to gain market share and we have received DOE
funding to develop the next generation of advanced insulation systems.
Also, we broke ground on our joint venture manufacturing facility to produce lithium ion batteries for next generation
hybrid and electric vehicles.
Our elastomers businesses announced today a technology breakthrough that expands capacity for polyolefin elastomers,
and positions us to take full advantage of future growth.
And just last week, the EU announced that it has approved biotech corn products enabled by our leading trait
technology for import. And as you heard me say earlier, today we announced a huge joint venture with one of the
world's leading companies going to the next step. Our Saudi Aramco partners and ourselves will move to the final stage
of engineering design of what will be one of the world's largest free-standing industrial complexes.

These are just a few of the many examples that bode well for our ability to outpace the overall economic recovery, and
drive our earnings growth, and reward our shareholders.
Let me wrap up, if I can with our priorities if you turn to Slide 27, for the second half of the year.
We remain focused on executing our strategic and financial plan. From a strategic perspective, we are well ahead of our
revenue growth goal, and have already exceeded our year-end growth synergy run rate with more to come.
Operationally, we surpassed our commitments to deliver our Rohm and Haas acquisition cost synergies and reduce
structural costs.
Financially, we exceeded our two-year divestiture goal ahead of schedule, and are on track to deliver our net debt to
cap and free cash flow targets.
In summary, our earnings trajectory continued once again this quarter with our robust innovation pipeline, our broad
geographic reach, and our leadership in high-growth, profitable sectors leading the way. We remain focused on
realizing the full potential of our new portfolio and lean cost structure while executing on our innovation engine. We
believe we have the plan, the people, and the technology to deliver continued earnings growth for our shareholders. I
will now turn the call back to Howard.
Howard Ungerleider, Vice President, Investor Relations
Thanks, Andrew.
That wraps up our prepared remarks. For your reference, a copy of these comments will be posted on Dow's website

Now we'll move on to your questions. Before we do, though, I'd like to remind you that my comments on
forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and to anything that
may come up during the Q&A. Lisa, would you please explain the Q&A procedure.

Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - David Begleiter>: Thank you, good morning.
<A>: Good morning, Dave.
<Q - David Begleiter>: Andrew in your seed business did you gain share in corn seed this year in North America? And
what was the actual amount of your SmartStax acreage sales this year?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: One of the best parts of this call is I have
Antonio right here. Over to you Antonio.
<A - Antonio Galindez, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow AgroSciences>: Yeah, we have – in our
business in corn, it's early because we are waiting for the returns, but we are convinced we have gained share. We have
slightly gained share, remember we start from a much smaller part thanks to SmartStax, and thanks to our portfolio
today, we have sold everything we have on the SmartStax today. We also gained significant market share in our cotton

business. In the U.S.A. we had 10% market share last year. We believe we have grown more than 3 points in that
market, over 13%. And – and in our seed and traits volumes has grown 20% this year. So that's where we are. We are
looking forward for the launch of – continued launch of the SmartStax next year. We think we'll have SmartStax in
about – you know, close to 50% of our grain hybrids next year, and the challenge in launching a new technology is it
takes time to build up the production, but we are very pleased with the results of the SmartStax. We haven't disclosed
Bags at this moment, but we are very pleased with the launch this year. We sold everything we had.
<Q - David Begleiter>: Antonio, in crop chemicals is the pricing pressure in your view structural, or secular or just – is
it transitory in its structure?
<A - Antonio Galindez, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow AgroSciences>: I think there are a number – I
don't think it's structural. I think there are a number of – there are a number of factors that have put together – come
together this year. If you take the high-inventory level, you take some supply and demand on balances on the
commodities side. You take the weather conditions in some places in Europe and North America. You put all that
together, and coming from the increases in prices in '08, '09, all that together put even more pressure than what was
expected in the pricing market. So it has been tough this first half. But I don't think it's structural. I think, you know,
you look – as we go forward I think the second half will settle. I think we're going to see still pressure in the second
half, but as we get into 2011, I think it will be balance, and then we'll go into – which expected in this segment, which
is a more balanced, slow growth over the next couple of years as [inaudible]. Now, in our case, we have the new
products, and our new products are helping us to, I will call, outperform the market, and grow, and, you know, and we
look to our EBITDA results we're very pleased as the growth over '09 and '07.
<Q - David Begleiter>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sergey Vasnetsov>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Sergey.
<Q - Sergey Vasnetsov>: Andrew, I want to talk about volume gains. They were quite noticeable, but at the same time
quite a bit lower than for many of your other peers, and I actually I was quite pleased to see your results, that even in an
absence of strong volume you were able to deliver the results today that you talked about. Can you comment besides
outages were there any other factors this quarter?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we really – Sergey there's a couple of
major factors here. We had lost sales as I said, both Bill and I talked about.
That was about 3 percentage points on volume. And Styron, no one factored that into the forecast. You know we sold
Styron, closed at mid-June. So that's another percentage point, so we would have seen 11% just on our like and like
basis if it was – didn't have these unplanned outages. I can't stress enough how strong an impact these unplanned
outages were across our chains.
And Coatings had a great quarter, but actually would have had a much better quarter. If you look at other peer groups
or even look at downstream from us, our customers, they all reported strong numbers. Our Coatings numbers were
strong, but would have been much stronger, more in line with what they reported, and that alone would have bumped
up the volume significantly. Plus planned turnarounds hit us, we would have had an operating rate of 86% if we didn't
have the planned turnarounds, forgetting the outages themselves. And in fact if you look at the number of plants that
were down for the quarter for various periods of time, 120 of our 600 plants were down.

That's a big impact to any company and I would tell you that therefore going forward we see very good positive volume
momentum, Sergey. We are not concerned. These were one-time events. They are over with. We fixed them. The plants
are running safely, as I said on the call. So frankly, as you say, we see the positive of the point even though of course it
didn't help us in the quarter.
<Q - Sergey Vasnetsov>: And so to follow-up it's good to hear you being optimistic on Saudi Aramco joint venture.
And by the way, congratulations on the progress on this important project. Dow has also additional promise and large
project coal to chemicals in China. And so I'm just wondering if Dow could undertake both giant projects in the same
timeframe of let's say 2012 to '15?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the most important part of that – thank
you for your comment on Aramco – is, these are sequenced for different mixes. One is in market and competitive
because of coal, that's the China one. One is export oriented because of where it's located and access to feed stocks of
the oil and gas kind. The key on sequencing for us is a equity light structure and the building blocks. If had built a PO
plant on our own, that's $1 billion. The fact that we can make it part of an industrial complex where we are partnering.
And in the case of Aramco, 35% will go to the public, so we'll end up – 30% will go to the public. We'll end up owning
35%. You end up getting more bang for your capital, in this case equity buck. So we believe the way it will sequence is
the next several years we'll get the Aramco project, the Jubail project, up and running in the mid-part of the decade, and
the China project will come in the latter part of the decade.
<Q - Sergey Vasnetsov>: Thank you.
<A - Howard Ungerleider, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thanks, Sergey. Lisa, next question.
Operator
Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Paul Mann with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Mann>: Thanks, yes. You mentioned feed stock costs were up $1.6 billion, but prices in your Performance
Products and Performance Systems were up 20 [inaudible] and, respectively. Could you quantify the EBITDA effect of
the feed stock [inaudible] those divisions. And secondly, PetroLogistics, I believe, got a new propane dehydrogenation
plant, marching up I think it's this quarter, perhaps even last week or this week which should ease propylene prices a
touch. But I believe you've got a supply contract that may result in cheaper propylene going forward. Can you just talk
through that arrangement and what effect it might have on your margins going forward?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, exactly on your first question, Paul, we
believe we had a 2% hit to our EBITDA margin based on the situation between price on propylene – the most
important thing on propylene is the arbitrage between U.S. and Asia didn't work in our favor in the quarter. Normally
U.S. propylene is discounted by about 20% versus Asia. We had exactly the inverse through the quarter. Asia
propylene stayed artificially low, and in fact the spread at the beginning of the quarter was $0.21, versus exiting the
quarter was $0.07. So in essence, U.S. propylene was artificially high, and we believe that will return equilibrium in the
third quarter, which will allow margin expansion in our performance businesses to come true in the Q3 versus what we
were expecting in Q2, so we will play catch-up in the third quarter. So that really takes care of the whole issue of
margins and performance businesses in the second quarter.
In the third quarter, this whole point you made on the PDH unit, yes, 1.2 billion pounds starting up in August. We're at
50% of the offtake, this will help us enormously on propylene competitiveness in the United States, and enable us to
have margin expansions. And the related effect, the fact that we had this propylene arbitrage, the fact that we didn't
have the ability to export to Asia also hurt the previous question on volume. We lost volume in Asia because we
couldn't successfully export because of the propylene arbitrage, which was an extra point of Sergey's earlier question.
And last but not least we are taking care of it not just in the U.S. but in Asia with the start-up of our big propylene
derivative facility in Thailand next year. So that will take care of our propylene structural imbalance in Asia. All of the
remedies are in place, and should handle the questions you asked.

Our next question comes from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Koort>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Koort>: Andrew, is it fair to say based on that prior comment that you would expect all eight cylinders
will be firing in the second half of the year?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You can count on my commitment to that point,
Bob. Look, I'm not able to stop the unforeseen, so you've got to give me a little bit of respite on a bit of a stutter. But
that cylinder was not there because of unplanned outages and that was really something that frankly disappoints, but
having said that, we are already past the fix. We won't have any unplanned outages – we won't have any planned
turnarounds in the third quarter of any substance, only a few minor ones compared to the very big ones we had in the
second. We are – frankly have the propylene arbitrage in the right direction. And unplanned outages are over with.
We've got some allocations still going on, but we're satisfying all of the customers we need to satisfy.
<Q - Robert Koort>: And if I can just clarify the propylene comment. I guess we saw U.S. prices were marked down
very aggressively. Are you suggesting they weren't marked down as aggressively as what happened in Asia?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Correct. Exactly what I'm suggesting. And if you
look at the comparables for us, year on year propylene was up $300 million, sequentially it was up $40 million. So on
average it was up. Now if you do the trajectory through the quarter, the velocity of the propylene price coming down
through the quarter in the U.S., but the average didn't help us. And that particularly hurt because of the Asia number
being so much lower than the U.S. number, so we couldn't actually raise prices successfully in Asia at the speed we
needed to, nor could we export. So we had a double whammy, and I don't believe any of you guys had that in your
models. And, frankly, our businesses have been block and tackling that throughout the latter part of the quarter. And
already are on top of it for the third quarter.

Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna International.
<Q - Don Carson>: Yes, thank you. I want to follow up on Ag with Antonio. Antonio in your Slide 21, you talked
about, you know, a longer-term goal of 10% share in U.S. corn market, and you are only about 4% right now. I know
you have done some acquisitions, you have got a germplasm venture with Dekel, but do you have the pieces in place
that you need to get from 4% to 10%? Or do you need to make a major acquisition? And then just as a housekeeping
item, what was the year-over-year impact of the glyphosate downturn on your earnings?
<A - Antonio Galindez, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow AgroSciences>: Well, let me go to the second
one in a second, but on the seeds on the corn side, we need to have a few things. The first one is we need to have the
best technology available in order to succeed to get to that 10%. We're on our way. We have SmartStax, we'll have
Refuge in a Bag in two years, and we'll have the SmartStax plus the best herbicide trait come in, the first one to come

in 2012, 2013. So from a technology point of view, I think we are enabled for that. You take the germplasm, and we
have invested significantly. We are very pleased with the advancement we are getting, and we also have the Monsanto
exchange of material in germplasm this coming [inaudible].
You know, the bolt-on acquisitions we made, they are performing today. Will we make more? We are looking for
them, and we will continue to look for it. But it's not a major acquisition where we believe it's going to take us to 10%.
It is all this together plus some of the collaborations we are doing and so on is what is going to take us there, we are
confident that we will get there. But all of those things need to happen. And that's the reason we are significantly
investing in resources in R&D at this moment in that area.
In relation to glyphosate, like I said, took a big hit. That was 50% of the price declines of – drop of this quarter, and
obviously as we told you before, glyphosate for us is 5 to 10% of our sales, but the price drop was significant, and it
took 50% of our numbers.

Our next question comes from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments.
<Q - Peter Butler>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Peter.
<A>: Morning, Peter.
<Q - Peter Butler>: If you guys are hitting on all eight cylinders, does that mean we can expect a restoration of the
dividend? Dow stock and the dividend are well below previous levels?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Peter, the dividend question has had
discussion on our Board. We are clearly, clearly very mindful as a Board – this is a Board decision – that we are not
where we need to be long term. Having said that, our primary responsibility has been of course to ensure that our
capital ratios are intact, our balance sheet is intact and the economic growth that we are now starting to see is intact.
I believe the power of the portfolio, as you look at the next year or two, will enable your question to be answered in the
affirmative. I can't promise that, but that's certainly something that is top of mind for the reasons you raised.
<A - Bill Weideman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, Peter, Bill Weideman. Just to
add to that – to Andrew's point. Our priority continues to be – first priority is to pay down debt. But if you look at our
EBITDA for the quarter and you adjust for these, our actual EBITDA was closer to a $2 billion number. And if those
continued going forward with an economy, we certainly have a lot more options going into next year.
<Q - Peter Butler>: Okay. Your press release noted that the Rohm and Haas integration was going – was seamless, I
guess, was the way you put it. But I – in talking to some of my Rohm and Haas sources, it looks like almost all of
Rohm and Haas's key managers have left. Obviously including Pierre Brondeau and Raj Gupta. But also their key top
associates.
And maybe the result short-term is you have better earnings due to cost reductions, but in a people-intensive business,
this could be a huge problem longer term.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I would agree with you, Peter, if these
individuals that left – and each one of them was an individual decision – was the sign of something bigger. But if you
look at Guillermo Novo running, for example, our Coatings business today, Carol Eicher running our Buildings

Solutions business. If you look at Neil Carr, who is running our Adhesives and Functional Polymers business and
Packaging Business – these are just three names, top of my head, of legacy Rohm and Haas's who have stayed with the
new division, who are firmly believing in the potential and the growth of the division.
I could go more. Cathie Markham in our Electronics division. I could go to Dominic Yang in our Electronics division
as well. I can give you name, chapter and verse of all the people who have stayed. In fact, of the top 70 leaders of
Dow's Advanced Materials division, 50% of them are legacy Rohm and Haas.
High-profile departures will always happen. They happen on the outside. We will always lose good people because of
the nature of being a good company. It happened in your generation. You saw Enrique Sosa left, if I recall.
So good people will leave for their reasons. Pierre wanted to be CEO. He is doing a great job over where he is. And I
can go on and on. We are not concerned. In fact, we are over-delivering on the growth synergies.

Operator
Our next question comes from John Hurt with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q>: Yes, hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q>: Just a quick question on Electronics. Your pricing was down about 1% year-over-year. Can you shed some light
on which areas saw the biggest price declines?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It pretty much – I mean I don't think, Howard,
unless you have got some adds on this one, I don't think we saw anything notable.
<A - Howard Ungerleider, Vice President, Investor Relations>: No, I would say, John, it is really normal for that
segment to have essentially flat pricing.
So what happens is it's a fairly quick life cycle business. As you know every two or three years, we're changing over
the whole product wheel. And what happens is we bring in new products at higher price, and then over time, as those
products mature, they come off. But nothing out of the ordinary. In line.
<Q>: Okay. And your volume growth in electronics was pretty strong, yet your volumes were up about 5% in Asia.
Can you talk about what maybe drove that?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I mean we had some pretty big new wins
in semiconductor technologies, interconnect technologies. And interestingly enough, some of these wins in new
complete product areas don't show up yet as big volumes, but they will.
And if you look at some of the things that are going on in Asia, we have extended our trimethylgallium capacity. You
won't see that volume yet, but it's about to start up. We also have wins going on in the photo resist area, with the 193 in
particular, in those applications. You won't see that turning up. I think that's the sort of stuff that we are so excited
about. We have Electronics at 30% EBITDA margins without being at the volume levels they were two years ago, with
all these new wins going on.
We are defending our CMP business. We have kept our 80% share there very successfully. But it's pretty hard to grow
from an 80% share point. So real volume gains in Asia, in particular, are from the new businesses.
<A - Howard Ungerleider, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yeah, and John, just to follow up, to give you a
little bit more granularity, electronic materials in China was up 32%.

Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin McCarthy>: Yes, good morning.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Kevin McCarthy>: Andrew, in addition to the Aramco joint venture in Saudi, you announced a fairly sizable
chlor-alkali JV with Mitsui at Freeport. I was wondering if you could comment on the strategic rationale there. And
whether or not that is likely to replace existing some capacity to be rationalized on the Gulf.
And second piece of it, if I may, with regard to your existing chlor-alkali assets, should we expect Dow to seek a
partner for those businesses as well?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, thank you, Kevin. The strategy is very
clear, and that is we have basically backed our way into a large complex in Freeport and a smaller complex in
Plaquemine, Louisiana. And those two complexes exist in chlor-alkali to serve our downstream businesses, businesses
like Antonio's.
70% now of our chlorine footprint, with this announcement, will do that. The 30% that doesn't, over time, you can
expect to see us find answers to that in an asset-light, equity-light construct. And so over time, we'll see more of that in
the developed geographies, in particular, like our North American assets I just mentioned, but also our European assets
where we own 100%. And we are backing out of merchant EDC and we only are in EDC for fly-wheel purposes or to
serve downstream VCM, PVC customers like the Shintechs, like the Matsuis.
So our intent is to keep driving to the point you are making, use the chlorine, and have a competitive chlorine molecule
for our downstream value-add businesses.

Can you comment further on the timing of those outages? I mean, here we are in August. I know you said everything is
back up and running. But was there some leakage into the third quarter?
And was that $0.07 negative impact, was that predominantly in Basic Plastics? I think you said maybe Coatings also
had some of that. Can you give some more color on those outages?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I would say, Frank – thank you for your
comment on Dow's operational excellence. And I would totally, 100% underline that we are very focused on these
particular incidents as one-timers for very one-time reasons.
If I take the three major ones, the Bahía Blanca incident was totally based on water shortage. Nothing to do with plant
operating. We just – the site could not get water. So we were down for a month of the quarter, which is a big impact for
us in Latin America. And actually, if you look at our results in Latin America, outside of that, we did great in Latin
America, so – but it's just such a big part of our business down there. So as a consequence, that one had nothing to do
with operational excellence.
The other two, we had a very unfortunate incident in one of the heat exchanges in the phenol plant. Very tough duty –
actually hasn't happened to us before. So we did the root cause. It's fixed. But that affected the entire downstream
coatings chain.
And then the biggie was the MMA incident that we had down in Deer Park. Now Deer Park is the only legacy Rohm
and Haas site that is a petrochemical site. Frankly, we have had to pull all of our people over Deer Park to let it run to
its potential, and that's why safety first, pound second. We have taken the opportunity to root cause investigate not only
MMA, but the entire acrylics production units there so that they run to Dow standards. And that's in essence what
answers that question.
They're all one-timers. Two-thirds performance, one-third PE. So the impact was in Coatings and Infrastructure, in
particular, but also in the other Performance Products. We believe the $350 million of lost revenue as a consequence is
a one-timer.
<Q - Frank Mitsch>: And that was all in the second quarter?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, sir.
<Q - Frank Mitsch>: All right. And in terms of these very strong results on the Basic Plastics side, you talked a little
bit about JVs in other areas. Can you give an update on potential JV activity on the basic commodities side?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we have, as we said on the last call, we are
definitely very interested in a PE asset-light, equity-light strategy for the right reasons, with the right partner, for the
right competitive advantage on existing assets and new assets.
The Aramco announcement is a new asset. The Kuwait investment, the expansion down there is a new asset. But over
time, we believe our relationships with those two places as well as other places will yield an opportunity for us in
polyethylene existing assets.
We are driven to get an answer there, but we have a new-found competitive advantage with U.S. shale gas that helps
us. This will, once we execute that strategy, we will do it at the highest possible valuation going into peak earnings,
rather than living through trough earnings. So you'd expect us to time it better and right versus right now. And it will
help tilt our portfolio more to specialty, which will decline the volatility of the portfolio.
<A - Howard Ungerleider, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thanks, Frank. Lisa, next question.

Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi, thanks very much. It seems that the largest difference between your results and results
of comparable companies is the growth in Latin America and Asia. Even if your Asian results are dimmed down by a
couple of percent, most companies are reporting 25 to 40% volume growth. And in Latin America, most companies are
reporting 15% plus. So is there – and you said that your Electronics business is doing exceptionally well.
So what is really the source of the slowness in these regions compared to North America and Europe, where you seem
to be doing better than your competitors?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Actually, if you exclude our incidents, the ones
that I just referenced on the previous call, Latin America – you take Latin America Electronics. If you look at versus –
year on year – 27% up. If you look at Coatings and Infrastructure, 14% up. Performance Systems, 22% up.
Even Perform Products that had some of the issues, 13% up. So truly Latin America was very impacted, Jeff, by the
polyethylene issue with Bahía Blanca.
If you look at China, Electronics up 32%, as Howard already referenced. There, we had more of an impact than we did
in Latin America because we have less in-market assets.
So the big export opportunities that were propylene derivatives – acrylics, polyurethanes, epoxies – were all very tilted
to being impacted in the emerging world, where we import those products in. As I mentioned already, our Thai
complex and ultimately our Saudi complex would take care of that, because these are assets dedicated for the Asian
growth. But we were disproportionately affected compared to our competitors because of – in particular in Asia, this
propylene arbitrage I mentioned.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: What was the operating cash flow in the quarter?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Bill?
<A - Bill Weideman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: The cash flow from operations in the
quarter – from operating activities was 1.2 billion, and our free cash flow was a little north of 600 million, which is
about a $1 billion improvement over same quarter last year, and also prior quarter. And we actually did use operating
cash flow to pay down part of the 1.9 billion debt in the second quarter.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Thank you.
<A - Howard Ungerleider, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thanks. Thanks, Jeff. Lisa, we have time for one
more question.

And our last question comes from Hassan Ahmad with Olympic Global. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q>: Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Hassan.
<Q>: Quick question about the commodity side of the business. Of late, we have been hearing obviously a fair bit
about Iran in particular, and the couple of stories that seem to be coming out are, first and foremost, trade sanctions.
Obviously reduced trade because of that. Secondly, issues of companies with regards to garnering letters of credit and
the like.
And finally of late, we have been starting to hear about potentially a privatization of NPC. And if at all that happens, an
escalation of the gas price regime over there.
So as one thinks through all of these different elements, in your mind, how do all of these things sort of click together
when thinking about near- and medium-term sort of supply/demand balances?

<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think all the points you made, not to repeat
them, we would agree with, Hassan. And on top of that, add an extra point, which is implied in your question, which is
at the end of the day, competitive-priced gas, and therefore ethane, in the Middle East, has a very short timeframe.
Now when you look at crackers being announced in that part of the world, they'll be mixed feed crackers, and using
NGLs and maybe naptha. As a consequence of that, you are going to find that everyone is going to start having a rising
tide on gas and ethane price. And the NPC privatization and change in the gas price structure there, which we believe is
also inevitable, will change the – if you like, the competitiveness of those crackers, vis-à-vis product making its way
either to Europe and in particular to in-market crackers in Asia, in particular in China.
So I believe that's why our Aramco joint venture is so important. It's really going to be one of the last large complexes.
And the way we've designed that with Aramco is to tilt it to performance businesses. Propylene oxide, epiklorhidrine,
crylic acid, all these businesses that are building blocks that can take advantage of the competitive feed stock being
both gas, NGLs, and some naptha. I think there will be less and less of that available out of the Middle East.
<Q>: Super. And a quick, quick follow-up. Again, sticking to the region. This morning, there was some sort of
speculation about the Kuwaitis looking at BP's chemical assets. Now as one thinks about that, how should we think
about your arbitration that is going on over there or even potentially the Kuwaitis revisiting [inaudible]?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I can't speculate on a speculation. I think you
would appreciate that, Hassan.
But we are very good joint venture partners with the Kuwaitis. We have this issue, which is being arbitrated. We're still
very positive about that. We believe we have a strong case. It doesn't affect our existing assets there. It's being done
with all the right procedures. And early next year, we should have an outcome.
And of course, as Kuwait PIC seeks to expand, we always get asked and talked to and it has to fit our strategy, up to
and inclusive of whether they want to buy into any of our assets.
<A - Howard Ungerleider, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Okay. Thanks, Hassan. We're going to have to end
the Q&A at this point.
Howard Ungerleider, Vice President, Investor Relations
I would like to turn it over to Andrew just to make a couple of closing comments.
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I would just wrap up by thanking everyone for the call and the questions.
We also believe that we some issues in the quarter, we weren't very happy with them. We did fix them. We also believe
we had a strong quarter. We actually look at all of our key indicators, we had momentum in demand, margins,
EBITDA, cash flows, synergies. Advanced Materials is outperforming, our synergies are ahead of schedule, and we
have good strength in a lot of our other businesses, including Basics.
So I would say to you that going into the next quarter we believe our outlook is good, our business is strong, and we
have margin momentum, and we can deliver on the R&D and innovation promise of this new portfolio. So I would say
that we've got the issues behind us, and we're into the second half of the year with strength.
Howard Ungerleider, Vice President, Investor Relations
All right. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest as always
in the Dow Chemical Company. And we look forward to speaking with you more soon.
