O. B. Grayson Hall
Good morning and thank you all for participating in Regions' first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Simply put,
this has been a quarter of significant accomplishments. In fact I would characterize it as a pivotal quarter with Regions
now fundamentally stronger, strategically focused and well positioned to grow our franchise profitably. We certainly
still have plenty of work left to fully accomplish our goals but the past quarter's results position Regions well.
Let's look at the key milestones that have occurred over the past few months. We successfully completed an
approximate $900 million public offering of common stock. The overnight offering was significantly over-subscribed
and priced at a premium from the previous day's close. Our equity rates follow the results of the Federal Reserve's large
bank Capital Analysis And Review. There were no objections to our plan demonstrating what we believe is the strength
of our capital planning process.
Subsequently a major credit rating agency upgraded Regions, restoring us to investment grade status and attributing the
upgrade to improving profitability, positive asset quality and capital trends. Also we completed the sale of Morgan
Keegan, which closed on April 2, reducing our overall risk profile and improving liquidity and capital. And finally on
April 4 we redeemed the entire $3.5 billion of series "A" preferred stock issued in U.S. Treasury. On an ongoing basis,
the redemption eliminates the payment of preferred dividends as well as the amortization of the discount, which cost us
in total $214 million or $0.17 per share in 2011.
In addition to these important milestones, we also achieved broad-based asset quality improvement, providing strong
evidence that we are at a long awaited inflection point in overall credit quality trends. Plus, we continue to demonstrate
disciplined progress in improving customer service quality in all of our business locations. Further, Regions' first
quarter earnings from continuing operations were a solid $0.14 per diluted share. And despite seasonal factors and
legislative headwinds, adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income approximated $419 million, a level that we believe will
mark 2012's quarterly low point.
We're off to a very good start in 2012. And given our recent capital accomplishments, as well as the ongoing successful
execution of our business plans, Regions' outlook for the full year is encouraging.
There's no question that the first few months of the year have been busy and eventful for Regions. We've accomplished
a great deal and all these actions serve to enhance our overall risk profile and allows us to focus on core fundamentals.
As a result we're a fundamentally stronger company that has encouraging momentum. Let me turn the call over to
David who will provide first quarter's financial details, after which I'll return for some closing comments before
opening the call up for questions. David.
David J. Turner
Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide three with a quick snapshot of our first quarter
2012 financial results. We reported net income available to common shareholders of $145 million or $0.11 per diluted
share. And income from continuing operations totaled $185 million or $0.14 per diluted share. A net loss from
discontinued operations of $40 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, is attributable to an increase in professional and
legal fees. Pre-tax, pre-provision income, or PPI, was $438 million, as reported. Net interest income declined linked
quarter, however net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 3.09%. Non-interest revenues increased 3% on a linked
quarter basis and non-interest expenses, excluding fourth quarter's goodwill impairment, were up 5%. From a credit
standpoint, net charge-offs were down 23% and the loan loss provision declined 60% from the previous quarter.

As you can see, our first quarter results from continuing operations were solid, reflecting core business strengths and a
marked reduction in credit costs. We do expect this quarter to be the low point for PPI. Unless I note otherwise, my
comments will focus on results from continuing operations, excluding good will impairment in the fourth quarter of last
year, as we believe this provides a clearer picture of fundamental trends.
Now let's start with asset quality on slide four. In the first quarter we experienced broad-based asset quality
improvement. Virtually all credit metrics improved during the period and most should continue to do so throughout the
year.
Notably, first quarter's loan loss provision was the lowest in more than four years. Net charge-offs were down
significantly, resulting in a decline of $98 million or 23% linked quarter and exceeded the loan loss provision by $215
million. Inflows of non-performing loans declined to $381 million, or 32% from the fourth quarter's $561 million.
Non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $221 million or 9% linked quarter and $936 million or
30% year-over-year.
Total non-performing assets declined $1.3 billion or 33% from prior year. Also, it's important to note that nearly half of
all Business Services' gross non-performing loans were current and paying as agreed at the end of the quarter. This is
up 11 percentage points from a year ago.
Notably, Business Services' criticized and classified loans continued to decline with criticized loans down 6% or $391
million from the fourth quarter and down $3.2 billion or 35% from one year ago. As a reminder, criticized and
classified loans are one of the best and earliest indicators of credit quality. Our allowance coverage ratios remain
strong. At quarter end our allowance for loan and lease losses to non-performing loans stood at 118%, up 15 basis
points from last year. Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance to loan ratio remained strong at 3.3% at the end of the first
quarter.
Bottom line, we continue to make significant progress on asset quality and from almost every metric observed, you will
find improved credit quality at Regions. However, each quarter has its own unique characteristics and some volatility
should be expected going forward due to the uneven nature of the economic recovery.
Now let's look at our balance sheet trends starting with loans on slide five. Ending loans for the first quarter were down
$874 million or 1% linked quarter and the loan yield decreased 6 basis points to 4.29%. This decrease in yield primarily
reflects the impact of previously terminated balance sheet hedges. Ending earning assets however, increased 2% linked
quarter attributable to growth in the investment portfolio, which I'll discuss in a moment.
Investor real estate balances reflect a favorable decline of 6%. At quarter end balances stood at $10.1 billion which is
down $4.7 billion from one year ago. This portfolio now comprises 13% of our total loan portfolio, down from 18% a
year ago. We expect this portfolio to continue to decline at a more moderate pace.
Mortgage balances declined 1% linked quarter, reflecting our continued strategy to sell fixed rate conforming
mortgages. The company also experienced additional loan declines in the home equity portfolios as consumers
continued to refinance and/or de-leverage. Regarding the credit card portfolio, balances were down slightly on a linked
quarter basis, however, we do expect growth later this year once we assume servicing of the portfolio and control the
customer experience.
Commercial and industrial loan demanded remained healthy in the first quarter, driven by our specialized lending
groups. On an ending basis, loans grew $576 million or 2% fourth to first quarter. While growth was broad-based
geographically, we experienced particularly strong growth in southwest Texas in the energy industry, as well as central
and west Tennessee in the healthcare industry.
Pipelines have also picked up as customers continue to make capital expenditures and, to some extent, build working
capital. Line utilization on commercial and industrial loans was up 45 basis points linked quarter.
Indirect auto continues to be an area of growth as loans increased 5% linked quarter and we now have almost 1,500
dealers in our network. Total consumer loan production totaled $2.3 billion in the first quarter. We've been disciplined
and judicious with respect to capital deployment. As a result of our capital actions and credit ratings upgrade we are in

a better position for our balance sheet to work harder for us in the future.
Loan balances should end the year relatively stable compared to the beginning of the year as loan growth and CNI in
non-real estate consumer should offset more modest declines in investor real estate. On the liability side of the balance
sheet, as shown on slide six, deposit mix and costs continue to improve in the first quarter. Average deposits were up
1% linked quarter, driven by a $1.6 billion increase in low cost deposits, partially offset by a $721 million decline in
CDs.
Given our continued success in growing low cost deposits, average time deposits fell to 20% of average outstanding
deposits, down from 24% a year ago. This positive mix shift resulted in deposit costs declining to 37 basis points for
the quarter, down 3 basis points from fourth quarter and 22 basis points from one year ago. On a related note, our total
funding costs improved 3 basis points linked quarter to 65 basis points.
However, we expect to be able to drive additional improvement in deposit costs. We've approximately $4 billion of
CDs that are scheduled to mature in the second quarter that carry an average interest rate of 1.1%. There's an additional
$5.2 billion at 1.9% that will mature in the second half of the year. This compares to our current average going on rates
for new CDs approximating 25 to 30 basis points.
Now let's turn to net interest income on slide seven. Seasonal factors, including day count, along with a residual effect
from previously terminated derivatives, reduced net interest income on a linked quarter basis. For the quarter taxable
equivalent net interest income was down $22 million or 3%. However, the resulting net interest margin was up 1 basis
point to 3.09% which was impacted by declining deposit costs, gains on previously terminated balance sheet hedges
and a decline in low yielding cash reserves at the Federal Reserve.
We are optimistic about the course of net interest income and net interest margin over the balance of the year. As
always, the course will depend on the trajectory of interest rates and prepayment levels, particularly in the investment
portfolio.
In order to utilize a portion of our excess liquidity we purchased approximately $3 billion of investment securities
during the first quarter, almost $2 billion in agency guaranteed securities and $1 billion of corporate bonds. We are
focused on ensuring that we can retain flexibility to adjust the size of the investment portfolio in all rate environments
if more attractive loan opportunities arise. We believe these investments will increase the aggregate earnings of the
portfolio and also protect the investment portfolio from the negative impact of higher interest rates. Consequently, in
the first quarter the remaining excess cash reserves negatively impacted the margin 13 basis points, an improvement
from fourth quarter's 14 basis points. In addition, the impact of non-accruals on the margin declined 3 basis points to 10
basis points in the first quarter.
Let's turn to non-interest revenues on slide eight. First quarter non-interest revenues were up 3% linked quarter. As
expected, service charges declined modestly by 3% or $9 million linked quarter, despite the negative impact of
regulation "E" and debit interchange legislation.
These results demonstrate our ability to quickly adapt our business model. We've been able to successfully mitigate
these hurdles by generating new revenue streams and through the ongoing product restructuring of deposit accounts. As
a result of these changes we expect to completely mitigate this legislative impact over time.
Mortgage banking revenue was particularly strong in the quarter, aided by the government's HARP 2.0 program which
is serving to increase refinance volume. Revenues were up $20 million or 35% over fourth quarter. We estimate HARP
2.0 will add over $1 billion to our full year 2012 mortgage refinance volume. As we evaluate the mortgage refinancing
opportunities we believe our capacity to handle refinancing activity more expeditiously is enabling us to take market
share. We anticipate that mortgage revenue will continue to benefit from HARP 2 in the near term, but will moderate
over the latter part of the year.
Moving on to expenses on slide nine, non-interest expenses were up 5% linked quarter, however expenses were down
2% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we experienced a seasonal increase in expenses primarily related to an
increase of payroll taxes as well as an annual subsidiary dividend of $13 million. In addition, we experienced an

increase in pension and 401(k) related expenses. This increase was offset by a reduction in certain credit related
expenses, in particular other real estate and held-for-sale expenses.
Combined, these expenses improved $19 million or 56% linked quarter. And this is an area where we are making clear
progress. We also reduced head count during the quarter and over the past year we've experienced a decline of 737
positions or 3%.
As we've noted before, we will continue to seek expense savings without compromising prudent investment
opportunities or sacrificing the high service levels our customers have come to expect and deserve at Regions. In fact,
this quarter we are rolling out new technology to our teller platform that will leverage image technology to support a
streamlined process for associates and customers. This will also enhance our cross-sell abilities and allow tellers to
interact with customers in a way they were not able to before.
We continue to focus on process improvement, technology investments and improving operating efficiencies. Looking
ahead, we expect overall 2012 expenses from continuing operations and excluding goodwill impairment to be slightly
down from the 2011 level as a result of our continued and disciplined focus on expenses.
Turning now to our strong capital and solid liquidity on slide 10, as a result of our capital actions and events this past
quarter, our Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 14.3% and our Tier 1 common ratio increased by 110 basis
points to 9.6%.
Adjusted to exclude the government's preferred investment, the Tier 1 ratio was 10.6%. At quarter's end our pro forma
Basel 3 Tier 1 common and Tier 1 ratios were 8.9% and 12.5% respectively and are above the proposed policy
minimums.
As a quick reminder, as a result of the series "A" preferred stock repayment earlier this month Regions' second quarter
net income available to common shareholders will be impacted by the acceleration of the accretion of the discount
associated with the repurchased shares. The charge associated with the accretion is expected to be approximately $70
million.
Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remains solid with a loan to deposit ratio of 79% and cash held at
the Federal Reserve totaled approximately $5.2 billion at quarter end.
Lastly, based on our interpretation, our liquidity coverage ratio is above the 100% Basel 3 requirement.
Overall this quarter's results show the significant accomplishments that we've made on several important fronts. We've
substantially enhanced our asset quality. We've proven that our core business performance is sound and we further
strengthened our balance sheet from a liquidity and capital standpoint. And with that I'll turn it back over to Grayson
for his closing remarks.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, David. Let me close just by quickly recapping the notable accomplishments of the past few months. We are
pleased that a number of significant events are now largely behind us. We've raised capital, selling $900 million of new
common stock. We've completed the sale of Morgan Keegan. We've repaid the government's preferred investment.
We've made significant strides in addressing our asset quality issues, as confirmed by the notable improvement in asset
quality metrics. And we continue to deliver excellent customer service while investing in new technology and process
improvements.
As a result of these actions we can now focus more of our resources on fundamentals and on executing our business
plans and growing our franchise. I am proud of the progress we've made and I believe the second quarter of 2012 marks
the start of a new chapter for Regions. We look forward to a shift in focus where the emphasis will be upon profitable
and prudent growth. I am confident that we've the right business plans in place and the talent to execute successfully.
I'm also increasingly optimistic about the opportunities ahead, even in what we assume to be a relatively slow growth

We are committed to taking advantage of these opportunities and deliver improved high quality results to our

Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Jefferson Harralson of KBW.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Jefferson.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Good morning, how are you? Great to talk to you guys today.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Thank you.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: I'm surprised to be first. Okay. Can we talk about the ability possibly to have a 1% ROA?
You guys have always had a 1% ROA in the past but you have a balance sheet that's $19 billion smaller than peak,
you've got $21 billion less loans than peak. Can you get to 1.0 ROA on this size balance sheet with this expense run
rate?
<A - David J. Turner>: Jefferson, what we've kind of guided to is that over time we believe we can be in that 1.0% to
1.2% ROA. The question is timing and clearly as the economy improves our ability to attain that level is more
achievable. We are continuing to look at credit. We had substantial improvements in credit. But that's going to be
uneven. So we need to continue to focus on credit as well as having our balance sheet work harder for us now that
we've received our ratings upgrade and we're outside of TARP. So we'll start to working towards those, that range of
ROA that I mentioned, it's just timing.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Because Jefferson, as you look at it we've been in a very defensive posture over the last
few quarters from a capital and liquidity perspective and we do believe we're at the point that we can move a little more
off of defense on to offense in terms of prudently generating new business. We do see the opportunities starting to
increase for us in our markets. Obviously, our strengthening position will help us from a competitive perspective.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: All right. Thanks, and my follow-up, David, you mentioned you were optimistic about
spread income and margin. Does that mean that you think that most likely they will both move higher from here
throughout the year?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, we do believe that because of our deposit re-pricing opportunities that I mentioned, that
our margin will -- you will see improvement in our margin throughout the year.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Just some follow-ups on the net interest income. It seems like the securities that you added
were done towards the latter part of the quarter. So I'm just wondering what the full run rate benefit of that would be as
we think about 2Q and beyond.

<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Matt, we really haven't given guidance quarter to quarter. What we said is we expect
that, if you look at the year, that -- and it goes back to Jefferson's question really, that we expect our NII and margin to
be improved over where we were in 2011. So that's back-end loaded and it's back-end loaded primarily because of the
deposit costs, but also to the point that you brought up, getting the balance sheet working harder for us really didn't
begin in earnest until receiving the ratings upgrade and having the TARP repayment.
So you saw a little bit of that movement in the repositioning of the investment portfolio. So it will take to the back half
before you start seeing it.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: And as we think out a little bit longer term, I realize the credit rating boosts will help, and if
more come that will help more. But if we look at the cost of your long-term debt, it's still pretty high especially versus
your other funding, and given your low loan to deposit ratio, how do you think about remixing the funding over time
and what that might mean to the NIM beyond this year?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, we have a couple of maturities that are coming up this year and next year; we'll have to,
we continue to watch our credit spreads. They are coming in. They are still wider than we expect and hope for over the
long-term. We do have a pretty low level of long-term debt compared to our equity, especially compared to our peers.
But we will look for opportunities to take advantage of our tightening credit spreads and to the extent we see
opportunities to refinance, in particular we've one series of the trust preferreds that are 8.8%, we'll be looking at that in
particular.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: All right. And then just separately, if I may, obviously credit was better than expected
pretty much across the board. What stuck out to me was the reserve release was quite large and I guess, being sensitive
that the credit metrics can be choppy, you talked about being uneven, yet you were confident enough to bring down a
lot of reserves. So do you feel like we're past the point where you kind of have two or three good cores of credit and
there's a little blip that ends up maybe catching some folks off-guard? So maybe we'll still be choppy, or uneven, but
fewer bumps or smaller bumps?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Matt, I'll make a few comments and I'll ask Barb Godin if she'll add to this. But what we've
seen is we had a very good quarter from a credit quality metrics standpoint. Our allowance methodology has been a
pretty rigorous process that clearly over the last few quarters has been enhanced and strengthened. And we're very
rigorous about sticking to that. The metrics all look very positive this quarter. We do anticipate some level of
unevenness. But clearly what we're seeing, absent any unexpected economic shocks, that the credit quality trends will
continue to be favorable. But we're going to stick to our process. We're going to stay disciplined in the way we look at
credits and the way we look at the allowance methodology. Barb.
<A - Barbara Godin>: Matt, as we think about the allowance as well, as we've been making progress and strides on
putting on better quality credits and rolling off those weaker credits, that too has a positive impact against our
allowance needs. And as it relates to what we expect for further quarters the only guidance I would give you is let's
remember that for each of the last couple of years in the third quarter we see a seasonal bump. There's no reason I
wouldn't anticipate that this year, albeit I'm hoping it would be muted from prior years, but it will be clearly choppy as
we come out, and as Grayson said, we are going to follow what the economy does.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: And Matt, if you look at -- the most problematic segment of our portfolio has been the
investor commercial real estate, down 32% over a year ago. Ended the quarter at roughly $10.1 billion. But if you get a
little more granular into that portfolio you see that construction is down over 50% in that portfolio and is now slightly
under $1 billion dollars, $955 million. You look at some of the more problematic groups, the land, single family and
condominium, down 40% year-over-year. And all of those components, land's down slightly under $800 million, single
family is about $800 million, and condo's down to $130 million. So, as you look at the make-up and composition of
that $10.1 billion, it continues to be a stronger story.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies & Company.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a quick couple questions on the expense side. David,
can you break out for us what part of the salaries increase was related to pension costs that will stick around for the
year, versus the FICA and stock option stuff that will tail off?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, let me answer it maybe a different way than you asked it. If you look at the expense run
rate from the first quarter and you try to figure out what is kind of the seasonal component, there's $35 million to $40
million of that number that you would not expect to recur going forward. So you can put that in your model and that
will get you an approximation of --the question you just asked.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And my follow-up on that is then also, credit related expenses were really nicely lower.
And I just wanted to ask you to walk us through some color on that and also have we now, in that line also now gotten
back to a nicely lower run rate or could that still be lumpy and episodic?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Hey Ken, it's Barb Godin. I'll answer that question. As it relates to what we're seeing in our
OREO expense there's less write-downs that we're taking due to appraised values coming in, we're seeing some
bottoming in some of our markets. In fact, in a handful of markets we're actually starting to see some rates starting to
move in the opposite direction. And beyond that we've simply just not put as much into our ORE portfolio so therefore
overall expenses have tailed down nicely, and again we'd anticipate that they should, absent any large moves to ROE,
should stay low.
<A - David J. Turner>: Ken, I would add that we did have some gains in transactions, related to held-for-sale and
that's a function of our aggressive write-downs we've taken. The market, as Barb mentioned, in some cases is
recovering and we're seeing quite a few buyers come into the market looking for these assets. So that's helped bolster
prices. Get a little concerned to try to give you too much guidance as to where that could go in the future. I think we
need to be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves trying to predict that. So that's going to, that's one of the uneven
things we want to continue to watch. But our OREO and held-for-sale portfolios have now gotten down to a relatively
small level and so the volatility with that shouldn't be that great.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And then one just quick final one, just coming back to the NII story. I just want to
understand that first to second with average earning assets, the – you've gotten rid of the $3.5 billion of TARP and
you've raised the $900 million. That's a net reduction of $2.5 billion or so. So do we still have a step down to come just
from balance sheet side before we then see the second half growth?
<A - David J. Turner>: I think averaging can mislead you a little bit. That's why we put into the prepared comments
that our ending earning assets are actually up 2%. So I think you ought to look at that as maybe a better indicator of
where things could trend.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Right. TARP was – right, but TARP was after the quarter end.
<A - David J. Turner>: That's right. And so we had the money sitting in, at the Federal Reserve.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: At quarter end.
<A - David J. Turner>: At quarter end, so we utilized our excess cash at the Fed to make that repayment.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Understood.
<A - David J. Turner>: [indiscernible] (34:25).
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Couple questions. One is on the liquidity pool and the opportunity to redeploy that into
securities and loans. If you could put into effect all the excess liquidity that you hold today into the weighted average
portfolio that you've got in securities and loans, what's your estimate as to how much that would improve the NIM?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Betsy, I think if you looked in kind of round terms, you're talking about a 13 basis point
reduction due to that excess liquidity. Now getting back to Ken's point, we've utilized some of that excess cash post
quarter end so our excess cash is down closer to the $2 billion, $2.5 billion range today. And we would look to continue
to deploy our excess cash in the most meaningful way. We obviously would rather deploy our balance sheet into loans
more so than we have in the investment portfolio. That grew close to $2.5 billion and we'd much rather put it into loans,
but we want to put it into loans that have the right risk profile and are properly priced.
So we are continuing to look for those opportunities and will -- what you will see over time is that we'll have more
aggressive plays on our balance sheet now that we have our ratings upgrade, in particular looking at our investment
portfolio, just an example is our deployment of $1 billion this past quarter into the corporate bond portfolio. It takes a
little more credit risk, helps us to meet the extension risk that we have in the investment portfolio from rising rates. And
those things over time will help us from an NII and resulting NIM.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. And then separately, I hear the improvements in credit and then I also hear your
prepared remarks, comments about volatility, and expect some lumpiness or bumpiness. Is that lumpiness or bumpiness
that you're expecting really because you need to say that just for legal reasons, you're -- obviously it's unsure 100% it's
what's going to happen, because the trajectory looks like things are obviously getting better on the credit side?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well I think that clearly when you look at the first quarter we had some very strong
improvement in our credit metrics. I think that, we've been in this cycle so long. We're going to always be -- if we're
going to err, it's going to be to the side of caution. And we do spend a lot of time stress testing our portfolio and
forecasting what we believe the future to be. But we tend to always sort of anticipate that it could be somewhat uneven
or bumpy as you recall. And Barb, you may want to add to that.
<A - Barbara Godin>: Thank you. Betsy, as well, if you think about last year, a year ago, I would just point everyone
to that where we all felt the economy was moving in the right direction or a better direction. And of course then we had
Europe that happened, and MF Global that followed that. Again we're simply being very cautious as to how we think
about the economy. We would still say it would be in a fragile state.
<A - David J. Turner>: I'll add one thing to it, if you look at criticized and Class 5 levels, those are clearly coming
down. We think that's one of the best places, first places you look in terms of assessing credit quality, and those are
coming down. We'll be disclosing our potential problem loan number which is the inflow numbers that we've talked
about before in the $350 million to $400 million range. So that is, we believe, showing that, an improvement. So I think
that we want to be careful with regards to the provisioning. Did I say the range, $350 million to $450 million?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: You said $350 million to $400 million.
<A - David J. Turner>: I'm sorry, $350 million to $450 million would be our range of potential problem loans.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. Which, that's lower than what you had had a quarter or so ago.
<A - David J. Turner>: That's right.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Hello?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: I'm sorry. Sorry about that. Hey, going back to the credit quality again, what are you saying --
we know you have a lot of exposure to Florida and other parts in the south and we've been hearing that the south is
probably less competitive on loan growth and pricing than other regions of the country. Now, you might not see that,
being in that region, but how would you talk about the competitiveness? And then also, on the follow-up is, where is
most of the good asset quality improvement coming from? Is it coming from the state of Florida or other regions that
you service?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I'll try to answer that question in a couple different directions. I would say one, from
a competitive standpoint, obviously we're operating in 16 states, predominantly in the southeast. But I would say what
we've seen is some pretty strong competition. I would say most of that competition has been around pricing. Not so
much on covenants, but certainly you've seen some pricing competition as there's been a strong effort by all of our
competitors to try to grow loans prudently.
So we are seeing that. I would tell you when you look at the business side of our balance sheet, most of that growth has
been in commercial industrial lending, predominantly in the upper end of that, of the middle market. And I would say
specifically where we've seen our most success is in what we call specialized industries, which has been asset based
lending and healthcare and energy in particular.
We've seen strong growth in those segments. And, but I would tell you that's been sort of broad-based across the
footprint. Florida has never particularly been a strong commercial industrial state. But we are seeing some improving
signs in the State of Florida. I would tell you most of the borrowings tend to be around CapEx. There's a lot of
investment in technology and in equipment that we're financing at this point in time.
I'll tell you on the consumer side we're still seeing, as David mentioned earlier, we're seeing very strong growth on the
residential mortgage segment. We had about a $1.6 billion in production in the first quarter. $200 million of that was in
the HARP 2.0 segment. And about 60% was refinancing.
Our refinance to new home purchase is running about 60/40%. We are seeing even stronger pipelines in both consumer
and business in the early part of the second quarter.
Auto, indirect auto lending continues to be strong with us. For us. I would tell you that obviously pricing has gotten
more competitive in that segment as well, but we're still pleased with the spreads that we're seeing [indiscernible]
(42:20).
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And you're seeing, and you're also, you talked a little bit about on the mortgage side, on the
purchase side, you're seeing an increase in purchase throughout your footprint or just in specific states?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: It varies by state. Obviously purchase has been a more dominant, more dominant in states
like Florida. We've had a stronger purchase percentage out of Florida, just because of the inability for many of those
mortgage holders to execute a refinance. Obviously HARP 2.0 has changed that to some degree. And our application
volume for the first quarter applications for HARP 2.0 is about 20% of total volume. We think it will be stronger than
that for second quarter.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Hey guys, thank you very much.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Good morning. First just thinking about aggregate period end loan growth here relative to
the negative 5%-ish range there in the first quarter, I'm just wondering, how do you think this will trend. How quickly
will this recover and do you think residential mortgage is going to be play a larger role in your aggregate loan growth
just given unattractive returns really in a lot of other earning asset classes and also some weak demand in some of your
core lending segments?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: You've got -- I would tell you that the sort of the way we look at our loan growth, if you
looked at first quarter, obviously as David mentioned a moment ago, you need to look a little beyond the period to
period averages and look at ending balances. We actually were a little stronger on ending balances than the averages
would tend to indicate. We do anticipate that we'll continue to see growth in the segments I previously mentioned, but
that -- and we'll see a more moderate decline in commercial real estate over the year.
Commercial real estate was down about $600 million period to period, which is a more moderate decline than we'd
seen previously. We think there's still some moderation in that. But it's still declining. We do think that from start to
finish, that our loans outstanding will be fairly stable. But you will see, continue to see modest runoff in the first half of
the year and modest growth in the second half of the year.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Got it. And how has your appetite changed for retaining conforming mortgages at this
point?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We really haven't had much of an appetite for that. We've had, we retained very little of
our production. Mostly what we're retaining is the adjustable rate mortgages as well as jumbo mortgages, which have
been a relatively small percentage of our production. And, at this point we don't see that changing. We continue to
evaluate it from quarter to quarter. And we are pretty rigorous about that evaluation. And at this point in time we still
are holding on that strategy. David, do you want to speak to that?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Craig, we continue to look at that because we know that's a, we're different than our
peers. We can't come up with a compelling argument for us to keep those mortgages, it's primarily the 15-year product
that we normally would retain. But the spreads we can make in terms of selling it, selling the production versus putting
it on our books and having what we think would be long dated, pretty long dated loans, that we can take a proxy risk in
the investment portfolio for that and have a better liquidity profile for that, to be prepared for the loan growth that we
really want to put on the books. So we'll continue to look at it, but we don't see that we would change that in the
near-term.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Great. Thanks, guys.

The next question is from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hi, Erika. Good morning.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: My first question is a follow-up to Ken's, I just wanted to make sure I understood it correctly.
David, are we looking at about an $875 million quarterly starting point for the expense run rate and the main message
in terms of PPI improvement, if you could keep it stable at that level?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, what I said was if you take the existing expense number and back off $35 million to $40
million of that, that is $35 million or $40 million in that first quarter that should not repeat. We do believe for the year,
which is consistent with our previous guidance, that our expenses should be down from 2011 and of course that's
adjusting 2011 for the goodwill impairment. And we're sticking to that.

<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Got it. And with regard to your comments on the margin, do you expect the loan yield
compression of about 6 basis points that you saw this quarter to moderate or is the margin expansion for the remaining
of the year really a function of savings that you could extract from your funding base and also lower cash balances next
quarter related to using some of that to pay back TARP?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's -- our guidance that we're giving you relative to NII/NIM takes all that into
consideration, including other hedges that we have on the books that will expire this year. So all in, we believe we're
going to continue to have improvement in the margin.
I think the -- we saw the change of 6 basis points. We don't see that necessarily repeating, given the nature of how that
unwinds in the first quarter. So you shouldn't extrapolate that.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Got it. And my last question is on the home equity portfolio. I'm sure you saw larger banks
this quarter report an increase in NPLs due to a change in the accounting methodology with regard to classifying a
performing first if they're behind, I'm sorry, performing second if they're behind a problem first. Barb, have you
complied with this, or reserved for this?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Erika, in fact we've had a look not only at our own portfolio but what we service. And in total
that number is roughly $3.7 million of our home equity that we would need to move into non-accruals, that would
happen this quarter. We've also taken that as a proxy and used that to look at the rest of the portfolio. So our
anticipation is that there would be an incremental, roughly $10 million that could also happen coming from where
others have the first and we are holding the second mortgage. So all in, I would say a relatively immaterial number.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Got it. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning, everybody. We've spent a little time talking about the expense side of things. I
would like to get a little additional color on the fee revenue outlook for Regions. You have made a couple of comments
about HARP helping out the mortgage side of the business for at least the next quarter or two. I'm curious as to where
else you might see some benefits in terms of fee revenues in the second quarter and third quarter. And within that, can
you provide any additional color on what, on the ongoing relationship with Raymond James at this point following the
sale of Morgan Keegan?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Okay. Let me try to answer your questions. First of all, I think from a fee revenue
standpoint, in terms of non-interest revenues, clearly the first quarter benefited from a very strong level of production in
our mortgage group. We do not see that abating. That continues early into the first quarter. Our pipelines and our
applications that we're receiving to date would not indicate that that's abating any time soon. So we would anticipate a
continued strong quarter in that regard.
On the consumer side, as we mentioned before, the consumer checking account, we've really been in a transition for
several months of migrating our consumer checking account base from a, from basically a free checking offering to
more of a fee eligible offering with hurdles around balances and transaction types. And we've successfully sort of
bridged that transition and starting to see good results from that regard.
We also introduced a number of products into our consumer offerings, prepaid cards and some money transfer types of
activities and check cashing kind of activities that have augmented our service charges. We continue to introduce
products into the consumer suite that will generate some level of revenue, but that are meeting very legitimate customer
needs and trying to grow the consumer side of the portfolio. I'd also mention, since we reacquired our credit card
portfolio we're generating pretty strong interchange revenue off of that portfolio as well as we continue to see growth in
the debit card transactions.

We've seen year-over-year growth in debit card in spite of all the changes that have been made to that product. So we
have said we think over time we can mitigate the impact of the revenue challenges we have on NIR. And so far our
results are tracking on target to a little better than target.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: If I could, just a follow-up on that specific subject. Are you assuming that the Q1 number for
your capital markets revenues are basically the peak for the year and that they would begin to come down similar to the
trend that you saw last year?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We are not, we -- the capital markets group, I think had a good first quarter. But we
actually are encouraged about what we think might happen through the rest of the year. And I do think that, you
mentioned earlier, the continuing relationship with Raymond James, they continue to be a good customer of ours as
well as a partner on a number of fronts. And so we are hopeful that that turns into business for us later in the year.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And if I can, one final question on asset quality. You've mentioned several times you
expect asset, or credit trends to continue to improve, perhaps not in a straight line. I guess I'm just curious about how
you're thinking about where ultimately reserves would be, would fall out relative to the loan portfolio. Are you looking
somewhere in the 2% to 2.5% range or possibly even lower?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, this is David. We've -- we continue to monitor closely credit. We have to all
acknowledge that we're still in an unusual environment in the world economy. And we try to assess where reserves
really end up. I think we would all agree that reserves are going to be higher than before we entered the crisis. And so if
entering in the crisis you were in the 1.25% to 1.50% range you are probably in that 1.50% to 2% range and that's the
best guess we have right now. We need to wait and see how this thing pans out. But I would think -- I know that's a
wide margin, 1.50% to 2%, but that's probably the best guidance that we would give you. And the question is, in what
time period. We're at 3.3% today, in what time period would that shift down and that's a harder thing to answer because
of the unevenness with regard to the economic recovery. So in time I think we can get down to those levels.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Thank you, David.
<A - David J. Turner>: Okay.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Brian Foran of Nomura.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Hi, how are you? I guess just one definitional one. So when we think about PP&R having
bottomed here is it as simple as just kind of making the expense adjustments you talked about, $35 million to $40
million, and the $13 million subsidiary dividend? And looking out to 2Q there is a PP&R base that is $50 million
higher or so, or is there anything else that we should adjust for in the same kind of seasonal element that would either
bring it back down or push it back up in terms of looking for a run rate as opposed to guidance?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah I think if you look at the first quarter that certainly is your starting point with the
expenses we talked about. But you need to be thinking about our deployment of our balance sheet in a more meaningful
manner, and putting our excess cash to work, getting our investment portfolio to work, being able to participate in loan
syndications now that we have our ratings back that we hadn't had before. All those help drive earning asset growth. So
I think there's something -- there should be more than just taking out those expenses that help drive improvements in
overall PP&R.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Having the investment credit rating back and having put ourselves in a better position of
strength from a capital perspective, will allow our commercial bankers to compete more effectively in this market.

<Q - Brian Foran>: And as I think about that, maybe as part of the loan outlook, I know you don't break out runoff
versus core loans the way some of your peers do, but is the assumption that loans will inflect this year, I guess as a
prerequisite of that, just that the runoff headwind will slow, or does the core loan origination run rate actually need to
accelerate from the current levels in order to get to growth in the back half of the year?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well I think, as we talked earlier, we're experiencing pretty good growth in our C&I book and
our pipelines remain strong. We're very encouraged there. We do have headwinds, which are a continuing moderation
of a decline in investor real estate, so that will slow some, but still decline. And we still have the consumer that's
de-leveraging. In particular our home equity line of credit book that continues to attrite because of this refinance and/or
de-leveraging that's occurring.
It also is, what impacts us versus our peers is our decision not to retain the resi mortgage originations on our books
versus selling them into the market. So as we mentioned earlier, we think if you look at the beginning of the year loan
portfolio and you look at the end of the year, you're going to be about flat year-over-year. We're down about 1% end to
end this first quarter. And we'll see a little bit of attrition. But the back half we expect the growth will take over that and
get on a run rate in that second half, leading into 2013.
<Q - Brian Foran>: And I guess just the last one, I know TruPS isn't a huge number for you, but can you just remind
us what you're thinking in terms of timing and also would those be expected to be something that would be, just cash
on hand would take those out, or should we build in some kind of replacement debt cost?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, we continue to look at that. We have two issues, a roughly $500 million issue at 6.6%,
and then we have a $350 million issue at 8.8%. We have put ourselves in position to be able to deal with either one of
those. The 8.8% is the more likely candidate, given where our credit spreads are. And I think that if -- a caller earlier
had mentioned about our credit spreads. If our credit spreads tighten like we think they will over time, or hope that they
will over time, then that gives us even better opportunity to either take them out from a cash standpoint and/or replace
them with cheaper debt.
We still have to maintain our policy of cash at the holding company, which is two years worth of cash to take care of
all debt service and dividends and so forth. And we're over that policy today. We will continue to maintain that which,
if we took out that piece, would put us, depending how things trend this year, could put us in the market. But for $350
million we might be able to take it out for cash. We'll have to wait and see.

The next question is from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons of Sandler O'Neill.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin P. Fitzsimmons>: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on the service charges. You
mentioned how there's been a big impact over time from the regulatory hurdles and you've made changes to offset that.
Is there any additional hit to expect from, for instance, sequencing change for overdrafts, or is that already complete? If
you could just comment on that. Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Kevin we -- you have to, when you look at the service charge revenue streams that we
have, the revenue stream for overdrafts and insufficient funds, I think as a revenue stream that continues to be some
level of debate over in the industry. And it, part of that debate is around posting sequence and part of it is about funds
availability. And also parts of it is about, sort of different institutions' stances on waivers and refunds regarding NSFs.
That revenue stream continues to decline for us. And we anticipate that it will still continue to decline for some time to
come. And we're re-pricing our products and readjusting our business model on existing products in addition to new
products to offset that. We do still have, we do anticipate that there will be rule changes, further rule changes regarding
this process that we'll adapt to and adjust to, but I think it's premature to speculate as to what those might be.

<Q - Kevin P. Fitzsimmons>: Okay. And Grayson, I want to just follow up. You mentioned a few minutes ago about
some of the additional products on the consumer side like money transfer and check cashing activities and that there's a
real need for that. You made that point. Are those kind of activities that you run by the Consumer Finance Bureau just
to make sure there's no trouble with that down the line, or are we just way early on that front to be thinking about that?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think we're way early. Obviously we've had a lot of conversations with our supervisors at
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But those conversations are confidential. And -- but I would tell you that
we try to go through a risk assessment on all the products that we introduce. We try to make sure that they are fair and
responsible, that they are treating customers fairly. I think those are all objectives that all of our supervisors agree with.
But I do anticipate changes in this space. And it's just too early, from my vantage point, it's just too early to call.
<Q - Kevin P. Fitzsimmons>: Okay. Okay, great. Thanks.

Your final question is from the line of John Pancari of Evercore Partners.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. Barb, you had indicated that you expect OREO expenses to stay low through the
year here. I just want to clarify that. Do you still expect further decline and you're just being conservative there? And I
guess I have a similar question on the related credit costs throughout the expense base beyond the OREO expenses. Do
you also expect continued declines through the year and into 2013?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Yes. John, as long as we're looking at what's happening with real estate values and prices that's
where I'm basing my remarks. That is that we have seen as I mentioned earlier some of our markets stabilize. Some of
the markets start to improve a little and of course that should directly impact our OREO expense and costs. So as we
see those things getting better throughout the year hopefully we won't be taking as many marks and our expense will be
lower throughout the year, but again, dependent on the economy.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. So what would you say is your total environmental costs in your expense base that could
come out as of today? I believe it was north of $800 million a few quarters back. So I wanted to see -- how do you
quantify that total amount as of today?
<A - David J. Turner>: That number had been in the $300 million range. We may be talking about something
different on your $800 Million. But $300 million, we said over time three-quarters of that would come out. It's just,
when it comes out is based on improvements in the economy. Clearly we have seen that in the first quarter. And we
think that that, those costs will continue to abate. It is not just OREO and held-for-sale costs but it's all the people that
we have that manage problem assets for us as well in terms of where we deploy them. Today it's in dealing with
problem assets; tomorrow it could be elsewhere in the organization to help serve customers.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. Yeah, I might have included some of the legal expenses in my number then. Then
separately in terms of securities, can you just give us what the durations were of the securities you put on during the
quarter and what the yields were approximating?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, we had been, our duration had been about two and a half years. Today it's probably
closer to three. We've put some corporate debt on the books. Not a lot, about $1 billion this past quarter. And that
duration's in the four to five-year range, which is what drove that duration up. But we like that asset class relative to the
mortgage-backed securities, given the volume that we had there.
<Q - John Pancari>: And the average yields that were put on that?
<A - David J. Turner>: Somewhere – John, somewhere in the 3.25% range, versus 2.50% range if we put on a
mortgage backed.
