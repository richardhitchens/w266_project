Ursula M. Burns
Good morning and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on slide three with a review of the strategic imperatives
that define our business and align with our financial performance.
First, accelerating our Services business, we're operating in a market that is rich with opportunities especially as more
and more enterprises and governments seek efficient and productive ways to manage their operations. We're taking full
advantage of our experience and expertise by diversifying our offerings, aggressively pursuing opportunities in key
growth areas like e-discovery, HR outsourcing, customer care, transportation and healthcare and expanding globally.
During the first year of this – during the first half of this year, revenue from Services grew 8% in constant currency,

tracking very well with our expectations.
Second, is maintaining our leadership in Technology. We're continuing to take a disciplined and practical approach to
managing our Technology business for a sustained benefit to our bottom line. That means providing the industry's best
technology delivered through a cash-generating business model and focusing on building our business in color, SMB
and across developing markets. During the first half of this year, installs of Xerox products were up 5% and in
particular our Color MIF, that's machines and seals, was up 14%. Install and MIF growth is a good indication of future
annuity revenue reflecting our continued market share leadership and in particular, the share that we're taking from
competitors.
Third, we're driving operational excellence across our enterprise. This means adjusting our cost model so that we're
competitively advantaged to have the financial flexibility to adapt to changing marketplace needs while scaling in key
growth areas. Operating expenses are down. This is indicative of our disciplined approach to managing our cost base.
And in Services, we delivered sequential improvement in operating margins. By executing well on the first three
priorities, we're very focused on the fourth which is creating value for our shareholders. Doing so by delivering solid
earnings and allocating capital in the areas of acquisition, dividends and share repurchase.
The economic uncertainty has created more pressure especially in Europe and especially impacting our Technology
business. We benefit from offering a diverse portfolio that allows us to aggressively pursue areas of higher growth and
to manage for improved profitability in more mature markets. The quarterly numbers give one picture, but I'm just as
closely managing the progress that we're making to be increasingly differentiated and advantaged in the marketplace.
We're winning customers' trust and helping them simplify how work gets done in ways that may surprise you.
Please turn to slide four for some examples of what I mean.
Key to our Services growth is investing in those markets where we already have respected expertise and where we see
potential for market expansion. The discovery process for the legal industry is a great example. It's a complex area and
one that can be incredibly costly if left to more manual processes. We've built a competency in e-discovery through
advanced software tools and Services and we just strengthened our advantage through the acquisition of Lateral Data.
It's software helps firms and in-house legal departments manage the entire discovery life cycle in simple and affordable
ways. We're also taking this customized approach to the mobile phone market by acquiring UK-based WDS which
provides technical support to the world's largest wireless telecommunications brands. Through its proprietary
cloud-based platform, WDS analyzes millions of technical support interactions across thousands of mobile devices. It
then uses this data to help clients adjust any systemic problems all real-time, fast and in productive ways.
Productivity is also the benefit of advancing Technology and Services for healthcare. While the headlines this past
month were all about what's next for the Affordable Care Act, we were already moving far ahead through our
established relationship with healthcare payors, providers and government agencies; this includes Q2 announcement for
developing Nevada's Health Information Exchange and enhancing New Mexico's Medicaid reimbursement services to
create a cloud-based portal that gives Florida business owners more health insurance choices as well as being selected
as the BPO provider for NIH. Xerox is exceptionally well positioned as a trusted provider for the business of
healthcare.
That's a quick glimpse of the story behind the numbers and we'll share more with you each quarter and hopefully they
help to reframe your perception of Xerox to showcase the amazing opportunity that's in front of us and to better explain
the evolving nature of our business mix and model. So now let's look at how this translates into our financial results.
Turn to slide five. I'll provide a top level review, then Luca will take you through the detail and I'll close with our
expectations for quarter three and then we'll take your questions. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of
$0.26. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.22 per share. This includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles.
Earnings are in line with our expectations and reflect the investments that we're making to grow our business.
Total revenue of $5.5 billion was down 1% and up 1% in constant currency. Demand for our industry-leading Managed
Print Services led to a 6% increase in revenue from document outsourcing.

ITO revenue was up 9%, a significant improvement from prior quarters and revenue from Business Process
Outsourcing grew 8%. Revenue from our Technology business declined 4%. This was impacted by the continued weak
macroeconomic environment and by clients increasingly shifting to Xerox's Managed Print Services, which was
reported in our Services segment.
I remain quite pleased with our across-the-board progress in Services and the benefit that it brings to our top line.
Strong revenue from Services, our growth driver today and in the future, gives us financial flexibility that helps
minimize the impact from our slowing Technology business.
We continue to make the appropriate investments in our Services business which includes incurring startup costs to
ramp new contracts. So as a result, and as expected, we're facing near-term pressure on margins but also as expected,
we made sequential improvements in quarter two.
Operating margin of 9.7% was down naught year-over-year and up 1.2 points from quarter one and that was driven by a
1.3 point sequential improvement from our Services business. Q2 gross margin of 32% was down 1.4 points, improving
one point from quarter one. This is in the range of our expectations for the first half of the year and we balance our
investments by continuing to improvement RD&E and SAG which is now at 19.4% of revenue.
We generated $228 million in cash from operations, again in line with expectations and reflecting the need to make
higher cash pension contributions during the first half of the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate $2
billion to $2.3 billion in full year operating cash. And we are continuing to use available cash for acquisitions and share
repurchase:
Please turn to slide six for a closer look at our top line results. The metrics of these charts tell two different but key
messages. First, reiterating the importance of Services in the total picture of our business, a year ago, the revenue
coming from Services and Technology were about – were evenly split. Now Services makes up 51% of the total, up
from 48% a year ago.
Second, a reminder of the significance of our annuity-driven business model. As you see here, 85% of our revenue is
annuity and it's up 2% in quarter two.
We remain focused on increasing profitable annuity-based revenue across our portfolio. We manage our Services
business for growth, building our pipeline, increasing signings of multiyear contracts and investing in acquisitions to
strengthen our competencies. In addition to winning major BPO and ITO deals, we continue to lead with our Managed
Print Services which are in demand as enterprises look for ways to operate more efficient workplaces. For example, we
recently signed a six-year MPS contract with Boeing to consolidate its printers, copiers and fax machines and to
implement a global printing framework based on price, energy, efficiency and ink use.
We also strengthened our annuity stream through the installs of Xerox equipment. Our approach is to lead in color so
Xerox ink is being used to generate color pages printed in workplaces and print shops of any size.
During the quarter, our Color MIF was up 14%, equipment sales revenue was down 6% in constant currency and this is
where we're seeing the largest impact from economic weakness, especially in Europe. In fact, two-thirds of the
equipment sale revenue decline came from Europe. Equipment sales revenue was the most – has the most volatility in
our business right now and it represents just 15% of our total revenue. We're managing it by being very disciplined
with our cost base while expanding distribution to capture the opportunities in SMB and developing markets.
In summary, we're clear-minded about the dynamics of our two businesses based on market opportunity and the macro
environment and we're managing our operations to align with the changing nature of both. In Services, again our
emphasis is on growth and making the investments to scale so that we can serve our clients in diverse, reliable and
efficient ways anywhere around the world. And in Technology, we're sharply focused on streamlining the cost base.
Our emphasis is on nurturing our resilient business model in ways that maintain market leadership while generating
cash and supporting our bottom line.
Considering the economic uncertainty, we now expect that revenue from Technology will continue to be weak. As a
result, we're revising our full-year earnings expectations. They're based on continued strong year-over-year revenue

growth from Services, lower revenue from Technology and the ongoing benefit from operational efficiencies. So let me
turn it over to Luca and I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. So, Luca?
Luca Maestri
Thank you, Ursula and good morning, everyone. Overall, I believe we performed well in a weak economic
environment to deliver 1% constant currency revenue growth and EPS within our guidance. Services, as expected, had
strong growth and we are confident this will continue for the balance of the year. Technology revenue improved
sequentially, down 4% year-over-year versus down 5% in Q1 at constant currency but this was helped by an easier
compare and we expect equipment revenue will continue to be pressured given the challenging macro conditions.
We were pleased with the margin performance despite being down from last year. Sequentially, gross margin improved
100 basis points to 32% and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 9.7%. Year-over-year gross margin was
down 140 basis points driven by Services and mix, while Technology gross margin was actually 20 basis points better.
The drivers of the decline are generally consistent with what we saw in Q1. Services margin saw good sequential
improvement but as anticipated, we had margin compression due to new contract ramp-up costs and this remains the
largest driver of year-over-year margin decline. Also, the increase in Services mix continues to impact gross margin but
it's fairly neutral to operating margin. The gross margin in our Services business is half that of our Technology
segment, so the strong growth in Services has a direct impact on overall gross margin.
We again saw good progress in expense efficiencies with SG&A improvement of 50 basis points. As a result, operating
margin was down 70 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect operating margin to show year-over-year
improvement by Q4.
Restructuring of $29 million was $38 million higher year-over-year and it's important to note it is fully reflected in our
adjusted results. Tax rate of 22.4% was lower than prior year. The EPS impact from higher restructuring and lower tax
rate offset each other on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS of $0.26 was down a penny from 2011 with the only
adjustment to reported EPS being the amortization of intangibles.
Moving on to segment performance; let me start with Services. Services revenue was up 7% in Q2. The growth rate
was somewhat lower than Q1 driven by BPO. This reflected some timing of revenues and some lower volumes in areas
such as transportation and customer care. ITO showed good revenue acceleration and was up 9%. New contracts signed
in recent quarters are now beginning to ramp and we have about 3 points of growth related to intercompany Services as
this business is taking over more of our own IT infrastructure. We, of course, eliminate this intercompany growth
within total Services. Also, document outsourcing continues to show a good pace of growth, up 6% at constant
currency. Giving the muted economic environment, we believe this overall performance confirms the strength of our
diversified Services portfolio. We expect growth in Q3 will be in line or better than Q2. It is worth noting that the Q2
growth was almost entirely organic, but clearly we will continue to support Services growth with tuck-in acquisitions,
the latest examples being the WDS and Lateral Data acquisitions that Ursula just highlighted.
Signings in Q2 were lower year-over-year and down 1% on a trailing 12-month basis. The year-over-year decline is
caused by less renewal potential this year despite a strong 89% renewal rate for the combined BPO and ITO business.
New business signings on a trailing 12-month basis are up 13% and continue to drive our revenue performance.
Services margin of 10.6%, while down year-over-year, showed a 130 basis point sequential improvement. We continue
to expect that by Q4, Services margin will show year-over-year improvement and will be within our 11% to 13% target
range for Services.
Let's now turn to the Technology segment. Technology revenue was down 4% and document-related revenues, which
includes document outsourcing, were down 2% in constant currency. Despite a sequential improvement in Technology
revenue, it is fair to say we saw increased pressure on our results from the macro environment.
Equipment in particular was lower than anticipated driven by weakness in Europe and the continued success of our
Partner Print Services offering which results in some revenue shifting from Technology to Services. The sequential

improvement in revenue was driven by unbundled supplies which was up 5% versus down 7% in Q1. Unbundled
supplies represents a little less than 20% of our Technology revenues and is predominantly aligned with Entry products.
It can be volatile given channel inventory dynamics which is what we saw in Q1 and Q2.
Looking at product segments, part of the weakness in equipment revenue was mixed. We saw a rebound in Entry
thanks to new products and OEM sales. High-end showed very strong color install growth but this was driven primarily
by the Entry production products and mid-range was impacted by the migration of Managed Print Services. We are
planning for equipment revenue to continue to be weak in Q3 and therefore for total revenue declines to be down
mid-single digits for Technology.
Segment margin of 11.3% was down slightly from 2011 but reflected continued cost and expense control and was
above our 9% to 11% target range for Technology. There are obviously a number of different dynamics at play in the
market and as we move to the key metrics slide, I would like to give some additional insight into how we view and how
we are managing our different businesses.
Let's look first at Services. The company has gone through a transformation over the past two years with Services now
accounting for over 51% of total revenues and we clearly expect this trend to continue. A few important points to make
regarding our position in Services and future expectations.
We are a leader in a number of very attractive and growing Services segments including healthcare, both government
and commercial, commercial BPO areas such as human resource outsourcing and transaction processing as well as
transportation. We have strength in three very important capability areas: ITO, Customer Care and Document
Management, which we leverage across all of our lines of business. And we have a tremendous opportunity to increase
our capabilities, leverage innovation to build greater differentiation and expand globally. This should lead to greater
operating leverage and value-add, which will improve not only revenue but margins over time. Services will be the
growth driver for the company and also will make us a more valued partner to our entire customer base.
In terms of Technology, I want to address how we're managing the continued impact of a weak macro environment.
First, we have been gaining market share for several quarters and we do not have significant exposure in some of the
areas of greatest secular pressure such as consumer and single-function devices. For instance, when you look at the
metrics on this slide, they're generally stable and in some cases positive.
Second, we continue to selectively invest in areas where we see the greatest growth opportunities, such as small and
medium-sized business, Managed Print Services and color. And third, we have realized sooner than many that there are
specific areas of secular pressure such as transaction- [ph] saving (20:09) printing that impact us. As a result, since the
end of 2008, we have proactively worked to make our business more annuity-based, our cost base flexible and our
investments more focused. Our document-related business remains attractive. It has a very large annuity stream and
good cash dynamics, limited capital requirements and committed revenue streams. We are the global market leader,
have great technology and strong customer relationships and we can leverage these characteristics to strengthen our
Services business further.
If you now turn to the next slide, I will take a moment to review Q2 cash flow. Cash from operations was a source of
$228 million which compares to a source of $347 million in 2011. Through the first half, cash flow was $213 million
versus $317 million in 2011. This is fully in line with our expectations, as the driver of the year-over-year decrease is
the timing of pension contributions. Cash contributions to our global pension plans in Q2 were $158 million which was
$80 million higher than 2011. We now expect second half contributions of approximately $150 million versus $303
million last year. We spent $115 million on CapEx which is consistent with our annual forecast of around $500 million
and we decreased debt by $455 million. Dividends paid were $63 million and we repurchased $306 million of stock.
This was an acceleration compared to our original plan and we continue to plan to repurchase between $900 million
and $1.1 billion for the year weighted toward the end of the year. Finally, we remain on track for $2 billion to $2.3
billion of operating cash flow for the year. Let us turn to the next slide to review our capital structure.
Our Q2 ending debt balance decreased to $9.2 billion. In May, we retired $1.1 billion in senior notes which was the
only term debt coming due this year. From a maturity standpoint, we maintain a well balanced debt ladder with just

about $1 billion coming due annually. During the course of the year, our debt balance may change moderately given
timing of cash flows but we continue to plan for $8.6 billion for year-end debt. The vast majority of our debt is in
support of our financing of customer leases. Of the $9.2 billion debt balance, $5.6 billion can be associated with the
financing of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance debt is calculated assuming a seven-to-one leverage of
our finance assets of $6.4 billion. These finance assets represent committed revenue streams from our customers.
In Q2, as I said, we made good progress on share repurchase, $306 million or 41 million shares. We have said all along
that our repurchases will be back-half weighted given timing of cash flows, but we are maximizing what we can do in
the near term given the share price opportunity. In summary, we continue to be focused on growing and improving the
profitability of our Services business while maintaining our profitable leadership in Technology. We are seeing the
impact of macro weakness but believe we are well positioned to have steady revenues and profits through this time. In
terms of capital allocation, we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to return value to shareholders through
share repurchase, dividends and accretive tuck-in acquisitions. With that, I will hand it back to Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. Our results in the second quarter reflect
consistent progress. Growth in Services, increase in annuity revenue, the steady pace of increasing installs and Color
MIF, sequential margin improvement in Services, disciplined cost management and on-track performance with cash
generation and capital allocation, all delivered to build value for our stakeholders and more value in our business.
Our guidance on cash remains unchanged and we remain committed to investing in share repurchase throughout the
year. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings of $0.24 to $0.26 per share and we now expect full-year
adjusted EPS of $1.07 to $1.12 which comprehends the continued revenue weakness that we're expecting from our
Technology business.
With that, I thank you again for joining us today and we – and as we get to your questions, I know that you'll want to
dive deeper into trends, especially in our Services business. So we have in the room with us today, Lynn Blodgett, who
is the President of our Xerox Services business. Now let's open it up to your questions and I'll field them and ask either
Lynn or Luca to chime in as well.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Good morning.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Good morning, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: I guess the first question, Ursula, is can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms
of the pressure on the Technology side, whether you see if this is a cyclical issue? Clearly Europe is weak from an
economic standpoint or more of a secular trend? I think you've talked about it some in the past. I'm curious if you've
seen any changes in maybe the rate of decline on the secular side; just any clarity you can give us there would be
helpful.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you, good question. I think one that many people have, so let me – we're going to
spend a little bit of time talking our way through this. First, let me start with the secular trends that we're seeing in the
marketplace. We see a growth in color almost across the board. So, mid-range, high-end, places that we participate. We
see that in Color MIF increasing and color pages increasing. We see a shift, a decided shift towards Managed Print
Services away from single-function devices. We don't have a very large in single-function devices, black and white or
color at the low end and we took advantage of this lack of participation by driving, by starting and then driving our

Managed Print Services business. More and more customers are pushing toward Managed Print Services.
There's no doubt about it. All of our competitors are now engaged in Managed Print Services, we have been engaged in
a long time and we're leading. That's the second secular trend. We see growth in small and mid-sized businesses
everywhere around the world, the U.S. and in developing economies particularly. We see a move away from – which
we've seen for quite a few years now – high-end black and white transactional pages. That move is continuing. It has
not slowed down. It's – the momentum is there and we have recognized that and baked that into our – into our business
model and our guidance on a go-forward basis.
We have not seen a slowdown or a shift in those secular trends at all. If you look at the macro environment and then I'll
bring it all together, we have seen a considered slowing of business in Europe. We saw this a little bit later than most.
But in the first quarter – and in the first quarter, we definitely started to see the pickup. We have seen acceleration of
that softness in the second quarter – towards the end of the second quarter. That's the reason why we've adjusted our
guidance downwards. We're now assuming and planning for mid single-digit declines in equipment revenue in the
Technology segment. This is a – in revenue in the Technology segment. This is a big change from where we were in
the first quarter. We were thinking that we could hold that to flat to low single-digits.
And now I think that's not a realistic expectation. So, secular trends haven't changed. I mean, we haven't seen a change.
If you look at North America and DMO, we still see a pickup in color, move to MPS, a slowdown in high-end black
and white printing, a pickup of SMB businesses, so that's still there and on a macro side, we are definitely seeing a
weaker Europe. I hope that answered it.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Yeah, no, that was – that was helpful. My next question is for Lynn, actually or Ursula,
whoever wants to take it. Can you talk a bit about what's going on in the healthcare side in your Services business?
Opportunities, challenges, given Obamacare and all that's sort of developing right now.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I'll have Lynn take it. We are pleased, really pleased and very excited about healthcare
but I'll have Lynn dive into it; it's a real winner for us.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: You bet. Shannon, thank you. As you know, we are very well positioned in all of the aspects
of healthcare. Our Healthcare business has grown and is now a significant part of the overall portfolio and we have –
we have Services in the – in the private sector both in the payor and the provider side and on the government side and
so the whole effort around affordable care is something that we feel that we're very well positioned for as well as the –
just the continued evolution on the private side. So, we feel very, very good about our position in healthcare.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Can you give us sort of an idea of how big it is?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: It's right now about $2 billion of the portfolio, so about 10% of the overall portfolio, and it's
growing nicely.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And that $2 billion is just for the healthcare provisions for – in BPO and ITO. We have,
obviously, in our Technology side, we have support of the healthcare as well but for the Services business, BPO and
ITO, we are definitely a leader here. We also have just recently won some new business throughout the States and
you'll be seeing that in the next quarter.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. And then my final question for Luca, we've been hearing more about sort of questions
about the Leasing business, your thoughts on how big of a Leasing business you need to maintain given your mix to –
or your migration to Services, so could you talk a little bit about how you think about the Leasing business
strategically?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Well, the Leasing business is directly related to our equipment revenue. We – we support our
customers by financing those leases, 85% of all the equipment that we sell is financed by ourselves to our customers.
You will see that the size of the portfolio has come down a bit in line with the decline in equipment revenue. It is really
part and parcel of our go-to-market strategy. It is a great differentiator for us in the marketplace, particularly at times
when credit becomes difficult. So, it's a business that we like because it's very profitable and it's very much bundled
together with the rest of the Technology business. It will follow, in terms of the sizing, it will follow very much the

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah, hi. I wanted to ask you if we should be concerned about Services bookings 26%
down in the quarter after 27% year-over-year the prior quarter on some pretty easy compares and the drop-off in the
renewal rate.
<A - Luca Maestri>: So, Ben, let me start with the renewal rate. Yeah, let me start with the renewal rate. The renewal
rate was excellent during the second quarter; we're at 89%, the top of our range of 85% to 90%. The drop in bookings
very much driven by less renewal potential. Less renewal potential is not necessarily bad. It means that we got
long-term contracts and in this given quarter, we didn't have much to renew and, as you know, renewing contracts tends
to bring some compression in margins. If you look at our new business signings and you look at it on a trailing
12-month basis, actually, we're up 13%. Very good.
And, by the way, we have seen some level of delays in decision-making during the quarter, particularly in document
outsourcing. Our pipeline has now grown 10% in the quarter. So, new business signings up 13%, pipeline up 10%. So,
we are not concerned about the progression of signings.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: One of the other things, Ben, this issue of renewals is – it's a – it's a kind of an interesting
metric because it actually is better for us, if you consider the risk that's associated with renewals and as Luca said with
margin compression, the fact that we don't have much up for renewal is a good thing and we renewed a high percentage
of that. So, we feel very good about renewals and we're glad there wasn't a lot up for – up for grabs.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Do you have another question, Ben?
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. Yeah, with regard to the Technology segment, if you could just kind of talk a
little bit more about your positioning. What we're seeing is a rapid drop-off in a lot of the Entry-level and the ink jet,
some of the ink jet areas for certain players and I was just wondering if you could talk about your relative positioning
among the segments. You tend to call an Entry-level at a higher level than some of the others and if you could just talk
about your relative positioning there and by the segment and what kind of deceleration you're expecting.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: All right. So, there's two – two ways to look at this. First is on the traditional single-function
– single-function, low-end either consumer or very small business – very, very small business market. We are a de
minimis player in that portion of the market. We serve those customers through resellers, any resellers who are
interested in taking our product and moving it. We are a very, very small player there.
The next segment is a little bit higher up in the SMB place and primarily color and multifunctional devices, A4
configuration but some small A3 as well. If you look at our install growth across Entry, we've grown installs in all of
those places, even into very, very small color printers, A4 color and A4 mono. But we are relatively small in this
segment and serve it through resellers.
The way we participate here is through MPS and MPS does two things for us. One, we can deliver some of our
technology into a client's account, SMB and large customers as well, but we also, through our success in MPS, take

over pages in clients' accounts that are not done on our technology today.
So, what we're seeing is definitely a softening of the market potential for the small devices, particularly single-function
devices, and we participate in that, not by bringing new technology only, but by bringing new offer called MPS. I hope
that answered it.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah, and could you just clarify how – what kind of growth rate now you expect at the
high-end considering I think it has a disproportionate share of the EBIT in the segment?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We expect to continue to grow color, high-end color, mid to high and high-end color installs
and activity and revenue, particularly in color, in color and we expect to continue to see weakness or declines – revenue
declines in our high-end black and white business. There's no doubt about either of those things. One second. I think
that that's – yeah, so the trends haven't changed. I mean, we're still shifting towards color. We're still moving some
pages down from offset to color driven by applications, that's why we're seeing, even in weak economic environment,
some buoyancy in the color metrics and we're definitely continuing to see the move from black and white in the
high-end.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay, thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Thank you. I'd like to extend Ben's question for a second, if I could. On bookings, A) what
are you anticipating for the next couple of quarters? The compares certainly don't get any easier and then part – well,
I'll say part B of that question, but if we could just go over A for a second.
<A - Luca Maestri>: We anticipate a sequential progression in signings. You know, we signed a lot during the course
of the second half of last year. But clearly, we expect signings acceleration as we get into Q3.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: The pipeline is growing – the pipeline is strong and is growing, growing 10% and is growing
across the three lines of business and in sub-segments of the business. So, we're not seeing a concentration of pipeline
at all and we're seeing expansion in just about all of the lines, so we do expect as Luca said for signings to continue to
be strong.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, but if I extend that for a second, let's – let's presume for the year, because right now
you are down 26% year-over-year first half, so let's say you're down 20% to 25% for the year on your bookings. With
that as an assumption, will you still be able to grow Services, say, in the mid single-digits to high single-digits as you
look out over calendar year 2013?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yes, I think that the signings rate that you're looking at is a little bit misleading because of
the renewals and, again, if we don't have the challenge of renewing something that's better than it coming up for
renewal because we don't have a re-price and that is skewing the number. We, as Luca said, we definitely have a
difficult compare in the second half but we expect bookings – new business bookings which are the things that -
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: New business bookings and renewal rate are the two things, not renewal volume but renewal
rate are the things that drive growth and because those are improving, we feel comfortable in maintaining the growth
rates.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Let me ask another on Services. Ursula, for you, the tuck-in acquisitions is identified
as being $300 million to $400 million for the full year. Is that a run rate we should be thinking about even as we look at
CY 2013?

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We haven't given a lot of guidance on CY 2013 but I would say that acquisitions across the
board in both Services – across the board in Services and in distribution, a little bit less there, are part of the business
model for our business and so tuck-in acquisitions is something that you should continue to see particularly in Services
for the foreseeable future.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. I'm going to ask one more and then I'll cede the floor for Lynn if I could. Lynn, could
you just describe how your direct-level reports have changed in the last year as the business has changed and what I'm
interested in is the influx of say Xerox people or even adding to third parties from the Accentures and the IBMs of the
world that would help in the consulting side of the business or ITO areas?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Well, I think that we have a very good mix, particularly in my direct reports, of people who
have experience from the private sector and the public sector. We have continued to, over the last year, to align the
chief – the operating officers on a more vertical basis. So, we have a commercial healthcare person, a government
healthcare person and so on. So, we think that improves the focus and the subject matter expertise. And we have –
we've had nice movement of people from the traditional ACS side of the business over into the Xerox ranks and vice
versa.
So, my Chief Financial Officer, for example, is directly from – from Xerox and has been a tremendous addition to us.
And we continue to look outside. It's – we try to promote from within as much as we can. But we also know that you
have to have a healthy mix of new talent. A lot of our new talent comes via acquisition and that's probably the biggest
source of influx of new talent. But we, because of – each competitor that we have goes through cycles and when one is
having difficulties, we try to take advantage of that and hire talent from those people.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: All right. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean, Murray.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Hey, guys, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I guess the first one is for Luca.
Luca, can you walk through how much wiggle room – I guess, through the cash flow dynamics for CFO and I know
you sound like you said you came in line with what you were expecting this quarter. I think it was a little bit lighter
than what most folks were expecting. So, could you talk through sort of the wiggle room and the reiteration of the
guidance for the second half of the year? How comfortable are you now with that guidance because you didn't lower it
but you're lowering overall P&L guidance and maybe what some of the influences are in there? And are there any
tailwinds that we should be thinking of?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Sure and let me start with the issue of guidance. So, we're still comfortable with the $2 billion to
$2.3 billion even though we've taken earnings down. When you look at our reduction of guidance in EPS, when you do
the math, it translates to approximately $100 million of pre-tax cash earnings. So, obviously, that's a headwind. What
offsets that is the fact that a portion of the reduction comes from equipment and so also our Leasing business will
reduce – our leasing receivables will come down and that will give us a partial offset in cash and the other tailwind that
we have is that we now expect our pension contributions to be about $50 million lower than we were forecasting
previously because of this recent pension funding legislation that was passed at the end of June. So, that's why we end
up with a similar cash flow as prior quarter.
When we look at it in progression, first half versus second half, again, we have delivered exactly the same level of cash
flow in 2012 first half versus the first six months of 2011 when you exclude the different timing of the pension
contributions. So, as we look ahead and we know how much cash we have delivered last year, again, we think we can
be well within the range.

<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Awesome. Thanks. And I guess for probably for sort of for Luca and for Lynn, on the
Services operating margins expectations for the second half of the year, how does macro softness or does macro
softness influence what you guys are expecting from Services operating margins through the year and then I have a
follow-up to that as well?
<A - Luca Maestri>: In general, Services is much more resilient to the macro but there are areas of our Services
business that – and we've seen it already in Q2 where, for example, transportation or customer care that you end up
getting lower volumes with lower levels of activity but as we look at our progression, we've said it before. We expect
that by Q4, we will be within our target range, 11% to 13% for Services operating margins, and we were pleased with
the progress that we made in Q2. We expect Q3 to be more or less in that ballpark that we've seen for Q2.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: And [indiscernible] (46:20) -
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Sorry last one and then let's move on.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Yeah. It's just a follow-up on that. Are the operating margins in Services, have they been
tracking relative to your expectations? And do you have any – is there anything that can positively offset some of the
lower volumes like lower unemployment claims or something like that – or higher unemployment -
<A - Luca Maestri>: Of course, we have such a diversified portfolio that you always get some offset but, again, in Q2,
we – our operating margin in Services was slightly ahead of our expectations.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Thanks. I have a question on the supplies revenue growth. You had mentioned that it was
partially driven by timing of purchases for channel partners. Could you dig into that a bit more and help us understand
how much of an impact that had on growth? And then off of that, how should we think about the growth pattern as a
result of that in the third and fourth quarters? And then I guess finally on that, how should we think about macro risk to
supplies consumption in coming quarters given that I think some of your competitors are starting to see some
consumption pressure as a result of the macro environment?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah, so let me start with Q1 and Q2. There were inventory dynamics in Q1, they were negative,
so we were down 7%. In Q2, the positive 5%, Bill, is a combination of an easier compare because of the Japan situation
last year and I would say it was about 50/50. Some of it was the reversal of some of these inventory dynamics, some of
it was the easier compare. As we look at the second half of the year, we expect some slight decline, so when you look
at the full year for supplies, down slightly for the full year which is exactly what we said – said last time, last time
around. And, of course, some of it is around macro weakness.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And you asked about the supply consumption and what – the tie to macro. Remember that
this supplies that we're reporting here is not all of the supplies that we actually sell in our business. Most of the supplies
are bundled in our contracts. This is about 20% of the supplies. And as Luca said, it's volatile given our channel
partners buying at certain times versus pricing, et cetera and their cash flow needs. But on the – on the major portion of
our business, the supplies are trending towards the macro environment which is a move towards color, a move towards
MPS, and a move away from black and white at the high-end. That is in the business model and in – and incorporated
in how our supplies are being consumed.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, that's helpful and then one more question. There's been quite a bit of variability on share
count estimates for you guys, particularly as folks try to fine tune the timing of the buybacks. Just so we're all level set,
can you help us understand how you're thinking about the diluted share count dynamic in the third and fourth quarter
and as we exit the year?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah, so, Bill, we provided on page 20 of our deck, we provided you with the fully diluted
shares as of June 30, right, that we are at 1.366 billion shares, and then you need to think about it in terms of the

different dynamics. We're going to be buying back shares throughout the quarter, I would say relatively consistently.
And we will be issuing some minor amounts for stock compensation plans and then you need to do the average of the
three months and then you'll come out with an average – weighted average shares for adjusted EPS for Q3. And then
you take whatever is the ending point and that would be your starting point for Q4. I hope it's clear enough but clearly
we can give you much more detail if you want separately.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Well, I guess just to clarify; the variability particularly is on the fourth quarter. Some folks have a
pretty significant decline in the share count because of buyback assumption. So, specifically, if you could help us
understand how we should think about that sequential move with the back-end nature of your buyback.
<A - Luca Maestri>: No, right, you're not going to see it – you're not going to see the full impact, right, because it's
going to be a weighted average of the three months of Q4. So, for the purposes of EPS, it's obviously a limited impact.
You will have the full effect only starting in January of 2015.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Oh, okay. Makes sense. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes, thanks, good morning. First question is more high-level. Just curious here, Ursula or
Lynn, if you're starting to see some folks pull forward purchases because they're worried about a decreased purchasing
power owing to currency fluctuations down the road. So, are you worried that maybe the forward quarters are maybe
being mortgaged here in the very near term because of some currency issues?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Not at all. Not at all. We are not seeing – that dynamic is an interesting one that you just said.
We're not seeing that. We see a healthy mix of people telling us that they're going to wait, people buying now and
people – we don't see a lot of people saying, I'm going to – please, I want to buy earlier. We're seeing a normal business
mix here, particularly on the Services side. On the Technology side, what we are seeing is people saying for any large
equipment purchase, let me think about it a little bit more. And for – and therefore, sweating their assets a little bit
more. We see equipment sale revenue softness with that. That's primarily happening in Europe. But we're also seeing in
the United States a mix down.
So, people are buying, particularly in color, for example. There, our color install growth and activity growth was at the
lower end of the high segment of that market. So, you see a huge activity growth but it doesn't always translate to
revenue because the number of devices – the size of the devices are smaller but we're not seeing people move forward
stuff and therefore putting pressure on our go-forward.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. Then the other – the other question here, either for Luca or Lynn, just kind of
curious here in terms of the Services business. You're definitely signaling the peers that the gross margin improvements
in Services are sustainable and I'm trying to figure out how that impacts the cash flow. Are we getting to the point now
where you're going to finally see later this year and early 2013 that positive inflection point where the startup costs of a
lot of these Services engagements starts to fade and thereby you start having better gross margin but also better cash
flow and is that supporting the cash flow reiteration for 2012?
<A - Luca Maestri>: So, on – first of all, on gross margins and I think you're asking about operating margins on the
Services side as well, right? Let me repeat. We expect to see – to come out of 2012 at an operating margin level for
Services which is better than 2011 and obviously, we believe that that will carry forward in 2013 and give us some
tailwind.
Regarding capital use and the ramp-up of these contracts, clearly, the investments that we've made for the contracts that
we're ramping up are declining because we now ramped up these contracts. But we want to continue to grow this
business.

And depending on the profile of the contracts that we're going to be signing, there's going to be capital requirements.
And certainly, we're not going to shy away from growing the Services business because it requires some capital
investment upfront. From an operating cash flow perspective, I'll just repeat what I just said before. We are comfortable
with our guidance and it includes the type of investments that we need to make for the Services business. This year, in
general, the Services business has fewer mega deals than we've seen in 2010 and 2011. These mega deals typically
requires additional capital. So, when you do a compare year-over-year, there's less use of capital on the Services side
for new contracts.

Your question is from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Hello, Chris.
Operator
Chris, your line is open.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the competitive environment on both the
Technology business and the Services business. Ursula, on Technology, in your prepared remarks, you indicated you're
gaining some market share. So, I was hoping to flesh that out a little bit. Where are you seeing market share gains,
against which competitors and which segments? And then secondly as it relates to Services and the deferral of activity
that you referenced, are you likewise seeing an increasing competitive environment or pricing environment on those
new contracts?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I will take the share and then I'll have Lynn chime in on the pricing environment of Services.
So on competitive environment in Technology, we are absolutely gaining share. Publicly reported, externally reported
positioning, we gained share in all – we've gained share in all segments in – of the business in North America and in
developing markets. And we – it's kind of hard to tell what's exactly happening in Europe. It seems like we're gaining
share there as well but we also have some share weakness in certain segments so potentially yes, we're gaining share.
Excuse me.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: If I can just interject.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: While I'm choking.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Just trying to help you, Ursula, that's all. In terms of the deferral of opportunities that was –
is alluded to, that, first of all, is not – not substantial. And it's not driven by a change in competition. It has much more
to do with people just being a little more cautious in their decisioning process. We – we're always asked about the
change in competition or are we seeing a significant shift from one competitor to another? Because we're in so many
different markets, we deal with competitors a very wide very wide set of competitors, and in general, we haven't seen
any sort of a material shift in the competitive landscape.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Let me go back to Technology and I'm not choking anymore. So, as I said, we are gaining
share particularly in the United States and key markets and developing markets. We are gaining in most segments and
the competitors that we're taking from are the traditional competitors, there's Ricoh who has some challenges that
they're working their way through. They're working their way through in 2012, there's HP. There's, I mean, normal

places, different competitors, different segments. The most competitive segment right now is the high-end of the color
printing business. It's probably the most competitive segment and we're holding our own there and in certain places,
winning share.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: My follow-up is around R&D and your commitment to R&D. On a year-on-year
basis, R&D is down 8%; on a two-year basis, it's down 17%. Is this level of R&D sustainable over time and can you
continue to cut R&D and remain competitive in both Tech – in Tech Services?
<A - Luca Maestri>: It's important to keep in mind that when you look at our R&D numbers, they're only a fraction of
what we spend, right? Our R&D activities are coordinated with Fuji Xerox in Japan and when you combine the R&D
spend of the two companies, you actually conclude that our R&D investment in Technology is very healthy. There are
some areas of R&D, particularly the noncore areas where obviously we're looking for cost efficiencies and we look for
outsourcing opportunities in that space, but those are, again, I repeat the noncore portions of R&D. We feel very – very
good about our product development capabilities as is reflected in the fact that we've been gaining market share for
several quarters.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And innovation in Services shows up in a shift that we're making in our core R&D that you
see reported but also a lot of innovation in Services happens in a way that doesn't come out. It's almost in the operating
expense line of the business. So we are very focused on R&D – on innovation, very focused on innovation. We are
coordinating with Fuji Xerox and we are absolutely not stepping away from being a market leader in all of the areas
that we said were focus for us. That's Services, all lines, small and medium-sized business where we have a lot of effort
there, color for sure, and MPS. Spending a lot of money in those areas and we'll continue on a go-forward basis. Thank
you, next question? Is this the last question?

Yes, ma'am, it is. Your final question comes from the line of Alban Gashi with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Alban Gashi>: Hi, good morning. I guess my question is as the Technology business comes down throughout the
year given the equipment downturn, how does that impact the Technology margins as you get higher supply side? And
then a quick follow-up for Lynn on Services.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Obviously, without a doubt, that is the reason why we've reduced guidance on EPS. Without a
doubt, a slowdown in equipment and a slowdown in Technology revenue in general has an impact on margins so we're
going to see some lower margins on the Technology side. The way we deal with it is the way we've been dealing with it
for many years which is really the relentless focus on cost management and trying to grow those areas of the business
that provide some growth opportunity. But that's fundamentally, Alban, the reason why we've taken EPS down.
<Q - Alban Gashi>: Okay, and then I guess, Lynn, on the Services margin; as you get back into your target range of
11% to 13%, can you put into context some of the drivers of – between the mega contracts maturing, overall
operational improvements and then just revenue growth and mix sort of ranking them?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: I think the biggest contributor would be the ramping of the mega deals, as Luca said. We
haven't had as many mega deals this year as last year, so that in and of itself should provide us some relief but we also
want to continue – we never want to shy away from an opportunity that has a reasonable return associated with it
because of the startup expense. And so we're – we think it will come from the lower – lower mega deals. We're – as we
implement, we improve operational efficiency. So, you have that investment that happens when you're starting up and
then you have a natural improvement in productivity as – just as the contract matures; that will also contribute. But we
hope that our bookings will continue strong and so that will counterbalance that to a certain extent.
<Q - Alban Gashi>: And I guess just a quick follow-up to that. As you end the year in the fourth quarter, you said you
expect it to be higher year-over-year than the fourth quarter of last year. But I guess, where do you expect to be within
the 11% to 13% range?

<A - Luca Maestri>: Within that range.
<Q - Alban Gashi>: Lower, higher end?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, within the range.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Solidly within the range.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Solidly within the range. We'll give you more – we have an Investor Conference in
November and we'll be able to give you more detail about the Services business and the progression that we're making
