MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the third quarter 2010 General Dynamics earnings conference call. My
name is Derek and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later in the
conference we will be facilitating a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference
is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Amy Gilliland, staff
Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Derek and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter conference call. As
always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company's outlook.
These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained
in the company's 10K and 10Q filings.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Amy and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the
third quarter with sales of $8 billion, nearly 4% better than the same quarter a year ago. Operating earnings of $966
million were up 10.5% over the year ago quarter. Company margins improved 80 basis points to 12.1%. Earnings per

share were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis, $0.22 better than last year's third quarter. Third quarter free cash flow after
capital expenditures was $784 million, 121% of earnings from continuing operations. This includes a voluntary
payment of $270 million to our pension plan. In terms of capital deployment we used $700 million in the quarter to
retire our 4.5% fixed rate notes. We also purchased 2.7 million shares of General Dynamics stock in the open market
for $163 million. Year-to-date, we have spent $726 million to repurchase 11.2 million shares. Through share
repurchases and dividends we have returned almost 90% of year-to-date free cash flow to shareholders.
Third quarter orders were the strongest we've seen this year. Aerospace and IS&T's book to bill exceeded one to one
while Combat's book to bill was nearly one to one. At the end of the quarter total backlog stood at a robust $61.8
billion.
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups starting with the largest of our four businesses, IS&T.
IS&T enjoyed strong orders, sales, earnings and margins in the third quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion for the second
consecutive quarter, an 8% increase over last year's third quarter. This is healthy growth in light of the fact that last
year's third quarter was the group's highest sales quarter in 2009. Year-to-date, sales are up 7%.
The group's third quarter earnings were $306 million, up 3.4% year-over-year. Operating margins were 10.4% in the
quarter, essentially in-line with my 10.5% full year guidance. The group's book to bill exceeded one time for the third
consecutive quarter causing backlog to increase by $230 million. If the group maintains this win rate, as I expect, 2010
will stand as the 12th year that book to bill has been at or above one times, an excellent track record for a business of
this size and diversity.
Award activity in the quarter was particularly strong at our tactical communications and IT services businesses. Several
of these contracts are detailed in today's earnings press release. Total estimated contract value, which adds the potential
value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog stood at $24.9 billion at quarter end. This represents well over two times
expected 2011 sales and a 5% increase above the year ago value.
Fourth quarter sales and margins will be essentially in line with the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales
to increase approximately 8 to 8.5% over last year driven by double-digit sales growth in our tactical communications
and information technology services businesses. Margins for the year will remain around 10.5%. As we look to the
future, IS&T is particularly well positioned. I want to spend a few minutes this morning giving you a sense for why.
First, a few facts that highlight the group's diverse business base. Group sales are derived from thousands of contracts
at any given time with no single contract totaling more than 2% of company sales. Approximately 40% of sales come
from civil agencies, restricted, commercial, and international customers. Product and systems integration dominate the
group's efforts, representing over 50% of sales. The remaining sales consist of approximately 25% high-end
engineering services and 20% pure IT service work. Nearly half of sales result from fixed price contracts while
approximately 38% are cost plus and the remainder time and materials.
Over the past decade, we have evolved the group's products and services offerings into a balanced portfolio that
remains at the forefront of defense and federal spending priorities. Let me briefly review the three key pieces of this
business.
First, tactical communications and battlespace management. This segment represents approximately 45% of the group's
sales and comprises a U.S. and a smaller U.K.-based business. The group's products and services provide critical
command and control capability and enable secure, continuous communications all the way to the dismounted soldier.
Programs include the army's battlefield network known as WIN-T and the new hand-held software defined joint tactical
radio system known as JTRS HMS. We have dramatically diversified our overseas C4 business from a purely
U.K.-based avionics house to a provider of vehicles, force protection, security, avionics and C4I products to a global
clientele. Earlier this year, GDUK was awarded a development contract for the British Army's Scout reconnaissance
vehicle. This program remains a top funding priority and was included as a component of the Army's future land forces
in the U.K.'s recent strategic defense and security review.
Next, information technology and information services. Our IT services unit comprises a little over one-third of the
group's sales. This business enjoys excellent market positions in the Defense Department and in the intelligent

community as a provider of IT infrastructure, simulation and training services and key mission support. This business
also provides an array of IT healthcare services to military, federal, and commercial customers.
And finally, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, ISR systems. Comprising about 20% of IS&T sales, this
business specializes in signals intelligence, tactical imagery and information collection, processing, exploitation and
distribution. In 2009, as many of you know, we added Axsys to this unit. As a best in class supplier of
high-performance electro optical and infrared sensors and systems, Axsys provides sensor components that enhance the
ability of war fighters and government agencies alike to provide timely, actionable intelligence.
Although not a designated business unit within IS&T, cyber security encompasses core capabilities resident in each of
our businesses, including encryption and information assurance, network security, and forensics. General Dynamics is a
market leader in the cyber arena with approximately $2 billion in 2009 sales across a diverse customer base including
the Pentagon, Homeland Security and the commercial markets. As prime contractor on many sophisticated national
cyber security programs, we employ more than 50% of U.S.-cleared digital forensics investigators. Government
agencies and private corporations alike will spend billions to protect and defend their networks in the years ahead.
General Dynamics will be a major part of that fast-growing market.
The IS&T group, by leveraging its current capabilities to capture new business in faster growing market segments, has
the opportunity to deliver steady growth over the next several years. Each of the group's businesses remain focused on
maintaining their competitive edge by aggressively cutting costs, encouraging continuous improvement initiatives and
selectively pursuing those opportunities that offer the most attractive returns.
Combat Systems. Combat Systems sales were $2.1 billion in the third quarter. This result represented less volume than
the year ago quarter primarily in vehicle modifications, combat logistics support, and development programs.
Year-to-date, over 50% of the group's sales decline is related to less MRAP volume and less engineering work which is
largely the result of the cancellation of future Combat Systems. Despite a reduction in sales, earnings were essentially
flat with last year's third quarter as margins expanded in several of our businesses.
The 150 basis point year-over-year margin improvement is the result of strong operating performance and less
engineering and development content. Total backlog for Combat Systems was essentially unchanged from second
quarter at $12.8 billion. Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $475 million for Stryker vehicles and
Abrams tanks, $80 million for Iraqi tank logistics support, $260 million for reactive armor, guns and biological
detection systems, and a $120 million award to supply ammunition to the Canadian armed forces. Because of the
success of Stryker double-V hull testing we received another series of orders for the new hulls subsequent to the
quarter. Double-V modifications of the current Stryker fleet remain another promising opportunity. We were also
notified earlier this month that our U.S. vehicle business was selected to negotiate a contract to produce Merkava APC
main hulls and kits for the Israeli government. We expect to add this program to backlog in the first half of next year
and will deliver these hulls over the next several years.
We made progress on several international programs in the quarter, delivering the first of 140 Iraqi tanks, finalizing
preparations for FMS LAV production, and progressing through Canadian LAV upgrade engineering work. Despite
this progress international sales are coming more slowly than anticipated but should grow more significantly in 2011.
Consistent with my earlier report, a number of international programs have been slowed by their country's financial
status but none have been cancelled or withdrawn.
Combat expects to book several additional international orders in the fourth quarter, including an FMS LAV order
totaling $250 million, the first production contract for an FMS tank upgrade program totaling $300 million, and a $100
million order for German Eagle vehicles. In the first half of 2011, we expect to add the first tranche of production
funding for the $850 million Canadian LAV upgrade program to the backlog.
The pacing of U.S. awards has also lagged our expectations this year. Some of the awards expected in the first half,
including armor and biological detection systems came late in the third quarter and will result in lower sales than
previously expected in 2010. Other program awards, most notably the ground combat vehicle competition, will push
out until 2011.

Looking forward for the group, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest by far. For the full year, I expect
the group sales to be around $9 billion. My expectation for the group's full year earnings remain unchanged. Margins,
therefore, will be around 14%, 40-50 basis points higher than my prior guidance. This margin performance is the result
of strong operational execution in the first nine months of the year and a favorable program mix that includes less
development and initial stage international work than originally anticipated.
As we look ahead, combat's international opportunities combined with current backlog provide relative top-line
stability as international workload mitigates some slowing in our U.S. programs. The group's mature program mix will
result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group had another good quarter, with sales of $1.7 billion, up 12% over the year
ago period and 4% sequentially. Earnings totaled $169 million, up 9% over last year and consistent with last quarter's
result. Sales and earnings growth were driven by growing Virginia-class volume and SSBN Replacement design
efforts. The group's third quarter operating margin was 9.9%, down modestly from both the year ago period and the
prior quarter due to mix shift in our surface combatant programs. With that said, this operating margin exceeded my
expectations due to particularly good performance at Electric Boat and NASSCO.
Electric Boat's third quarter delivery of USS Missouri is representative of the focus resident at each of our three yards.
EB delivered this submarine in a record 65 months, five months faster than any of the six prior Virginia-class boats.
Missouri required 600,000 fewer labor hours than EB's last Virginia-class sub and was 8% under target cost. Marine's
backlog totaled $20.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, down 3% from the end of last quarter. Despite this decline,
the group booked several key orders in the quarter including funding for Bath Iron Works to continue providing
management, engineering and detailed design development for the DDG 51 program.
NASSCO also received funding for advanced engineering and long lead materials for the new mobile landing platform,
MLP. Pending final contract negotiations with our customer, we expect to add several construction contracts to Bath's
backlog in the first half of next year, including DDG's 1001 and 1002, the second and third of the Zumwalt class, and
DDG 115, the restart of the DDG 51 program.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group sales will look similar to the third quarter with operating margins in the
mid 9% range as the surface combatant mixed shift at Bath Iron Works becomes more apparent. For the full year, sales
should be up approximately 5% compared with last year and margins will be in the high 9% range, slightly better than
my prior guidance.
Looking ahead, our shipyards enjoy a healthy backlog and an attractive opportunity set. In addition to our Navy work,
we continue to see renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers and anticipate that we can leverage our
excellent commercial tanker performance to win new commercial work in 2011.
Over the next two to three years, you will see the potential for margin improvement as surface combatant fixed price
work builds, commercial shipbuilding opportunities materialize, and construction on two per year Virginia is realized.
Aerospace. The Aerospace group's third quarter results were marked by improved order activity, service volume and
operational performance. Group sales were nearly $1.3 billion, up 15% from last year's third quarter due to more green
aircraft deliveries and higher services volume. Earnings were $199 million, a nearly 60% increase over the same period
last year, while margins were 15.4%, a 420 basis point improvement. When compared with this year's second quarter,
sales, earnings and margins were down due to the two-week furlough at Gulfstream which caused fewer green
deliveries and the timing of R&D costs. I expect sales, earnings and margins to show improvement in the fourth
quarter.
The business jet market, particularly in the large cabin long-range segment, continued to make strides toward recovery
in the third quarter including further reduction in preowned aircraft levels. Gulfstream took one preowned aircraft in
trade this quarter and sold two aircraft for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, Gulfstream had no preowned
aircraft in inventory.

Customer interest remains healthy as Gulfstream booked more orders in the third quarter than in any quarter since the
economic downturn began in mid-2008. On an absolute basis, dollar denominated book to bill was 1.2 times. Orders
handily outpaced defaults resulting in a modest 1% decline in the backlog from the end of the second quarter. The
group's backlog remains a robust $17.6 billion.
In addition to current backlog, our pipeline of new opportunities remains strong. We continue to experience strong
international order activity and interest particularly in emerging markets. In the quarter, Latin America and Asia Pacific
represented nearly a third of order activity and now comprise over 40% of backlog. Recent orders span the entirety of
our in-production and new aircraft portfolio.
Flying hours improved, again, this quarter, a reality that helped Gulfstream's service facilities enjoy their highest
quarterly volume ever. Year-to-date, Gulfstream's service business is up 18.5%. Beyond improved utilization figures
and a growing installed fleet, Gulfstream's service volume reflects their unwavering commitment to providing best in
class support. In the quarter, Gulfstream's large cabin business jets were voted number one for the eighth consecutive
year in the annual AIN Product Support Survey.
Jet Aviation service business has also enjoyed healthy growth this year, up nearly 10% year-to-date. As the
international installed fleet grows, we are adapting by growing our product support organization which is the largest in
the industry today. Jet continues to enhance its service offerings across the globe with particular emphasis in Asia, a
region whose installed base promises to grow rapidly over the next several years.
Although Jet's service related sales were up in the quarter, overall volume was down modestly from last quarter on
lower completion revenue. Business jet completion's work has been lighter this year as OEMs deliver fewer aircraft.
Conversely, the narrow-body/wide-body pipeline remains robust and Jet signed agreements to complete three more of
these aircraft in August. Jet continues to take steps to improve profitability, including consolidating its U.S.
completions and MRO operations at its Cahokia, Illinois facility near St. Louis. Planned deliveries for large cabin
aircraft are on track at 75 this year. Mid cabin orders were more plentiful than anticipated in the quarter and I now
expect a total approaching 30 this year, several more than I guided you to in July.
We continued to make exciting progress on the product development front. With three G250 aircraft and four, soon to
be five, G650 aircraft in flight tests we are on glide slope toward 2011 FAA, EASA certification for both aircraft. In
fact, recently the fourth G650 test article and the first ever Gulfstream test article with a fully outfitted interior flew the
fastest ultra-range flight, long-range flight ever flown by a business jet. This is a compelling demonstration for the
G650's exceptional high-speed cruise capabilities. That was 5,000 nautical miles at .9 mach in 9 hours and 45 minutes.
Both aircraft flew to NBAA in Atlanta, Georgia last week with the G250 making its maiden trans-Atlantic voyage en
route. For the full year I expect the Aerospace group sales to be up mid single-digit above last year, slightly higher than
my prior guidance due to better than anticipated service volume. Operating margins will also be better than previously
anticipated, close to 16%. As we look to the future, the group will enjoy steady top-line growth driven by new product
introduction and improving service volume. We will continue to manage this business with great discipline on the up
cycle as we did through the down.
In summary, General Dynamics continues to perform well and remains positioned for a good fourth quarter. For the
year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.70 to $6.75, an increase from my prior guidance.
As we look toward 2011, the defense and aerospace markets remain dynamic. Amidst the uncertainty of a
fast-changing marketplace and budget adjustments, we remain focused on execution as we believe this will enable us to
leverage our incumbency to win new opportunities.
Our defense backlog already includes a solid order book for next year and we are encouraged by the Congressional
support our programs have received in the 2011 Defense budget appropriations process. Consequently, as we look to
the future, I believe General Dynamics will offer a sustaining defense business with excellent operating margins and
strong free cash flow.
In addition, our aerospace business will be the growth engine throughout the near and immediate -- intermediate
timeframe. We are aggressively managing our business -- businesses for profitability with continued emphasis on

earnings growth and efficient conversion of earnings to cash. Our strong balance sheet and excellent cash outlook
afford us tremendous flexibility to continue deploying capital in a balanced manner in order to create the greatest
long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details,
Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some observations about our cash performance and
financing activities. As you know, we experienced growth in working capital through the first half of the year due to
timing of contract payments, particularly in our IS&T business. Continued focus on this area has begun to yield
positive results. In the third quarter we reversed the trend and trimmed 2010 POWC growth by a third. You can see the
impact of that effort and the impact that it had on strong free cash flow performance in the quarter. In addition, as Jay
noted, we repaid $700 million of fixed rate notes in the third quarter.
As a result of strong free cash flow and debt repayment, we reduced our net debt by almost $400 million in the quarter.
This leaves us at the end of the third quarter with a strong balance sheet and a debt-to-equity ratio of just under 24%.
With the third quarter debt repayment we're expecting net interest expense for the year of between 155 and $160
million, consistent with our previous guidance but probably toward the lower end of that range.
I should point out that in 2011 we're planning a $750 million debt repayment and a $300 million pension contribution,
very similar to the debt repayment and the pension contribution made in 2010. Finally, a quick note on our tax rate. I
previously guided you to a range which was as low as 31.2%. That range was predicated largely on a then-in-process
2009 tax return. As we finalized the return in the third quarter, we identified some additional R&D tax credits that
drove the rate to the low end of our range. At this point, we're forecasting an effective rate of 31.2% for the year, with
some opportunity to improve. That compares with the full-year rate of 31.5% last year. The tax rate in the third quarter
reflects the true-up to the reduced full year rate. That completes my remarks and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the
Q&A.
Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Hugh. As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has an opportunity to

<Q - Rob Stallard>: [inaudible] Yeah, I thought I'd ask you a quick question on the Aerospace side and how demand
for the G650 and G250 have been tracking over last quarter, if you've seen any interesting moves in the backlog there.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Rob, on the -- I would say that activity has been very
steady and encouraging in both aircraft types. The 650 backlog, as you know, has been very strong all along and we're
now up at about 200 orders and looking good. The 250 is taking orders as well. We've talked about that before. It was a
little early to get into the order book. It showed well at NBAA and people actually seeing the airplane now, it's doing

well in flight tests so that order book is starting to develop as well and so we're very bullish on both of them.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Are you able at this stage to give a little bit more character on how you expect the G250 to ramp
up?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I mean, it's -- it will enter into service late next year,
as you know. And we'll ramp it up as the market dictates but we think our timing relative to recovery in the mid-cabin
market looks pretty good at this point. So we'll see how it goes. But we're -- as I say, the order activity and the general
interest in that 250 aircraft is increasing essentially week by week. So like I say, we're pretty bullish on that one and
you know we are on the 650.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please --
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Jay, that was a great amount of detail, and much appreciated on IS&T. And you talked about
the sub businesses there. Could you perhaps given what's going on inside the beltway talk about the longer-term growth
trends for each of those businesses and maybe highlight some of the pressure points on sales or margins?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I mean, we -- the areas that I highlighted for us
are all growth opportunities I mean, the battlespace management tactical communications piece as I described is just,
what, 45% of the business, really, in one instance, is the core network communications system for the United States
Army in the 21st century going forward. So that will be an ever-growing, and you know we're passing through LRIP in
WIN-T and we're expecting an LRIP decision on JTRS here within the next two quarters, I think. So that business will
continue to mature and develop going forward.
The IT services piece, for us, is very good business, both in the infrastructure, the support, the healthcare, IT. So we've
got many opportunities across what I'd call a diverse growth portfolio in IT, you know. And then we've got our ISR that
I talked about which is 20% of the portfolio. But, again, it recognized a necessary fast current in both DoD space and,
frankly, in agency space and commercial applications. Wrap all around that cyber, which will take a big tent with lots
of players in it for as long as the eye can see, we believe, and we're well grounded in cyber, as I mentioned in my
remarks. So I see all of that and more giving us tremendous opportunity in IS&T going forward.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard Rubel>: Thank you very much. Jay, could you talk a little bit more about, I mean, you talked a lot about
combat, but just sort of the evolving change that's occurred? I mean, one would have expected a lot of this hard metal
to pretty much be in place for the third quarter and some of it seems to have slipped and, you know, maybe you can sort
of talk about what sort of marching orders you're expecting from that group going forward.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, Howard. Thanks. Look, the first thing I would
say about combat in terms of the year is that the execution at the business level has been outstanding in all respects. So
we've got a great team doing superb work across a global scale here. I'm very proud of them. Now, as to the sales
attendant to that performance, we had, as you know, a very -- what I would call with the clarity of hindsight, a very
aggressive sales plan at the start of the year which has been softened by the realities, mostly timing realities, of the
world scene. So I would tell you that the first half of the year, in terms of sales growth, if you will, pretty much
happened the way we thought it would. And I think I've been saying all along that we were heavily loaded to the
second half of the year which is not terribly unusual for combat but it was more so this year, I think, than perhaps

historically. So we were heavily loaded to the second half of the year.
I would tell you in addition to what I said in my remarks about year-over-year comparisons with MRAB be volume
going away and FCS being cancelled a lot of what we're seeing, Howard, is just the timing of these programs. You
know, the indigenous vehicle programs we're seeing European sovereign debt realities impact us in Spain with the 8x8
competition that was going to happen this year has been moved into the mid-year of 2011, but reaffirmed by the
Spanish Ministry of Defense as being essential to the Spanish Army. So we believe that one will still come. There are
others in Portugal and other European countries that have pushed out a little bit, prolonging contract negotiations on
sure things, if you will.
The Canadian LAV is probably the best example of that. $850 million, I mentioned it in my remarks, it's happening,
okay, as we speak, we're in development contract execution right now. We'll get the production contract in 2011 and
off we go. And, oh, by the way, there, Howard, I should just mention on the Canadian side is -- you know, when we
talk about that LAV upgrade we also talk about the tactical armor patrol vehicle and the CCV as downrange programs
that are coming. But just in the last few days it's been reaffirmed by the -- my source was the Army Chief up there, who
basically ties this as a family of land combat vehicles that will all be -- the RFPs for TAPV and CCTV are going to
happen this year according to him. And so we'll be in production, whoever gets that will be in production from 2012 to
2015. So it's coming, it's just not here this year.
Ditto with the U.K. Scout vehicle which we're in contract right now on development but it will be more to follow in the
coming years. The international vehicle export business we talked about before, the FMS LAVs and some of the tanks,
we've got some of them, we've got more to come. Some of them we expect here in the fourth quarter. Would I bet
everything on the fourth quarter? No. But if it's not in the fourth quarter, it will be in 2011. So it's all coming.
The U.S. vehicle business, we've had descope on some of the programs that we talked about earlier in the year, Cougar
MoD is one of them; the remote weapons system for Stryker is another one that comes to mind. We'd had delay in new
programs like the GCV as I talked about. And honestly a little bit of lumpiness I guess you could say in kind of the
reset and modification work on Stryker and Abrams as the Force reconstitutes or repositions itself in some measures.
And then, on the weapons systems business we've seen some delay as well, armor is a classic example. And then we
had some softness in the commercial axle market and some of the aftermarket that goes with that that actually is
coming in now. But anyway, I think that's probably more than you asked me for but to frame it all or to sum it all, I
would say it was also a very strong order quarter for combat which also bodes well, I think, for the rest of the year and
for 2011. You know, historically European Land Systems has been the strongest in the fourth quarter. I expect that to
happen again this year. Okay?

Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, thanks, Jay. I have a question that relates to Howard's question which is, we've got this U.K.
Strategy Defence and Security Review (sic) [Strategic Defence and Security Review] and I want to get some clarity as,
obviously there was a bit of surprise in terms of delays in 2010 which is probably going to affect your guidance in
2011. Can you give us some color on what effect you see tightening of European budgets in terms of its potential effect
on 2011 sales and time of expected awards?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: With absolute precision, I can't do that, Heidi. But
my sense is, I mean, I mentioned, for example, the Spanish 8x8. We believe, every indication we have says that
decision will be rendered by mid 2011. And the U.K. piece is proceeding apace and we're in a development contract of
like $750 million, I think, to develop the first seven or so vehicles. All that is going. So for us, the Strategic Defence
Review in the U.K. was -- we came out of that quite nicely, actually, between the Scout vehicle decision and the
implications that it has for our Bowman program over there, et cetera. So we'll see program movement to the right in
2011, again, I'm not naïve enough to believe that won't happen. But as I've told you before, nobody's pulled any cards

given their financial status.

Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Myles Walton>: It looks like the default activities in the quarter might have been about 400 million. Can you just
give us some color on the level of liquidated damages and also should we expect to see a slowdown in that through the
rest of the year?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The default activity, honestly, was modest, shall we
say. The order activity was really strong, the liquidated damages, Myles, were de minimis. I expect the order book to
continue to grow. I expect the default activity to continue at a small or a low but steady, as we've talked before, level.
People move in, people move out. But remember, our discussions about backlog and sweet spots, and in large cabin
we're still looking at an 18-month backlog for both G450 and G550 and if I seem distracted it's because we're having a
horrendous storm right now that I can barely hear myself for the rain hitting the windows, I apologize. But the backlog
is strong and you know what the order book is like on the G650 and now the 250 is building so we're bullish on all of
that.

Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Co. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you very much. Jay, you gave us the gains in services year-to-date. Could you give us
some color on what the serve to services businesses were up both sequentially and year-over-year? And secondly,
update us on the expected green deliveries of G650s for next year.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I can't pull a number out of my head, Cai, give
Amy a call about that. I want to say, did I say it was 18.5% year-to-date? But we're very -- the services business is
improving as the flight activity increases which is happening out there certainly in the Gulfstream fleet. But the green
deliveries on 650s will start late next year. How many, I'm not exactly sure yet. Probably 10 to 12 is kind of the hip
pocket number I've got in my head right now. And then you know I think I've talked before about the production rates
that I'm advertising right now in '12, '13, and '14 of 17, 33 and 33 which before someone asks me, yes, we would look
forward to accelerating past that but we're just not ready to do that yet although we're encouraged by everything we see
and experience with the G650.

Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - David Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, David.
<Q - David Strauss>: Jay, could you talk about your thoughts on potentially raising additional debt in the current
low-interest rate environment? And then second, on pension, I know it doesn't impact you guys like it does the other
defense companies, but talk about maybe what impact it could have on 2011 given what we've seen on the -- potentially
are seeing on the discount rate side?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'll take the last part first and, frankly, I mean, Hugh
said it, we're -- our pension exposure right now is very much under control. We paid 270 this year, we think we'll
probably pay 300 next year and it won't get in the way of anything else we need to do as far as capital deployment goes.

And so we don't anticipate any cosmic changes there in terms of what our requirement will be. As to the debt market, I
know it's a favorite question that we get a lot. But I would just tell you that kind of in keeping with the way General
Dynamics does business, which I like to think is very disciplined, we kind of don't go to the debt market unless we
have a specific reason for going to the debt market. If I got a purpose in mind and we need to go, we've got plenty of
access to go there. But we don't do it just to get some cash.
We are -- we've got $2 billion in credit facilities, we're great cash generators, we've got lots of cash on hand right now
and so we'll continue to generate more. It gives us the flexibility we need to be acquisitive which we historically, as you
know, have been and will continue to be as opportunities present themselves. So we're not inclined to go to the debt
market for good deals because actually the commercial paper market right now, which we've got great access to would
give us more attractive rates than the debt market. We also retired our $700 million notes this year at par with
essentially no -- with no economic cost to us. So we think we're managing that side in a pretty balanced manner.

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Just back on the Combat Systems, can you just talk a little bit about -- it sounds like the mix in
terms of the development and engineering which helps you this year, should I be thinking about as we go into next year
that that's going to put some pressure on margin? And then your number for this year implies something on the order of
2.8 billion in the fourth quarter. I know European Land Systems helps but does that imply something closer to a
double-digit type of growth rate next year from the lower base this year as things start to move in?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm not ready to really speak to next year yet, Sam,
but clearly the fourth quarter will be the strongest quarter, and I think if I didn't say this earlier I think I meant to but at
any rate it will be -- it's always strong in Combat. ELS is a large part of that reality, but this year it will be stronger still
and that kind of was the plan all the way along. And the way things are coming to fruition, it will indeed be the plan for
the rest of this year. So the margin attachment to that, the margins we received or that we gained this time are outsized,
shall we say, a little bit. I would think of this wonderful business that we have in Combat Systems as kind of a 13%
steady-go business going forward.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America, please proceed.
<Q - Ronald Epstein>: Yeah, just following up on I guess two things. You said about 13% margins on a go forward
basis. So what we saw this quarter was a little bit of an anomaly in terms of the strength of the margins in Combat
Systems?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: A little bit, yes, Ron.
<Q - Ronald Epstein>: And what drove that?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: One, I'll say it again, but one is not an anomaly and
that's the performance of the team in Combat Systems. But some of it has to do with mix shift. Some of it has to do
with just timing of the products in our portfolio and the way they come to us, and all of that kind of coalesced to give us
more uplift and kind of the perfect storm on the up right now. But I would -- for calibration purposes, I think I would
bring my head in around that 13% and up or down a little from that.
<Q - Ronald Epstein>: Okay. Great. And then --

<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Plus engineering too, by the way, did I say that?
<Q - Ronald Epstein>: Okay, okay. And then I guess on the Gulfstream front, can you just give us an update on how
flight test is going on both the 650 and the 250?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You bet. In a word, very -- or two words, very well.
The 250 is -- there are three birds in flight test right now. I mentioned that one of them, which I finally got to see, touch
and sit in, in Atlanta, flew, obviously, trans-Atlantic from Israel but then was going to do a number of its test points
here in the United States before going back to Israel. Everything is looking good. I talked to the pilot, test pilots on both
aircraft. We're very happy. The 650 continues to, shall we say, outperform in all corners of the flight envelope. It's
magnificent. I would also take this opportunity to mention that -- I said it before but it's worth foot-stomping I think,
the test bird that was down in Atlanta at NBAA with a full interior is the same bird that we used to get the 5,000-mile,
.9 mach, nine hour 45 minutes. So we're essentially taking a service bird into the test regimen and getting all or more
than we expected out of it. It's -- we're -- if you can't tell, we're very pleased.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from J.P. Morgan, please proceed.
<Q - Joseph Nadol III>: Thanks, good afternoon.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey Joe.
<Q - Joseph Nadol III>: Jay, just from a high-level, it's a tough environment, I think, in Washington is the consensus
and in Defense broadly. And some of your peers have noted that the last week or so in their calls and your combat
business has seen the impact of that in terms of the guidance coming down the last couple quarters for this year. I'm just
trying to reconcile some of the, you know, some of the commentary on sort of go forward numbers not only in Combat
but IS&T, steady growth the next several years, some of the comments on Marine which are bullish, and is -- do you
think GD is just -- these businesses are just much better positioned than the industry? Or -- and I'm trying to reconcile, I
guess, the environment and your commentary. It's good to be optimistic but how do I get comfortable with that
guidance given the environment?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, first of all, I'm not giving guidance for next
year or beyond. But I think if you look at the portfolios and you look at the relevance of the businesses, I mean, the
Marine group is going to be building Virginia-class submarines for a long time. As we've talked before, the Navy will
need surface combatants of scale that we build for a long time. So that workload and the repair attendant to that will be,
certainly, I would categorize it as steady if not some growth going forward. And I'm not -- I'm being realistic in terms
of how I think of Defense. It's not going to grow, okay, like it has been for -- very obviously. But we do believe that
there may be some modest growth opportunity in there. And what I cited in the fast currents in IS&T are a classic
example of that.
On the Combat side, that's a steady business, as we see it right now, okay. We see a lot of 2011 already in program of
record. And if you look at the United States Army, for example, and look at the 20-some heavy brigade combat teams
and the seven going to eight and probably going to nine Stryker brigade combat teams with the former at 60 Abrams
per brigade and the latter at 330-plus Strykers per brigade, that kit is not going to change out until you see a
fundamental change in the force structure of the United States Army.
So we try to think of it in pragmatic terms, thread-based and core-based, if you will. And that really, I think, informs
the basis of my comments as much as anything, Joe. And on the aerospace side that is clearly a growth engine for
everyone, I would say, in the industry but particularly when you're driving the premier brand of Gulfstream with new
product about to hit the street with 200-plus airplanes in the G650 queue, et cetera.
So put all that together and you've got a -- I believe, a very steady, sustaining Defense business. Now, could things
change? That depends on budgets and all the realities. But I still believe with everything I've got that the threat and the

appetite for risk-taking at a national strategic level will derive the Defense budget as much as anything. Will there be
pressure? Is there pressure? Good Lord, yes. Will it tighten? It already is. In every segment we deal with. There's no
question about that. So we're not denying any of that. But we deal with it day-by-day, contract-by-contract,
platform-by-platform, system-by-system and we think we deal with it very well.

question this afternoon.

Sure thing. The final question will come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Thank you, that's a heck of a storm you've got going on there in the background.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: I just wanted to focus in on a very specific question on IS&T. Do you have much exposure to
the JFCOM closure, is that one of those 2% programs that you talked about? You didn't have any programs larger than
2% in IS&T. And then someone asked earlier what the revenue outlook was and you did a great job of explaining that
for IS&T. But I think he also asked about the margin outlook and I don't think you had an opportunity yet to address
that so I wonder if you wouldn't do that now.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, the margin piece, you know, it's a double-digit
margin business, if that's -- you're talking about IS&T, right?
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Yeah, and the outlook for it going forward.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. We'll be double digits in IS&T. We lead with
that right now. We're proud of it and we have every reason to believe we'll sustain it. The JFCOM piece, I won't go into
the whole, you know the story, I think, Jason, but for us the impact to us, we have, you know, I think probably 300 or
so folks attached to or working with the Joint Forces Command down there in Tidewater. And we'll see what happens,
how this shapes out. But I believe what we're hearing and feeling now is that as JFCOM reconstitute -- I mean, is stood
down or reported somewhere else in some way, shape or fashion not all of those missions are going to be eliminated.
And we would expect to move with wherever those missions are translated to. So we -- that -- all that said it's not a
major impact on us certainly and we'll go with the mission if the mission moves. And we'll reconstitute somewhere else
if our part of it is eliminated.
