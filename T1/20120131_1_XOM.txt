MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Exxon Mobil Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call
is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor
Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal
Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. The focus of this call is
ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011. I will refer to the slides that
are available through the Investor section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to
our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.
Moving to Slide 3, I'll start with an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic
recovery was slower in the fourth quarter, largely due to weakness in Europe. GDP improvement in the United States
and Japan was tempered by negative growth in the European Union. U.S. real GDP growth was 2.8%, improving from
1.8% in the third quarter while Japan delivered another quarter of positive growth as post-earthquake recovery
continues. In general, non-OECD growth remains robust, even with a slight decline in growth from China. Energy
markets were mixed in the fourth quarter. Crude oil and non-U.S. natural gas prices remained strong while worldwide,
industry refining margins saw a significant decline as did commodity chemicals margins.

Turning now to the fourth quarter, financial results as shown on Slide 4. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter of 2011 earnings
excluding special items were $9.4 billion, an increase of $150 million from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 47%. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding special items were $1.97,
up $0.12 from a year ago. The Corporation distributed more than $7.2 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter
through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was utilized to purchase
shares.
Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the first quarter of 2012. CapEx in the
fourth quarter was $10 billion, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010.
We continue to invest in robust projects throughout the business cycle, all of which serve to help meet global demand
for crude oil, natural gas and finished products while supporting economic growth including job creation. Our cash
generation remains strong, with $17.6 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales including $6.9 billion
associated with asset sales. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, cash and marketable securities totaled $13.1 billion
and debt was $17 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash and
marketable securities increased from $11.3 billion to $13.1 billion, including cash on deposit associated with potential
asset sales, which have not yet closed and therefore are not reflected in earnings. The combined impact of strong
earnings, depreciation expense, higher working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program
yielded $17.6 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and
equipment, or PP&E, of $8.6 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.2 billion. Additional financing and investing
activities had no net impact in the quarter.
Moving now to the full year results as shown on Slide 6. ExxonMobil's full year 2011 earnings, excluding special
items, were $41.1 billion, up $10.6 billion from 2010. Earnings per share for the year excluding special items were
$8.42, up $2.20 from 2010. The Corporation distributed $29 billion to shareholders in 2011 through dividends and
share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $20 billion was utilized to purchase shares.
CapEx in 2011 was $36.8 billion, up $4.5 billion from 2010 mainly due to acquisitions of unconventional assets
including the Phillips Companies and continued progress on our world-class project portfolio including the Kearl Oil
Sands Project. Our cash generation was very strong $66.5 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales,
including $11.1 billion associated with asset sales.
Moving now to the full-year cash flow statement has shown on Slide 7. During the year, cash and marketable securities
increased from $8.5 billion to $13.1 billion, including cash on deposit associated with potential asset sales, which have
not yet closed and therefore are not reflected in earnings. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation
expense, higher working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $66.5 billion of
cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment, or PP&E, of $31
billion and shareholder distributions of $29 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased our cash and
marketable securities by $1.9 billion.
Moving on to Slide 8 and a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $9.4 billion
increased $150 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. Upstream earnings increased $1.3 billion while Downstream
earnings decreased by $725 million. Chemical earnings were down $524 million. Lower corporate and financing
expenses increased earnings $50 million versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
As shown on Slide 9, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $9.4 billion declined by $930 million compared
with the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower industry Refining and Chemicals margins.
Looking now at the full year comparison on Slide 10, ExxonMobil's full year 2011 earnings excluding special items
were up $10.6 billion to $41.1 billion, an increase of 35% from 2010 primarily due to strong oil and gas realizations.
Upstream earnings increased $10.3 billion while downstream earnings were up $892 million and chemical earnings
were down $530 million. Corporate and financing expenses for the full year in 2011 were $2.2 billion, down $104

million from 2010. Our guidance for corporate and financing expenses continues to be $500 million to $700 million per
quarter.
Moving next to fourth quarter business highlights beginning on Slide 11. The offshore installation of our deepwater
Angola Satellites project is nearly 50% complete with development drilling well underway and targeting start-up in
mid-2012. The project will involve a subsea tieback to the existing Kizomba A and B FPSOs and produce
approximately 100,000 barrels per day on a gross basis. This level of production is similar to levels achieved by FPSOs
at our Saxi Batuque and Mondo developments.
The PNG project is also progressing as planned towards a 2014 start-up. Recent milestones include completion of over
130 kilometers of offshore pipeline, welding of over 100 kilometers on the onshore pipeline and commencement of
piling work at the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant.
At Banyu Urip in Indonesia, we have issued five major EPC contracts including those associated with the onshore and
offshore pipelines and mooring tower. The project remains on schedule for full field production in 2014 with a targeted
initial gross production of 165,000 barrels per day.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we funded our interest in the Lucius Development which is scheduled for a 2014 start-up.
ExxonMobil's Hadrian South discovery will also tie into the Lucius facility with start-up planned for 2014. Also during
the quarter, we completed a settlement with the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of Justice
regarding the Julia Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This will allow us to progress the initial phase of
development of this important discovery.
Now turning to Slide 12. Construction at the Kearl initial development is now 87% complete and is on schedule to start
up in late 2012 with an initial gross production rate of approximately 110,000 barrels per day. Also during the quarter,
we funded the Kearl expansion project, which will add an additional 110,000 barrels per day of production and is
anticipated to start up in late 2015. When combined with the Kearl initial development, the expansion will develop 3.2
billion barrels. Future debottlenecking of both phases will increase output to reach the regulatory capacity of 345,000
barrels per day and fully develop the 4.6 billion barrel resource.
Turning now to an exploration update on Slide 13. ExxonMobil maintains a balanced global exploration portfolio,
which supports an active exploration drilling program aimed at testing new play concepts, opportunities in existing
basins and near-field wildcats across the globe.
For example, we are currently drilling a well in the Black Sea offshore Romania and participating in an exploration
well offshore Tanzania, both of which will test new deepwater play concepts. In Nigeria, we mobilized the West
Polaris rig and commenced a new deepwater exploration program in Oil Production License 214. In the Gulf of
Mexico, we were the high bidder on 50 new exploration blocks in Lease Sale 218, which further strengthen our acreage
position in the Western Gulf of Mexico and leverage our advanced seismic imaging capability. This technology will
allow us to progress new exploration opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico and other basins around the world. We also
maintain an active global unconventional exploration drilling program.
I will now provide an update on some of these activities on Slide 14. We continue to focus our drilling activity to
maximize development of liquids-rich plays. In the Woodford Ardmore, we added another rig and now have eight
operated rigs developing this recently discovered liquids-rich resource where we hold more than 170,000 net acres.
Current drilling is focused on delineating this acreage, which more than tripled in 2011, as well as determining optimal
well spacing and drilling and completion practices. Ardmore well performance continues to be strong and we
completed a total of 31 new wells in 2011. In the Bakken Shale, we have seven operated rigs developing roughly
400,000 net acres of leasehold.
In 2011, we drilled and completed a total of 51 wells, including 18 in the fourth quarter. And notwithstanding severe
weather in the first half of 2011 and increased downtime, our net Bakken liquids production increased 27% in 2011
versus 2010. In the fourth quarter alone, net Bakken liquids production increased 13% versus the third quarter of 2011,
and 41% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. In the Permian Basin of West Texas, we have five operated rigs, which are
developing conventional plays as well as testing new liquids-rich unconventional opportunities. In Canada, we have

had encouraging early results in the Cardium, with two wells on production at year-end and additional drilling planned
in 2012. Finally, we commenced drilling two wells in the Neuquén Basin in Argentina in December to test
unconventional liquids and gas potential.
Turning now to Slide 15 with an update on the Downstream. We continue to make targeted investments where there is
an attractive growth opportunity. We are investing to help meet growing demand for motor fuels with cleaner burning
formulas and to sustain the competitiveness of our refining portfolio well into the future. During the quarter, we
completed a lower sulfur fuels project at Sriracha, Thailand, refinery, which will increase production of cleaner
gasoline and diesel fuels at the refinery by over 50,000 barrels per days. Additionally, construction of the lower sulfur
fuels project has begun at the joint Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil SAMREF refinery in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The
project will include new gasoline and diesel hydrotreating and sulfur recovery equipment, with completion expected by
the end of 2013.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 16. Upstream earnings in the fourth
quarter were $8.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2010. Stronger crude oil and natural gas realizations
increased earnings by $2 billion as crude oil realizations increased over $22 per barrel and gas realizations increased
$1.09 per kcf. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $1.5 billion, due mainly to the impact of lower
entitlement volumes in West Africa, pace decline, downtime, divestments and lower than normal seasonal demand in
Europe, partly offset by the ramp-up of Angola and Iraq projects. All other items, primarily gains from asset
divestments, increased earnings by approximately $800 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth
quarter of 2011 were $21.18.
Moving now to Slide 17. Oil equivalent volumes decreased 9% from the fourth quarter of last year, mainly due to the
impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, decline, downtime, lower than normal seasonal demand in Europe
and divestments.
Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp-up of projects in Angola and Iraq and continued strong performance in
our U.S. Unconventional Resource business. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and
divestments, production declined about 4%.
Turning now to the sequential comparison start on Slide 18. Versus the third quarter of 2011, Upstream earnings
increased by $435 million, higher realizations increased earnings by $190 million as crude oil realizations remained
strong and natural gas realizations increased $0.46 per kcf. Production mix and volume effects increased earnings by
$50 million due mainly to higher seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by the impact of divestments. Other items,
primarily gains from asset divestments and lower exploration expenses, partly offset by higher operating expenses and
unfavorable foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by $190 million.
Moving Slide 19. Oil equivalent volumes increased 6% from the third quarter of 2011, due mainly to higher seasonal
demand in Europe and the ramp-up of projects in Angola, partly offset by the impact of divestments.
Turning now to the full year comparison and starting on Slide 20. Upstream earnings were $34.4 billion in 2011, an
increase of $10.3 billion from 2010. Improvements in global realizations led to an increase of earnings of $10.6 billion.
Lower liquids volumes, mainly due to lower entitlement volumes in West Africa and base decline, partially offset by
project ramp-up in Qatar, lowered earnings by $2.5 billion. All other items, driven by higher gains on asset sales of
about $2.7 billion, increased earnings by $2.2 billion.
Moving to Slide 21. Volumes grew by 1% or 59,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2010. Ramp-up of
projects in Russia, Qatar, Iraq and Angola, combined with continued strong performance in our U.S. Unconventional
Resource business more than offset the impacts of base decline, divestments and lower entitlement volumes in West
Africa. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was up over 4%. For
further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and the IR supplement.
Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 22. Downstream earnings in the
fourth quarter were $425 million, down $725 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. Lower industry refining margins
contributed to a decrease in earnings of $740 million, while volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $30 million.

Other factors increased earnings by $40 million.
Moving to Slide 23. Sequentially, fourth quarter Downstream earnings declined $1.2 billion, largely driven by
significantly lower industry refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million while other
factors increased earnings by $360 million primarily due to inventory or LIFO, benefits and higher gains on asset sales.
A full-year comparison of the Downstream is shown on Slide 24. Downstream full-year 2011 earnings were nearly $4.5
billion, up $892 million from 2010. Higher industry refining margins contributed to an increase in earnings of $800
million. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $630 billion, reflecting the ongoing benefits from investments
and refining optimization activities. Other effects decreased earnings by $540 million, mainly due to the absence of
favorable tax effects and higher expenses.
Turning now to the Chemical financial and operating results and starting on Slide 25. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings
were $543 million, a decrease of $524 million versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Lower margins decreased earnings by
$230 million, mainly in commodity chemicals while volume effects decreased earnings $40 million. Other factors
decreased earnings by $250 million, primarily due to unfavorable tax effects.
Moving to Slide 26. Sequentially, fourth quarter Chemical earnings decreased $460 million. Commodity Chemical
margins declined significantly, driving a negative earnings impact of $390 million. Volume effects increased earnings
by $10 million while other effects decreased earnings by $80 million.
On Slide 27, we show the full-year comparison for Chemical results. 2011 earnings were nearly $4.4 billion, including
record Specialty Chemical earnings of about $1.8 billion. Overall, stronger margins increased earnings by $260 million,
while volume effects decreased earnings by $180 million, mainly due to higher planned maintenance in 2011. Other
effects reduced earnings by $610 million, primarily due to unfavorable tax effects and higher planned maintenance
expenses.
While the fourth quarter was a reminder that the Chemical business is cyclical in nature, ExxonMobil's quality portfolio
of both Commodity and Specialty Chemicals provides upside benefit when commodity margins are strong and a stable,
less cyclical Specialty's earnings base when Commodity Chemical margins are weaker. We continue to leverage our
feed advantage, integration, cost discipline and premium product offerings to outperform throughout the cycle.
While we manage our Downstream and Chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture benefits from the
unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Both businesses delivered strong results in 2011, with
combined earnings of $8.8 billion, up $360 million, from 2010.
Moving to Slide 28. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full-year financial and operating performance was strong and
reflects the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver superior results. As we continue to
focus on operational excellence, deploy high impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration,
ExxonMobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.
And finally, I would like to mention two upcoming events. First, in mid-February, we will be releasing our 2011
reserves performance data. Second, as many of you will already have seen, our Analyst Meeting this year will take
place at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, March 8. This will include a live audio webcast beginning at 9:00
a.m. Eastern, 8:00 a.m. Central Time. ExxonMobil's presenters will be led by Chairman and CEO, Rex Tillerson.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.

<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Thank you. Dave, two somewhat unrelated questions. Can you comment on the status
of West Qurna and how that project is going? And then the related part of that is can you make any comments on
adding acreage in Kurdistan? There's obviously been a lot of press about that, I don't think you've put out anything
officially. That was – that's the first question. Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, let me – Arjun, let me actually answer those in reverse. I don't have any comments
to make today on Kurdistan. I will, though, tell you that in the West Qurna Field, things are proceeding on plan. We
continue to meet our production commitments and progress the redevelopment projects in West Qurna and that's going
very well. The Common Seawater Supply project is also progressing, and we are in the process of finalizing
commercial terms with the Ministry of Oil and other participating IOCs. So things are going well and continuing to
progress as planned.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Thank you. The other question was just on U.S. gas. Looks like your production ticked
up here in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the current gas outlook is pretty weak. You all, I know, take a longer-term
view. Can you provide any comments on how you're thinking about your U.S. gas rig count and outlook in light of
what at least are currently pretty weak prices? Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes. Thank you for that question, Arjun. That's a very topical item today, and I know
there's a lot of questions and a lot of interest in the U.S. gas business and what we're seeing and what we're doing. I
might just take a moment and kind of address the broader picture of U.S. gas. I'll start by saying we remain bullish on
the future of natural gas as an energy source. For those of you that are familiar with our recently released Energy
Outlook, we are very bullish on the demand side of natural gas as an energy source in the U.S. And as we all know,
given the fairly steep decline in conventional gas, unconventional gas will play the dominant role going forward. In that
regard, we are very pleased with our unconventional resource portfolio and look forward to a major participation in that
space.
Now as we all know, due to record production this year and record storage levels and a relatively mild winter to date,
prices have weakened significantly recently. I can tell you that we have not curtailed any gas production and we're still
running 65 to 70 rigs across the space. What has changed over the year is we have re-allocated a large number of those
rigs to liquids and liquids-rich plays. For example, if you were to step back a year and then come forward to today,
we've actually doubled the percentage of the rigs in that fleet that are drilling either liquids or liquids-rich plays and I
mentioned some of those examples in my prepared remarks. So although the overall size of the fleet has remained
about the same, a very substantial portion of that, those rigs are drilling liquids or liquids-rich plays.
Nonetheless, I can also tell you that we are still drilling dry gas wells. We do have a few of those that are required for
lease maintenance or meeting other contractual obligations, but we are drilling a number that continue to provide good
economics. As you would expect, with a drillable well inventory of over 40,000 wells, we're able to put those things in
order and have significant optionality and flexibility to drill them, and that really gives us an opportunity to maximize
the value of that resource over a long period of time. So, if you look at the total market, we continue to be focused long
term, while making the adjustments in our rig fleet to head to the higher value, higher margin products.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: David, just a really quick follow-up.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Given the comments on the Cardium and some of the oil plays, do you see the
opportunity to raise your overall rig count more towards the liquids and liquids-rich plays where 65 to 70 rigs kind of
plus or minus your number for this year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I think as we look across the year, I wouldn't expect the 65 to 70 rigs to change a whole lot
in total, but I think it would be reasonable to expect that we will continue to expand the focus of that drilling to the
liquids and the liquids-rich plays, particularly in some of the areas where we are having good initial success. And we'll
look forward to again bringing on some more wells there. So I think that's what you'll see kind of as the year
progresses.

<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question will come from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Paul. How are you?
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Good, thank you. How are you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: All right.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: David, obviously with these PSC effects, you've had quite a significant step down in volumes.
Thinking back to your Analyst Meeting, I think that the 2011 number was guided to be around 4.6 million barrels per
day of production. You're about 100,000 barrels a day lower than that. Should we sort of reset your trajectory of growth
from that lower level? Or should we think about a structurally lower level you've talked about? I guess PSC volumes,
which I guess are now lost because I assume you're blowing through tranches there and equally a change in how you're
handling – there's somewhat of a change in how you're handling U.S. drilling. Can you just sort of update us on the
outlook for 2012? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, Paul. I think we'll give you a broad outlook on 2012 at the March Analyst Meeting,
and we'll look at both this year and what the go forward. Certainly if you look at our overall projection or production
for the year, again if you back out the effects in particular on entitlements, we did in fact actually do a little better than
the 4%. I think we had targeted 3% to 4%. So, if I just look at the operational performance, we actually did as expected
or perhaps even a little better than expected. As you did note and as we note in the charts, we did see a fairly significant
impact from entitlement volumes across the year.
In particular, if you look year-on-year, it's about 124,000 barrels a day in total. About 100,000 barrels of that was price
related and the other 20,000 barrels was tranche related as we talked about particularly in Nigeria and Angola. So,
clearly, at the prices that we saw this year, we did see an impact. The prices that we were looking at and we put
together our Outlook back in March were a little more conservative than what we saw actually, and so that had the big
effect. But we'll look forward to giving a fulsome discussion in the March Analyst meeting of volumes and drivers for
those going forward here again in about a month.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: And just more specifically forgive me if I missed this in the comments but there was a large gain
in asset sales in upstream. I think we've got the Apache, I think it was probably – there was a deal with Apache in the
North Sea. But could you talk about what else was sold? I'm not clear what that was. Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, we had a – that was the biggest one. The biggest impact that you saw was in the
North Sea. We had some minor other things going on, but the North Sea was the biggest deal and accounted for the
bulk of the asset management gain that we talked about there that you see in the other category.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay. So to be quite specific that it was obviously more than 50% of the number was that specific
deal?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Oh, sure. Sure.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, that was the main item.

Next we'll hear from Faisel Khan with Citi.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Faisel. How are you?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: All right. How are you doing?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good. Thank you.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: All right. Thanks. Just one more time, just on the absolute gain in the quarter on the asset sales
because it's $810 million year-over-year, but what's the absolute number for the quarter? And also, if you can give us
the absolute number for the effects that took place in chemicals, the unfavorable tax, I think, change?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. The absolute impact in the quarter, if you're looking on that $800 million, we had an
impact of about $1 billion in the quarter, was the absolute number.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Understood. And then the effect of the tax, unfavorable tax impact in Chemicals?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, are you interested in the full year impact? Or looking at the quarterly?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Just the fourth quarter.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you look at the fourth quarter, again relative to the prior year, that impact was really
most of that $250 million that you see there, that was the bulk of it.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Got you. And then last question for me, can you be a little more specific about the rig
count in the U.S.? You said you've been shifting a lot of the rigs to liquids-rich plays, but of the 65 to 70 rigs you're
running, how many of those rigs now are running in the liquids-rich plays versus the dry-gas plays.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'll tell you, Faisel, for commercial reasons, we don't want to be that specific. I think what's
important is that it is now a substantial proportion of the total. And again, I mentioned several examples in my prepared
remarks, and you can see the increase we've had in the rigs there. So, without adding all that up and giving you a total,
it's been a significant increase over the last 12 months.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Then what about the Lower 48 production of liquids? How has that trended? What
number is that in the quarterly number for their volumes?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't think we've ever given a – typically give a specific Lower 48 number. If you look at
the total in the U.S., that number has been trending about flat or so over the course. And we've seen a number of ups
and downs there, but nothing real specific to highlight.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. All right. Thanks, David. I appreciate it.
Operator
We'll move on to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Yeah, hello, David. Just coming back to the volumes, if I look at it year-over-year, I mean all
of it's European gas and that's probably why they're in the economy but -

<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: About 214 mcfd of net growth, is there any other areas that you feel as you look at the
performance that it disappointed you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: When we look across the year, in particular on the full year effect, I'll tell you one area
where we did not perform quite as well as we would have expected would have been in downtime. For example, if you
look at the full year, downtime year-over-year was worth about 35,000 barrels per day on a decrease in a number of
areas. And I'm pleased to report that as we came across the end of the year, particularly as we went from the third
quarter to the fourth quarter, we actually got a lot of that back, and that was a big piece of the increase that you saw
sequentially.
Other than that, I think as we look across the year, all of our projects that came online performing very well. The base
decline performed about as expected. The projects that came online are doing well. And overall operations were good,
but I think I mentioned off and on across the year, we did have some unplanned downtime and maintenance outages
and we are working on that. I'll say scheduled downtime was about as expected. So, it was clearly the unplanned
outages, but again, about 35 kbd. Other than that, we're pretty pleased with how things went.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Then if I look at the cash flow, you've got $10 billion of total CapEx. You've got asset sales
increasing. Should I read into this that you're going to be a little bit more aggressive about spending organically and
then perhaps selling some of the tail assets? Or is it just timing in Q4 for that $10 billion run rate?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I wouldn't read anything into that. We had $10 billion in the fourth quarter. I think that was
about the same as it is in the prior year. We generally see a pretty big ramp-up quarter-on-quarter as we get to the end
of the year.
Likewise, on divestments and you've seen a number of those announced that haven't closed yet and will as we move
across this year, particularly in the Downstream. I don't think there's anything special other than it's all part of our
ongoing asset management program. I'll tell you a lot of these deals are a long time in the making. Some years in the
making. And others come up rather quickly as the situation warrants. So, no change in direction. No change of
philosophy for us. Again, timing. And – but we do have a continued program to look at the portfolio, add where we
need to add, divest where it's favorable to us and then restructure where it meets all the stakeholders' needs. And I think
you saw a lot of that over 2011. And again, many of those deals will close in the first half of this year.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Thanks, David.

Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, Dave. Good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: I just want to make sure that I get the number right. You're saying that the absolute asset sales
doing in the Upstream is about $1 billion in the fourth quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And that when I'm looking at, from the fourth to the third quarter, the other item is a positive
$190 million, is that – means that in the third quarter, we have about $800 million in asset sales gain or that there's
other things in that also?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Order of magnitude, that's about right. There are some puts and takes but that's pretty close.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So, what is the full year absolute asset sales gain? If the $2.2 billion that you show as other, that
is the number? Or there is other things inside there also?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, if you – if you're looking at the full year number, where we saw the $2.2 billion...
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Right.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, the full year for the Upstream is about – the delta is about $2.7 billion with an
absolute of about $2.9 billion.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So, absolute is about $2.9 billion in 2011. Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: In Europe, the European gas is down 730 mcfd year-over-year.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Right.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: How much of them is related to weather and how much is actually that the underlying capacity
decline?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I think if you look at the total amount, I think about half of that is weather and the other
half declined more or less. Clearly, sequentially, third quarter to fourth quarter we didn't see near what we were
expecting.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And I think you have mentioned, I probably just missed it, that the cash on deposit from
the future asset sales, how much is that and related to which field?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, Paul, good question. It's $3.6 billion that we have on deposit for potential asset sales
that haven't closed. And although I don't want to give the specific details of what that relates to because, obviously, the
deal hasn't closed and that means we continue to have commercial discussions going on, but I did want you to know it
was there because what you have is cash without an earnings impact. And should the transactions mature and close,
then you'll see an earnings effect some quarter in the future without a cash flow. But that number is $3.6 billion.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: When do you expect to close your deal in Japan?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Oh, by about mid-year.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Mid-year. And that – on the – wondering, some of your other competitor in the Downstream,
the independent refining company, that in the quarter, they have some significant hedging losses due to using WTI to
hedge for their long haul crude supply, wondering whether Exxon did any of that at all? Do you hedge and lock in the
defense so for your long haul crude supply in your Downstream? And if you do, do you use WTI or Brent contracts?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Paul, that's a good question and a pretty straightforward answer. No to all parts of that
question. We don't do any hedging and we certainly don't speculate in the futures markets.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.

Next we'll hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug. How are you doing?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Not too bad. Thank you. I'm going to try a couple also if I may. The first one is really more of a
philosophical question on your U.S. gas statements that you spent some time on earlier. We're all obviously fairly
familiar with the XTO economics from the legacy portfolio. I think it's probably fair to say that some of your dry gas
production is probably challenged from a return on capital and an NPD standpoint. So as – given Exxon's focus on
returns, given the early revenue – or the early – the dependence of those early wells on the early part of the production

to basically justify the economics, at what point would Exxon consider basically zeroing out its dry gas drilling or
indeed curtailing production? Is there a gas price? Or is that a philosophical decision that you just keep drilling right
through?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Doug, I really can't comment or speculate on any forward operating decisions. The
comments I made earlier really talked about where we are today. And again, the plan that I talked about in terms of
what we're drilling and where we're going. But I really don't have a comment to make on what any future operating
decisions that we might take.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. I thought it was worth a try, David. The second one is also a kind of philosophical
question. As we look forwards – and I guess you'll give us an update in March – but you have an awful lot of long-life
assets that are either already in or will be in the portfolio over the next couple of years, arguably stabilizing the
underlying cash flow. Or maybe think about it another way, reducing the maintenance capital. How do you ultimately
think about changing the balance between dividends and share buybacks? Noting that through all your share buybacks
over the last few two years, your absolute dividend payment as a percentage of cash flow has actually declined fairly
precipitously. How do you think about that? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, that's good. Let me hit that in a couple of areas. One, in terms of the CapEx. Yes. As
you note, we are in a CapEx mode now and have been for the last year or two and will for the next couple years
investing in large, legacy projects that as we talked about before, have all of their – or most all of their CapEx up front.
Certainly in the last few years, the Qatar investments would qualify for that. Now the two Kearl Oil Sands projects,
Morgan LNG, Papua New Guinea LNG and those sorts of things. So, surely, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a
number of projects are due to come on in the 2012, 2014 timeframe. And we'll begin to see both the production and
cash flows from that.
Without going too far beyond that, we've got a lot of other opportunities we're working on as we've discussed and we'll
discuss more at the Analyst Meeting that we hope give us the opportunities to continue to spend CapEx in order to
grow the business profitably. As you know, one of the opportunities we have in addition to our ongoing drilling
program is the strategic cooperation agreement with Rosneft, which we are progressing and progressing as planned.
And as I've mentioned in prior calls, that gives us tremendous exposure to what could be a very, very attractive
opportunity.
Now as far as the dividend versus share buyback, I don't have any change in our approach to communicate today. We
are committed to continuing to provide a reliable and growing, stable dividend to our shareholders. And then once
we've invested in all the attractive projects and opportunities we have available, returning a lot of the cash to the
shareholders through share repurchases. So, that's a long-term kind of approach we've taken over the last many years.
And I would expect going forward – although we continue to look at that all the time, every quarter, I don't have any
change to communicate today.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right. Appreciate the answers, David. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: In the Downstream between sales in Malaysia – I think it was Q3 – and then Japan and
consolidation of fuels marketing and lubes, restructuring's becoming fairly meaningful in refining and marketing. And
so, my question regards the strategic rationale behind these moves and whether you consider these actions as normal
course of business or maybe more? And either way, do you know the productivity benefit that the company expects to
realize from these actions?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, that's a good question. I'll say it's really part of an ongoing program we've had in the
Downstream for a long time as opposed to any specific change in strategy or event. We, like others, have been looking
at our Downstream assets around the world. And where we have had areas where in certain locations, that our assets are
of significantly more value to others, we've actually sold those businesses. The resulting impact has been very positive
on our returns in the Downstream. So, we continue to progress and look at those things. We've about finished up the
retail conversion in the U.S., and that has gone on very well. And the earnings associated with those divestments have
been very strong.
As you mentioned a couple of the other sales that we have out there, in Malaysia, in Argentina and Central America
that we announced last year should close some time in the first quarter or second quarter of this year. And then the
Japan restructuring that we mentioned here last couple of days, we should also close again by midyear.
But taking all that into account, we do continue to invest in the business where it makes sense. The ultra low sulfur
diesel investments that we've made in the last couple of years. I mentioned some additional lower sulfur and cleaner
burning fuel projects that are underway, as well as of course the Chemicals projects that we have underway. So, we
remain committed to these businesses. But again, as we said in our outlook for energy, in certain parts of the world the
demand for transportation fuels is flat to down, and I would expect us to optimize there. And where we have
opportunities for growth, we will.
But I would say overall, if you look over the last couple of years and kind of what's out there now, it's been a very
successful asset management program. And we're very pleased with it, but it is an opportunistic program. And I don't
have any guidance going forward other than the deals we got out there to close.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. I follow. So – and also in U.S. E&P, profitability has been a little soft over past
couple quarters. And I realize that natural gas prices have been weak, but crude oil performed pretty well. And so, my
question is whether you can comment on the cost trend that you're experiencing in U.S. E&P? And/or any other color
you can provide on U.S. E&P profitability?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Certainly on the overall unit margin or unit profitability, we are of course impacted
by the decline in gas prices. And while we do intend to give a nice update in March on the unconventional business in
the U.S., I can tell you that some of the objectives we set out at the time of the merger are coming to fruition. We are
seeing improvement in capital efficiency. We are seeing reductions in operating expense. We're seeing improved
productivity on the wells through a number of things, everything from pad spacing to length of laterals to how we array
the laterals in certain areas.
So, a number of both engineering and technology things we've brought to the table are paying off. And I think that
helps mitigate the impact of the lower expenses, or the lower prices if you will. So, from that standpoint, I think we're
progressing well, and optimizing again that portfolio. But at the end of the day, the profitability on a book basis is
certainly impacted by the declining price trend that we've seen over the course of the year.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: All right. Thanks a lot, David.

We'll move on to Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
<Q - Robert Arthur Kessler>: Good morning, David. One quick clarification on the U.S. natural gas commentary and
then also on the unconventional liquids. On U.S. natural gas, with your unchanged bullish long-term outlook, any
thoughts on being a continued consolidator in the U.S. E&P space? And then on the unconventional liquids, thanks for
the color on activity there in the different areas. Can you provide some, maybe, IP rates? And if I could sort of shoot for
the moon, well-specific costs on the areas you highlighted?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, sure. Let me hit those two questions. In terms of the first question, I don't have any
specific guidance, but as we have said for a long time, I would continue to say we are always looking for opportunities

that are out there, and you've seen that in some of the acquisitions that we've made over the last year or so. We continue
to look at opportunities. Certainly as the environment changes over time, we're always checking to see what's available
and what might be of value to us. But again, no specifics.
In terms of the individual IP rates, I don't have any specifics to give you. I will say that if you look, for example, up in
the Cardium, where some of the tight oil well rates that you've heard from others, ours are certainly doing well and at
the upper end of that range. We're getting good rates in the Woodford Ardmore. We're looking forward to some of the
other ones. But again, a lot of our drilling has been delineation in nature, and we have yet to bring a lot of those wells
on production. So, I wouldn't want to give specifics other than to just conclude and say, that program is going well, and
we're very optimistic again in particular, the Bakken, the Cardium and the Woodford Ardmore are all looking very
attractive and I look forward to giving you more updates on those areas as this year progresses.
<Q - Robert Arthur Kessler>: Okay. Thanks, David. If I could ask one quick clarification on the Downstream. You
mentioned the benefit of inventory liquidation. Sounds like you blew through a couple of LIFO liquidation layers. Any
quantification of that benefit to earnings more explicitly? And then any kind of strategy around liquidation of
inventories around year-end, ad valorem tax purposes, for example, or is this just kind of an inherent volatility in the
inventory balances?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I'll tell you, you didn't see a real big change. I'll tell you the absolute inventory, the
LIFO effect for this year in the fourth quarter was $200 million, and frankly, that's about what it was last year. So, we
didn't see much of a change in any of our businesses, about $200 million, but again, no big shift in program. That's kind
of typical as we optimize our inventories at year-end.
<Q - Robert Arthur Kessler>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Next we'll hear from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, Jason. How are you?
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: I'm doing well. Thanks. Hope you're doing well also. Just wanted to ask really for an update
on some of the other unconventional activity that weren't mentioned in the discussion. So, I'll hold it to one but it's
going to be multi part if that's okay. First of all, Utica Shale, have you actually spud a well there yet? And are you still
in acreage position around 75,000 acres or have you increased that?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. As I mentioned, we would be spudding a well in the first quarter of this year, and we
do have one going down as we speak. The acreage position there is about 75,000 acres today, and we're looking
forward to working on that.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Great. And then on the Horn River Basin, David, can you talk about what activity levels are
like during this particular drilling campaign and if you have advanced any strategy towards potentially exporting that
gas as LNG?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'll hit the first one. We are. We do have a drilling program planned for this year. I think it
will be about the same as we had last year, and again, it's really related to evaluation and delineation as opposed to
production. So, a similar sized program. And it's going be – I think it will be about two wells, two to three wells, which
is typically what we've been doing. In terms of strategies for eventual monetization, I don't have any specific
information to provide other than, of course, with a resource potentially as large as that, we are exploring all of the
options that are out there, and we'll continue to do so. And as soon as I have an update on that, I'll give it to you.
I might also mention the Neuquén Basin. I think I mentioned it briefly in my prepared remarks. We do have two wells
going down there. They're not completed yet. So, I can't give you any specifics, but we continue to add acreage down

there. And looking forward to an active drilling program, and really trying to test the potential for both liquids and gas.
So that is active.
Another country that we've talked about before is Poland, and I think I mentioned in the last call that we would have
had the two wells down in Poland. Those two wells did complete in the fourth quarter, and while we did find gas, it did
not flow in commercial quantities in either of those two wells. So, we'll be analyzing that and evaluating the various
characteristics of the shale there and working on our go-forward plan. I think that's kind of an update. If there's a
country I missed that you're interested in, I'd be happy to talk about it.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Maybe just as a follow-up, David. What is the condition of the service industry in
Argentina? Are you able to find rigs and pressure pumping equipment? Or are things fairly tight? And then I'll leave at
that.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, in Argentina, we're doing okay. We have – we farmed into a block there, and the
operator there is pretty well established. So at least for the activity that we have ongoing and the wells that we're trying
to drill, it's not impacting our program, but we'll see how that turns out as we go forward and the activity in the area
increases in general.

report was coming out in February, but could you give us any indication if any reserves from Iraq were booked in this

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, I think I'll wait. And we'll, of course, talk about both of those. But both of those will be
included in our press release. And it will be out in mid-February. So, we're only a couple of weeks away.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on Kashagan. Is that still on schedule for this year? And
any update you can give there would be helpful.

different than that.

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes. In fact, that's turned out to be a pretty positive for us. It's been very stable. We haven't
seen any significant increase. And on that front, things are pretty good. I think the folks over there are very pleased
with the progress we're making in the business, in the program. The integration, the availability of technology and other

resources to advance the programs that were underway. And so again, that's been a positive for us.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay. And then a quick one about Japan. The transaction with TonenGenera, was that
brought about by Exxon proactively? Or were you approached by the buyer in the steel, who was interested in making
this happen? Or in other words, just can you tell us a little bit about the background to that deal?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I really can't share any specifics along those lines. I can tell you when you look at the
restructuring and the assets involved and how they're structured and managed today and how they will be after the deal,
this is a positive for all the stakeholders involved. And really better positions that combined business to meet the
market needs of Japan. And I think that's probably the most important part without getting into the specifics about how
it was initiated.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay. Will Exxon have any wholly-owned refineries in Japan after this closes?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, we won't.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay. Understood. Thanks very much.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure thing.

Our next question comes from Philip Weiss with Argus Research.
<Q - Phil H. Weiss>: Morning. I just have one – most of my questions have been answered – but I do have one
follow-up on the U.S. You said that the rig count that's being used for liquids-rich is rising but when I look at
production, natural gas as a percent of your total production has grown and liquids has actually fallen a little bit. So I
wondered if you could just comment on when we might start to see that trend change?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. The fall-off in the liquids is really just the overall decline in the conventional as well
as some divestments. You'll recall we had a divestment in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and that had an impact on us
year-over-year, particularly in the second half. In terms of when we'll see significant production growth out of the
unconventionals, a lot – I mentioned some of the increases in percentages although we haven't given all the specific
production volumes but we'll do that as we progress.
One of the things we've seen is a lot of the drilling is really around delineating the resource and appraising it; finding
where the sweet spots are; determining what the best approach to fracking or otherwise producing those resources; a lot
of time being spent on evaluating well spacing. So, I think the best way to think about this is a lot of activity and a lot
of drilling and a lot of planning as opposed to being in a huge hurry to get a well on production and over to sales. But
clearly, as that's program advances this year and we continue to put in the wells and the infrastructure, we would expect
to see those volumes increase at a fairly hefty rate. And again, we'll talk a little bit more about the overall program and
what to expect at the meeting we have in March.
<Q - Phil H. Weiss>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Société Générale.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yeah, hi, David
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, John.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Couple quick ones, for the Woodford Cana, what's your split, do you know, between gas and
liquids?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: In the Woodford Ardmore?
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. Sorry. Yes.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I don't have a specific split number on that. I think what's more important as opposed
to specific production is the emergence and the discovery really in the Ardmore Basin of the liquids potential. I'll tell
you if you were thinking about rigs in particular in that, we've got eight rigs drilling liquids and two rigs drilling gas, if
that was the real nature of your question. And so, again, early mover in there on our part over the last year or so and
really looking forward to ramping up the activity there.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. With many of your U.S. liquids plays, you spoke of being in the delineation mode. Does
that mean you're having to deal with HBP acreage capture issues? Or are you just trying to get a sense of field sizes?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, it's not really the HBP capture. It's really figuring out what we got and what the best
way is to go about developing and producing it so that we optimize the total over a long period of time as opposed to,
again, being in a big hurry. It's – if you think about it, it's what's the field size in the acreage position that we have,
where are the sweet spots, and then where do you go first, and then how do you develop that to optimally produce? And
we do – I will say we probably spend a little more time than others working on the front-end design and evaluation
because again we're focused on what the overall long-term value is we can get out of that. And that's kind of the upfront
investment in time and resources that we've seen here over the last year.
I guess the last thing I'll mention is even as we're doing some of these delineation and appraisal wells, even that, we
find some fairly significant efficiency gains as we go from one area to the other and then capturing those allow us, once
we get to really producing the resource, we're not starting out from scratch. We've already got some experience. So,
again, more to that as the year progresses.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. In terms of going from a delineation mode to development mode, how long do you
think that will take before you get your comfort level to reach that sort of level or degree of planning?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Well, I think it depends on the various areas and the resources. Some we've had efforts
underway for a while now. And some we're just starting really getting things underway. And it will vary. But again, I
think what you'll find as the year progresses, I'll give you updates as we progress and really get to kind of the
production level, because it will be different amongst the various fields.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Thank you.

Next we'll hear from Katherine Minyard with JPMorgan.
<Q - Katherine Lucas Minyard>: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just a couple of quick ones,
what's the – as we kind of look at ExxonMobil's portfolio in North American natural gas, what's the usage been over
either 2011 or the fourth quarter? Just in terms of consumption at the refinery and even the oil sands level?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Kate, I don't have those specific numbers. I can tell you directionally in the U.S. one of the
benefits we got out of the merger with XTO was an ability to optimize gas feed into all of our refineries along the Gulf
Coast and optimizing feed into there versus sales to third parties. So, I don't have those specific rates, but I can tell you
we've been able to optimize that to the benefit of our refining economics.
Additionally, we've been able to also, through integration, optimize our feeds both natural gas for utilities as well as
ethane into the Chemical business. So that's ongoing. And probably if you talk about integration, that's probably more
important than anything that we have going on up in the oil sands space. So, a clear benefit and one we're taking
advantage of.

<Q - Katherine Lucas Minyard>: Great. And then just switching gears to the cash position. When we think about
ExxonMobil's potential uses of cash over the next say year or so, should we be considering potential underfunded
pension liabilities as a use of cash? I can appreciate that maybe the year-end 2011 data isn't completely finalized, but is
that something that might be on the table as it's been in years past?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Again, I think they're still sorting through all of that. And I think we'll publish that number
when the K comes out here in a little while, but I'm not aware of anything significant on the table relative to what we've
seen historically.
<Q - Katherine Lucas Minyard>: Okay. All right, great. Thank you so much.

Next we'll hear from Mark Gilman with Benchmark Company.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: David, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Mark. I'm going give you the last question this morning.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Oh boy. I guess I'd better make it good, huh.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Just a couple if I could. You mentioned in your prepared remarks asset sales gains in the
Downstream. Could you quantify that on an absolute basis in the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. It was about $200 million.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. It's been indicated in the trades that you are in arrears or I should say Baghdad is in
arrears to the tune of $500-odd million on West Qurna. Can you comment on the validity of that?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Mark, I really can't comment specifically on the items that you mentioned, particularly in
the trade press. What I can tell you is that we have an ongoing relationship with the Ministry on a number of
administrative items, but things are – we're working through that. But I don't have any specific on any one item. We
work on issues from procurement to invoicing to payment to a number of things and those are ongoing.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. I was curious about the Tonen transaction. 22%, kind of an odd number in terms of your
retained interest in Tonen. Can you give me some idea how that number came about? And, well, why it is that you
would want to retain a 22% interest?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I can tell you the 22% is – represents the 80 million shares that we're keeping in the
business. I can tell you again the whole transaction is really around optimizing the commercial structure in Japan, and
when we looked at the various restructuring and consolidations and optimization of the assets in there, that's where we
ended up. And it really represents – we're not – we're still committed to Japan. You'll see a large presence of
ExxonMobil in there. All of our brands will be in there. We'll continue to provide services and technology, but it's
really just I think if you looked at the Japan market and how it's evolving, that restructuring was really kind of a natural
next step in the integration of those assets. And again, we'll position the combined company to better meet the needs of
the market and add value for the stakeholders.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Last one from me. You've got some license renewals coming up in Abu Dhabi, you and
others in the consortium. I think the expiration of those licenses is 2014. In your case in particular, is there any linkage
between the potential renewal of those licenses and the terms under which they get renewed and your Upper Zakum
project?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We are involved in commercial discussions that are ongoing, but, Mark, I think as you can
appreciate, I really couldn't comment on anything that had to do with the negotiations there or any of the specifics with
