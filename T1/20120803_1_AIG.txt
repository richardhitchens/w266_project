Robert Herman Benmosche
Thanks, Liz, and good morning, everybody. If we go back to the first quarter of 2011, seems like a long time ago, but
that was when we restructured. We talked about we are going to focus on as the management team fixing the
foundation of AIG, our basic businesses, and how we run those businesses. In May of 2011, when went out and did our
first re-IPO, if you will, of the company of selling our shares and we talked about aspirational goals that we were going
to achieve as we rebuild that foundation. And, you've seen us perform very well per quarter since then.
And if you look at this quarter, it's no exception. We had an outstanding quarter across the board with all of our
businesses contributing to profits in this quarter. We also saw ML III basically almost finished in terms of sell off of the
assets in ML III. So, we have significantly de-risked the company this year with ML II and ML III. And by the way, we
did buy almost $7 billion of ML III assets, which we feel are very good for this company on the yield basis going
forward, especially in this lower interest rate environment.
And so, when we think about capital management for our company, we think we are actually slightly ahead of our
aspirational goals for 2015 with the some of the stuff that's already happened. To-date, we've given almost $37 billion
back to America for the aid and support they've given to AIG.
So, we are well on our way to living up to our commitment to pay back all of our money given to us by the U.S.
Government and you've seen numbers now that it's going to be a very healthy profit as well.
So, all of our businesses as I said have done well. I'm going to let them – David will talk as well as Peter and Jay. So,
I'll let them do that. But on the non-core assets, let me talk a little bit about ILFC and AIA. We're continuing to work to
take ILFC public; however, the markets have not been very receptive at this point in time, but we're continuing to
manage that business very effectively.
On AIA, we have a very good performing company out there. Mark Tucker has done an outstanding job of that
business. And so, we're looking for the right time and the right price to monetize our ownership of AIA. We're often
asked about regulation. We really don't know when we will be regulated but we do believe we will be regulated by the
Federal Reserve probably. That seems the most likely candidate and we're putting an enormous amount of effort and
cost to make sure that we are Fed-ready as the project is called for that oversight.
So, before I turn it over to David, just a comment about capital management. We are looking at making sure that we
use that capital for the best performance of our shares for our shareholders. So buyback is one of the things we could do
with that capital – another is to buy businesses and you can see in a small way, we did an acquisition of Woodbury
Financial Advisors. It enhances our Advisor Group we have today and builds a stronger and bigger platform for us. So,
we're continuing to invest in businesses that give us growth but that also allows us to use money for share buyback, but
it's not just for share buyback, it's doing what's right for the shareholder.
So, let me turn it back over to David and he'll pick it up from here.
David L. Herzog

I want to start with a discussion of our financial results. As evident from our results for the quarter, it's been another
very busy quarter for AIG as we continue to execute on the capital management and operating fronts. Year-to-date,
we've repurchased $5 billion in shares and as Bob has mentioned, we remain committed to our $25 billion to $30
billion of capital management through 2015. I'll discuss liquidity in a bit more detail in a minute.
Turning to our financials on slide four, you can see that after-tax operating earnings per share were up 56% to $1.06
which is driven in part by a 26% pre-tax insurance operating earnings growth and overall strong non-core asset
performance. Book value per share was $60.58 or $56.07 excluding AOCI. It was up 4% sequentially. Share buyback
contributed $1.03 to this quarter's book value per share growth.
GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.33 for the quarter, which reflects certain items that are excluded from
operating EPS. The primary drivers for that difference in the quarter were $1.3 billion of tax valuation allowance
releases or capital loss carry-forwards, partially offset by an increase in tax reserves of approximately $300 million for
legacy tax issues related to foreign tax credits associated with cross-border financing transactions, and an increase in
legal reserves of approximately $470 million net of tax associated with various legal contingencies. We also had some
discrete items in the quarter that lowered our operating tax rate by three to four points or just under $100 million in
taxes.
Slide five provides a breakdown of segment operating earnings, which reflect strong growth in insurance operations.
And Jay and Peter will speak to that in just a minute. I know the gains in the Direct Investment Book this quarter were
driven primarily by positive fair value adjustments on DIB assets, CVA, and unwind gains. At the end of the second
quarter, the DIB had assets of a little over $37 billion and liabilities of just over $29 billion. I would note that much of
the DIB's assets and liabilities were swapped, eliminating interest rate and FX risks in those books. And the bulk of the
$3.5 billion of net assets in our Global Capital Markets, as reported in our Q, can be ascribed to those assets and
liabilities associated with the DIB.
Slides six and seven highlight our capital structure and liquidity. We remain well capitalized with a debt to total capital
ratio of approximately 19%. During the quarter, the holding company issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes, and
ILFC raised a little over $750 million in secured debt. Liquidity remains strong as we have realized close to our target
of $4 billion to $5 billion in annual dividends from our operating subsidiaries. In the second quarter, the holding
company received $1.3 billion in dividends from the insurance companies, bringing the six month dividends and
payments to roughly $4 billion.
Slide eight summarizes Maiden Lane III at the end of the second quarter. At June 30, ML III liquidation value was $8.2
billion or an 11% sequential increase, reflecting the Fed's successful auction process. There have been 12 Maiden Lane
III auctions, representing a little over $39 billion in par value. And there is a little over $6 billion in par value remaining
to be liquidated. Maiden Lane III cash flows since inception paid down another $16 billion in par value. Going forward,
we would expect continued strong cash flows on our Maiden Lane III related investments. And we participated in the
vast majority of the auctions but were selective in our bidding, and we were successful in roughly a third of the deals.
There was strong demand for these assets, as Bob referenced.
We will receive cash as the proceeds of the completed auctions are paid. Through the end of July, we received proceeds
of $6.1 billion. And based on the auctions that have occurred since the end of the quarter, we would expect another
almost $2 billion in cash in mid-August. The ML III assets were part of the DIB at the end of the second quarter. We
believe the DIB now has more than $5 billion of liquidity, in excess of its needs to meet all of its maturing liabilities,
even in stress scenarios, without having to liquidate DIB assets or rely on additional liquidity from the parent.
Looking ahead to next quarter, given the ML III purchases, a portion of those acquired assets will remain at parent or
within the DIB, and a portion of those will be in our insurance subsidiaries. The assets acquired from ML III will
continue to be accounted for at fair value through earnings.
Slide nine provides a summary of all the cash received on ML II and III along with our purchase activity. Our purchase
decisions consider opportunities to improve operating earnings and returns and our capital management. The ML III
purchases were a good fit for our insurance subsidiaries, and the ML III related assets held in the insurance companies

would be highly rated, NAIC 1 or 2.
So at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Peter to discuss our progress on Chartis. Peter?
Peter D. Hancock
Thanks, David. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to provide a brief update on Chartis's second quarter results,
which are summarized in the earnings presentation and comment on our progress, growing the value of this franchise.
AIG's second quarter Property Casualty results highlight our commitment to improve the quality of our portfolio. We're
seeing positive trends as a result of successful execution of our initiatives, including an improved accident year loss
ratio, growth in products that produce high risk-adjusted returns and advancement of infrastructure improvements that
ultimately make us more efficient and provide better customer service.
Turning to slide 10 of the presentation, Chartis reported operating income of $936 million in the second quarter, a 20%
increase over the prior year, driven by underwriting improvements and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by an
increase in expenses. Catastrophe losses were $328 million in the quarter, largely from storm activity in the United
States, Japan and floods in the UK. While catastrophe losses were higher than expected, we're comfortable with the
result given the general level of cat activity and the extent of our geographic mix of business.
Our combined ratio includes net prior year adverse development of $117 million, which was partially offset by a
favorable change in net reserve discount of $94 million. Favorable development from prior year catastrophe losses
partially offset this adverse development. Our reserves are subject to robust internal and external review.
In the second quarter, several third-party studies using diverse methods, confirmed that our reserves are reasonable. In
addition, we continued our ongoing review of the bulk of complex environmental claims supplementing traditional
actuarial techniques with case-by-case forward-looking engineering and litigation analysis, leading to reserve
strengthening on a small number of individual claims.
The accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 98.3%, driven by improvement in the underlying loss
ratio of 2.9 points compared to the prior year. The effective use of data and analytics has improved underwriting
decision making and allows us to shift our portfolio towards more profitable products and regions.
For example, we are growing Consumer Insurance which represents 40% of total net premiums year-to-date. We are
also increased our investment in Consumer Direct Marketing business, which is currently operational in 50 countries.
We remain focused on international growth in the quarter, with 48% of total premiums generated outside of the U.S.
and Canada and growth economy nations or emerging markets represent 10% of total premiums. In Commercial
Insurance, we are using predictive modeling and analytics to optimize our mix of business and to identify profitable
growth opportunities within this customer base.
In addition, we are taking corrective underwriting action when returns are projected to be less than our cost of capital
over a reasonable timeframe. We continue to see general improvement in pricing, terms and conditions. Most notably,
commercial rates in the U.S. improved 8%.
In Europe, rate improvement was approximately 1% on average, reflecting the macro challenges affecting that region.
While we've not characterized the environment as a hard market, it's certainly improving. Overall, customer retention
and new business remain strong and in line with expectations given our business mix and improved risk selection
initiatives. We balance growth, profitability and risk by understanding customer preferences, including the value they
attach to our distinctive product offerings. Expense increases offset some of the positive trends in the quarter, which
were primarily driven by higher acquisition costs attributable to our business mix shift and higher general operating
expenses tied to strategic investments in people and processes. You should expect to see further loss ratio improvement
and a gradual decline in the expense ratio through the end of 2013.
Operating income including $1.2 billion in net investment income, a slight improvement compared to the prior year.
This is primarily due to redeployment of excess cash and short-term investments away from our concentration on

non-taxable municipal bonds into higher yielding corporate and structured securities. This was partially offset by
decreases in hedge fund returns.
Slide 11 summarizes the top line. Chartis' net premiums were down slightly compared to the prior year's quarter after
adjusting for foreign exchange. The continued restructuring of our loss-sensitive business in the U.S. Casualty reduced
overall premiums by approximately 1%, but it improved capital efficiency. The remainder of the decrease reflected
enhanced risk selection and rate discipline strategies particularly in Casualty lines. This was partially offset by
increases in higher value lines and growth across the Consumer portfolio.
Capital management remains a critical focus for us. As David mentioned, we met our dividend payment commitment to
AIG during the second quarter. Our capital adequacy levels are solid and we maintain strong financial strength ratings
that carry a stable outlook with the four major rating agencies.
Let me conclude by saying that second quarter results were encouraging as they reaffirm progress against our strategic
initiatives. We'll continue to direct capital and resources to optimize risk-adjusted profitability where we see
opportunities. We remain confident that these strategies will help us achieve our aspirational goals as well as make us
the most valued insurance company in the world.
Now, let's turn over to Jay.
Jay Wintrob
Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everybody.
Turning over to slide 12, SunAmerica delivered another solid quarter with $933 million in pre-tax operating income,
strong sales across most product lines, positive net flows and improved base net investment spreads. As a result of our
strong statutory earnings and capital position, SunAmerica distributed over $800 million to AIG this quarter and for the
year, we've distributed $2.4 billion to AIG.
Our sales trends were perhaps one of the best indicators of the value of our diversified business model. While we
remain disciplined in the fixed annuity market in this low interest rate environment, our increased sales of individual
variable annuities and mutual funds drove overall positive net flows. During the second quarter, individual variable
annuity sales were $1.3 billion up 51% year-over-year.
Importantly, sales growth was driven by our new product launched earlier this year, which includes a volatility control
fund and rider fees linked to changes in the VIX index – both of which reduce our risk related to market volatility while
offering customers an attractive benefit. Although we're seeing robust growth in variable annuities, you should expect
us to continue managing risk through product design and redesign and maintaining an effective hedging program.
Individual variable annuities with living benefit guarantees represent 6% of total SunAmerica Financial Group assets
under management. Thus, we have the capacity, the distribution reach, the risk controls and financial discipline to
capitalize on the growing demand in this market while certain competitors are pulling back.
As expected, fixed annuity sales declined this quarter given the low interest rate environment and I'll discuss the overall
impact of low rates in the next couple of slides. Sales of group retirement products were up 2% year over year as
rollover deposits have begun to slow with the low rate environment. Retail life sales continue to outpace overall life
industry sales growth, increasing 3% year-over-year and 14% sequentially due to our continued focus on expanding
distribution.
Mutual fund sales were up significantly, contributing to positive net flows for the sixth consecutive quarter at
SunAmerica, which again highlights the advantages of our diversified product portfolio. As announced earlier this
week, we're further strengthening our extensive distribution capabilities with the acquisition of Woodbury Financial
Services from The Hartford. This transaction represents the first acquisition for SunAmerica Financial Group in recent
years and we expect the transaction to close by the end of 2012. Once the transaction is finalized, Woodbury Financial
will become part of our Advisor Group, one of the nation's largest networks of independent broker dealers.

Woodbury Financial's approximately 1,400 advisors complement very well Advisor Group's network, which includes
more than 4,800 independent financial advisors at SagePoint Financial, Royal Alliance Associates and FSC Securities
Corporation. We are confident that the expansion of our broker dealer network will provide growth opportunities for
SunAmerica, for Advisor Group and for Woodbury Financial.
On slide 13, you can see base yields for our major spread businesses continue to benefit from the cash redeployment in
the second half of last year. On a sequential basis, we saw another slight uptick in base yields due to recent investments
in structured securities. We've been opportunistic with our investments in these securities in order to increase net
investment income and offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment. During the quarter, SunAmerica
Financial Group invested $1.5 billion in structured securities consisting principally of purchases from Maiden Lane III.
Base net investment spreads for Western National, our leading fixed annuity writer and VALIC, our group retirement
business, also benefited from active crediting rate management. Base net investment spreads were up 45 basis points
from a year ago at Western. And at VALIC, they were up 47 basis points. Crediting rates for Western were down 21
basis points from a year ago and at VALIC, they were down 31 basis points.
We will continue to actively manage spreads for both annuities and universal life products. Approximately 56% of
SunAmerica's annuity and UL account values are now at minimum guarantees, up from 51% last quarter and 38% at
the end of the second quarter of 2011. Nearly 70% of total annuity and universal life account values have minimum
guarantee crediting rates of 3% or lower.
On slide 14, we've provided additional disclosure on the impact of sustained current low interest rates. There is no
change to our outlook for the remainder of this year or next year. Looking further out to 2014 and 2015, you can see
that there is additional pressure on earnings, assuming no changes in rates but no meaningful impact to DAC or
statutory capital is expected. Our projections are for a steady decline in base portfolio yields in this scenario and new
money yields of between 4% and 5%. And to give some context, our new money yield in the second quarter was 5.03%
in the aggregate.
So, we continue to manage through the current interest rate environment and expect that we'll have opportunities to
grow profitably through continued focus on product innovation, strong in-force product management and strengthening
and growing our distribution footprint.
And, with that, I'm going to turn it back over to David to wrap this up.
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Jay. And before I turn it over to Liz, just a comment or two on slide 15 for a few highlights of our
Mortgage Guaranty business, United Guaranty. We continue to make good progress in terms of operating earnings,
which this quarter were driven by favorable development and continued decline in new delinquencies. We also
continued to grow our new insurance in-force or new insurance written. And I think most importantly, we've assisted
over 24,000 Americans stay in their homes through modifications and refinancing, and so that continues to be a focus
of the United Guaranty team.
So, with that, Liz, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A.

Of course [Operator Instructions] And we will take the first question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Hi, good morning, thank you for taking the call. So, a question for Peter, could you help
us better understand some of the actual operating levers that you guys are pulling on the initiatives to improve
underwriting discipline, and then separately, the critical initiatives that you are pursuing in claims. We've talked a lot
about the mix lever, which I think it makes a lot of sense given the range of profitability of your businesses. But I think
what's less clear for investors is exactly what you're doing and how you are affecting the lives of desk underwriters and
client adjusters as you guys manage through process changes and change your underwriting policy.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think, starting on the underwriting side, it's the process of really exporting best practices
around the world through integration of the best thinking that has grown up in the historically rather separate cultures
of the domestic broker group and the Lexington in the U.S. versus AIU internationally. And so the global management
structure that we have for underwriting in Commercial was announced when I took the role, but was really rolled out at
the level of the underwriting management structure over the course of last summer.
So we're starting to reap the benefits of those consistent global standards, which allocate risk appetite where we're
getting best rewarded for the risk that we're taking. That's how underwriting authorities are delegated, how technical
pricing models are used, where underwriter judgment is allowed to alter the result of technical underwriting models, so
these are a work in progress. But I think we made a lot – a lot progress in the last 12 months, which is starting to feed
through in the lower loss ratio. The business mix shift is both a macro point, recognizing that long-tail casualty lines are
less attractive in a low interest rate environment than they were in the past. However, as we apply greater and greater
understanding using analytical techniques, predictive modeling and other methods, we're finding attractive areas of
business mix at a more micro level that are also coming to fruition.
On the claims side, it's a long investment, started in 2008 in our Global Claims Initiative that is starting to be rolled out
around the world and giving us some very encouraging improvements in reduced leakage. And so, one very tangible
example of that in commercial auto fleets in the UK, we have seen loss ratios drop by 10% by exporting best practices.
So we are quite encouraged that the return on investment for using systematic claims management techniques all over
the world is going to continue to reap benefit and again this is an area which lends itself to analytics and predictive
modeling, especially in the area of fraud control where we have pockets of excellence, but a lot of the world has not
fully embraced state-of-the-art modern fraud control. So, I think that we see some interesting opportunity to further
improve there.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Great, thank you. And, David, I very much appreciate the expanded disclosures on
Global Capital Markets and the Direct Investment Book. I'm wondering if you can just spend just a little more time
talking about how the capital balances or at least the excess assets in these businesses, we should think about tying
those back to the holding company assets you have indicated that you have. And I guess a question that ultimately most
investors are trying to figure out is if you add up the holding company liquidity with liquidity that may be available in
other buckets, if we look forward say 90 days, and we imagine an AIA transaction, the market is dependent on that.
What are reasonable levels of liquidity that will be available and truly excess to the company would be? Thanks so
much.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Sure, and I'll comment and if my colleague, Brian Schreiber, wants to add, he'll do so. I think
we were pretty clear about our view of the excess liquidity in cash and financial resources that were now available that
were coming out of the Direct Investment Book, which is why we made the disclosure that we did and we're trying to
give people a better sense of the size and magnitude and the financial resources that stand behind the Direct Investment
Book, and our confidence in those future cash flows and the stress testing that we do, in conjunction with our
Enterprise Risk Management people to assess how much is truly excess at this time. And I think that our disclosure
around that is pretty clear. So I think again, we're evaluating from time to time based on market conditions and where
we are. We've not made any decisions, as Bob said, with respect to either ILFC or AIA at this time, so I think it would
premature to comment on that and speculate about what we may or may not do. Brian, anything else on the Direct
Investment Book?

<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Yes, I think generally a simple way of thinking about is, as David mentioned earlier, we are
still standing by our aspirational goals for capital management. And when we did re-IPO, we explained that the sources
of available capital will come from non-core asset dispositions, but also from excess capital generated being generated
in the operating companies as well as maintaining leverage at the holding company. That said, the DIB will run off over
time. It's got substantial NAV and a meaningful amount of pull to intrinsic in its underlying assets. So over time, that
NAV and that additional pull to intrinsic will ultimately be freed up. And again, that's how we get to those aspirational
goals of $25 billion to $30 billion.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: That's great, and just a minor clarification. So the Direct Investment Book, the excess
assets in that are in addition to the $7.3 billion of holding company cash and investments that you guys have disclosed?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: No, we consolidate – again, the DIB liquidity is part of overall parent liquidity. So in that
number, you have the DIB. But keep in mind, the number in the Q is as of 6/30. And since then, we've received the
proceeds from ML III. So if you're doing a pro forma, you'd need to add that to the parental liquidity balance.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes. Josh, just to be clear though, the NAV is different from cash, so I want to make sure
you're clear on that, okay?
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Okay, that actually makes perfect sense. Thank you.

And now we'll move to our next question, and that will come from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yes, thank you, I guess a couple questions. The first is, in the Q, you talk about some pressure in
the Japanese Consumer business. I'm wondering. Can you talk about what's happening there and what you're doing to
address that?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes, I'm going to ask Jeff Hayman to answer that.
<A - Jeffrey L. Hayman>: Hi, Jay. So, I think the Q commented on both Auto and Accident and Health, so, let's
address them in that order. The auto severity issue that was highlighted really only is in relation to the Fuji Fire and
Marine portfolio. Our legacy, if you will, auto portfolio has performed quite well in the quarter. The Fuji Fire and
Marine portfolio is reported to us on a quarter lag, so this is actually first quarter months reported in the second quarter.
It has a much wider geographic spread than our historical businesses. And there was a lot of bad weather in Japan in the
first quarter, a lot of heavy winter weather. And that affected our physical damage and property damage liability
severity. So we look at that as episodic, not chronic.
On the A&H front, we sell basically two chunks of business. We have an individual supplemental medical type of
business and we have a group benefits combination of at-work and 24-hour largely accidental death and
dismemberment business. The AD&D business is basically a large-loss business. So a number of the industries where
we have good penetration from a group benefits perspective had increased activity as a result of the reconstruction after
the Tohoku catastrophe. So we've had to play catch-up in terms of rates. We just implemented an 11% rate increase in
that portfolio on June 1. Renewals are already going out. We've already done some rebalancing, remixing of benefits,
and some other product changes.
There's also a small amount of individual AD&D business that we really don't sell much in the way of new business,
but it's a historical portfolio that the rates are governed by the rating organization in Japan, and they've just
promulgated a 15% rate increase that the industry will have to adopt at some point within the next 12 months. So we're
confident that we can get a handle on those portfolios as well.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: That's really helpful thanks. And then the second question, on the commutation of the
reinsurance treaty, which resulted in a change in the reserve discount, are there other internal reinsurance treaties that
also can be commutated? Is this another source potentially of more reserve discounts to come?

<A - James Bracken>: This is James Bracken. We do have internal reinsurance contracts within the organization to
enable us to deploy capital effectively. The contract that we commuted in the current quarter was one of the few that
actually ceded U.S. workers comp business offshore. And so you shouldn't expect us to see this type of benefit arising
from internal commutations on a go-forward basis. This was part of our overall restructuring of internal reinsurance for
the organization. So we've been working through this for a very long time.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: That's great, thanks a lot.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Just to put that in a broader context of the simplification of our legal entity structures around
the world and the conversion of branches to subsidiaries, especially in Asia, while in Europe, we are converting to a
series of branches in Europe of one central European hub in the UK and a revision of internal reinsurance and capital
maintenance agreements that optimize our capital fungibility around the world.
<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: Let me be more candid. We did a lot of auditing to make sure that the reserve
development and this action were absolutely independent of each other.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: It had been long in the works, in other words.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Got it, and thanks for that.
Operator
And now we'll move to the next question. That will come from Adam Klauber with William Blair.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks, good morning. As of the end of July, how much cash and short-term securities do you
have at the parent company? And could you give us some range on how much of that may be used for near-term
buybacks?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Okay. Again, in the Q, parental liquidity is $7.3 billion. That includes the DIB numbers as
well, but it also includes some restricted cash at some of our subsidiaries, so parental liquidity excluding some of the
restricted cash is $6.5 billion. Then we have received roughly $6.1 billion so far in Maiden Lane III proceeds. We
expect to get another roughly $1.9 billion by mid-August and then another roughly $0.5 billion at some point in the
future. So we do have ample liquidity in the organization and ample capital.
We did also buy a reasonable amount of the Maiden Lane III securities, which did use some of that liquidity. So as
David mentioned, there was deemed to be $5 billion of excess liquidity that could be allocated to other uses at the
parent. Other than that, I don't think we are going to comment any more on capital management.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Okay, and one follow-up on Chartis. You've obviously done a lot of hard work to get
profitability moving in the right direction. In baseball terms, are we in the fifth inning, eighth inning? Where are at as
far as really restructuring the portfolio?
<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: I thought we did pretty good so far. I'm going turn it over to Peter.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: You have.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think that -
<A - David L. Herzog>: Do you know those baseball analogies, Peter?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: After 26 years in New York City, I am slowly getting an understanding of your metaphor.
But I think that the improvement in underwriting methods I see as a perpetual striving for improvement, but with some
low-hanging fruit that's more front-loaded. And I think that some of that's visible to you and some of it's going to be
much more difficult to see. The most visible evidence of that is the reduction in top line over the last four quarters as
we change the way we looked at the loss sensitive business, which is over $1 billion in premium that produced negative

risk-adjusted profitability the way that it was configured. The customers were indifferent to us providing the same
service for a fee. So that's just very visible evidence of a change in mindset, where we're focused on value for our
customers, not so much the appearance of volume in the top line net premium written number.
We do see growth in that value as our focus is around growing profitable lines. And that starts out at macro business
mix shifts, which we talked about, but increasingly micro ones. And the more micro, the more complex and the longer
it will take. But I think that that's just natural competition. So I think that we've turned the corner in the most visible
evidence of change in approach to underwriting. We have a full year underwriting cycle under our belt. And so I think
trends as they emerge from here on out will be more representative of our progress.
<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: Let me give you a simple example. We've been talking about using information
and we talked about we paid in the last 10.5 years 27 million worker comp claims. We never did analytics on it. Peter,
his team, the actuarial team are now working with Johns Hopkins University to study 27 million claims records. What's
an example of things we're now learning – that if you injure your shoulder at the workplace and go to the emergency
room and because it's painful, they put your arm in a sling, it will generally cost us an additional $50,000, because
generally that will cause your shoulder to lock up.
And so we're now thinking about, how do we use that information to go out and tell hospitals how AIG feels you need
to deal with this kind of injury to prevent it from getting worse. That's a huge insight. It allows us to market the
company to the medical community; that we're doing things that will help them heal their patients better. It also helps
us deal with our costs. So that's just one example of many, many, many as we go through this database and begin to use
information we've never used before.
So as you ask what inning it is, I don't know but all I can tell you is we're going to have a good inning in the first and
the second, the third, and the fourth because this data will continually roll out and give us an enormous competitive
advantage over the next four or five years.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Great, thank you very much.
Operator
And the next question will come from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Yes, good morning, everyone. I have some items that were below the line. I'm wondering
if you can walk through why we don't have to fear more litigation expenses in the future and talk a little bit of the
legacy FIN 48 issues?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Sure, Josh, good morning, thanks. It's David. Let's take them one at a time, so the three big
items with the valuation allowance release. We put some disclosure in our Q around, I'll say why now and why that
number. So, we've been very active in developing prudent and feasible tax planning, strategies and transactions. And
we now believe we have met the standard to now project forward the benefits of those. So, that's that. We've made our
best estimate of what that is and so you can put that – that's the number and we feel good about the trajectory and the
path to that.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: On the DTA you're saying.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes, on the DTA, that's the value of this model, from the capital loss carry-forward, that was
the $1.3 billion benefit.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Yes, yes, more the FIN 48 is an offset I guess or something?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes, so the next item was the FIN 48 related to the foreign tax credits associated with some
cross-border financing transactions, and what I would tell you is that a couple things. One, we observed a piece of
litigation not related to AIG, but it was a market event and we researched that, understood that and then evaluated our
entire portfolio of related transactions and made our best estimate of what the potential exposure is on those, and we

made our adjustment accordingly.
I would never tell you that there never will be another, but we made our best estimate based on looking at the entire
portfolio, based on facts and circumstances as we know. So, again, we looked at the whole portfolio. And then, I think
you had a question on...
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: $719 million of litigation expense.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes. And on the litigation, the only thing I would say our disclosure speaks for itself and we
made our best estimate on what the exposure is, and I wouldn't comment any further that that. Again I would point you
to our disclosure and I wouldn't go any further than that.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: There is no color in the disclosure. So, it's just a – is it a general pool or is it for a specific
– is it one specific piece of litigation?
<A - David L. Herzog>: I am not going to comment any further than what our disclosure says, Josh. I appreciate that.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Okay, okay. And then, for Jay, how confident are you that you can fully hedge out the
equity risk on the variable annuity sales that you are doing?
<A - Jay Wintrob>: Well, I think we're very confident in the way we structured our VA hedged program. If you're
referring to the equity risk exclusively -?
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Yes.
<A - Jay Wintrob>: Yes, I think that we're very confident. I think that the market is deep with the contracts we used to
hedge that out. And we've said in the disclosure that we basically are market neutral in terms of the equity markets.
And then, we've commented separately on our approach to interest rate hedging, trying to balance both the economic
interests, the statutory capital interests, and the GAAP reporting interests.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Is there a certain amount of growth that could occur, where you would find it difficult to
continue to hedge out the equity risk?
<A - Jay Wintrob>: I think – I believe from where we at, I think that that's- the answer is no at this point. I think the
market there is quite deep on that. So, we'll continue to assess that and reevaluate it, but I think from where we are now,
essentially the answer is no.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Thank you very much.

And now we'll move to our next question that will come from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks, just going back to the kind of the cash in, cash out for a second. How much of the
$7.1 billion in ML III purchases came from the $6 billion that you got in July? Sounds like $1.5 billion was in
SunAmerica. Just trying to understand is the rest from that or do it come earlier in the year and then just one follow-up?
Thanks.
<A - Jay Wintrob>: Through June, there were roughly $500 million I think of purchases. So, most came subsequent to
that. Again, I don't think we -
<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: I did in fact mention that we did about $400 million of the first tranche of the
[Freddie] Macs, I think.

<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: $600 million.
<A - Jay Wintrob>: Sorry.
<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: It's all right. $600 million.
<A - Jay Wintrob>: That's right but the – and again, some of the purchases were done at Parent, some of the purchases
were done directly into the insurance companies and we haven't disclosed any additional details on that. So, I think
that's where we'll leave it.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: And then just help us understand, how do you think about the decision to deploy into these
assets versus to hold for other uses? Just trying to understand kind of what are the kind of the trade-offs that you think
about, that you thought about in terms of choosing to buying those assets?
<A - William N. Dooley>: Hi, this is a Bill Dooley.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Sure.
<A - William N. Dooley>: This is just part of our normal evaluation on strategic asset allocation and where do we want
to put both the free cash flow of the insurance companies and the reinvestment of the maturities within the insurance
companies and you look at the overall interest rate environment, which everyone seems to be concerned about. And
these assets fit our risk profile very well. It fits our duration on the book very well and we allocate these type of assets
between the Life businesses and the Property Casualty businesses. And with the blend of our, what I would say, core
investing with the additional yield that we make on these asset classes, it gives us I think a very acceptable return on
our overall investment policies.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: So, $1.5 billion was in SunAmerica, a chunk happened and do we know how much
happened in Chartis?
<A - William N. Dooley>: No, we don't know, I don't have that number in front of me right now.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Next question will come from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Good morning. I guess a point of clarification on the disclosure around the DIB assets
and liabilities, just a confirmation. Of the $39 billion of assets that you disclosed, roughly $8 billion of that relates to
Maiden Lane III. Is that correct?
<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: That's correct.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. And I guess just how much capital do you think needs to manage that book or to
support that book?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: We don't look it at a single measure of capital. We look at NAV in an absolute basis. We
look at economic capital, which is, again, available capital versus required capital under various stress scenarios. And
we also look at cash flow sufficiency of our assets to cover our maturing liabilities, and we look at that under stress as
well. So it's not just one approach or methodology that we use. and I think, as David said, based on that analysis, we
have made a decision to reallocate some of the capital within the DIB. So that gives you a sense that we believe there
was excess capital and excess liquidity.
In addition, the portfolio is in wind-down. The assets and liabilities are matched up quite well. And then, again, over
time, we would expect to realize a freeing up of the NAV as well as the additional capital created from the pull to
intrinsic of the assets.

<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. On SunAmerica, you sold about $9 billion of assets to harvest gains. You
released $1.3 billion or so of the capital loss carry-forwards. Can you just expand upon the strategy of harvesting gains
going forward? You did talk a little bit about that in the Q. And I guess what I'm interested in is, how much more
should we be expecting, and how do expect these assets to be redeployed?
<A - David L. Herzog>: This is David. I'll touch on the expectation of the strategy, and then Bill can talk about
redeployment. We evaluated the totality of, again, the prudent and feasible strategies and transactions, including capital
gain harvesting, so that was incorporated into our overall assessment for the quarter. We have, again, various
transactions that have, as a consequence, tax outcomes. And then we've identified certain portfolios where capital gain
harvesting is an appropriate step to take, again, balancing the need for maintaining capital sufficiency, statutory
reserves, cash flow testing, maintaining margin, and operating earnings. So we're again not looking at any one
individual measure, but trying to balance the need for operating earnings with the need to realize the benefits of the
capital loss carry-forward.
I would say that the amount of expected realization is in line with what I had commented earlier, even going back as far
as when we were on the initial offering back in May 2011, so it's consistent with that. We're executing in line with
those expectations. So, Bill, you want to talk about the redeployment?
<A - William N. Dooley>: Sure. I guess my first comment is that in just the normal course of business on managing
these portfolios, we take gains from time to time and we continue to take gains from time to time, as we take different
views on different credits within the overall portfolio, so that was number one. Number two, if you look over the
portfolio over the last 18 months or so, with the redeployment of the cash that built up over that period of time, the
portfolio has undergone a lot of changes to its asset classes and things like that. And at the same time, it allowed us to
take some of these gains that maybe in the past we wouldn't have during this period of time.
The other aspect of the thing too is that we took this opportunity to rebalance the duration of the portfolios. So right
now, particularly in the SunAmerica portfolios, we feel that the assets are reflective of the proper duration against
liabilities. And I think that's also very important given the interest rate environment that we find ourselves in and we
could be looking at in the near term as well.
<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: I just want to remind everybody. We did talk about sec lending.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Right.
<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: And we've gone through a whole approach to our liquidity management here and
what are the most effective ways to do that. And as part of that liquidity management, we've determined that we could
do some securities lending. And that as a consequence of that securities lending, it would create capital gains. And so
that's another form of harvesting capital gains, which is part of that liquidity program. But we probably wouldn't take
that approach if we couldn't cover some of the costs of those capital gains, but that's covered now. So it made sense to
take that approach to how we handle our liquidity. So that's another thing that is allowing us to get there without
actually selling securities and losing the yield.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator
And now we will take a question from Thomas Gallagher, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Good morning. Bob, I guess just a question on your comment that you have a team who is
preparing for Federal regulation – for regulation by the Fed. Can you comment at all about what your initial read on
what you guys are thinking behind the scenes on that? Is there going to be any meaningful change in terms of strategy,
businesses, asset allocation? Is there anything that you've gleaned thus far as you've reviewed what new regulation will
mean?

<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: No, I don't think there's any concern we have about the businesses we have and so
on. We are discussing internally the effects the Volcker Rule could have on us, and so there is a little concern there. We
are thinking about that if we – and we are giving thought to whether we should now close the bank we have because
we're concerned about that aspect of it, and an insurance company invests very differently than a bank would.
But aside from that issue, this is really about making sure we have really good process and good controls, especially in
the risk management arena, very good controls around how we determine we can handle a bump in the night that
happened in 2008, for example, and so that's the CCAR process that we go through. And we're doing it in the same
discipline. Look, a lot of us were frustrated with SOX 404 and so on. It was a lot of form over substance, but the
process itself made sure companies really thought through the controls they need to have to make sure that they issue
numbers that are correct. And so we see this as an enhancement to that process, and so it's really about process,
policies, and making sure we have really good controls over some of the assumptions around our liquidity and so on.
So that's really the major change is just how we do things.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Got it, and you wouldn't see necessarily an asset allocation change within the portfolio. In
particular, when you read some of the NPRs that have been put out by the Fed, and again, a lot of this as it relates to
you guys is probably still somewhat uncertain, but when I look at like RWA charges for things like alternatives, it
seems very high. So I was just curious, from a high level, whether there would be a change for you.
<A - Robert Herman Benmosche>: We have the NAIC. They do a very effective job in the U.S. You have the FSAs
around the world and so on. All of them have their capital charges at the insurance companies who are required to
maintain RBCs and so on. So the insurance companies, in my opinion, are already there. And I think that I don't – we
don't know because we don't know what we don't know. But my sense is that that's not going to be an issue. The real
question becomes the amount of money that we hold at the holding company above all of the regulated entities; and to
the extent that we own these regulated entities, what requirements the Fed may have. For example, at AIG we have as
you know the capital and maintenance agreements, which says that we can contribute money back into the insurance
companies if RBC is full. We've got to make sure that money is actually there and is available if, in fact, there is a crisis
at an insurance company. And so having the Fed regulate that money and making sure that when we have a liquidity
plan we have one, that's reassuring to the insurance regulators that are looking at AIG's ability to live up to its
commitment. So in a way, we see it as a big positive.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just last question, just a question – in the Q, it references on
the DIB that excluding the mark-to-market adjustments, there was a negative spread. I think that's just because ML III
is its own entity on a segment reporting basis. And right now, technically, it's in the DIB. But as we think about selling
off or using potential proceeds from ML III for something else, how should we think about the earnings power of the
DIB assuming there is a draw-down of assets from use of assets from Maiden Lane III?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Yes, I think it's a good question. I think you're right. The spread number does not include
Maiden Lane III. But what it also doesn't include is what are the most significant source of earnings going forward in
the DIB, is the pull to intrinsic of the underlying assets. So to the extent there are assets going out of the DIB, the
remaining assets, as we said, will be sufficient to meet maturities and you'll see the pull to intrinsic coming through
over time. And excess liquidity, to the extent it exists within the DIB, could be used to make further attractive
investments or to retire debt. So as the DIB winds down, you'll see more and more of that kind of activity.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: So in other words, there are a lot of assets within the DIB that have an element of below par
that you would expect to get to par over time?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Maybe not par, but to intrinsic but they are trading at deep discounts to what we believe
intrinsic value.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Understood, thanks.
