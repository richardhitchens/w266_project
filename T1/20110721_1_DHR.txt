H. Lawrence Culp
Matt, thanks. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another record quarter for Danaher. If we look back
here on the first half of 2011, we've gotten off to an excellent start from both a core growth and an operational
perspective.
Core growth in the second quarter was 7.5%. We feel good about where we are today. Our portfolio of premiere brands
has never been stronger. Our businesses are performing well. We are well positioned in our served markets and the
macro drivers propelling our growth remain intact. We continue to be encouraged by the current tone of the businesses,
but given the recent economic headlines and macro data points globally, we've been paying particular attention to our
leading indicators.
We grew at a mid-teens rate in the emerging markets in the quarter, with China growing more than 20%. We've always
taken the long view of the emerging markets, believing that our businesses can't be leaders globally in the markets they
serve without leading in the emerging markets.
The developed markets grew mid-single digits in the quarter, with the U.S. a bit stronger than Europe.
The Danaher business system enables us to capture market share through innovation, new product introductions and
go-to-market initiatives. AB SCIEX, Videojet, Fluke, Kollmorgen, ChemTreat, Hach, Tektronix Communications and
Radiometer are among the businesses where we believe we have taken notable share from competition.
During the quarter we delivered strong operational performance with our core operating margin improving 160 basis
points year-over-year with Test & Measurement, Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Industrial Technologies all
delivering over 100 basis points of improvement, all the while continuing to invest in growth opportunities and
restructuring related activities for future margin expansion.
So with that as a bit of a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported second quarter adjusted
diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the impact of the acquisition of Beckman Coulter,
of $0.69, representing a record second quarter for Danaher and a 28% increase as compared to our adjusted EPS last
year. Revenues for the quarter increased 15.5% to a record $3.7 billion, with core revenues up 7.5%. The impact of
currency translation increased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions more than offset the impact of deconsolidating the
Apex revenues, resulting in a net 3% increase of revenues.

Our year-over-year gross margin for the second quarter increased 250 basis points to 52.4%, largely due to leverage
from greater sales volumes, productivity improvements and the higher gross margins of our newer businesses. Overall,
our operating margin in the second quarter increased 80 basis points year-over-year to 16.9%, with our core operating
margin up 160 basis points.
Included in the operating results was $14 million in equity earnings contributed by Apex. Absent the Apex
contribution, our operating margin was 16.5%. Operating cash flows from continuing operations for the first half were
$1.1 billion, a 26% increase compared to the first half of last year. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the
first half of the year was over $1 billion and our free cash flow from continuing operations to net income ratio was a
healthy 121%. We are now confident free cash flow will exceed $2 billion in 2011, which would be a first for Danaher.
During the quarter we completed three acquisitions, including the previously announced acquisition of Beckman
Coulter. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enabled us to finance the acquisition in a very cost effective way. We
are just three weeks into our acquisition of Beckman Coulter and we are thrilled to be bringing on this iconic franchise
in the Diagnostics & Life Science base. We're excited to get started and the level of enthusiasm by the Beckman team
and their early embrace of DBS has been outstanding. Over time, we'll strengthen Beckman's competitiveness through
enhanced quality, innovation and commercial execution. We will also take full advantage of both the cost reduction
opportunities and the strategic synergies and clinical and research applications that we see at Beckman with our Life
Sciences & Diagnostics businesses.
So turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues increased 24.5% for the quarter, with core
revenues up 9.5%. Test & Measurement's core operating margin for the second quarter increased 120 basis points.
Overall, operating margin increased 110 basis points to 22.4%.
Fluke core revenues grew low double digits in the quarter with solid demand for our industrial products, including our
new 190 Series II hand-held ScopeMeter and our 810 Vibration Tester. We saw growth in all major geographies, led
again by the emerging markets, which grew in excess of 30% during the quarter. We are confident that Fluke is
outperforming the market.
At Tektronix, core revenues were up mid-single digits in the quarter with orders up low double digits. Sales of
oscilloscopes and video test equipment were particularly robust in the emerging markets. Tek continues to invest in
innovation and in the second half of this year we'll introduce a new category of mid-range oscilloscopes to address
evolving industry and engineering challenges. Additionally, the introduction of a new oscilloscope capable of greater
than 30 gigahertz bandwidth across multiple channels will further enhance our product scope performance portfolio and
will help meet electronic designers' needs for more accurate characterization of high-speed serial data beyond currently
available platforms.
Core revenues from our Communications businesses grew to mid-teens rate led by healthy demand for our network
management solutions in North America. We continue to see good momentum from our LTE offerings as evidenced by
several significant new customer wins during the quarter. We launched a series of new products across the businesses
during the quarter including Fluke Networks' OptiView XG network analysis tablet, designed for automated network
and application analysis in the deployment and troubleshooting of new technologies, as well as Arbor Networks'
Pravail Availability Protection System designed to ensure application availability for data centers and in cloud
computing.
Environmental segment revenues increased 5% in the quarter with core revenues declining 0.50%. Despite essentially
flat core growth and continued growth investments, the segment core operating margin was up 20 basis points in the
second quarter. Overall, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 21.7%.
Water Quality core revenues increased at a high single digit rate. At Hach Lange the demand continued to be healthy
for core lab instrumentation, particularly for industrial applications. During the quarter we did see a slowdown in
demand from our municipal customers, though overall, municipal growth was still positive. On a positive note, we
were encouraged by Hach's strong order book that saw orders improving sequentially each month through the quarter.

Trojan core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter driven by robust growth in industrial
applications, particularly in the emerging markets. Those of you who were with us in December will recall Jon Clark's
presentation on the $1 billion ballast water opportunity, which would require cargo ships to monitor and disinfect
ballast water prior to discharge at port. Currently, 28 countries representing 25% of the world's deadweight tonnage
have ratified the agreement and full ratification is widely expected to occur this year. Trojan's land and ship based
testing program is underway and we're starting to see order activity there.
ChemTreat's core revenues grew low double digits in the quarter, their third consecutive quarter of double digit core
growth, with particularly solid demand from industrial customers in boiler applications. During the quarter, we
expanded our Water Quality group with the acquisition of Adcon Telemetry, a leader in low-power wireless telemetry
systems for environmental monitoring and in drinking and wastewater operations.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's second quarter core revenues decreased at a low double digit rate due largely to difficult
year-over-year comparisons resulting from enhanced industry security standards last year. We continue to see strong
demand for dispensers in North America and Europe and continue double-digit growth at Veeder-Root.
Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, revenues for the quarter increased 30.5% with core revenues up 8%. Our core
operating margin was up 390 basis points in the second quarter. Overall, our operating margin decreased 110 basis
points from the prior year to 4.9%, primarily due to acquisition-related transaction costs, [ph] changing control charges
(14:22) and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue associated with the Beckman Coulter acquisition.
Radiometer's core revenues grew at a high single digit rate in the quarter, driven by continued success of our ABL90
and ABL80 blood gas analyzers and consumables across all major geographies, with particular strength in Europe,
China and Japan. The rollout at AQT is progressing well, with over 25 units placed in emerging markets alone during
the quarter.
Leica Biosystems' core revenues increased at a mid single digit rate in the quarter, driven primarily by healthy demand
for our core histology systems in China, Japan and North America. During the quarter, we equipped the University of
Southern California's new Outreach lab with a complete histology system, including BOND-III advanced stainers, core
histology instruments, reagents for both advanced and core staining and our first CEREBRO sample tracking system to
help their lab identify and track patient samples through the histology workflow. With this placement, USC will now
serve as a key reference site for CEREBRO here in the U.S.
Leica Microsystems' core revenues grew at a mid single digit rate in the quarter, driven by strong sales for confocal and
surgical microscopes in China and Latin America.
Core revenues at AB SCIEX grew at a mid teens rate in the quarter. Demand was broad based with research, applied
and pharma markets all growing in excess of 10%. We continue to be very pleased with the tremendous success of the
TripleTOF 5600, which had exceeded expectations and more importantly, is making a significant impact in the market
with customers. At the ASMS show in May, we had over 20 scientists, including many key opinion leaders, present the
results at AB SCIEX's user meeting, which speaks to the impact that technology is having on the scientific community.
At ASMS as well, we launched SelexION, an innovative differential ion mobility spectrometry technology for
quantitative and qualitative analysis for use on the QTRAP 5500 and the TripleTOF 5600 to improve data quality and
accelerate sample preparation.
As we mentioned at the outset, during the quarter we closed on the previously announced acquisition of Beckman
Coulter. While it's still early, we have been pleased with the customer and associate feedback we have received thus
far. Our initial operating reviews have been positive and we look forward to sharing further successes with you in the
coming months.
Turning to Dental, segment revenues increased 18% in the second quarter, with core revenues up 6.5%. Our core
operating margin was up 25 basis points in the second quarter. Overall, our operating margin was up 10 basis points
from the prior period to 10.9%. KaVo core revenues increased at a mid single digit rate in the quarter. Our imaging
products have grown low double digit thus far this year due in part to the continued success of the DEXIS Platinum

intra-oral sensor and our recently introduced OP300 hybrid digital imaging system. Demand in North America was
robust in the quarter and we continue to build momentum in the emerging markets where KaVo and Sybron are
collaborating more intently and investing together in go-to-market initiatives.
Sybron core revenues grew at a high single digit rate in the quarter led by orthodontic solutions and infection
prevention products in North America and the emerging markets generally, as well as the absence of inventory
destocking that occurred in the prior year period. Customer response to Kerr's recently launched composite filling
system, SonicFill, continues to be very positive, helping drive high teens core growth in general dentistry consumables.
So moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues increased 32% for the quarter with core revenues up 14.5%. Our core
operating margin increased 190 basis points in the second quarter. Overall, our operating margin was 21.7%, a 100
basis point increase compared to the same period last year.
Product Identification core revenues were up low double digits in the quarter, with broad based growth across all major
geographies and product categories. Demand from electronics customers for our parts marking systems was again
strong this quarter and we believe we continue to capture market share.
During the quarter, we also launched 1610 DH, a dual head version of our 1000 series CIJ printer. This high-speed,
continuous ink jet printer is designed for applications requiring printing in two locations on the same product or on
multiple lanes of a web application and is ideal for food and beverage, pharmaceutical and building material
applications. While still early, we've been pleased with the customer feedback with this new product.
Our Motion business' core revenues grew at a mid teens rate in the quarter. The momentum we saw late last year and
earlier this year continued as we experienced significant growth in all major geographies and markets. Kollmorgen's
AKM and AKD motors and drives continue to capture share and we are on track to double AKD drive revenues this
year compared to 2010.
So to wrap up, a good start to 2011. We're obviously excited to have Beckman on board and from what we've seen thus
far, DBS is going to have high impact at Beckman and that gives us a lot of confidence not only to tackle the challenges
in the business, but also in our ability to take advantage of both the growth and cost reduction opportunities. Our
businesses continue to perform very much in line with expectations that we laid out in December. With DBS, we have
the potential to drive organic growth and margin expansion. And with our increased exposure to higher growth
emerging markets, we believe we are well positioned to continue to outperform for the remainder of 2011 and beyond.
We are initiating third quarter 2011 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance of $0.66 to
$0.71. We are increasing our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance from the
prior range of $2.65 to $2.75 to a new range of $2.75 to $2.82. The new full year range includes approximately $0.05 of
accretion related to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter.

<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Good morning. So glad to see Beckman Coulter finally in the fold. And I want to actually,
though, lead off with a couple questions on just the overall impact that you're seeing on a macro basis from the China
deceleration and other emerging market concerns overall across the business. I know you mentioned you were up 20%.
But are you seeing any signs of weakness at all?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think you see signs of weakness all the time, Steve, but having been with the China
and Indian teams earlier this week, albeit telephonically, I would characterize the general tone and outlook as quite
buoyant. We clearly are working against some very tough comps. I think we've seen some signs in China, for example,
of a slow start in a couple of businesses, Water being one, on account of the timing around the five year plan, maybe a
bit more so than the tightening. I think some of our businesses are on the outlook for signs of credit tightening where
they deal with smaller customers. But by and large, I think their mood was quite upbeat with respect to the second half.
India is obviously dealing with a couple of different issues. Might say, by and large, we expect a little of the froth to
come off, but still think as we look at the third quarter and certainly the second half, the emerging markets will lead the
way.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. All right. Well, it's always hard to reconcile that with some of the deceleration in the
government's action and interest rates, but okay. That's good to hear. Just on the growth within Environmental, the
negative 0.5%. Obviously that's all it looks from Gilbarco Veeder-Root. Are you expecting that to turn around or what
should we expect going forward there?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, Steve, I think that that's exactly right, just to make sure we're all on the same page.
We certainly saw Gilbarco play out in the first half very much as we would have anticipated in large part because of the
tough comps on the payment schemes here in the first half. That obviously gets easier for us as the year goes on. And
we would expect them to be more of a contributor here as we go forward. As we talked about at your conference not
that long ago, obviously we've also seen a little bit of pressure in the muni world at Hach Lange and to a lesser degree
at Trojan. So we're watching that carefully. But as we look at the third quarter, I think that when we talk about the
guidance for the quarter, I think the Environmental segment won't be leading the way here. We talk about our growth
guidance for the quarter for the second half being in that 6% to 8% range as we've talked. I suspect Environmental will
probably be south of that midpoint. But specifically, I think GVR will begin to improve from here.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And are you expecting additional acquisition related transaction costs from Beckman or are
we finished in the numbers you took this quarter?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Steve, we will have about $0.14 or $0.15 a share in the second half, primarily related to
inventory step up and deferred revenue. So of that $0.15 that we'll call out in the second half, probably 85%, 90% of
that will be non-cash in nature. There will be a little bit of cash cost to take out the Beckman bond here in the third
quarter and we expect to be done with all that by the end of the year.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Great. Thanks. I'll hand it off at this point. Thanks.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thanks, Steve.

Next we'll hear from Deane Dray of Citi Investment Research.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: It sounds like we're getting closer to the time to revenue on this ballast water opportunity
and it does sound like it could be a big deal for an extended period and I've seen much higher estimates for that $1
billion. I know that's the addressable market, but – for Danaher. But if you'd just take us through what you think the
gating factors are. From my understanding it's the U.S. Coast Guard has to ratify it. That's considered to be the more
stringent standards and then from a technology standpoint, sounds like Trojan has to partner with someone. And just

give us a sense of where you are in terms of what product will be assembled and available for – on the ships.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Sure. Well, I think the – from a regulatory point of view, this is a global initiative, it's not a
U.S. effort, as I know you know, Deane. And I think that our read of the political landscape, and I don't think we
necessarily have unique perspective here, is that the global agreement will come into force here this year as the folks
that aren't yet onboard are indeed signed up.
I think that will really trigger this market in earnest. In anticipation of that, as you've indicated, we have been investing
heavily at Trojan to really take their disinfection technologies, which they deploy in a whole host of, if you will, land
based applications, primarily at waste and drinking water treatment facilities, but also in industrial and commercial
applications, to these cargo ships, to basically help them disinfect the water used as ballast before it's dumped at port.
That I think is a product capability that we have. We can by and large do that ourselves, but obviously we don't really
have shipboard capability. So we're partnering there, Deane, really from a sales and service perspective to make sure
that the technology and the packaging that we have is well deployed and obviously a very new vertical for us.
So as I indicated in the prepared remarks, we're in the process of a rigorous test protocol for this disinfection
equipment. That occurs both on land and in situ, onboard ships. The order book is beginning to percolate here. Really
don't think this is a needle mover for us with respect to revenue in 2011. But I suspect by the next time [ph] you see
Mars, say, at year end (28:23), we'll be talking about 2012 revenue and we're going to stick to that $1 billion [ph] ban
(28:28), that's a big number and it's still very early in this regard. But again, obviously flagging it here, we're very
optimistic about this being a meaningful growth driver for Trojan and for the Environmental segment going forward.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. And just as a follow up and also still on the Water sector, you called out some
softness on the municipal side and I know this was something that got discussed last quarter, we're not surprised to see
it. But what is the nature of the softness? I would trust it's not on the consumable side. Is it more new project related,
delays and push outs?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, I think that's a fair read, particularly in the developed markets. I think that China has
obviously been a big growth driver for us. I think the team's prediction that the new five-year plan would cause projects
to be a little unclear with respect to timing in 2011 has played out. But I think China gets better for us as we move
forward, all things being equal. And who knows what's going to happen with respect to some of these municipalities
given some of the political headlines of late. But still good growth. It's all relative here. A little bit of the top has come
off at Hach Lange in the wake of these pressures, but they're still performing very well and we think they will in second
half of this year.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. Thank you.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you, Deane.

Next we'll hear from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Hey, Steve. Good morning.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Could you just maybe talk about trends at Tektronix? The revenue there was a bit light relative to
what I was expecting. Can you maybe talk about what was going on in the order flow for the quarter?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Sure, Steve. The – I think what we saw at Tek was a strong finish following a light start to
the quarter. I think we were pleased to see, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, orders north of shipments at a
double digit rate, very encouraged by that. I think as we saw that build through the quarter and even here early in July,
Tek would appear to be in good shape. Obviously, some of the technology end markets that we serve are showing some
signs of softness, so we're watching that carefully. But I think given the book to bill dynamic there, given the sequential

progress through the quarter and, frankly, the new product introductions that we commented on that are coming to
market here in the second half, we feel very good about where Tek is right now.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And, Steve, I would add, that dynamic of orders being better than shipments was also true at
Fluke and at Tek Communications as well.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Right.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: We had a very good order book across Test & Measurement in the second quarter.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: So what was the book to bill at T&M?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: It was – order – the shipment growth in Test & Measurement was 10%, while order growth
was mid teens. [indiscernible] [ph] it would be 104, 105 (31:46), or something, I guess.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. Hey, maybe just a high level question. Are you guys at all thinking about contingencies? I
mean I know Danaher always has some sort of hedge and restructuring in there, but I mean have your antenna picked
up anything in the last couple of months that kind of changes the behavior telling your managers to maybe put a little
bit more of a contingency in place? How are you looking at that?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think it's a balance right now, Steve, because again, we had a very strong core
growth quarter in the second. I think our outlook for the second half is still quite positive. So we don't want to head for
the bunkers prematurely. That said, I think we're always in a mode this time of year to make sure that we're taking
sober look at second half, not only with respect to this year, but also making sure that where the structural opportunities
are, that those are being identified so we can continue our quiet restructuring and we would anticipate doing that here in
the second half. I think you've heard us for a while now say that we're not seeing dramatic impact from the headlines in
the businesses. That's good. But we're taking nothing for granted right now. So we're watching things carefully and the
businesses know to not only watch those leading indicators, but also to be ready in the event that a more dramatic storm
comes ashore here.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: And then one more question. Are you guys ready to do a – do you think you have the capacity to do
another, I don't know, $5 billion plus deal if something kind of comes along in the next couple of months?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Another $5 billion deal in the next couple of months?
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Yes.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I think we're on record as saying our second half deal envelope is probably in the $300
million range. So that would suggest wrecking the balance sheet beyond recognition, Steve. I don't think we'll be going
there any time.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. So the low end of that $5 billion range?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yeah. I think our appetite for doing a very large deal and having to issue a substantial portion
of that deal and – with our equity, it's a very, very tough putt.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. Especially with a broken ankle. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Jon D. Wood>: Hey. So, Larry, can you just comment on Beckman, the core outlook there following what you
guys have seen from that business in the second quarter? Is a flat assumption for the year or the back half of the year
for that matter still relevant? And then going to the accretion side for Dan, is that deal going to be accretive in the third
quarter?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Jon, I would say that we were pleased with the second quarter performance at Beckman.
You kind of look at the last two quarters there. They've been up low singles, up call it 2%. Obviously not where we
want to be, but I think very much where we thought they would be. And that's I think – you saw the second quarter, we
saw the second quarter in line pretty much with the last couple of quarters in that regard. So I think we're comfortable
with the state of affairs there. You know that we've tried to keep expectations around revenue very modest here given
that there are some other issues we need to work through.
But I think as we look at the second half of '11, as we look at 2012 right now, we're right where we've been assuming a
flattish revenue outlook ahead of the real impact that we're going to have on the top line by improving quality, getting
past some of the regulatory challenges, making sure that we are aggressive from a competitive perspective in terms of
how we get out and take care of our customers, let alone what we want to do from a new product perspective over time.
So no real change, but we much prefer being here today on the other side of closing because we're able just to operate
differently and build the momentum we had albeit the planning momentum over the last four or five months.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Jon, in terms of accretion in the back half, our expectation is that all that nickel will come in
the fourth quarter. We anticipate a pretty substantial quiet restructure and we don't plan to call it out in the third quarter.
We will have additional restructuring and realignment costs in the fourth quarter as well, as well as into 2012. That's all
factored in there. But we have a lot of action we're going after as we speak. There will be a big impact of that in Q3.
We think we can absorb that and have it be neutral to EPS, be the right thing for the business to position it, and then
start to be accretive in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Jon D. Wood>: All right. Great. That's very helpful. And then my follow up, on the Life Sci & Diagnostics core
business, obviously SCIEX continues to gain momentum here. Larry, can you just comment on your view of
qualitatively of that mid teens number, how much of that do you think is a market share phenomenon and how much do
you think is just the mass spec market, if you will?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Jon, I think it's a tough line to draw here on the back of obviously a couple of quarters of
very good growth. I think we are encouraged by our performance with the 5600 from a new product perspective. I think
there are a number of geographies, particularly in North America, where we're very pleased with the improved
commercial execution of the organization. But clearly, as you know as well as anyone, the market has been upbeat.
Pharma has been, I think, better in the first half of this year than anyone might have anticipated. But I think that this
business is doing well. We'll see where some of the other folks come in here, but I think in the first half of this year, we
probably took a little bit of share in certain corners. I was up in Boston with the team yesterday and I think they are
feeling very good about the response at ASMS around some of the add-ons to the 5600, feeling very good about some
prospects for the second half, let alone the product – the new product development pipeline. So all in all, it's still only
18 months in, right, with SCIEX, but we really like where we are with this business.
<Q - Jon D. Wood>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you, Jon.

<Q - John G. Inch>: Morning, guys. So just so I understand the guide, you beat by $0.04 your midpoint this quarter,
you're raising by – effectively the year by all of the Beckman contribution. Is there no sort of spillover from whatever
beat in this second quarter to the rest of the year based on your positive commentary? Kind of looks like you've got the
third quarter flat, right? So what sort of – why isn't there a little bit more optimism from the second quarter reading
through to the rest of the year?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: John, I think the headlines given what they are obviously have us tempering our thinking
here. But I think all in all, as we look at the top line and the [ph] BCM (39:36) here for the second half, let alone the
nickel from Beckman, I think we feel very good about that guidance. Certainly, as we look at some of the things that
we want to make sure we work through beyond the obvious, whether it's the muni headwinds that we talked about a
moment ago, obviously Japan from a supply chain perspective was something we said we'd like to see through, though
I think the signs there are all positive, and some other items there. But I think all in all, we feel very comfortable about
where we are in the second half.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And, John, as you know, we like to have some latitude in the second half to pull forward
some cost actions we would typically budget for – we're in the process of budgeting for 2012. I think if the top line
continues, you may see us take some actions here that otherwise would occur – cost actions that would have otherwise
occurred in 2012.
<Q - John G. Inch>: No, that makes sense. I'm just trying to make sure there isn't some implied message of obvious
slowing in some aspect of your business, which sounds like that's not what you're suggesting at all.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: No. No.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Again, I think we're talking about 6% to 8% core for the second half and that should be
from what we see today, balanced between the third and the fourth.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Larry, what do you think the risks are that Beckman next year possibly puts up organic growth
that's negative? Is that – like is the over/under kind of equally weighted if you're looking at sort of a flattish outlook or
do you think the balance [indiscernible] (41:12) sort of tips to more positive versus negative?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I think you've got a number of swing factors there, John. But I'd take a balanced view there
given where we are. Which is why I think [indiscernible] (41:28) -
<Q - John G. Inch>: [indiscernible] (41:28)?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I would say we take balanced view as to the over/under on that flattish outlook, which -
<Q - John G. Inch>: So in other words, if it – okay. So in other words, if it's negative, it's not going to be negative by
much is the point you're making?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: That would be our current view, yes.
<Q - John G. Inch>: What's your outlook, Larry, still for the cost side as you've kind of gotten into Beckman and how
much of the $0.05 – is there any sort of the cost synergy baked into the $0.05 this year or does just more of that kick in
next year?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, the cost synergy effort really works against us this year, as Dan highlighted, because
we're going to be putting some of that investment into the business ahead of pulling out that $250 million of cost that
we've talked about. I think, John, we are very confident, given the planning that has been underway for many months
now, that we can safely reduce their cost structure by that amount and do that – and when I say safely, what I'm
referring to and have that come out without impairing the business' ability to grow, to improve quality, to invest in
innovation and the like. So I'm highly confident that as we move forward, we're going to find other opportunities. I
think for today we're going to stay with that $250 million cost out number.

<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah, no, that makes sense. And then just lastly, can I ask you about Industrial? Obviously, you
sort of saw how the quarter progressed from a macro perspective, right, looks like there had been a bit of pre-buying in
March systematically. I'm not talking about Danaher, I'm talking about overall economy. And then May was obviously
a little softer and June seems to have been a bit better. What happened within your Industrial businesses? Not maybe
specifically defined to Industrial Tech, but just as you look at sort of your Industrial production-related types of
businesses. What happened in the quarter and what's your outlook? I mean the 14.5% is obviously very strong. So it
suggests that there wasn't much of a trend, but maybe what was going on under the surface?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah. No, I think it was strong and certainly as we look at the third quarter, I'd say that
Industrial Tech, the segment is probably going to be on the high end of that 6% to 8% growth range. They'll certainly
be above the midpoint. I think if – your question, I think properly framed, if we just look at the industrial landscape, not
limited to our Industrial Tech businesses, I think what we saw, whether it was at Thomson where we fell through
distribution, be it the Fluke industrial business, the POS was, by and large, pretty good. And I think distribution, by and
large, was fairly upbeat and I think as the quarter wore on, things were stable, things were solid. Where we did see, I
think, a little bit of softness, John, was more on the OEM side of the business. And that's another one of these second
half areas that we're going to have to watch. Certainly at Kollmorgen, we saw that and that was primarily in our
technology end market, so no surprise there. But obviously something we want to watch given the supply change and
the build rate risk factors that we would have in our limited OEM facing businesses.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Right, but did that sort of – was that trend throughout the quarter or did it kind of see a blip in
May and get some sort of a bounce back in June? I mean, it sounds trite, but it is sort of – people are very concerned
about kind of monthly progression here, that's all.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, no. And nobody more than me and Dan here. So we're – we understand the question.
I would say that it was a bit – it was kind of – it was bumpy as we went through May and June. So it's really hard to
discern an exact trend and we certainly didn't see a dramatic fall off in our leading indicators, but we did see a softening
order book, maybe a little softer than we would have anticipated. So again, that's why we want to make sure we're on
our toes here come the second half.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Right. Thank you very much.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: You bet, John. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Morning, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, so, Larry, on the FDA issues, just kind of troponin, sodium and glucose, things
like that, how are you feeling about them in terms of an update and what you're thinking for the second half?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think that from a regulatory perspective, Shannon, we feel very good about the
progress the business is making. Obviously, troponin is probably the single assay under question and gets the most
attention. Certainly, plenty of work ahead of us in that regard. So no new news this morning in that regard. But again, I
would just remind maybe the broader group that the regulatory challenge to Beckman Coulter is not strictly one born of
three specific assays where they've had issues historically. It also incorporates a broader quality system effort that has
been, I think, well documented and that's going to be a – that is a significant undertaking. I think we're pleased with the
progress that the company has made. We've had, obviously, a lot of visibility not only on the plans but the progress, so
we're knee deep in that with them now. That's our number one priority here in the short term, obviously it will be in the
long term, as well.

But I'm very encouraged by the trajectory that the Beckman team is on in that regard. But again, a lot of work to do. I
think more broadly the integration planning has gone exceptionally well, Shannon. The transition team is probably on a
full time equivalent basis almost 25 people strong from a Danaher view in terms of our folks spending virtually all of
their time at Beckman. We have made some organizational changes there. We have begun to exit the public company
structure and in turn the public company costs that go with that. We have split the business formally into two halves, a
diagnostics and a life sciences business, to provide appropriate focus around each of those businesses. We've made a
few changes as a result of those two moves, which have included the insertion of a Danaher CFO, as well as one of our
group execs as the – in essence the Chief Transition Officer for the business. Tom Joyce continues to oversee all of
this. Bob Hurley, the Beckman CEO, is a full partner in that effort with Tom and we're feeling very good about the
outlook. Again, lots of long days and weeks ahead to be sure.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Yeah. Good luck with that. Hey, on Dental, what do you think about the margins there
as – I guess as you look into the rest of the year, into '12, and what's happening there from either a mix or cost
standpoint as we look from kind of this 2Q run rate?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Right. Well, they're – they need to be much higher. I mean let's make no mistake about that.
I think what you saw in the second quarter, Shannon, was really a function of a couple of things, certainly we had a –
this plant that we're taking out has impacted margins as we would have anticipated, call that quiet restructuring. We
certainly have stepped up the growth spending there, largely around the second half ramp for the new imaging products
that I referenced, as well as in light of the traction that we have in the emerging markets with the collaboration between
KaVo and Sybron, long overdue, but now well underway. And I think the third issue there, which really, some of the
negative mix we had in certain product categories, that has certainly – it certainly didn't help. The team understands
that they ought to be a 15% plus OP business. They have a road map that they are executing in that regard and we
would anticipate that – nothing less from that business.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And we'd expect a meaningful sequential improvement off those operating margins, Q2 to Q3
here.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: As we saw in the second quarter, right, they were up 100 basis points sequentially from the
first.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, but getting to the 15% --
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: [indiscernible] (50:16).
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Right. Getting to the 15% plus is that going to take a little more time into next year
or...?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: That won't happen this year, Shannon. Sorry if I suggested that.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: No, you didn't, I just concluded it. Just wanted to make sure I was hearing it right.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah. No, the -
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Go ahead.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: No, I think the path, the 15% plus at Dental is a multi year effort, obviously more of the
work resides at KaVo than it does at Sybron, but that progress continues and they need to deliver more of it, obviously,
given where they are versus that target. But we're confident we'll do that.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thanks, Shannon.

[Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Morning. Can we just spend a little more time on understanding kind of how the FDA issues
play out for you? And one element of my question is obviously there is substantial cost involved with kind of making
this right and getting on the right track with the FDA. Is that cost push that's required fully already embedded in kind of
Beckman's cost base? Or is there another kind of step up that needs to happen now as you guys take the reins to really
make sure this gets fixed?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Jeff, I would say that the effort that has been underway is a considerable one here for the
better part of a year. As a result, you're certainly seeing an increased spend in RA/QA type activities across the
company. But I don't think that we see a dramatic step up from here relative to what they need to do. It really is more
just executing on the plan that has been laid out, that has been staffed, that has been funded over a multi-year period to
make sure we are as good as any company with respect to fulfilling our regulatory obligations, not only to regulators,
but obviously, in turn, to our customers.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And I assume there's some significant outside help and expertise involved in doing this
currently?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: That's exactly right, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And, Larry, can you give us a sense then, and perhaps it's embedded in the [ph] $250 million
(53:06), but once this is set right, so to speak, I mean the effort never ends, but once we're kind of past the fire drill,
what kind of costs come back out on kind of the FDA correction?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Jeff, our planning assumption is that cost does not come out. Maybe it does, but our – that
[ph] $250 million (53:31) savings is not – none of that includes the benefit of reducing their quality cost.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right, but -
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Maybe that's conservative, but I think it's a good planning assumption.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right, but in actuality there is some meaningful nut there that likely comes out.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I don't think that's what we're – Jeff, I don't think that is what we're saying. I think what
we're saying is we've assumed a level of spend there that takes a number of different forms that we think is important
and while a lot of the activity may be in what you might think of as remediation mode, that will transition into
maintenance mode as we move forward. So again, I think we see tremendous cost reductions at Beckman, we see
strong margin expansion potential, but first things first, quality and RA/QA top that list. So we're not assuming any
reductions there.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Is there anything that we should be looking at kind of from the outside looking in to gauge
how this is going or should we kind of expect it just kind of comes in your regular quarterly updates of kind of the
acquisition integration and the like?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, well, we're – we would anticipate, Jeff, I think using these calls to give you as much
of an update as we can as we move forward. It'll be hard to report a Danaher quarter from here on out without a
significant amount of time on Beckman. But we'll also obviously be talking about Beckman at different conferences
and the like as part of our normal IR rounds.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great. And just one unrelated follow up, product ID orders, can you give us a little color there
on how that's looking into the back half?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: The – I would – as we think about the back half here again with the 6% to 8% range for
core, I think we would anticipate that Industrial will be above that with product ID playing a significant role, albeit

without the new acquisition Esko being in that calculation. They're off to an outstanding start, by the way, so we would
– we have a strong outlook here in the second half for [indiscernible] (56:01).
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I mean, Jeff, they have a lot of momentum. I mean they did have a very, very strong second
half last year, so from a reported basis, their core numbers probably aren't going to be quite as high as they were in the
first half, but that doesn't really – sequentially there's just still a lot of strength in the business right now.

Mark Douglass – I'm sorry, Mark Douglass of Longbow Research.
<Q - D. Mark Douglass>: Hi, good morning, gentlemen.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - D. Mark Douglass>: What was – currency had a bigger impact on the top line versus expectations and probably
what you were guiding. And what are you expecting for the rest of the year and what was the impact on EPS or net
income in the quarter?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Mark, I don't think it was bigger than our guidance. When we issued earnings in the third
week of April, the euro was $1.45 and it actually averaged a little bit less than that for the balance of the quarter. So it
wasn't a surprise to us given where the euro was when we announced earnings and gave guidance in April. It obviously
was a benefit of about 5%. I think it will be slightly less, a couple points here in the – maybe three to four points in the
back half, assuming the euro stays kind of in the low $1.40s. Clearly there had been some volatility there, but sort of in
that range.
<Q - D. Mark Douglass>: Right. Okay. I guess I was thinking 2% for the euro, but likely a little more than that?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yeah.
<Q - D. Mark Douglass>: Okay. And then just lastly on the Fluke Networks, Tek Communications, [ph] even tech
some (57:40), things in Com, at least for the equipment space service providers, seems to have gotten more negative
more recently. What is your outlook for the com space right now going forward, has it changed materially?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think what we saw in the second quarter was very encouraging. Again, as I think
Dan indicated, across T&M and certainly in the Coms group, positive book to bill. Good strength. Some of the comps
that are out there that you may be referring to aren't necessarily the best comps. We don't have a lot of exposure in
certain verticals, particularly around financial services and with the government – the federal government here in the
U.S. – that some other folks do. Our exposure tends to be more with the carriers, certainly on the mobile side where
we're seeing very strong growth at Tek Coms and [ph] much of Atnet (58:39) is really an enterprise play where we've
seen and with our portfolio very good performance. And that, coupled with a good emerging market exposure, is why I
think those businesses have fared very well relative to some other companies that may be comps, but really aren't
competitors.

And next we'll hear from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Rick C. Eastman>: Larry, can you speak to maybe just a minute or two to you talked a little about Industrial,
maybe orders were a little bit bumpy during the quarter. But if you look at kind of order trends and maybe tone of
business in Europe specifically, across maybe IT, and then also the Test & Measurement business, any discernible slow
down or change in inflection in the tone of business in Europe during the quarter?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Rick. I think the short answer is yes. Certainly as we look at the
geographies, the emerging markets led the developed markets and the U.S. was ahead of Europe, so it was really the
first time we saw that differentiated performance out of Europe. I would say it was, by and large, broad based. And it
certainly didn't necessarily get better as the quarter wore on and the angst and the like from the headlines grew.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Rick, I would add, the business in Europe that probably held up the best in the second quarter
was Test & Measurement. So we did – as Larry alluded to, we did see some weakness in the other Industrial
businesses, a little bit of Med Tech as well in Europe.
<Q - Rick C. Eastman>: Okay. And so if we think geographically and we're thinking about this core 6% to 8%,
obviously emerging above that, U.S. maybe towards the 6% number and then Europe stays positive, but low singles? I
mean if we try to split this geographically?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I think that's about how it played out in the second quarter and it's probably not a bad sort of
rough planning assumption.
<Q - Rick C. Eastman>: Okay. Okay. And then just another just general question. When I look at the T&M piece of
the business and also the Industrial Tech piece of the business, given the very significant core growth rates that we saw
in both businesses, I was a little bit curious. The incremental margin in both businesses was kind of in the 27% range,
maybe a little bit below 30%. Is there a concerted effort there maybe to kick up any quiet restructuring or should that
incremental have been a little bit bigger on that type of core growth?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Rick, there's a little bit of noise in both of those incrementals because of both the Keithley
acquisition and the one-time charges there, and the recent Esko acquisition in Industrial Tech.
<Q - Rick C. Eastman>: Okay.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: If you look across Danaher, obviously you don't have quite this visibility, but if you strip out
acquisitions and also currency, our fall through across the businesses were closer to 40%.
<Q - Rick C. Eastman>: It was. Okay. Okay.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: That was true in Test & Measurement. Now Industrial Tech was lower because of Motion.
We are seeing some significant inflation in areas like magnets and the rare earth issue in China, where some of the
magnets we're buying are literally 10x the price we paid at the beginning of the year. Now they're getting a fair amount
of price, they're still doing well, their margins are consistent with where they were in the first quarter, but we're not
seeing kind of the seasonal improvement we see in – more typically see in margin. And that's really Motion, that's not
the other pieces, and it's not product ID. But that's one area where inflation is hitting us very hard.
<Q - Rick C. Eastman>: Okay. So the core fall through for all of Danaher or those two pieces was closer to 40%?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: All Danaher was closer to 40%. Test & Measurement was right in there. Industrial Tech was
lower because of the dynamic I just talked about with Motion.
<Q - Rick C. Eastman>: Right. Okay. Okay. Very good. Thank you.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you, Rick.

And, ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, our final question for today will come from Jason Feldman of UBS.
<Q - Jason Feldman>: Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Hey, Jason. Good morning.
<Q - Jason Feldman>: So the – at AB SCIEX, the TripleTOF has been very successful and by all accounts you've
gained a fair amount of share. At ASMS there were a couple new product introductions from some of your competitors.
Do you still see runway from a market share perspective or is it time to think about the next generation of products at
some point in the not too distant future?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Jason, I think we see a lot of runway. I mean we have not yet been shipping the 5600 for
four quarters yet. So that, coupled with all the KOL support, we feel good about that. But it's always time to think about
the next generation of products. And again, I was up with the team, we did an R&D review yesterday. This is always
the part of a new acquisition integration that takes longer to affect, but I think we're very encouraged about what you'll
see AB SCIEX roll out over the next several years by themselves. And obviously, over time you're going to see some
of the synergies I referred to at the outset come into play there as well. So we're thrilled about what they've done here in
the first half and just have a very upbeat outlook as we think about that business going forward.
<Q - Jason Feldman>: Okay. And lastly, on Beckman, I think you've been very clear from the very beginning about
how that will be initially dilutive to your overall organic growth rate. And I understand that the immediate concern is
the cost synergies and the integration and to focus on those issues. How long does it take, do you think, before you're
really able to give focus to working on structurally improving their underlying core growth rate, whether it's sales
synergies with other businesses or improved innovation? Is that a 2013 kind of phenomena or some other point?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Jason, our efforts thus far both in planning and here in the last couple of weeks with respect
to execution have been focused again first and foremost on quality and I'd say second on growth. So we're already
spending a lot of time in a whole host of ways trying to help the top line both in the near term and the long term. But I
think what we've tried to suggest is that despite that activity, given the context, a flattish revenue outlook is probably
the sober frame for the rest of this year and through next year. I think our hope and intent is that come 2013 and
beyond, you'll begin to see the impact of Danaher and DBS on Beckman's core growth. I think the nature of the work is
just more straightforward, as Dan highlighted. You'll see that impact with respect to cost out far sooner, but that
pairing, that timing of those activities is, I think, by and large typical and certainly appropriate for this situation.
<Q - Jason Feldman>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Thank you, Jason.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: You bet, Jason.
