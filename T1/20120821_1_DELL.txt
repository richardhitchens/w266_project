from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, which are
discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement in our press release and web deck.
We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Please also note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin,
operating expenses, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP measures are
reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the web deck posted in the Investor Relations section of
Dell.com and in our press release and 8-K filed today. I encourage you to review these documents. Please also note that
unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Rob.
We're executing on our strategy to deliver end-to-end solutions with a flexible design point. This helped drive our
Enterprise Solutions & Services business to $4.9 billion, up 6%, with 14% growth in our Server and Networking
business. ES&S is now over a third of our revenue and over half of our non-GAAP gross margin.
Year to date, we've announced six acquisitions and closed five of them, all of which will help drive a higher mix of
solutions with more predictable revenue and margin streams.
In the second quarter, we closed Wyse, the global leader in cloud client computing; and SonicWALL, a leader in
unified threat management and next-generation firewalls. Both are off to great starts and their pipelines are up more
than 35% sequentially. We're also excited about the pending acquisition of Quest Software, which we expect to close in
the second half of the third quarter.
Growth in our ES&S business, good product execution, and pricing discipline all contributed to solid profitability and
quarter-on-quarter improvements in gross margins. While the Client business deteriorated more than we expected, we
maintained gross margins in a challenging macro and competitive environment in this space. For the quarter, we
delivered revenue of $14.5 billion, down 8%.
I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward.
Our gross margin was 22.6%, up 60 basis points sequentially, including a benefit of $71 million or 50 basis points
primarily related to a vendor settlement. Sequentially, OpEx dollars were basically flat at 14.8% of revenue. We
continue to aggressively manage G&A and discretionary spending. At the same time, we added strategic spend
approaching $100 million sequentially. This consisted of OpEx from the acquired companies and incremental R&D.
Operating income was $1.1 billion or 7.8% of revenue. Cash flow from operations was $637 million. Our cash
conversion cycle of negative 30 days deteriorated by two days sequentially, primarily driven by an increase in DSO of
three days. The key driver of this DSO increase was a shift in mix to more complex ES&S opportunities, where
customer terms are typically longer.
Our second quarter tax rate was 17.5%.
We spent $400 million in the quarter to repurchase 29 million shares of Dell stock, and ended the quarter with $14.6
billion in cash and investments.
Earnings per share of $0.50 declined 7%, up 16% sequentially.
In June, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a dividend policy with an expected quarterly rate of $0.08
per share, or $0.32 a share annually, beginning in the third quarter. We're committed to maintaining our disciplined
capital allocation program that will increase the distribution of capital to shareholders to 20% to 35% of free cash flow.
This program includes our dividend, stock repurchase, and strategic investments.

Now I'd like to turn to our global business units. Large Enterprise revenue was down 3%. This business delivered
ES&S growth of 9%, including 17% growth in Servers and Networking, which was offset by declines in the EUC [End
User Computing] business. Operating income for the business expanded 40 basis points sequentially, driven by higher
gross margins and OpEx reductions.
Our Public business was down 6% as we did not see the typical seasonal ramp in the state and local government
business in the U.S. The softness was driven by continued budgetary challenges. Despite this, we remained disciplined,
driving operating income up 150 basis points sequentially. Looking at the third quarter, the U.S. Federal business is
well positioned for the year end of their fiscal year which occurs September 30, and we expect to see normal
seasonality here.
SMB revenue declined 1%. Similar to Large Enterprise, there was strong ES&S growth of 15%, including 27% growth
in services, which was offset by a contracting EUC business. The stronger mix resulted in gross margin expansion and
a sequential operating income increase of 50 basis points. This business continues to be a great example of our ability
to drive premium growth in strategic areas by providing customers with broad-based solutions that help them
efficiently solve their business challenges.
Across the business segments, we're rapidly expanding our channel network to approximately 113,000 partners, with an
increasing percentage certified in Enterprise Solutions sales.
The Consumer business was a challenge, down 22% with notebook revenue down 26%. Operating income declined 60
basis points sequentially, as the business increased gross margins but the reduction in OpEx did not keep pace with the
decline in revenue. While we held share in key mature markets like the U.S., emerging markets were very competitive,
with growth occurring predominantly in the low value space where we have not participated. I'll address this in some
more detail later.
Our BRIC revenue was down 15%, with Asia-Pacific and Japan down 12%. Within APJ, our ES&S business increased
7%. Despite a challenging demand environment for desktops and notebooks, these are important markets for us, and we
see improved growth potential going forward.
Turning to our lines of business, our Server and Networking business grew 14%. Servers increased 8%, helped by the
success of our 12th generation server line launch. The time to market and competitive differentiation of these servers is
resulting in higher gross margins than our previous generation and ramped very quickly to over 50% of our mix exiting
the quarter. Our Networking business continued to gain momentum, as our easy to manage and high performing
networking solutions are benefiting from the server transition to the 12th generation products.
Dell IP storage was up 6% to $416 million in the quarter. While this is below where we would have liked it, we believe
this is roughly in line with the market. We're confident in our portfolio and focused on accelerating growth and
improving execution.
As you may have seen in a separate press release this afternoon, we announced that Marius Haas has joined Dell to lead
our Enterprise Solutions business. He inherits a business that is growing and in great shape. We want to thank Brad
Anderson for his many contributions to Dell over the past seven years. He spearheaded the development of a
world-class server business, built our Data Center Custom Solutions business, and oversaw the acquisition and
integrations of EqualLogic, Compellent, and Force10, among other contributions. As a result, Dell now has a portfolio
of differentiated intellectual property in servers, storage, and networking. Marius is a 20-year industry veteran who
brings great business, strategic, and operational expertise to Dell, and we're excited to have him on the team.
The Services business continues to deliver solid results. Business grew 3% to $2.1 billion, driven by 7% growth in
Support & Deployment and 35% growth in our Security business. We're offsetting contraction in desktops and
notebooks by selling more in-quarter services and increasing attach rates of our premium offerings.
Gross margins increased sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter, as we continue to improve our cost structure and
focus on higher margin areas of the services landscape. We continue to see very good leading indicators, as our new
signings were $974 million and $1.8 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. The mix of our second quarter new signings is

very encouraging, as approximately two-thirds are focused on infrastructure, cloud, and security, and one-third on apps
and BPO. We continued to increase the breadth of our vertical capabilities. Many of these new signings are in verticals
outside of our traditional areas of strength. Our services backlog increased 5%, with balanced growth in contracted
services and extended warranty.
Our third-party Software & Peripheral revenue was down 9%, with improved sequential gross margins. This business
was impacted by the contraction in desktops and notebooks combined with continued pruning of low-value product
segments consistent with our strategy.
Our Desktop and Mobility business was down 14% as we continued to maximize operating income in a challenging
environment. Our focus continues to be on mid and high value systems, which contracted at an industry level in the
second quarter. Our Latitude and OptiPlex products performed well in the commercial space, but we're seeing pressure
on consumer and entry-level corporate products. There is particular softness and pricing pressure in key emerging
markets like India and China as well as Western Europe. In the quarter, we saw the channel drawing down inventory in
anticipation of the Windows 8 launch. We also continue to see discretionary spend being directed to alternative mobile
devices like tablets and smartphones.
In light of these results and market dynamics, I think it's important to reiterate our client strategy. We're focused on
continuing to drive our cost-out initiatives to maximize operating income versus unit share. We'll continue to deliver a
strong portfolio of systems targeting the mid and high value spaces. We've refreshed our Latitude and XPS portfolios
with products that are thinner and more powerful. We're building strong capabilities in security and systems
management and have an industry-leading position in thin client solutions. And we're positioned to be a leader in
addressing the emerging corporate BYOD trend with our current XPS 13, 14, and 15 notebooks and our upcoming
tablets and converged devices. In addition, you'll see new Windows 8 ultrabooks, all-in-ones, tablets, and converged
devices in the fourth quarter and heading into next year.
Now I'd like to discuss our outlook. In the third quarter, given the macro environment and soft Consumer business, we
expect revenue to be down 2% to 5% sequentially. With the uncertain environment and competitive dynamics, we're
lowering our FY 2013 EPS outlook to at least $1.70 per share. This incorporates a $0.02 to $0.03 dilutive impact from
the pending acquisition of Quest Software. For additional detail on the potential impact of this transaction, please refer
to slide 23 in the web deck.
We expect continued solid growth in Enterprise Solutions, Services, and Software combined with what we think is a
realistic view of the challenging end-user computing environment in the second half.
We expect our full-year tax rate to be between 20% and 22%.
Before we take questions, let me close with a few summary points. We're making progress on our strategy and will
continue to invest in building end-to-end solutions capabilities. This is a long-term strategy, and it will take time. In a
tough environment, we did a solid job managing the business to optimize the P&L, and this will continue to be our
focus.
We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation program. This has allowed us to increase the amount of cash
we're returning to our shareholders in the form of our recently announced dividend and our ongoing stock repurchase
program.
Now let me turn it back to Rob.
Robert L. Williams
Thanks, Brian; just a quick reminder to limit your questions to one with one follow-up. Regina, can we have our first
question?

[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks, good afternoon. Given the light PC revenue this quarter, what are your thoughts on
whether Win 8 and the new ultrabook and tablet form factors can actually get the PC market back to positive growth
territory? If so, when do you think that happens? When are we back in positive growth? And how aggressively can Dell
really participate with those new form factors given the focus on margins over revenue? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Katy, I think we are bullish about the products that we have coming aligned with the
Windows 8 launch. I think, as you know, our mix of business tends to be more on the commercial side, so there might
be a little bit more delay in terms of that having an impact for us as it works its way through the consumer side of the
business. But we would expect that you head into next year seeing a bit of a benefit clearly as that works its way
through the system and we see those products in the marketplace.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. I wonder if you can give us an update on the sales execution issues that you
had last quarter. That didn't seem to come up; and along with that, how your vStart 3-2-1 selling bundling is going.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I would say we are seeing progress here. This is not a single-quarter benefit that you
see from these kinds of changes. It's a broad set of actions that we are still in the process of implementing. You can see
some of the elements of the portfolio in the second quarter actually showing some good results here. Clearly on the
enterprise side, we've seen some of the actions we've taken to improve our execution. So multiple-quarter impact, early
returns are pretty good, and we continue to make progress there.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Brian, I just want to get a sense in terms of how
investors should think about the cash conversion cycle going forward. The Enterprise Solutions transformation does
seem to be taking hold here, and you are showing some progress. So how can it still stay in that negative 30-day
threshold? Should we start to think about maybe going into the negative 20 days instead?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Mark, we've modeled it out, and I would tell you I think it does play out a little bit
slower than you would expect as you transition the overall mix of the company. There are some short-term – as you
look at the DSO within the quarter, there are some elements of specific transactions with specific customers and a terms
mix dynamic that plays out that I think we get back some as we move through the year, and the impact of the mix of the
business actually happens over a longer period of time. So we're still comfortable in the low 30 days as you look at the
remainder of this year. And as we exit the year, we'll give you a bit of an update on that. But I think it's a little bit more
gradual than what we saw this quarter.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay, thank you.

Page 6 of 14
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on some of the
pricing environment that you discussed. I look at other PC vendors that reported like Acer and Lenovo, and we actually
saw their gross margins go up sequentially and their share performance be better than yours. So perhaps you can
discuss which vendors you think are driving pricing, what you think is ultimately driving it, and how you foresee that
going forward. And I have a follow-up, please.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Toni, I think there were clearly pockets where we saw more competitive dynamics. I think
we talked about emerging countries and a bit of a move to lower value products in those markets as a dynamic that
played out. So at the lower end, lower value segments were places where we saw the most aggression. And to be honest
with you, we avoided some of that. I think if you look at the notebook business in total for us that the mix – or the
overall ASP change in the quarter was not that significant. So I don't know that it was a big driver in terms of the
overall P&L, but there were pockets of aggressive competitive behavior, without getting into specific vendor details. So
we're going to continue to watch that as we move forward. And again, where we saw very aggressive pricing behavior,
those are places where we did not necessarily participate, and that drives a lot of the revenue dynamics that you saw in
the quarter.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And then secondly, you talked about managing the P&L in a tough environment, and you
did a good job on the OpEx side. But relative to your expectations at the beginning of the year, your EPS guidance is
dramatically lower. And I guess the question is at what – is there a trigger point for your looking at costs in a much
more aggressive way than what you've done year to date given your current outlook for EPS relative to I think what
you had hoped to do at the beginning of the year?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, look, I think what you saw in the quarter was a pretty good balance of being able to
invest in the key areas of growth. We brought in the acquisitions. We invested incrementally in the enterprise business,
but we were able to manage OpEx in general to about a flat level with some disciplined cost actions on the G&A side
as well as discretionary spending across the portfolio.
I don't think you'll see us – I think that's the approach that we're going to continue to take is continue to support
funding, the important areas of growth in the business, but at the same time, being aggressive on the cost reductions
that we talked about at the analyst meeting. We're in the midst of really launching a broader program across the
business that we think over the course of the next two to three years gets at $2 billion of costs, as we talked about, and
that will have broad implications across OpEx but also COGS.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. I just wanted to try to understand relative to the plan that you put up
at the Analyst Day in June where you talked about you could handle a decline in core Dell of about 5% year over year.
How do we think about what core Dell was this quarter? I mean 14% I think for Client, I'm sure there are some offsets
there. And then again, to Toni's question, flexibility in costs and margin and that, how should we think about this in the
context of the plan you put up in June?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I think, Shannon, you have to look at both sides of it. Clearly on the enterprise side of
the business, we feel pretty good about the progress. And as we look forward and even look at the outlook that we're
providing for the total year in the second half, a pretty consistent view with what we talked about in terms of that
continuing to grow and contributing strong profitability. I think the PC business and maybe when you talk about that
EUC business as we talked about in the analyst meeting, we had the Client business as well as S&P in that part of the
business.
The revenue deterioration we saw in the quarter was clearly above anything we expected. And I think that's something
that as we think about moving forward, you can't expect that that business will have that sort of deterioration over a
long period of time. We think as you look at the second half of the year, it's going to be a challenging environment for

that part of the business, but should stabilize as we come out of that and get Windows 8 in the marketplace. So I think
clearly a little more deterioration there than we expected, faster than we expected, and managed the P&L pretty well
given that dynamic that we saw in the quarter.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great, and then the second question is on linearity. Did things get worse in various
geos or with various verticals, any color you can give there?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, to be honest, I wouldn't call out any linearity in terms of the quarter that was different. I
think as you look at the results overall, we were surprised at where the emerging markets showed up in terms of overall
revenue. But I wouldn't say that that was getting worse or better as we exited the quarter, pretty consistent throughout.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Thanks, Brian. Just to follow up on that, Asia down 12%, BRIC revenue down 15%, you
touched on it a little bit earlier. But if you can go into more detail on how much of the change here is market versus
market share and how much is client versus enterprise? It has been a key growth driver for Dell over the last several
quarters, so I just wanted to get some more color on the regions. Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Sure. Brian, I would say in those markets, in general what we saw there was a challenging
consumer dynamic that drove the overall financials. We did see solid performance from the enterprise side of the
business, and the commercial side of the business was clearly better. So I think that's clearly what drove it. And when
you look at that space in general, we saw demand growth in the market really isolated to the low value segments of the
PC business. And when you look at the mid to higher price or higher value elements in the portfolio or of the market,
they were actually down within the quarter. So that was clearly where we were focused. We didn't participate in the
lower value segments, and that's how you get that result.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay, and then just any additional thoughts on enterprise spend as we head into the
second half? I know you had a solid pipeline coming into the quarter. You had some push-outs from last quarter into
this quarter. So how did that progress as the quarter went on, and are you expecting a normal flush as we head into Q4?
Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yes, this is Michael. The enterprise demand, obviously, in the second quarter was solid. We
think the 12th generation PowerEdge refresh continues to be strong. We're well positioned there. And increasingly,
we're changing the sale to be a complete data center sale, so we feel good about that. We think the addition of Windows
Server 2012 is going to be an additional catalyst in the second half of the year, and feeling good about our portfolio
there.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot, guys, just a question maybe on the PC-centric revenues and the level of
degradation you saw. I think it was down about 14% between mobility and desktops. Could you just talk about how
much of that issue was due to channel drawdown ahead of Windows 8 versus some of the other issues that may be a bit
more secular in nature? And then could you just maybe talk about given Microsoft is launching their own hardware
with Surface, how do you think that plays out from your perspective, especially in the consumer arena? Thank you.

<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, look. I think as we talked about, there clearly were slower growth or negative growth –
more negative growth in the mid to higher value elements of the portfolio, and that's really what I think in our case
drove some of the – drove a 14% decline. And a lot more growth in that business in consumer specifically has been at
the low end, and our choices to participate or not participate clearly affected the revenue in the quarter. But that is the
market dynamic that we see.
There is also, as we said, as you head through the quarter, the second quarter, we began to see the channel begin to
push out and try and draw down inventory levels of Windows 7 based product as they move into the fall, which we
would expect to be one of the key drivers moving into the third quarter for us. So I think that's the overall framework
that we see and don't expect a lot of – there's really not a catalyst that we'd expect some growth in that space in the third
quarter.
As you're thinking about Microsoft entering the space, clearly as we think about it, we've spent time talking to
Microsoft and understanding how they're thinking about it. There clearly are opportunities for us as Windows 8 comes
through in having differentiated products. And I think that at the same time, they have announced the Surface product
that will be in the space. We will have products in there, and I think you'll see a diverse set of offerings that take
advantage of what Windows 8 brings to market. So I don't know, Michael, any comments?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yes, I think there has been some understanding of the number of units that they're likely to put
forward. It's a relatively small percentage, maybe in the 1% to 2% range of total PC units through the middle of next
year. Certainly with our business being more focused on commercial, centered around the Windows 7 transition, which
is still very much underway, feeling very good about the portfolio we have with OptiPlex, Latitude, Precision; the XPS
product line is in good shape, and we're ready for Windows 8.
Operator
The next question will come from the line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. I just want to drive into your revenue decline guidance sequentially. You talked
about normal seasonality in U.S. Federal. It sounds like generally the ES&S business is doing well, and it also includes
some of the Quest revenue. So it looks like the end user Computing segment might be seeing a high single-digit decline
sequentially. And I'm curious how much of that is market mix related of the higher end weakness versus ASP pressure
versus you walking away from business? And when or if would you consider addressing the lower end markets? And I
have a follow-up, if I could.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Maynard, I think it's a combination. Clearly, I would expect that the market in general will
suffer through a bit of this inventory adjustment during the third quarter. I think that's just the reality of a transition like
this that we would expect to see. I also would expect that the dynamics around some of the macro environments of the
emerging countries and more growth being focused on the lower value segments versus mid to high is something that
we would expect to continue over the next couple quarters here. So we're being conscious about that and managing the
business for profitability, and I think that's why we end up in that revenue range.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Okay. And then just given your free cash flow, where your free cash flow was, and then your
commitment to share repurchase and dividends, how should we think about your M&A strategy? Should we expect a
pause here, or maybe more offshore acquisitions? And I'm also curious just given all of your acquisitions whether that
drives a period of digestion before more consumption. Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Look, I wouldn't say there's a change in strategy. We'll continue with the framework around
capital allocation that we've talked about. Obviously, that is the dividend. We continued to buy back in the quarter. We
have done a fair amount of acquisition activity this year, and we're in the process of, obviously, hopefully closing Quest
as we enter the second half of the third quarter here, and that's a relatively large acquisition. So there will be some
digestion and execution around the integration of those specific acquisitions. But our growth plans as we move forward
will continue to be a combination of organic investments and continued inorganic investments.

Your next question will come from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. Digging into your server commentary from earlier in the call a bit more, it
looks like you're gaining share in what appears to be a weakening market. Is there any macro conservatism on servers
in your second half outlook, or are you generally assuming that share gains can counter any further macro deterioration
in that segment?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: I think we're well positioned. We have the number one position in North America. We were
first to market – have been first to market with the x86 transition here in the first part of the year. The product line is
lining up incredibly well versus others. As we do a better job of selling a converged solution, selling storage and
networking along with the servers, our blades are getting stronger. This is the best server line we've ever had, and we
feel very good about what we have planned for follow-on generations. So also workloads are moving to x86, so we're
seeing continued shift in our Services business. We've got a very nice pipeline of application migration business that's
developing around some of the capabilities that we built in Dell Services and other acquisitions like Make and Clerity
that have added to that. So a combination of new workloads, new capabilities, a strong product line, I think we're well
positioned to grow there.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, hopefully I didn't miss this earlier. But can you give us
a quick update on how you're thinking about component prices for the second half? Is it still similar to what you were
thinking before?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Bill, I don't think it has changed much. As I'm sure you know, the demand environment
and some of the weakness in unit volumes I think has driven a little bit more deflation into the entire component cost
environment. We're seeing some of that, but not dramatically different than what we've talked about.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask; my first I guess is on Asia and some of the BRIC and
growth markets. They were disappointing in the quarter, you mentioned, and you said that the outlook for those
markets though would improve. I was just wondering why and why you felt that way. And then I had a quick
follow-up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think we're looking at the macro forces in those markets, and we don't see in the short term
a catalyst that changes that, Ben. I also think this dynamic of moving to lower value, lower price segments and that
being the focus of the markets is a trend that I don't see changing over the next couple quarters here. And as we get into
a better – hopefully a better economic environment heading into next year with a new set of products, a new portfolio,
including some to address those markets specifically, I think we would expect to see better growth.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. And then just on storage, we saw a decline of 13%. Obviously, Dell IP was up,
but the decline accelerated from last quarter. And we must be getting to an end to that EMC related revenue. I was just
wondering when you guys thought the storage line would start to grow.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, look, I think we still have a fair amount to overcome next quarter, and then I think it
normalizes to something very close to the current run rate. I hate to use that as an excuse, and I would tell you the 6%
growth that we saw in the quarter was behind what we expected. That portfolio is in good shape. The businesses are in
good shape. We've seen – overall, I think the pipelines look good. Competitors continue to be generally aggressive in
parts of this business, but we would expect to see more growth there. And heading into the second half, the headwind
from the compares on EMC becomes a much smaller issue, and we really don't want to talk about that anymore as we

Your next question will come from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I just want to clarify on the server growth that you guys saw. Can you help us
split out unit growth versus ASP increases? And in terms of this new server cycle that you guys speak about, can you
give us any sense as to how significantly more gross margin accretive it is than the previous cycle?
Then the question I have for, I guess, Brian just on the OpEx point, just to be clear, you guys spent $100 million more
on R&D, which is incremental R&D spend by you as well as the acquisitions, or was this $100 million that you spent
more? I just want to understand why is Quest not making money. I thought it was historically. Have you guys decided
to change the OpEx structure in the near term? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: On the server question, clearly we've seen higher ASPs or higher-end configurations as
we've launched new products here. And as a result, it has driven expansion in terms of margin rates within the business.
12G has had higher gross margins, and as that has mixed up to a higher percentage of our servers at higher prices, that
has helped the overall profitability in the business.
On the OpEx line, specifically on Quest, Kulbinder, there is a purchase accounting element that drives the short-term
dilution of that business. As you think about a software acquisition, the write-off of the deferred revenue over the first
couple periods of that business ultimately more than offsets the accretion. On a cash flow basis, the business will be
accretive really in the first period that we bring it in. So that's really the dynamic that we'll see in the second half of the
year for Quest.
As you think about the $100 million, what we did, approximately between – about $75 million is related to the
acquisitions and their OpEx spend as you bring them into the portfolio in the quarter, specifically SonicWALL and
Wyse being the two largest. In addition, we've spent about $30 million incrementally in R&D quarter on quarter
sequentially around the Enterprise business. So that provides a little more detail.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, thank you. I was hoping if you could talk a bit more about the PC market away from
what's in front of you during the current quarter. And broadly speaking, is Windows 8 enough to stimulate the market
as you look out in the January and April quarters, or do you need better economic cycles here? And more specifically
for Dell, with Dell having – or with tablets having a bigger role in the market and Dell having a much richer mix of,
say, clients, PC clients versus tablets, and consumers driving more of the change of growth rate, how do you see Dell
positioned against that backdrop? And I do have a quick follow-up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, look, I think as you think about the next two quarters, Keith, there clearly is what we
would see in a typical transition for an operating system. And as our business is more heavily weighted towards the
commercial side of the business, we still continue to feel good about the refresh opportunity that we've seen data that
would suggest only about 50% of that Windows 7 transition is complete. And that's got to continue and will continue as
we play out over the next several quarters here before anybody really thinks about Windows 8 on the commercial side.
Those areas in the corporate or commercial customer base that are looking at tablets, clearly there is a wait-and-see
approach to how you think about that playing out in the commercial enterprise. And as Windows 8 as an alternative

talking a lot about and really waiting for.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: So we would expect that. That could be a catalyst and we'll be part of that, and our products
are really focused on that part of the market.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. And, Brian, could you just speak to server and networking growth net of acquisitions
in the quarter? It was up 14% year over year, and I was just wondering what the M&A impact was.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I guess I don't have that. I would tell you that server growth because really there's not any
M&A impact; it was 8%. And networking was up 94%, so clearly Force10 had an impact on that. We can get that for
you, Keith.

Your next question will come from the line of Jayson Noland with R.W. Baird.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Great, thank you. I wanted to ask about Enterprise Solutions. Marius is well known and
respected, but it's tough to see the guy go that has built that portfolio up over the last few years. And I guess the
question is do you expect any change of direction, and what's the resource commitment level given all these new
technologies, be it software defined networking or Flash out there?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Look, I think we've got a great business, and I think we can make it even greater. And I think
the reason that the gross margins in that business have been expanding is because we have an increasingly
differentiated portfolio of solutions. And our intent is to only drive that more and further, so the kind of areas we're
highlighting are the source of things that we would be focused on.
Just also to add to some of the prior questions, some of the shifts that are going on in the industry are obviously moving
workloads into the data center, and we're benefiting from that as well. So as you see more virtual – insert your adjective
here or noun here in terms of the client, the network, the security, the storage, et cetera – those are all driving the
enterprise growth for us. So we're going to really make what is a great business today an even larger, more successful
business.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Thanks, Michael.

Your next question will come from the line of Brian Marshall with ISI Group.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys. You've had good success integrating deals in the past. Obviously,
EqualLogic was a home run; KACE, both these were up probably anywhere from 5x to 10x in a few years after you
acquired them, but obviously you had to reinvest in the business. I think the case in point recently was Compellent up
100% sequentially the first quarter you guys acquired it, but you invested. So I guess the question is can you help us
think about how we should think of revenue growth in some of the new deals like Quest and SonicWALL, Wyse, et
cetera, and how that balances out with the level of investment you're going to make on the OpEx side? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Brian, almost everything we've done from an acquisition standpoint clearly was a
business case that was built around growth. And as part of those business cases, we clearly have considered the
investment required to accelerate growth and leverage the benefit of our sales capacity and customer relationships
across the portfolio. So I think you'll continue to see more of that. And we will make the necessary investments as part

of the deal structure, as part of the deal models to drive that growth as part of the strategy.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: One of the other things we're finding is that many of these software acquisitions actually pull a
lot of infrastructure. So for example, if you think about, we some time ago acquired a company called AppAssure,
which is already growing very fast in the backup, recovery, replication, high availability space. And it turns out that a
lot of customers are deploying unique server and storage environments for AppAssure. And so you're going to see us
leverage our infrastructure strength with our emerging software capabilities as we complete the Quest acquisition to
drive even further growth there.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Michael, is there a rule of thumb where you'd think of a ratio like $1 of software maybe pulls
forward $3 or $5 of hardware in that instance? Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: That sounds good, but I don't have a particular rule that I'm ready to give you today about that.
I think your mileage can vary dramatically depending on the type of solution. But certainly, we have a broad set of
capabilities across services, security, software, enterprise, all manner of client devices, and so we're able to bring a
much fuller suite of solutions and capture a much larger share of the opportunity.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Understood, thanks.
Operator
The next question will come from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Thanks. I wanted to ask about the demand trends you're seeing in the corporate client
business. It looked awfully weak to me, yet you didn't really call it out as an area of weakness. For example, back of the
envelope, SMB clients looked like they were down mid-teens, public down double digit. Why are you seeing such soft
demand in corporate client given your comments around Win 7? Just help us understand that.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I would say, Chris, that as you think about that, there has been a bit of a pause, I think, as
you think about corporate budgets and IT spending because discretionary spending has been to some extent put on a
back burner. And some of these – clearly, these refresh activities have to continue, but they're just seeing a pause given
the current environment and all the uncertainty in the environment. That's just what we're seeing.
<A - Robert L. Williams>: I would add to that, Chris. When you think about the fact that China is down in total for
the country for the first time as far back as I can remember and the declines in APJ in general and Western Europe, that
happened in the commercial accounts as well. And that's a tough one to overcome when you've got a big impact in a
region like that. Those are the types of things Brian talked about where you think about those are markets that are likely
to snap back once we work through what is a cautious environment. I think a lot of commercial customers are looking
at their discretionary spend right now and saying I'm going to put some additional dollars to work in some of these
enterprise solutions. But if I've got a decision to make, I might pull back a little bit on some of these client transitions
and wait to see how things play out at a macro level. So I think you're seeing a little of that.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: And to follow up, I wanted to follow up on the storage question with the Dell-owned IP
business. I looks like your server attach, thinking about Dell-owned IP attached to servers, it looks like it's actually
declining. Yet, Michael, in your comments you talked about increasingly winning these whole data center sales. So can
you help us understand? Is there a timing issue between the server and storage spend as they're upgrading server versus
storage, or are you seeing some incremental competition translate into a decreasing win rate in that storage business?
Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: I think we can definitely do more there. What I'd also tell you is that the line that separates
what the server and what the storage is not as clear as it might have been a few years ago. If you look at our 12th
generation servers, you'll notice that they have enormous disk capacities, and so you're seeing large amounts of storage
show up inside the server itself. But 12G is certainly strong. Storage was not as strong as we'd like, and there's
definitely room to grow that faster.

Operator
Your final question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yes, thanks, guys, just under the bell; so one question and one quick follow-up. When we
look at your guidance and you look at the various factors impacting the gross margin mix of the business, you talked
about potentially a more deflationary pricing environment component-wise. Can you help us understand what you're
assuming on a gross margin perspective, particularly around the product gross margin over the next two quarters as it
relates to those two items? Or put another way, are you assuming a consistent solutions and PC implied gross margin
trend?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Aaron, obviously, we don't provide specific outlooks for gross margin or OpEx in
detail. But what I would – so I'll give you a sense for the drivers and how we're thinking about them and maybe talk
about the second quarter and then maybe how it moves forward. Clearly, we got the benefit in the quarter of improved
mix. We saw the higher margin elements in the business grow faster. The Services business has expanded margins, as
we said, six quarters in a row, and that obviously helps. And then the lower margin, the consumer elements of the
portfolio, which would have the lower margins, had the most revenue weakness. Component prices were a push in the
quarter. And then as I said, pricing was generally mixed and a headwind in some parts of the business but in some
places not so much. And I think also currency in the quarter was a bit of a headwind at the margin line. And as we
move prices up around that, we clearly would expect that to be less of an issue as we move forward. So I think those
are the dynamics. As you think about the second half, as I would say, a lot of those same dynamics would be what we
would expect to continue to play out.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Okay, and then, Brian, if I can, a quick follow-up. In the context of your 20% to 35% spend
on dividend and share repo, you also added a comment about strategic investments. I don't know if I misheard that, or I
just want to understand. That 20% to 35%, is that specifically just share repurchase and dividend?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Or is there something else you might be thinking about? Okay.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: The broader capital allocation program that we have obviously has an element, which is
continued strategic investments, and M&A is part of that, but that's beyond the 20% to 35%; 20% to 35% is for
dividends and buyback.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Perfect, thank you.
