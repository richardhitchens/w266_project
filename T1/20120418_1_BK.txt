businesses. We will be using the quarterly earnings release document to discuss our results.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Andy, and good morning everyone. And thanks for joining us today. For the quarter, we generated net income
of $619 million and earnings per share of $0.52, which compares to $0.50 in the first quarter of last year and $0.42 in
the fourth quarter of 2011.
Total revenues were up 6% sequentially. If you exclude the share on the services business that we sold right at year-end
2011. On a reported basis, revenue was up 3%. Now, that improvement reflected the solid sequential growth in
investment management and investment services fees. We clearly benefited from new business coming on board, and
improved market values.
How we achieve that growth in spite of the fact that levels of client activities remain lower than normal as an indicator
of that volumes, indicator of the volumes, the combined share volume on the New York Stock Exchange and net effect
was down 17% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.
Lower volatility in the currency markets also negatively impacted our foreign exchange and investment service its fee
revenues. Most of our other core investment services metrics showed positive trends. And in investment management,
the key metric we focused on are flows and investment performance. We had our 10 consecutive quarter of positive
long-term flows of $7 billion and we are please to see nice improvement in the performance of our U.S. equity
products. So over all the trends remains encouraging.
While we can't control market conditions, we made good progress and controlling what we can, which is winning new
business, managing our expenses carefully and strengthening our balance sheet. On the new business front in addition
of the positive long term flows in investment management, asset servicing at it's stronger quarter in terms of new
business wins in 12 months. I should also mention that during quarter and asset servicing, we were ranked number one
in our peer group in terms of service quality in both the R&N and global custody surveys.
That speaks to our success to maintaining our focus on our clients as we transform the asset servicing business. So
simultaneously when we improve the client experience and business profitability.
In fact our quality scores grows year-over-year which is encouraging. On the expense front, we are seeing the early
benefits of our operational excellence initiatives. On an operating basis, total expenses were up 4% sequentially, which
mostly reflected higher litigation and legal expenses and some seasonal staff expense. So on an operating basis again
adjusting for the sale of share owner services, revenues were up 6% sequentially, while expenses were up 4%,
producing 200 basis points of positive operating leverage.
In terms of capital, we generated nearly 700 million of Basel I Tier 1 common and we delivered a strong 21% return on
net increase level of equities. We also repurchased 17 million shares during the quarter.
The strength of our balance sheet was worn out by the results of the latest test, stress test, which reflects the strength of
our business model and the excellent quality of our balance sheet. The results also show our continuing ability to return
capital to our shareholders while maintaining our strong capital position.
As a result, there is no objection to our annual capital plan which includes the continuation of our current dividend and
the repurchase of up to 1.16 billion of outstanding common stock in the next 12 months. This is consistent with the
combined dividend and share buyback ratio of 60% to 65% that we have discussed at our Investors Day. So again, nice
progress in those areas that we can control.
Looking ahead, we continue to believe the lower level of plan activity is the cyclical issue and there our fee revenue
should recover quickly as we return to normal level for the activity. In the mean time, we're focused on delivering a
high quality service and high standard of investment performance to support our revenue growth. Reducing our cost to

operational excellence initiatives and maintaining our financial strength which is enabling us to rapidly return capital to
shareholders.
So in summary, it was a solid quarter and we're delivering on all the items we laid out for you back in November at our
investor conference. So with that, let me turn it over to Todd to go through the numbers.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Gerald and good morning everyone. As in the past, my comments will follow the quarterly earnings review
and let's start on page two. As I take you through the results, keep in mind that the first quarter of 2012 is the first
quarter without our Shareowner Services business, which we divested it at the end of last year, in fact again in
December.
As a result, many of comments around fee revenue and non-interest expense will actually exclude the impact of
Shareowner Services. I would also note that we have adjusted some of our disclosures on the schedules to reflect this
divestiture. We had a solid quarter, earnings were $0.52 which is a good reflection of our core performance. As we had
higher litigation and legal expenses and also had the impact, seasonal impact of our equity compensation programs.
And they were offset by an increase in securities and leasing gains. This compares to $0.50 in the first quarter of 2011,
and $0.42 in the fourth quarter.
We call it the fourth quarter included restructuring charge.
Highlights on a sequential basis, total revenue was 3.6 billion, up 3%, if you exclude Shareowner Services, it was up
6%. Investment services fees was also up 3% and also 6% excluding Shareowner services. That increase is primarily
due to a improved market values, higher volumes, and net new business. Investment management fees excluding the
impact of the seasonal performance fees in the fourth quarter were up 7%, driven by higher market values and net new
business.
FX and other trading was down 16% due to significantly decrease volatility in the first quarter. Net interest revenue
was up 2%. That larger effects were bit of a smaller balance sheet and lower accretion, both of which were partially
offset by increased investments in the high quality investment securities portfolio.
The provision for credit losses was $5 million. Non-interest expense for the quarter was down 3% on aGAAP basis, up
4% excluding amortization of intangible assets restructuring the charges, M&the expenses and most importantly the
direct expenses related to Shareowner services. We did a pretty good job of controlling expenses during the quarter.
The increase is primarily driven by higher litigation and legal expenses and the seasonal impact of stockholders is I'll
give you just a minute.
But first, turning to page four, we will call out some of the business metrics that helped explain how our underlying
performance is going. Here you can see the AUM increased 4% sequentially and 6% year-over-year to a new record
level of $1.3 trillion with long-term inflows of 7 billion in the quarter. They benefited from strength and fixed income
and actively managed equity assets. It was our 10th consecutive quarter of positive long-term inflows.
On the level of long-term flows is lower than its in recent quarters. We saw a shift towards more active asset classes
which had higher fee realization. Assets under custody was up 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year also to a record
level of 26.6 trillion driven by net new business and higher market values. Most of the key metrics showed solid growth
on a year-over-year basis. Loans and deposits are up, DR programs are up modestly and most clearing and broker
dealer services metrics are up substantially. So the fundamentals that we control remains strong.
However there continues to be softness in volumes and volatility and it has impacted our investment services business.
Looking at page, the fees on page six. Asset servicing fees were up 7% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. That's
reflecting net new business and sequentially higher domestic equity markets as well as higher lending revenue which
was driven by better spreads. We had our best new business quarter in four quarters with 453 billion in new AUC wins.

Over last 12 months, new assets under custody wins have now totaled 1.2 trillion with approximately 450 billion yet to
be converted. Most of those conversions we expect to occur over the next three months. Issuer service fees excluding
the Shareowner Services business were down, excuse me were up 2% sequentially and down 14% year-over-year.
Sequentially higher DR revenue was partially offset by lower corporate trust fees. The year-over-year decrease resulted
from lower money market fees and lower corporate trust fees. Those lower fees are driven by weakness and structures
products and we also saw a little lower DR revenue year-over-year.
Our clearing fees were up 9% sequentially and up 4% year-over-year. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher
trading volumes and growth in mutual fund assets. The year-over-year increase was driven by net new business in
growth in mutual fund assets and retirements accounts, which is partially offset by lower trading volumes. So there
were lower volumes year-over-year but higher sequentially and there were also higher money market fee on a
year-over-year basis.
Turning to investment management fees, it is important to understand the impact of the overall AUM on our level fees.
We do have a balanced AUM mix roughly one-third in equities, 35% fixed income, 24% in money markets and the
remainder in alternatives and overlay. In addition we have a significant portion of assets under management that are
impacted by global markets, more international markets.
Given these dynamics, roughly 50% of annualized investment management fees are actually correlated to equity
markets. Of that total, over two thirds of price on a daily or a monthly basis to the average level of market in this season
is important. As noted earlier, our boutique managed assets across international emerging markets to the values of are
just as important in the S&P 500.
Looking at the first quarter 2012 results, investment management fees excluding performance fees were up 7%
sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. The sequential increase reflects the impact of net new business, the
year-over-year decrease reflects higher money market fee wavers, partially offset by net new business.
Equity values benefit investment management fees sequentially, they had little impact year-over-year. And you can see
this from the metrics. The S&P, FTSE, MSCI industry and grow sequentially both on a spot and average basis, but
year-over-year the S&P increased, but 5,100 MSCI industries were down, both on a spot and average basis. As we have
reported in the past, fee wavers continue to impact a number of our businesses and our estimated aggregate impact to
EPS this quarter was about $0.06.
In FX and other trading revenue was down year-over-year on sequentially. When we look at the underlying
components, FX revenue totaled a 136 million. That's a decrease of 26% sequentially and 21% year-over-year.
Sequentially volumes were flat, but volatility decreased substantially while the year-over-year increase primarily
reflects those lower volumes and volatility. The standing instruction alternative continues to be very important to our
clients, although we saw a decline year-over-year in the use of standing instructions as a percentage of all transaction, it
increased sequentially. Other trading revenue was 55 million compared to 45 million in the fourth quarter and 25
million in the year ago quarter.
Both the increases were primarily driven by a high fixed income trading. Investment in other income totaled 139
million in the quarter that compares with 146 million in the prior quarter and 81 million in the year ago quarter.
Sequentially, it was down slightly and that's because of a 98 million pre-tax gain in the sale of Shareowner services in
the fourth quarter. And that was somewhat offset by leasing and seed capital gains in the first quarter 2012. Leasing and
seed capital gains also accounted for the year-over-year increase.
Turning to page eight of the earnings review, NIR was down $15 million sequentially and up 67 million versus the year
ago quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by lower average client deposits, a little lower accretion. And
that was partially offset by increased investments in our high quality investments securities. This is consistent with
what we told you, what our NIR strategy was going to be during the Investor Day presentation in November.
I should add that, that we had expected as occurred deposits to contract from the sharp rise that we saw late in the end
of the fourth quarter. So, those deposits did leave us. The year-over-year increase with primarily driven by higher

average client deposits. Increased investment and securities and higher loan levels, partially offset by lower accretion
and lower spreads.
We would expect deposit volumes to continue to be volatile due to the uncertainty of the global financial markets and
the potential for regulatory changes as we look forward. The net interest margin was 1.32% compared to 1.27 in the
fourth quarter and 149 in the year ago quarter. The sequential increase reflects increased investments in the securities
portfolio and a decrease in lower yielding interest bearing deposits with banks. The year-over-year decrease is
primarily driven by the increase in client deposits, nearly half of which were invested in liquid by the very low yielding
assets.
Turning to page nine, you can see that total non-interest expense, and here if you exclude intangible assets restructuring
M&I and most importantly the direct expenses related to Shareowner services was up 4% sequentially and 5%
year-over-year. The biggest driver for the increase was litigation in legal expense which was up $60 million
sequentially and 70 million year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year increase also reflects higher incentive
expense due to divesting of long-term stock awards for retirement eligible employees as well as higher pension
expense.
As you all noted, we are beginning to realize the benefits of our operational excellence initiatives as reflected in lower
business development, professional and other purchase services, compensation, net occupancy and software and
equipment expense.
Page 10 details our capital ratios. Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was up 50 basis points to 7.6 at
quarter end. The improvement was driven by an increase in the value of our investment securities portfolio, earnings
retention and lower risk weighted assets partially offset by share buybacks and dividends. Our Basel I Tier 1 common
equity ratio was 13.9% at year-end, also up 50 basis points from the end of December, driven primarily by earnings
retention from the approximately $680 million of Basel I equity generated during the quarter.
On page 11, you can see that our investment securities portfolio continue to perform quite well. The pre-tax net
unrealized gain in our securities portfolio increased by 389 billion to 1.2 billion.
Looking now at our loan portfolio, you'll see that the provision for credit losses was 5 million, that compares with 23
million in the fourth quarter and the zero provision in the year ago quarter. And NPAs have declined from 341 to 331
million. The effective tax rate of 28.7% compared with 29.3% in the year ago quarter. So looking ahead, in the second
quarter we should see a seasonal increase in DRs and securities of lending revenues. NII should be relatively stable
depending on the size of our client deposits.
Fee waiver should be consistent with the last couple of quarters. The quarterly provisions should be in the range of $0
to $15 million. We continue to be focused on driving the expense savings through our operational excellence initiative
that we've laid out with you. We also expect to continue to repurchase in shares in the second quarter. There is always
the time we will depend on market conditions. The tax rate in the second quarter of 2012 should also be approximately
29%.
So with that, let me turn it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Todd and I think we can now open it up for questions.

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is
from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alexander Blostein
Great. Thanks everybody, good morning. Gentlemen, I was hoping you could update us on the pricing dynamics and
how those dialogues with clients going on? I guess, when we could see a little bit more intangible result on the
servicing pricing.
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Alex. Thanks. I will start and then if Tim Keaney wants to jump in. We are still on a very early stages of it, I
think as we laid out for you and last November, we were beginning with the smaller clients. We were working through
that process on a net basis we are positive. But it's a long grown out process.
We want to make sure, we are handling it the right way and are getting good information from the clients on how they
react to it. And but on a general basis, its been net positive and we're of to a good start. Tim, do you want to add
anything?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Gerald as you mentioned, we're starting at the smaller client range we've identify the universal of about 700
clients to go after first or about 50% through that process. We hope to be done through the entire universe in June.
We've had about 70% success rate keeping clients at an increased rate, and I'm also encouraged that we've had about
nine larger clients, so clients to pay us over $0.5 million a year or more. But if come up for review, we've retained nine
out of nine with an increase in fees. So, it's still early days.
Alexander Blostein
Got you, that's very helpful detail, thanks. And then just a follow-up on FX. I mean it feels like the sequential decline
was a little bit larger relative to some of your peers and the JP Morgan down 11, things were flattish, Northern down 15
or so. So, feels like everybody was operating in the similar environment, volumes were flattish, volatility came down a
lot. So, is there something else going on where your results were down more than 20 sequentially or is it just a mix of
business, the volatility in currencies that you are more active in was sequentially weaker?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I'll actually start. I would say its consistent with what we have seen in the past. So, the volatility impact was very
direct. So the same percentage that we saw, the decline in volatility that would have impacted our earnings reflected
right through to our numbers. The level of standing instruction actually rose a bit in the first quarter. But we saw on
sequential basis volumes, total volumes were absolutely flat.
I don't know if Tim has anything to add to that.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
No. I would just say looking forward, we see a huge opportunity to increase the percentage of volumes, it should
naturally be coming to us as custodian and asset service. And we've raised a focus on launching some new products to

collect that volume. We're pleased with the launch of our defined spread program which we launched in February.
We've got it around to about, just about all the clients kind of its very good news, a little over half of their clients have
decided to stay in our current range a program. And about 40% or so have signed up for the new defined spread
program.
So, we're watching very carefully. The key mission for us is to increase the volume and we're focused on launching the
new products and we'll be watching that quite careful.

Got you. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Elizabeth (Betsy) Graseck
Hi, good morning.
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.
Elizabeth (Betsy) Graseck
Couple of questions. One on expenses, could you quantify how much of the cost save program impacted this quarter?
And then as you're talking about the next quarter outlook, could you give us a sense as that's likely the trend given that
usually have a step up and salary in 2Q?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure Betsy. It's hard to decide for exactly how much the cost save program has benefited to tease it out in its entirety.
We are seeing some significant benefits on the technology front. And the best ratio that we provide, I think that will
help you look at this is if you look at our investment services revenues relative to the related expenses, they did move
from -- revenues are now 94% of expenses versus 90 in the fourth quarter. So, it looks to me like there is a 100 basis
points or so would be my best guess for what we're getting out of that.
And then there was a follow-up, the follow-up question was on the margin increase.
Elizabeth (Betsy) Graseck
Right.

Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think seasonally you're not going to see quite as much impact because its going to show off in the third quarter.
We're going to delay the increase until July 1st. And there is also, I want to bring to your attention that the acceleration
of our equity programs, there is a seasonal impact to that. So, as employees near retirement age, we recognize a 100%
of that expense in the period that its granted. So that had quite a big impact, probably at least a $30 million delta to
what we would see in the second quarter.
Elizabeth (Betsy) Graseck
Right. Okay. And then separately, the gross margins in your business in the asset servicing business obviously
improved which is different from what we've seen from other folks. Could you kind of speak to what you're doing there
to drive that kind of result? Obviously, you would have the reprising, but you mentioned it's early days. So there must
be something else going on there?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I think Betsy, it's really assumptions, I have got expense management and Tim can talk a little bit more of it. Last
call, we started, not started, but we really focused in reducing the expense base and the employee base to better match
the revenue growth we are experiencing. And so I think those programs have kicked in and it's really been on the
expense side controlling that is new revenues are coming on board, and so that allow for the margin to expand.
Elizabeth (Betsy) Graseck
But your gross margins extend as well. I'm just assuming
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I'm sorry. Can you
Elizabeth (Betsy) Graseck
Even gross margins have expanded recently, if I'm looking at fees over are you saying?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Higher margin.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, if you noticed that our assets under custody are up above 3% sequentially and I think you will see that our
revenues were up about 6% sequentially in asset servicing. So Tim you might want to comment on that

Yes, Betsy, it's really a mix point. We've been talking about this now a few quarters in a row, we've been winning a lot
of new business in middle office outsourcing and transfer agency which really aren't geared to AUC. I think you see the
opposite kind of playing through and the year-on-year results, definitely a business mix point that you are around you
raised.

Yes, I would say that's about what the seasonality was. I think that's a kind a net out to about that numbers, Cynthia.
Cynthia Mayer
Nothing beyond that. Okay. And you mentioned also that you expect stable NII depending on or depending on deposits.
So what kind of trend are you seeing so far this quarter and what do you regard this sort of a normalized rate or a
normalized level?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Okay, I think normalized in this abnormal environment is about where we are. So in the zero rate environment it feels
like about a 130 to 135 type of range is what we could squeeze out of the NIM. But there are a lot of factors that will
impact that because if we see a shock one way or the other we could see balances grow. But if we don't see any
meaningful change in behavior or any meaningful change in interest rates, our balance sheet seems to be behaving
pretty stable about this level, which is about where we closed for the third quarter.

Okay.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
About where we closed the first quarter, I'm sorry. That 300 billion is the settled to the average balance sheet size. The
fourth quarter we saw the spike in deposits when everyone is waiting cash with that net more normalized of the $300
billion range in net interest margin and this 130 to 140 is probably about right.
Cynthia Mayer
Okay. And then just lastly maybe on the issue or services post the sales of the share owner service, the share owner
business, is that kind of a good run rate at this point?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. That line is now issue or services is just two of our underlying businesses, it is corporate trust and DRs and current
fees ahead of our businesses is where the,
Cynthia Mayer
Yes, about half of the decline on the first quarter was corporate trust. About half was DR. Our corporate trust has to do
with the market and the global debt markets was flat for the quarter. And the U.S. market thus shows some
improvement, it was up about 2% and we also had 12 CL loans after the first quarter. So that was very encouraging.
So in that business we are very much looking to decrease expenses and manage risks and in the DR business, of course
that's emerging market related and it's also impacted by corporate action.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
So, there is just little less corporate action
Cynthia Mayer
And global M&A is down.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Cynthia, I said the DR business is pretty volatile because it's episotic with corporate actions
Cynthia Mayer
Right, okay. And sounds like overall maybe cyclically depressed still a little bit. So, could bounce back credit volatile.

It is, I mean and its a reflection of the activity that's going on primarily in the emerging markets. Corporate trusts is a
reflection of what's going on in the debt issuance and with the lack of the structure, debt market, its a little more
challenging.
Cynthia Mayer
Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Analyst
Hey, good morning. It's actually Kathy filling in for Ken. Just a question, I guess following up on the NII outlook. How
much with the understanding that the balance sheet is probably at a right size. How much of the NIM improvement was
due to just the access liquidity drag coming off versus a slightly more aggressive embellishment strategy?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I say it's about half and half, Kathy.
Analyst
Okay. Got you. And then within expenses and there was a couple of stock holes within on the fee inside, the investment
income obviously was pretty high. And then on the expense side of things, the other line was pretty high due to the
litigation expense. What do you see as kind of a good run rate going forward for these lines?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
I think lower for both hopefully.
Analyst
Okay. And then just lastly on capital. The 1.16 billion for C cards, are you looking to do that pretty rapidly through the
year? And then if you could share an thoughts as to why no dividend hike? Thank you.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
I'll take - when we submitted the C cards, we do submit it on a quarterly basis and our plan is to do rapidly throughout
the course of the year and actually over the following four quarters. Because now it doesn't really stem into the first
quarter of next year. So its continuous for four quarters. In terms of the dividend hike, I mean we had indicated at

November that we'll be in the 20% to 25% range as a payout, and I think we're giving more consensus is, we're
following into that range. And Gerald, do you have anything to add to that.
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, just a couple of quick comments on that. I think we were, as we tend to be relatively conservative in our
approach to capital plan. When we submitted the plan, we did not want to break any ratios even under a stressed
environment. We also wanted to maintain that 20% to 25% payout for dividend and 60% to 65% payout in total
including the buybacks. We were well within those numbers even in a stressed scenario. And I think it just shows that
the - of our business model and the flexibility that we have going forward.
So, time will tell on what we'll do, beyond what's the plan is today. Next question?
Andy Clark, Investor Relations
Operator, do we have any more questions?

Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
Howard Chen
Hi, good morning Gerald, good morning Todd.
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, how are you?
Howard Chen
Just a follow-up on that fairly large buyback approval you have. Assuming just no more frictional deposit role-off,
when does leverage become a potential constraint again as we saw a little bit when the market was choppier at the end
of the year?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we're up to 560 leverage ratio, so we're pretty comfortable with where we are right now. We could actually take
on quite a significant increase in deposits. And so we build, I mean as you can see we're building even with this type of
activity. So we brought back a lot in the first quarter and pay our dividend we continue to build both Basel I and Basel
III capital. So, we think that's going to be much, much less of a constraint for us when we go forward.
Howard Chen
And given the world is just fragile, Todd I mean what is that kind of like leverage constraint or target that we should be
thinking about in the back of our minds?

that.
Howard Chen
Okay, great. And then another one on the numbers. I apologize if I missed this in your remarks, but leasing and seed
capital gains were elevated again. I know that's probably the core business, but could you just provide some more detail
on all of that and maybe your outlook for the sustainability of that going forward?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
In the other income line, you can see we've had some volatility it's probably been in the 60 million to 150 million type
of range depending on some of the one-off items like seed capital, the Shareowner services, and we do from
time-to-time as we're winding down our lease portfolio, some of those leases are at a gain. I think the normalized with
which normal and that line items probably in the $80 million to $100 million range.
Howard Chen
Okay. Great, thanks. And just pardon one for me. As a statutory limitation is ending here, it appears we are seeing some
more mortgage elated lawsuits for the industry targeted more the trustee rather than the originator. Gerald, I know you
have made some fairly strong statements on all of these at the Investor Day. But I'm just curious if you had may
involved thoughts on that and how you all are preparing for some of this coming down the industry pipeline? Thanks.
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We continue to feel very good about market position as trustee as these cases have been going through the profits. As
you may have seen we got a favorable rolling here in the state New York around the settlement, I think it is endorsed
again our role as trustee and the limitations of our liabilities. So we still feel quite good about our position as trustee in
this situation.
Howard Chen
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.

Good morning, gentlemen. Just one quick question for you. Obviously deposit outflows have been persistent across the
space. I was wondering giving your vintage point, have you any sense as to where those flows are moving back into? I
mean, obviously we have seen equities and there is a general rerisking seen, but are most flows moving back into funds
or where this capital has been flashing around the system that sitting on your balance sheet? When is it kind of ending
up today?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I say generally it is a re-risking seem John. Let me turn this one over to Curtis Arledge, Head of our Asset
Management. Curtis.
Curtis Y. Arledge, Head of our Asset Management
Yes, we have definitely seen flows out of those deposits and money plant generally moving back into rerisking flows
have been into international equity markets and bond markets. So there has definitely been a team of investors who are
rerisking being more of our spot in their approach. It is hard to know exactly where deposit flows and the economy
flows go. But from AUM flows there is some re-risking going on.
John Stilmar
And then given the fact that you have your strong position with your clients and the balance sheet. There is always a
debate about whether the custodians have the ability to potentially cross sell their asset management business to some
of those deposit basis. How would you say your ability to retain those deposit outflows from the balance sheet back in
this sort of some of your Bank of New York asset management businesses? Can you talk about where those funds
might have been recaptured and that is the potential opportunity to grow this asset management AUM or fee per AUM?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I mean we obviously have clients for hoe relationships across many of our asset management boutiques. And
when they have a relationship with us and they also use our money funds or deposits to hold cash we are always talking
about their holistic needs whether they are positioned well against their liabilities, did they have they are probably
amount of diversification again around their global portfolios. And I will tell you we are actually making real progress.
I's say it is one of the biggest opportunities for us as a company as to continue to mind the holistic relationship clients
can hold cash with us, they can also invest across a wide array of equity in fixed income products. We are going to be
announcing later this week a new head of our client distribution function. Really to continue we are very closely with
investment services team around broad relationships. And so I think its a really big opportunity for us.
John Stilmar
Would you say that the progress now is better than it was maybe a year ago?

Yes.

being able to capture that.

Thank you. Our next question is with Brian Bedell with ISI Group.
Brian Bedell
Hi, good morning folks.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning Brian.
Brian Bedell
Todd, you were talking about the excess deposit trends and potential impact of regulatory changes on that. Could you
just elaborate a little bit more and also the non interest bearing deposit obviously declined a lot on a period and basis.
Do you think that sort of just noise or is that indicative of a substantial downward direction into second quarter.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Sure Brian. While I start with the last question I think the period end point was really a spike and it was a spike in the
fourth quarter and now it's mostly noise. I think it was a little bit of a move into risky assets as we just discussed.
In terms of the looking out. I mean there are couple of things to look at, they could have different impacts I would say
on the deposit base. One would be, if there is a significant, if the rating is the -- significantly downgrade other financial
institutions we may see more deposits direct in here. Another item is what I mentioned regulatory reform. To post
money market reform and for that matter FDIC insurance. So, depending on what happens whether it's an extension of

Page 16 of 25
the significant FDIC insurance that exists today that could go either way for us, since we are as such on our balance
sheet we could end up seeing more deposits or you could see the deposits moving elsewhere into some other lower risk
type of assets such as treasuries.
In terms of money market reform, you could depending on how significant it was, obviously that it will take sometime.
You could see a move out of money markets into the deposit base. So, there's a lot of uncertainty and variables that --
which is why I was alluding to there.
Brian Bedell
Okay. Great. And then on the money market reform you wouldn't see any impact on that to at least 2013 I would think,
is that your, was understanding also?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Clark should might be better positioned to answer that.
Andy Clark, Investor Relations
Yeah. I think that we, six months ago they would have thought that there well might have been something in place by
the end of the year as all of you have read, the SEC proposals or suggested proposals. There are still I think discussing
themselves exactly what they are going to put out. So, I do think it's going to be more of a 2013 implementation here.
Obviously, there are other regulators besides the SEC that are focused on this. So, we do think that something is
forthcoming.
But I think, the industry has definitely helped the regulators understand that dynamics of floating NAV the challenges
that I would create both operationally and really limit the convenience of the product. And so, there is a lot of active
dialogue going on as you well know, but I think it will take the rest of this year all to figure it out.
Brian Bedell
Yeah. Okay, great. And then a question for Tim on the asset servicing. Obviously the growth is pretty good at 6.5%
linked-quarter. Tim, can you describe what contribution came from broker dealer services in terms of the growth or was
that mostly really driven by the mix shift that you alluded to as you can -- no office? And then the new business that
your branch is still bringing on these 400 plus billion so yet to converted. How should we think about that from a
revenue capture rate relative to your overall capture rate?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Brian I would say overall broker dealer services was a small portion of the story. I think it's absolutely a net new
business in flow story. I think Clark might have mentioned the 450 billion still to convert. We converted just over 300
in the last quarter. We expect to convert what hasn't been converted in the next three months.
And it's an excellent mix of business, it's good solid core fee business in middle office outsourcing custody and transfer
agency. And I think as we talked a little before that's really sticky business.

Okay, great. And the 70% success rate that you mentioned. Can you just define exactly what that is, is that 70%
retention or success relative to your objective?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. That 70% of the clients have agreed to the repricing buying. And of the clients that haven't yet that doesn't mean
they won't, a very small majority, a very small number of clients, pardon me that have said they are leaving us actually
haven't told is whether or not they found a custodian to take the business. So, it's 70% have accepted our new pricing
and as I mentioned we are only halfway through that 700 client basis. So, it's still early days and I am just reminded to
say it's a very different story at the high-end of the business. So, the largest clients that are multi-product, that are in the
security and running in foreign exchange program it's still very, very price competitive.
Brian Bedell
Great. Okay, now that's very help. And just a couple of housekeeping ones. Did the level of discount accretion net
interest revenue in the quarter and also the money fund fee waivers pre-tax income?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, the accretion was down a bit to about 80 million on the quarter. And that's probably about where it should run for
the next few quarters. And the fee waivers were just about flat with the fourth quarter, maybe slightly improved and
that's costing us somewhere between $0.05 and $0.06, it's kind of in the middle of that.
Brian Bedell
Is that 70 million about approximately?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
It's actually a little bit higher than that.
Brian Bedell
Close to 90 million.
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Closer to 90, Brian.

Your next question is from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
Glenn Schorr
Hi, thanks very much. Can we go back to asset management just for a SEC and talk about what products are just
bringing in the money. You've noted the last what 10 quarters in a row of positive long-term flows. It seems pretty
consistent, can you just talk about what the greatest asset gathers are?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And actually it is really important to understand the composition of the flows because too often I think we used
AUM as one instrument to describe what's going on. If you go back to a year ago, first quarter of 2011, a lot of flows
were very much index oriented and fixed income sort of low fee oriented. So we actually had $31 billion positive flow
a year ago, and then it generated about $26 million in net annual revenues.
The flows have definitely shifted more towards active mandates again with a international flavor, both international
stock and international bond flows have been favorable. And then within bond flows, we've seen more of a move to
emerging market, that's true for us. I think those trends are generally true for the industry. We are well positioned, we
have good performance, good investment teams in those categories. So the flow numbers are not necessarily as big, $7
billion of long-term flows this quarter actually generated more net annual revenues.
So, I really do think its important to understand both the AUM and the net revenue composition of the flows. And again
I think its too early to say that people are re-risking aggressively, but there absolutely is a shift away from more
passively, conservative oriented products to investors, thinking that at least some of the chaos and volatility is behind
them, and they are putting money back to work. They need to eventually earn a return on a low return environment,
they are deploying more capital.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
I'll just add to it. Again the beauty of our business model is we have a whole series of boutiques to book variety of
different investment strategies and so as people shift their thought process to different types of asset classes, we're able
to capture those flows and internalize it.
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Maybe one other point I would make is that, there is definitely also a trend away from investors buying products and
they are definitely looking more for solutions. The types of investment offerings that we have that appealed them really
are in the absolute return asset allocation, real return categories. So, I mean the balance fund of all is in many ways
making a come back as investors really are spending more time looking at their liabilities and trying to find a solution
that is well matched to it.
And again, we have a number of investments offerings there. I actually say, also its been why Mellon worked as a firm
because its clients are trying to figure out what is my overall solution. They're actually asking, who understands my
overall needs and when you have a large institution where you or both their assets servicer and may had to allow their
assets, you tend to be more of those people who really does have a holistic perspective on the entire client issue.

Glenn Schorr
Alright I appreciate that. The 60 million increase in litigation cost, is there any allocation you can give us towards what
that's for, Howard pointed out some of the ongoing mortgage issues but you also have that Stars case picking up steam?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. There is -- no Glenn, we really, I don't think it will be in our interest to disclose which items any of the
provisions are related to.
Glenn Schorr
Okay. And on that front, my gut, its the same answer, but have you given us a number on what your total litigation
reserve is right now?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No, we have not.
Glenn Schorr
Okay. And then just making sure on the Stars tax case, there is no reserve against that, correct?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No, we have not indicated what our provisions are but we do give a very clear indication with what the potential risk to
us is on Stars. By the way, the trials just began this week and we continue to believe we've got a very strong tax
position there.
Glenn Schorr
Okay. Last one, the jump up, this is not a this quarter issue, but its more making sure the jump up from Basel I risk
related assets to Basel III, it's bigger for you guys then lot of other companies. Is that just the low rate of securities and
the investment portfolio that eventually run off?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, I would say it's really there is two contributors there. We have a little higher operational risk I would think than
average. But by far is the largest contributor is the treatment of the self investment grades securities portfolio and that
portfolio is almost $4 billion, its attracting about the equivalent of $50 billion of risk weighted assets. So that's burning
off a few billion dollars of risk weighted assets a quarter.
Glenn Schorr
Got it. And obviously that's incorporated into the capital plans process.

deposits that you guys are thinking about that are still sitting on your balance sheet. How do we think about that
potentially in a more normalize environment.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Again I think we are in a more normalized balance sheet environment we have to remind you all that right at the year
end the last year we had a significant spike in deposits as everyone was in a risk off mode, we probably had $20 billion
to $30 billion of excess deposits right at the year-end that is more normalized and burnt also speak. And we are running
an average balance sheet in the $300 billion range and that feels about normal for us given our client activities.
Andrew Marquardt
Okay. And then you had mention that the discount accretion is close to about 80 million that should hold for next
couple of quarters. After that we are at trend lower or how do we think about that.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, the that probably got about, it will slowly trend lower as you see prepayments in that portfolio. So you can pretty
much just look at it as the overall adjustment on a portfolio, that's now a little over $3 billion and that's probably
amortizing at about20% per annum. So you can just look at it that way Andrew.

Okay, great. And then you had mentioned the normalized margin in an abnormal environment is now 130, 135. If you
remind us the normalized environment should that still be in the 160, 180 that you had mentioned that on the Analyst
Day?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
I think it would be Andrew, that's our best guess. There is probably still some deposits there and some free deposits
right here because of extremely low interest rate environment. That if we do go into a normal environment of a couple
of a 100 basis point of funds rate, we see a little smaller balance sheet, but we'd see a heck lot of higher yield on it.
Andrew Marquardt
Got it. And does that include or exclude the discount accretion benefit?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
It would, basically before I think we are going to see that environment, that discount accretion is going to have burnt
off. So I think we can pretty much, what we tried to point out in November, is we are adding, we are putting some
assets to work. And enough yield to offset the discount accretion burn off.
Andrew Marquardt
Got it, that's helpful. And then just lastly, in terms of the expense initiative that's gaining traction. How do we think
about the ability to achieve positive operating leverage this year and still what is still a tough revenue environment. Is it
possible to get positive operating leverage with that new initiative in this environment?
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Itcertainly is our goal. And just as we laid out for you in our Investor Day November, even in a slow growth
environment with a kicking in of our initiatives, we expect to produce positive operating leverage over the course of the
year.
Andrew Marquardt
Great. Thank you.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Andrew.

Good morning.
Gerald L. Hassell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Morning.
Greg Ketron
A couple of questions. One on in general you touched on us couple of time this morning, the pricing overall as you
have built a very nice pipeline before the couple of people talked about, looking at pricing and trying to improve the
pricing that exists in the marketplace. Are you seeing any better pricing as you move forward on billing and contracts?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
I'll take this real quick and then we can turn it over to. Of our businesses, the one that is getting the most attention
regard pricing in asset servicing. We are not seeing a lot of pricing pressure or noise elsewhere. So for us, our asset
servicing business is 25% to 30% of our business and I think that's gotten the most volume on this topic. So, Tim you
want to address it further?
Timothy F. Keaney, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, BNY Mellon
Asset Servicing; Chairman of EMEA
Sure. Todd I think I just maybe at the risk of repeating myself a little bit. I think on a very largest end of the market,
very large clients by asset terms that are looking to leverage a number of our products and services including securities
lending and foreign exchange. It's just still really competitive. But for us it's about trying to do more business with
those firms given the range of products and services that we have. I have seen a bit more pricing pressure when you get
to smaller clients and on bundled clients.
So, I think that's probably the best way to characterize it at this point. And if there is an area where there might be still a
little bit of pricing rationality I would say it's just generally in the public fund sector. And as we have said before we
are just standing incredibly disciplined making sure that every client no matter what size it is, is hitting our minimum
profit thresholds. And if that means we loose a couple of clients, we loose a couple of clients.
Greg Ketron
Okay. Great. And then if we can get an update on the asset sensitivity. You had mentioned the fee waivers had reached
maybe close to 19 million a quarter?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, the it is a little higher than we have had indicated in the past. What we had indicated historically or for the past
number of quarters here is that a 100 basis point immediate shift in short-term interest rates would have something like
a $500 million pre-tax income impact to us assuming there wasn't a significant change in our client behavior. That
number is probably a higher than it was probably over 600 million.

Over 600 million, up a 100 basis points?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yes.
Greg Ketron
And would that just be the revenue impact or would that include also any related expenses like comp on the higher
revenue?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Greg that includes our best asset related expenses.
Greg Ketron
Okay.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
That's pre-tax.
Greg Ketron
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Wendy, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.
Jeffery Harte
Good morning, guys. On the FX a scene we've been hearing from kind of bank FX trading operations has been a lot of
margin compression in developed markets, but things are going a little better in the emerging markets. Can you talk a
bit about to what extent your franchisee touches the emerging markets versus being very developed market centric in

FX trading?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, we provide FX services across all the markets in the developed and emerging. It's a pretty broad-based client
base and therefore we do trade and provide capabilities across all the markets. And I think that's one of the reasons why
when we described into client volatility-wide impacts just the way it does. And as Tim mentioned earlier, we are
continuing to address the market demands and provide services that meet their needs and it's not surprising with a loan
growth environment for everyone across the board and slower economies that this kind of activity is due to a very, very
competitively. So, our job is to try to capture as much volume that touches is as humanly possible and to be sensitive to
the client demand.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Jeff we cover over a 100 markets. So our revenues are very client focused. So it depends on our, what the business
activity of our clients is, and that's what's driving our revenues. But we do cover just about every consumable market.
Jeffery Harte
And to the extent you cover, non say developed markets is that a function of work client assets. I mean, the FX is
directly or largely tied to your asset on the custody clients?
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. That's right.
Jeffery Harte
Okay. Thank you.
Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you very much.
Timothy F. Keaney, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, BNY Mellon
Asset Servicing; Chairman of EMEA

Clark or -- a call. And that we appreciate you dialing in. Have a good morning.
