Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thanks, Amy. Good morning and thank you for joining us. First, let me say that I am thrilled to be here. Avon is an
iconic company with a rich legacy, a unique business model and a powerful global brand. Most of all, Avon has
passionate people how are committed to making it different by empowering women across the world. I've been here for
all of seven days, so it would be premature to make any declarations about our specific path forward. So as I begin this
new role, I am both realistic and confident about our opportunities.
Avon has a strong foundation, incredibly strong brand awareness. Over six million Active Representatives are a
tremendous asset that give us both global reach and the closest possible connection with our customers. Our employees
are mission-focused. They care about what they do and about empowering women's ability to earn and build their
businesses. We are a formidable competitor and a global leader in direct selling. We have great strength in emerging
markets, where millions of new consumers are rapidly joining the middle class. Our products offer great quality at a
good value.
Yet, as you well know, Avon also faces significant challenges. It has lost market share and missed expectations. It has
had problems executing, it has faced operational and strategic issues. The rate of growth has declined and cost structure
and cash generation need to be improved. And externally, the world is changing. We face new competitors in both
mature and emerging markets. Consumer expectations are changing and people are shopping in different ways. Product
lifecycles are shorter and we need to keep our representatives motivated and well compensated at a time when they too
have more choices than ever before.
I am taking a fresh look at every aspect of the business, and stabilizing the business is my first and most urgent
objective. During these early days most of my focus will be internal, as I work to assess the stills and capabilities of the
organization and make sure we have what we need to take us into a future of consistent and sustained growth. Between
now and mid-June, I will visit some of our key markets, including, U.S., Brazil, China, Mexico and Russia, to assess
the strengths and weaknesses of our business and to meet with regional leadership, our management teams and our
representatives. I'll be assessing the landscape of competitors, commodity cost issues, changing demographics and
technologies that give customers and representatives more choices. I will review our product portfolio as well as the
representative earning opportunity and our customer connectivity.
I will also be reviewing the operating model. This will include an emphasis on short-term business performance,
including financial metrics as well as operational issues, both globally and in priority markets. A lot good diagnostic
work has already been done in these areas; I've begun to review this analysis and will build on it with my own
observations.
In my experience, turning around a business requires clear priorities, realistic expectations and strict accountability. My
approach is disciplined. I will understand and realistically frame the situation, develop a short list of five or six key
priorities on which we are going to focus, put in place clear metrics and accountability, be clear about expectations and
deliverables and, importantly, get the organization working together toward achieving these priorities. Our people need
to be focused and motivated. And for our investors, we need to be very clear about our priorities and then hit our
targets; this is the only way to build confidence and trust going forward.
I will lead with the highest of standards. I will expect the best from myself and from all of our people. We will always
ask are we solving the problems, are we setting our standards high enough, are we making our company better, are we
asking the questions that challenge the status quo and allow for new thinking? I am confident that Avon's future can be
as meaningful and successful as its past, and I'm honored to be the CEO.
I look forward to meeting and working with all of you. And I also want to take this opportunity in closing to thank
Andrea for the great support she is giving me during this transition. She has been an invaluable resource and I
appreciate her commitment to the company and to me.
And now I'll hand over the call to Kimberly Ross, Chief Financial Officer of Avon.

Kimberly A. Ross
Thank you, Sheri. Good morning. I want to start by saying how excited we all are to have Sheri on board at this crucial
time for the company. Before I begin my review of the first quarter, I'd like to offer a qualitative perspective on the
business. The numbers this quarter are tough, and worse than we anticipated, particularly in regards to operating
margin. The business remains under pressure. In fact, we are likely to see revenue deceleration and continued margin
pressure in the second quarter. In particular, Brazil and the U.S. are likely to weaken and we plan to maintain high
levels of investment.
I know when I joined Avon that addressing the company's strategic and tactical challenges would take time, and that's
what we're seeing. As we said on our last call, 2012 is a year of transition. The whole team is working with urgency
and focus to address the issues at hand. I'll speak more specifically about the actions we're taking in a moment. Let me
just say I'm confident that our challenges are fixable.
With that perspective, let me talk in more depth about the first quarter numbers. The 1% constant dollar increase in
revenue reflects a price mix increase of 2%, offset by a 1% decline in units. Active Representatives were down 2%.
Driven by growth in all four beauty categories, constant-dollar beauty growth of 2% was partially offset by a decline in
Fashion & Home. Gross margin was down 310 basis points, impacted by commodity costs and wage inflation that was
not fully offset with pricing. Foreign exchange and product mix were also factors.
Adjusted operating margin was down 610 basis points, to 3.8% in the quarter. As we expected, we had higher
investments in RVP this quarter as we continued the transition to One Simple Sales Model in the U.S., and we
increased investment in representative engagements in Brazil. We also had higher compensation costs, primarily due to
the release of an accrual in Q1 2011 that did not repeat this year. In terms of key areas that were worse than we
expected, we had higher bad debt provisions in South Africa and product mix was more negative. We also had $27
million in costs associated with restructuring in the quarter. I'll come back to this point a bit later.
Moving to the performance of our markets in quarter one. Latin America, sales rose 5% in constant dollars, driven by
continued strength in Mexico and Venezuela, partially offset by a decline in Colombia, which continues to face
competitive pressure. While Argentina continued to grow, it slowed, as import restrictions on raw materials and
finished good started to have an impact on sales. We are switching to local sourcing where possible, but we will likely
continue to be impacted over a period of time.
Our largest market, Brazil, was us 2% in constant dollars, driven by 6% growth in Beauty, which was partially offset by
double-digit decline in Fashion & Home. In Brazil, our new general manager and his team have been focused on
understanding the drivers of recent performance and identifying the required steps to win competitively while
delivering profitable growth.
I will provide you three examples. First, while system implementation issues have stabilized and service has improved
sequentially, it remains at lower levels than a year ago. We need to reduce complexity to drive simplification and
continue to improve perceived and actual service in the broadest sense, including, but not limited to, billing issues,
shorts and late deliveries. These issues continue to impact representative satisfaction and costs.
Second, competition continues to increase, and it is pressuring Avon's results and brand positioning. While Avon's
brand equity remains strong, we need to improve local consumer relevance through more Brazilian-centric product
offerings and advertising campaigns. We are also looking at our Beauty product positioning across price tiers and
categories.
Third, price increases have negatively impacted unit volume and representative earnings in Fashion & Home. We are
recalibrating pricing to be more competitive. The team in Brazil is working on the actions to address these issues, but
they are not quick fixes. As a result, we expect sales to decline in quarter two. In addition, we had pre-sales of
approximately 4% ahead of the ERP implementation in the second quarter of last year.

Operating margin in Latin America was down due to weaker gross margin which was impacted by commodity cost
pressure, overhead and foreign exchange. Operating margin was further impacted by the planned increase in RVP to
enhance representative engagement in Brazil. Increased competition in Colombia and the importing restriction were
also factors, all of which are likely to remain factors in the second quarter.
North America's sales were down 4%. The U.S. core business, excluding Silpada, was down 2%. And benefits from
product portfolio enhancement of Smart Value and Giftables were offset by a decline in Active Representatives. This
was a result of the planned redistricting in our Western Region. The redistricting is proceeding and we are seeing
positive signs amongst the leadership ranks and top sellers. The most encouraging sign is that leadership up line is now
responsible for nearly all of our appointments, consistent with our strategy. We are also witnessing healthy growth
amongst our top sellers.
Growth in Honor Society and above was 31% in the last cycle and growth in President's Club was 13%. These early
signs give us the confidence that this remains the right strategy over time. But as can be expected with such a large
change, there has been some impact on activity, particularly among lower tier representatives. We are addressing this
with outreach programs, communication and rep engagement initiatives. Nonetheless, we expect quarter two to be
impacted both by the residual effects of the rollout in the West and by the likely disruption from the rollout we are
currently undertaking in the East. As a result, quarter two sales could be worse than quarter one's.
Given the learnings from the first quarter, the U.S. team has plans in place to mitigate the disruption. These include:
stronger and earlier communication with the representative and district managers, the hosting of recognition events for
top-selling representatives in May and in June; and the launching of the summer version of our Home for the Holidays
program that was so successful around the Christmas season.
In sum, our associates have put in endless hours working on this transition, and we are pleased with the progress thus
far. We are moving forward with the implementation of our U.S. strategy, and while painful in the short term, the early
changes in our representatives' actions give us the confidence that these are the right changes to stabilize the business.
The operating margin in North America was due to lower gross margin, which was impacted by negative mix,
commodity costs and transportation. In addition, as we indicated on the last call, we made investments in RVP in
support of the One Simple Sales Model initiative and we expect these investments to continue into the second quarter.
CEE. Sales were essentially flat, as sales in Russia were up 1% in constant dollars due to an increase in Active
Representatives. The region remains challenging but we are encouraged by the forward progress we made in the first
quarter. Operating margin in CEE was down largely due to lower gross margin stemming from commodity cost
pressures as well as investments in the brochure. Constant-dollar sales in WEMEA were up 1%. Developed markets
continued to be affected by the macroeconomic environment, which has negative impact on Fashion & Home sales.
Operating margin was down due to higher bad debt provisions in South Africa and foreign exchange.
Asia-Pacific. Constant dollars sales were down 4%. We are making steady progress in the Philippines, but the region
was negatively impacted by weakness in China. In China, our transition to a direct selling model is facing greater than
expected challenges. Defining Avon China's long-term strategy will be a critical priority. Operating margin in
Asia-Pacific was down due to lower volume leverage and higher bad debt expense.
Moving to cash flow. Operating activity used $33 million of cash during the first quarter compared to the use of $32
million in the first quarter of 2011, which included a pension contribution and a higher management incentive plan
payout. During the quarter, we made progress on inventory, with a three-day improvement in operational dates. I would
note that internally we are driving a stepped-up focus and accountability on working capital and we're looking at
additional process changes to further reduce inventory in the future.
Additionally, we have directly tied a portion of the 2012 annual bonus plan to cash generation. Net cash used in the
quarter was $30 million which compares with$165 million use in last year's first quarter, due to lower debt repayment
and a $44 million benefit related to the termination of two of our interest rate swap agreements.

So now let me give you some more color on what we have been doing to improve since we last spoke to you in
February. As I said on the call, our business review is focused in three key areas: revenue, cost structure and cash
generation. Additionally, we have been evaluating tactical organizational changes to increase decision-making speed
and relevance, enhance accountability and eliminate duplication. In quarter one, we reduced head count by
approximately 100 positions, resulting in a $21.8 million restructuring charge. We anticipate further head count
reductions and associated charges in Q2 as we extend the focus of our organizational review from corporate functions
to regions.
Let me give you three examples of our organizational changes we made in quarter one. First, we are downsizing
corporate functions and moving consumer-facing decisions closer to market in marketing, sales and analytics. In
parallel, we are retaining lean corporate centers of excellence to sustain the functional capabilities we have built
through the global matrix. For example, in global sales we have moved all sales incentive development in-market while
maintaining a small compensation center of excellence which we will use to leverage across the company.
Second, in Europe we are consolidating our CEE and WEMEA divisions into one region. This should reduce costs,
simplify operations and standardize processes. It should also improve effectiveness as we move to six market-based
clusters, each with their own campaign planning capabilities to address specific consumer preferences. John Higson, an
Avon direct sales veteran of 28 years, will lead Europe. As a result of these changes, in Q2 we will begin to report
Europe as one segment.
Third, in supply chain regional leaders who oversee supply planning, distribution and logistics will now report into
regional leaders instead of the corporate center. This move enhances commercial accountability for service and
inventory management while we maintain functional excellence and global standards through a corporate center of
excellence. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate process improvement opportunities to drive more agility into
our end-to-end supply chain.
Moving to the finance organization, let me give you some examples of some important changes to the finance
organization to improve accountability, enhance planning processes and upgrade talent development. First, we have
moved the reporting line of regional finance directors to me. Second, supply chain finance will now report into finance,
whereas it had previously reported to the supply chain organization. Third, we have established a dedicated financial
planning and analysis function to enhance our financial forecasting capability and business insights. SG&A and
Controller functions will be headed by separate individuals and this structure will be replicated in regions and major
markets.
In closing, we continue to face challenges as a company and it will take time to fix. But we have made progress in
identifying root causes and actions to be taken to stabilize the business and we have started to act in some areas. It is
worth remembering at this juncture that our brand is strong. The direct sales model continues to be strong and our
issues are fixable. I am pleased with the urgency with which we are addressing these issues, the level of engagement of
our associates and the ongoing commitment and enthusiasm of our representatives. All of that coupled with Sheri's
leadership gives me confidence in our future.
Now I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lauren Lieberman, Barclays Capital. Please state your
affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Barclays Capital. So, I just first wanted to ask about commodity costs, because
actually I just can't really recall a time that commodity cost was called out so dramatically in a release in the Q and was
such a big number. So if you can just elaborate on kind of what changed, what happened. And what's concerning about

that is that's not choiceful, right? The investments in SG&A and so on can be expected and have to do with stabilizing
the top line. The gross margin is what's throwing a lot of questions in my mind right now. Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, what I can say with regards to commodity costs is, obviously, we have longer-term
fixed contract costs in place. So we still have some lag coming through from the last year's commodity increases in
today's numbers.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of [ph] Bill Schmitz (24:04).
<Q>: Can you shed a little bit more color on the Latin American margin structure? I know you said that results in the
second quarter in the top line were probably going to be a little bit worse, but should we expect that same kind of
massive margin compression – like this is a new base to work from or was this quarter a little bit of an anomaly?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Well, I think I've said pretty much all I'm going to say with regards to quarter two. I mean,
we're not in a position today to give you the longer term with regards to where is the natural margin for the business.
With that said, as I said, we will have a couple items that will be impacting the Latin America margin, particularly in
Brazil going forward in quarter two. So but – at this point time, I am not going to provide a specific number with
regards to quarter two or the other quarters.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey, it's Bank of America. I guess the question is on margin again. Obviously, it was a pretty
poor margin performance as you guys called out. Can you talk at all or at least provide a little color around what the
short-term impact of stabilizing the business might be on this? In other words, are you throwing money at a number of
short-term problems? I mean, you've had a lot of management transition, a lot of external publicity that was bad. I'm
sure there are a lot of fires burning in the business. I mean, can you at least try to characterize qualitatively whether
there are costs or whether there are money – is money being thrown at that stuff in the near term that isn't necessarily a
sustainable expense?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Let me kind of walk through the margin a little bit for what we had in the quarter. So, as I
said, there were some expected items and some items that we were not expecting. So, on the expected side, we
expected some foreign exchange impact, the increased RVP investments, both in Brazil as well as in the U.S., and those
are investments that we expect to continue and we're engaging the representatives in Brazil and also as we're going
through the redistricting that's taking place in the U.S., so that continues.
We had wage inflation, particularly in Latin America, where we've seen double-digit inflation taking place there. And
then also we had the costs with regards to commodity and, while not always predictable, we did expect to have some
increases there. Not expected was the lower gross margins due to the product mix. While we were focusing on
increasing Smart Value, we had more Smart Value than we expected, and we also were impacted from slowing excess
inventory, particularly in WEMEA. And we will obviously continue to focus on improving our overall inventory levels,
but finding that right balance there with regards to the impact it has on margin and the impact it has on sales and the
impact we have on overall working capital is something we need to make sure we're getting the balance right there.
And what we did not expect was to have the higher bad debt provision in South Africa. So hopefully that gives you a
little bit more color as to what the items were in this quarter and obviously from there you should be able to get a feel
for which ones repeat or not. To your question, are we throwing money at issues? I wouldn't necessarily qualify it that
way. I would say, obviously, we're having to put money into rep satisfaction, particular in Brazil.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Kimberly, can you give us your updated thoughts on the dividend level here? It clearly
doesn't look like cash flow will cover the dividend this year and also Q1 came in worse than you expected and it sound
likes Q2 will see some weakness also. So can you talk about your commitment to the dividend level here and if you're
rethinking that?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, as I said before and I really believe this, that in principal the dividend should be
funded with the P&L, not with the balance sheet. The decision was made earlier this year to maintain the dividend for
2012. And going forward, Sheri and I will be reviewing to dividend in combination with the business strategy. And for
right now, I don't have additional updates. As I said, the decision was made earlier in the year to maintain the dividend
for 2012.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson, Citi Research.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. Just I think a follow-up to [ph] Bill's (29:12) question on Brazil. But can you say – I
think you said the competitive environment was intensifying there. Is that bricks and mortar or is it other direct sellers?
And then just housekeeping, can you break out the impact of currency on the Western European EBIT margins so we
could figure out how big a drag that was? But then, lastly and I apologize, the question regarding the decision to
collapse Western Europe and Eastern Europe, it strikes me – admirable from a cost savings perspective because maybe
you can eliminate a few heads, but from the vein of wanting to be more transparent, those are such different regions
and such different growth rates, I question whether that makes a lot of sense. Thanks
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Okay, maybe if I'll start with your last question. On the collapse of Western Europe, I think
a couple of things. First of all, as we look at supply chain, we were already running supply chain as a region. And so it
was actually creating a lot of complexity in the fact that they were having to deal with two different regions in Europe.
Also, what we've done here is actually while we combined it into one, but we are putting these fixed clusters which
allows us to get then closer to different markets and allows us to be able to group the markets in a – that are more
similar together, which should allow us to better service the representatives there and the ultimate consumer by
providing a more relevant product offering.
So I think on the cost side of this, yes, we eliminate some heads, but we also are able to get to more standardized
processes which takes complexity out of the business at the end of the day. And I would say that this is in line with
what some of our other competitors do overall. And we'll continue to give you color on some of the bigger points or
bigger highlights of the quarter and the individual markets. With regards to margin FX breakout, I'm going to allow
Amy to get back to you on that one.
<A - Amy Low Chasen>: It's actually a 70 basis points impact on the WEMEA margin.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: And then with regards to Brazil and the competition, I would say it's a bit of both. We do
have some entrants there that are expanding on the direct sales. But, obviously, bricks and mortar continue to expand
there, too. But with that said, I want to be very clear, direct sales remains very strong business model in Brazil.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan, Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yeah, thanks, good morning. A couple housekeeping questions. So Venezuela, 19% of
EBIT in the quarter. How much was that on a non-GAAP basis? And then could you explain a bit more about how you

revised the definition of RVP in terms of how to think about that number versus other puts and takes in SG&A going
forward?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, let me start with the RVP question. In the past – I think the main difference in the
definition is that now we'll no longer include some of the investments, primarily the large system investment that we
are doing in [ph] S&P (32:35). And the reason we changed the definition is to be able to align it more with how we
manage the business at the end of the day. And it just takes out some confusion I think internally and it also makes it
easier to be able to track this number back. I don't have the other number, particularly specifically on Venezuela, but I
will make sure that we'll get back to you on that one.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj, Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi, and, Sheri, welcome. How much independent due diligence were you really able to do before
taking this job? And how did you conduct it? Because, look, you specifically mentioned some secular changes to the
competitive environment, to the consumers, to the brand. Which leads to us, for what it's worth, those seem like secular
challenges, especially with how you engage with the consumer and the representative and the competition. And one
thing you didn't mention but you certainly must have thought of are FCPA and the free capital issues in Venezuela and
some of the other control issues. So I really wanted to get an understanding of your process before taking the job.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, certainly, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of the directors as well as
spend time with Andrea, and also had a lot of access to all public information. What I will say is, certainly, as I get into
the space and with my background in consumer, one of the other things that's most critically important is to be out with
the customer and be in the markets and continue to make sure that I'm engaged with that, looking at the total value
proposition. That's really where I will be spending my time.
Obviously, I'll be travelling to all of the different markets and being able to better understand the challenges ahead. One
of the things that was very apparent when I got here which really pleased me was the passionate outreach that I had
from the employees. I had dozens and dozens of e-mails from around the globe where people really were talking about
the model, how much they care about Avon and the company and also very clear about some of the challenges.
And so I recognize that we have challenges, I'm very realistic about what we need to do moving forward as it relates to
stabilizing the business, but I'm confident that we have a strong foundation on which to build. And that came through
early in my days and continues to weigh in and gets even stronger as I spend more days with the employee base of
Avon.

Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi, UBS.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yeah, good morning. Just a quick question on human capital. When you think about the fact that you,
Sheri and Kimberly, are new to the direct selling model, just curious what you're doing in terms of retention to keep
some of the institutional knowledge. If could just help address that question? Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, we did put a retention program in place earlier this year for key associates. So that is
something that we put in place and, obviously, trying to engage them and I think now with Sheri here also it will be
helpful in that should be able to spent some time with the different regions and set the strategy, which is always helpful
to employee engagement and retention at the end of the day.
<Q - Nik Modi>: And then just one quick follow-up for you, Sheri. I know it's early, you've only been there seven
days. But, I mean, as you look Avon today, are there any learnings from J&J that you can see are automatically

applicable as you look at the Avon situation?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, certainly, I've been involved with very complex businesses in the past in areas where
we had to either refocus the business or restructure. And I also know from a consumer background it is about getting
the value proposition right as it relates to the consumers and the representatives. But, certainly, what I think is most
critical is that we as an organization take a disciplined approach and put a plan in place where we really are focusing on
the four or five key priorities, making sure we have the right people in the right roles to drive the business and then
really holding people accountable and measuring our performance.
And regardless of the different areas that I've worked in, it's always about aligning the team towards those goals, and
that's really where I'll be focusing. It also goes to your point about retention. It's really about making sure that we have
everyone focused and motivated. To me, it's really the power of the people in the organization that will be critically
important moving forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty, BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning. Could you discuss a little bit about the increase in RVP in Brazil? I
think it was mentioned that you were working to increase rep satisfaction, but I don't know exactly what that means. Is
there a change in compensation? What's changing down there for the increase in RVP and what does it mean? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, it's just – what we've done is obviously as we had the service issues coming out of
the change in systems and the move to a different distribution center last year, we needed to put additional initiatives
and initiatives in place in order to reengage the representatives. So what we do is we're spending on, whether it be
different events or different incentives, in order to get the representatives back involved. Now, obviously, that on itself
is not the answer. It's also about bringing the excitement into the portfolio and getting our pricing right so we have a
value proposition.
One of the things, just to give you a bit more color, I mentioned that our pricing in Fashion & Home in Brazil became
rather uncompetitive, and so, therefore, it impacted the earnings proposition of the representatives there. So that
coupled with some of the service issues obviously means that we have some work to do to bring the representatives
back. And that is where we will apply some RVP dollars as well as enhancing the portfolio and the service in order to
reengage the representatives.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante, Consumer Edge.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone. And welcome, Sheri and Kimberly. You both made a statement
about conviction that Avon is fixable. And this implies two things, that basically you're going to come up with right
strategies but, more importantly, that you're going to have the financial flexibility to fix it. And when you have in North
America basically operating margins running at 1% and the overall company with operating margins at 3%, 4% do you
really think that – it doesn't seem that you're going to have that financial flexibility. So how is it that you feel that this
spreads confidence that Avon's situation is fixable? Thank you.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: As we said, Javier, 2012 is a year of transition for the company. I think there are tactical as
well as strategic issues that we need to address. Some of these things aren't necessarily requirement of investments, it's
just operational execution. Other things are simplifying what we do, getting speed to market. So I would say that there
are many things that we can address in order to fix some of the issues we are facing. That said, we also need to continue

to focus on getting costs down and we need to evaluate, in line with the strategy, what investments we need to make,
whether it be in systems or in other initiatives in order to get the company back to a position of growth. So that's
something we will be looking at, obviously, now with Sheri on board as she gets her feet on the ground, and evaluating
as we go forward.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: As a follow-up on the financial flexibility, I welcome, Kimberly, a distinction between RVP
spending that is essentially IT spending versus compensation. There had been a lingering question for many years with
regards to how big this line item is. We only know that the company has spent $550 million in incremental RVP, which
came on top of whatever was prior to 2005. Could you let us at least know in terms of trying to value the company and
assess that flexibility, how much is the total RVP spending as it stands right now? Thank you.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: We'll take your comment on board, but that's not something that we're going to disclose at
this point of time. As you can image, that's quite a competitively sensitive number.
Operator
Your next comes from the line of Alice Longley, Buckingham Research.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: Hi, good morning. Sheri, my question is a broader question for you in response to a
couple of things you've said. Avon has done study after disciplined study for years to determine what consumers want
and what reps want for Avon. What can you do differently to do better at that? And the other question is, looking at
Avon so far, do you think Avon is sort of stuck structurally selling a low-priced product line and yet reps want higher
and higher compensation that maybe the product line can't finance? Can you comment on that, too? Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Alice, obviously, it's early days for me coming in. I think one of the things that's critically
important is that I take a fresh look at all aspects of the business and really challenge what we've been doing and
making sure I fully understand are we fully understanding the value proposition which involves what is the appropriate
portfolio, what is the appropriate way to incentivize our representatives, and continue to look at that, making sure that
they have the tools to make them successful.
So at this point, it's hard for me to give you more color on that until I get out in the markets in the next several weeks.
Through June I'll be travelling all over to meet with people and spend time and also will be going through some of the
diagnostics that are already in place and making sure I have a better appreciation for that, and then determine what are
the appropriate next steps.

Your next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser, Caris.
<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Hi, it's Caris & Company. Can you, Kimberly, can you tell us, you have said that there
would be $100 million favorable swing on operating cash flow for the year due to various things. Can you say how
much of that swing favorable, if any, came in the first quarter? Because, obviously, it was offset by lower earnings so
the cash flow, therefore, wasn't better. But can you quantify how much of the $100 million, if any, came in the first
quarter?
And then, secondly, I think investors have been concerned with Avon's cash flow and the idea that the earnings level is
not more equal to the cash flow level and that there needs to be some kind of resetting of the earnings level. Can you
give us some qualitative comments about how much of the bad earnings we're seeing now is truly investment to kind of
stabilize the business versus a resetting in some way of earnings level due to whatever you may be finding. I mean if
you could just kind of qualitatively discuss that, I think that would be very helpful. Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, first off [indiscernible] (45:00) looking at the cash flow. So what I said is that last
year we had $100 million that would not repeat this year and most of that is in quarter one. So it was pretty much for

the full amount there. I understand the need and the desire to have a feeling for rebasing and where is the base, but what
I can tell you at this point is we are in a year of transition.
And so, at this point in time, are there some investments that we are making that will not repeat themselves? Yes, that's
probably the case. But there are probably some other investments that we will want to make going forward that at this
point in time I just can't give you a feel for until we sit down and we work through what the strategy is going to be
going forward. With regards to – I think I provided my comments on the dividend; obviously cash is something that's
very important to us.
As I said, we're tying even a portion of our bonus incentives to cash this year and we're working on improving the
working capital situation. So as we work through fixing some of the items, we will then get a better feel coupled with
the strategy as to where the new base is going to be. So I hear your need for it, but I just at this point of time, I couldn't
or I'm not going to give the current view on what the rebase would be, if any.

Your next question comes from the line of Leigh Ferst, Wellington Shields.
<Q - Leigh Ferst>: Good morning. Welcome, Sheri, and welcome, Kimberly. My question is about the management
changing. Clearly, having two top leaders in new positions can be disruptive. It's, obviously, also an opportunity for a
culture change. And you've mentioned some of things that you're thinking about. I'm wondering if you've considered
anything like amnesty for people who come forward to help you investigate and resolve some of your problems like
corruption. Because it can help resolve the issue and also be a tool in leading to culture change.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, I think certainly as we look at building for the future, one of the most important
things is to have engagement of our employees and making sure that as a management team that we are approachable,
that we are asking the right questions, that we are staying focused on doing what's right. I think I mentioned in my
opening comments that I am holding myself to very high standards and I will hold every employee to high standards.
And what that means to me is being clear about what's happening. If people have questions about what they should or
shouldn't do, they should feel very free coming to me or any member of the executive committee.
We need to be out and be visible and by approachable, particularly as we're driving change. I think it's very, very
important for us as leaders to make sure that we are accessible and helping people be part of the solution because it is
about aligning as a team and making sure that we can continue to be very proud of what we do in each and every day.
And I'm confident based on my early reads of the organization and the great notes that I've had with people from
personal stories about what's working, what's not working, what they'd like to see me fix. And then I think that's
something, a culture that we need to continue to drive throughout the organization.
<Q - Leigh Ferst>: Thank you. And as follow-up, can you give us an idea when you might be ready to give a strategic
update?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, certainly, and I know you're anxious and I certainly appreciate that. But I also want
to make sure that I have time to listen and hear what's happening in the markets to make sure that I understand what
we've done, what we haven't done and be very clear about what are the five or six things that we think are critically
important and, at the same time, be equally clear about what we're not going to do. And so certainly I will be able to
give you more perspective on where I am in the process on our next call. And as soon as we are ready to give you
more, I will be there because I think it is important that we have ongoing transparency and dialogue about how we're
thinking about the business.

<Q - Victoria L. Collin>: Hi, good morning, Kimberly. My question relates to the Active Rep growth in North
America. I noted that you said that the top reps were performing well and you were getting an increased average order.
But can you comment a little bit on the underlying trend given the rep declines despite your increased RVP support and
spending? And actually, secondly, I've got a question on China. Given this is a transition year, are the issues in China
related to sort of rebasing and rightsizing the platform, or is there something else either operational or structural that's
going on in that market? Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Okay, let me start with the U.S. As I said in my speech, we are seeing some positive
indications taking place, especially in the top tier of the representatives. But we have seen some disruption in the lower
base of the representatives. And I think part of this is because there has been, obviously, a significant change taking
place here and the communication and some of the emphasis has been more on the top-tier representative versus those
in the lower tier.
So that is a lesson learned that we will be taking as we go from the Western redistricting into the Eastern redistricting,
and something even, for example, that that our operational folks have said that they've learned is that for the district
folks, they should have given them a new map earlier to see what their new regions are. So there are lessons learned
that are being taken to the East in order to get that energy there and make sure that that any confusion that's lying in this
whole redistricting that's taking place is at least mitigated.
As you can imagine, with such a large change taking place, it's difficult to really give you a feel for – this isn't a change
that's taking place in a linear form. So it would be difficult right now to really say that we have a trend per se. I think
that's something for a later day as we go through it. What I will say though is I'm very encouraged with the first signs
we're seeing coming out of the strategy. The team in the U.S. have really done a great job laying out the project
management of this strategy change. And they have spent endless hours on the execution, including just this last
weekend they took the systems down in order to make all the adjustments for the Eastern part of the redistricting. And
I'm proud to say that the system came out actually earlier than we anticipated with all the changes in place. So a lot of
effort taking there, and I think a really good job. But with that said, we don't have a trend as of yet.
If we then look at China, I'll remind you that while China is not a large contributor to our business today, it is an
important market for us. And if you see our results, we clearly need a fresh lens on the business. We have new
management there on the ground and they're looking at the underlying issues. And also, Sheri will be visiting soon in
China. I was there recently. So I think looking at this with a fresh lens and looking at what has been working and what
clearly has not been working is important to figure out the path forward on China. So more to come on that one.
<Q - Victoria L. Collin>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Your final question comes from the line of Jason Gere, RBS (sic) [RBC] (55:55) Capital Markets.
<Q - Jason M. Gere>: Okay, thanks. It's RBC. Sheri, I just – I guess I had two kind of questions just kind of picking
your brain a little bit. One, coming from a consumer background where advertising was the lifeblood, just thinking
about coming to a company where you've seen a shift downward, I mean, more to RVP, less to advertising, are you
comfortable kind of with the levels that they are today? Or do you think that this is a business that should need more
advertising going forward?
And then the second question, also thinking about Avon as a company that's been in constant restructuring for the last
seven years, what's your view on a larger scale, broader-based restructuring as a way to kind of get – reenergize the
company and kind of make the right investments? Thanks and best of luck.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thank you. First of all, on the advertising question, it's really too premature for me to have
a perspective on that. As I've worked across different businesses throughout my career, whether it was devices,
pharmaceuticals, consumer, the most important thing is trying to understand the drivers of the business. And so what I
will be doing is spending time understanding the RVP equation as well as advertising and be able to give more

perspective at a later date.
As it relates to restructuring, the most important thing is to really get out and understand the operating model and
understand where people are, the teams, the regional teams and then come back with a better perspective on what
makes sense to be able to drive for the future. Obviously, the organization has undergone some significant changes.
And so I think what we need to be focused on is how do we stabilize and making sure that people are clear around their
accountabilities. I'm not sure that our overall restructuring makes sense; it may be just a better alignment of how we're
going about driving the business. And that's something that I will take a fresh look at as I'm out in the regions and
spending time with the global teams throughout the organization. And, in closing, I'm delighted to be here and look
forward to connecting with you in the very near future.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, I just wanted to add one more comment just on the restructuring. We had – obviously
in quarter one, we took a restructuring, and it's not a restructuring program like we've taken in the past, and you will see
size and magnitude was small relative to what we've seen in the past. So, obviously, continuing to look at where we can
get costs out and if there are cost associated with that, then we should take that as long as the payback is there. So we'll
see a bit more of that going into quarter two, as I said earlier, as we work into the region.
And just one other thing before closing, I wanted to come back to a question, I think it was [ph] Bill (55:55) that asked
it at the beginning with regards to Latin America. And I felt like maybe I didn't give you a strong enough answer, so I
just want to come back to that to give you a little bit more color. You had asked about the overall what was happening
in Latin America. And so I just want to talk about some of the drivers there. As we look at Venezuela and Mexico, we
had growth rates that were a bit lower than in Q4. And Mexico is lapping a very strong 2011, but it's still in a really
good position. Venezuela obviously continues to have quite a bit of inflation and it is a challenging market. So, with
that said, so far we've only had price controls on about 10% of the products that we have there.
Just on Colombia, we continue to face some competition there that has been quite intense and that has been impacting
our orders. And as a result of that, we began with a lower-than-expected rep base. Argentina, one of the other things
that we're facing there is that we've had some government import restrictions and at first this impacted us quite a bit
because it was both on finished goods as well as on some of the components. And this caused a high level of shorts,
which obviously impacted our units in the quarter.
We have moved to more local sourcing, so things should be improving there. But as I said in my notes, that we expect
to continue to have some impact there. And then also we might have, since the Fashion & Home items are items that
we cannot import, we're having to move to the local sourcing there. So we don't expect that it will have a major impact
going forward, but we still have to prove that out since we are changing what we're doing there. So, hopefully that
gives you a little bit more color on what is going on in Latin America.
So, with that said, I would like to thank everybody. Really excited to have Sheri here. And we look forward to talking
to you more in the future.
