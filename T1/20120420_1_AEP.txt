Thanks, Chuck. And thank you everyone for joining us today on AEP's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. It's been a
great quarter for us. I think from an overall viewpoint, AEP has done very well in terms of financial performance. We
delivered GAAP ongoing earnings of $0.80 a share, which is positive given the significant headwinds of the mild
weather, low natural gas prices impacts on all system sales, and the Ohio customer switching. It sort of demonstrates
the value and the diversity of AEP's service footprint and our ability to control costs to respond to these headwinds.
Industrials continue to improve, and while commercial and residential still struggle, I think it's an indication of the
economy and how much of an issue it is with the recovery of the economy at this point in time. And I think as we
progress, though, there is some fundamentals within AEP's service territory, primary metals and oil and gas activity,
that are contributing to a positive success for our territories.
With that said, we can't reaffirm guidance because of the significant area of risk involving the Ohio situation and the
transition of competition, which I'll discuss in more detail a little bit later. But even with the Ohio risk, we're still
committed to our long-term strategy we set out for you on February 10, namely movement to competitive environment.
We'll continue to move to that competitive environment in Ohio; we're embracing it; we support it with the corporate
separation that goes along with it in the formation of our competitive generation in retail and marketing functions.
Our investment in our regulated businesses obviously will continue as well. Our focus on the growth aspects and
repositioning of the company around transmission in other growth areas will be significant. The dividend strength is
still provided and secured by the regulated businesses and we have a continued commitment to the 4% to 6% long-term
earnings growth rate that we've discussed in February 10.
The transformation of our generation resources in response to the market EPA mandates is going to be an opportunity
for us, because we will deploy capital to do that, and we've seen the latest EPA rules, and Mark McCullough in our
generation area certainly has worked out a capital path that makes sense for us going forward.
So we've made progress in the first quarter on several fronts. On March 7 we issued $800 million of TCC transition
funding bonds at an attractive average interest rate of 2.28%, which compared favorably to similar recently priced
deals. Proceeds of the bond issue were used to fund the capital program, reduce TCC debt and contribute to the
pension, which is now 90% funded.
On March 8, we completed the acquisition of BlueStar Energy, the retail organization based in Chicago that
participates in deregulated retail markets and provides energy services, such as DSM-type activities. Integration of
BlueStar with AEP retail is progressing very well and is on schedule, and we now have over 100,000 customers and
growing quickly in that area.
I'm pleased with the progress in our reposition of the Transmission business. Earnings in Transmission continued to
improve, and with the recently announced Transource JV with Kansas City Power and Light and Great Plains Energy
and our continued formation of Transcos in our service territory, we continue to deliver more near-term projects to
achieve the critical mass for future growth.
Transource is an addition to the capital plan. We believe that it was a great project for us. It shows that critical mass in
the near term on the joint venture. Although there's not much spend in the first two years, it really does pick up in 2014,
2015, 2016. So that graph that we provided for you back in February that had sort of a dampened look toward the later
years, as we represented, was really based upon firm known projects with little risk, and we wanted to show it that way.
And now with the addition of Transource, you're going to see that portion of it sort of kick up in those later years as
shown in that graph. So that's important for us to start that critical mass and see that transmission investment continue
to grow.
The reason why we did the Transource deal was to pursue competitive transmission development projects in the advent
of Order 1,000 for – certainly wanted to set the tone for competitive transmission going forward. And it was important
for us to really put together an engine for that future growth. And we saw certainly from the Great Plains perspective a
near-term project that could provide ability for us to put that critical mass in place and really give us an advantage
going forward in the marketplace in the competitive access area. And it also is on the interface of MISO and SPP, so
that provides some future prospects for us. And as well, it focuses on other state footprints like Missouri and Kansas.

So overall it is a very good thing; Great Plains is a great partner for us, and one that we're happy to have involved with
the transmission business with us.
Our generation transformation activities continue in response to the market and EPA rules. We now have 4,600
megawatts that will be retired over a time period really detailed by the EPA rules end of 2014, but that could change
based upon the extension years and also it could change because of the market. So we're staying pretty flexible on when
the retirements would actually occur based upon a resolution of some of those issues. But the 4,600 megawatts is a little
different than the 6,000 megawatts we had mentioned to you previously at the time of the February 10 deal that we had;
6,000 megawatts. If we take out four and five, which we've already retired and then the Big Sandy activity, that gets
you to the 4,600 megawatt number.
But the current view is that, from a capital standpoint, there's a capital plan worked out even with the aggressive EPA
schedule. And certainly we want to be able to mitigate costs to our customers as much as we can during this process. So
we continue to be active on coming up with legislation that provides for more of a blanket extension of time to really
give customers time to make that adjustment. And for us, when we retire these plants, the communities involved, the
taxes involved, the socioeconomic factors involved need to be dealt with in a very positive fashion. And by replacing
generation, by coming up with other alternatives, these communities can adjust to that and I think that's important for
us as we deal with an economy that is where it is today.
Turk construction is now 90% complete. We're moving along very well in that prospect, getting Turk done by the end
of the year, and rate cases are being prepared to support that investment as well.
So I have to admit, while I've been pleased with the progress of transmission and generation and many of our regulated
operating company activities, my time has been spent here in the first quarter and before personally consumed by the
ongoing events in Ohio as we move to a competitive environment.
I'm sure all of you have followed this closely, and I can't talk too much about what's going on because of the ongoing
hearings in the capacity case, but without regurgitating the history of the capacity and ESP cases in Ohio, I'll give you
my take on the subject. This is a case where AEP is asking for what other utilities in Ohio have been previously
granted: a fair and reasonable transition to competition that maintains the ability for competitors to compete, but
maintains the financial integrity of AEP while we unwind some of the commitments that have been made; specifically
contracts with PJM for support of FRR-related capacity for our customers and the Eastern Pool Agreement, the
agreement that takes the transfer of capacity and energy among the companies in our Eastern footprint.
We need time to unwind those type of arrangements and those commitments have been made previously with the
concurrence of the Commission, and certainly we'd like to unwind those in a very rational way. The ESP plan that we
filed on March 30 balances the interests of what we believe are the three main interests of the commission. We tried to
be responsive to the concerns related to the previous stipulation and provide a clear path to competition with basically a
hybrid of the approach of the stipulation, but adjusted with more Duke-like characteristics, such as energy-only
auctions leading to an earlier, about six-months, full auction and a transition charge due to the retail stability rider.
So our plan is balancing these three areas, and I call it the 3 Cs: Customers, Competition and the Company. Customer
rates have been adjusted to mitigate the concerns of the low-load factor customers with a more moderate application of
the rate increases over all classes of customers. And discounted capacity rates have been put in place that allows for
competitors to successfully compete. We've shown that customers are indeed switching at the proposed $255 per
megawatt day rate. And the company's financial integrity is maintained through the transition period, tied to a utility
rate of return that puts us back in the position basically of the December stipulation.
So if you visualize a triangle with these three areas at each corner, there is a balance. And if you move capacity rates
down, you're only lining the pockets of the competitive suppliers at either the customers' expense or the company's
expense. And if it's at the customers' expense, the retail stability rider has to increase, causing higher increases in
customer rates, and that's probably not a good outcome. And if it's at the company's expense, it's tantamount to taking
capacity value that the company has committed for a three-year period to PJM to run and giving it to competitors to
subsidize the acquisition of our customers, which sort of seems a little bit un-American to me. It's really not

competition. It's more confiscation.
So there is a balance that has been struck with this plan that I would hope the PUC will support. I know there has been
much discussion about AEP's legal options, but I would much rather see this case resolved through an acceptable order
of the commission so that we can all move forward with clarity around the execution that we spoke of on February 10.
The capacity case is ongoing as we speak, and the procedural schedule for the ESP case has been established that has
oral arguments in early July, with a decision thereafter.
So it's been a very good quarter considering the headwinds that exist with the economy, and AEP will remain focused
on the execution of the areas we previously mentioned on February 10.
Now I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian X. Tierney
Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll explain the quarter-on-quarter variances to last year's
results, provide some color on load and the economy in AEP service territories, give some insight into coal and gas
switching, provide an overview of AEP's capitalization and liquidity and then get to your questions as quickly as
possible.
Turning to slide four, for the first quarter of this year, as Nick mentioned, AEP earned $389 million or $0.80 per share
in ongoing earnings versus $392 million or $0.82 per share for the first quarter of 2011. Weather accounted for a
negative comparison to last year of $0.12 per share or $87 million. Overall, heating degree days were down 31% versus
last year and 29% below normal, as this was the second mildest winter in the last 30 years for the AEP system.
Customer switching in Ohio accounted for a negative comparison to last year of $0.06 per share or $42 million. This
reflects a year-on-year decrease of total retail generation margin and is associated with AEP Ohio's total retail load that
had shot by the end of the quarter up 28%.
As you remember, in Q1 of last year, we were collecting provider of last resort charges in Ohio end of June. The loss of
Ohio POLR revenues versus last year accounted for a negative quarterly comparison of $0.05 per share or $39 million.
On the positive side, transmission operations contributed a positive $0.01 per share or $5 million. This reflects
increased earnings from Electric Transmission Texas. You will continue to see growth and investment in earnings from
ETT and our Transcos as we put dollars to work to enhance reliability and system efficiency for our customers. Rate
changes, reflecting increased investment in our regulated utility operations, accounted for a positive comparison to last
year's first quarter of $0.08 or $63 million.
Finally, operations and maintenance reductions accounted for a positive comparison to the first quarter of last year of
$0.11 per share or $80 million. This reflects a combination of spending discipline in the face of weather and other
earnings challenges, as well as a reversal of a regulatory obligation that was previously recorded.
Turning to slide five, you will see that our weather-normalized residential and commercial sales were lower than prior
year, while our industrial sector continues to show improvement, as Nick stated earlier. Overall, weather-normalized
sales were down 0.4% for the quarter, reversing a seven-quarter positive trend that was largely driven by the increase in
industrial sales.
Although our residential and commercial sales were down for the quarter, a number of economic indicators are
showing improvement within our service territory. First, the economy in AEP service territory is growing faster than
the U.S. economy and faster than it did in 2011. Real GDP growth for AEP service territory in the first quarter of 2012
is estimated at 4.4% compared to estimated U.S. growth of 2.2%. AEP's 4.4% growth compares favorably to that of the
first quarter of 2011 of 2.8%. In addition, the unemployment rate in AEP service territory is lower than it's been since
the start of the recession, at 7.9%, and lower than the U.S. unemployment rate for the quarter of 8.2%. We noted that
earlier this week the four-week moving average for U.S. unemployment claims rose slightly. We hope this is not a new
trend for an economy that has been showing signs of improvement.

The employment growth rate for AEP's footprint was better in the first quarter of this year than it was for all of last
year, with employment growth in the west part of our system at 2.3% beating the U.S. rate of 2.1%. Employment
growth for the quarter in the east part of our system was only 1.5% but still exceeded the growth rate for the region for
last year.
Contrary to this positive economic data, we should note that AEP's combined east territories residential customer
account was down 0.20% for the quarter, but that was more than offset by a combined west residential customer
account that increased 0.60%. We are hopeful that the economic outlook will continue to improve and translate into
improved electricity sales in the near term.
Turning to slide six, we'll look at the top five sectors in our industrial customer class. Primary metals, AEP's largest
industrial sector, is up 4% for the quarter-on-quarter period. If you exclude Ormet, our largest customer, which returned
to full production in the first quarter of last year, primary metals were up 1.2% quarter on quarter.
Chemicals and mining were both down for the quarter, but both sectors have shown quarter-to-quarter volatility
throughout the recovery. The paper industry as a whole has been slowly declining over the past several years. As more
aspects of our daily life become paperless, this trend is likely to continue.
In addition to the sectors depicted on this slide, the transportation equipment manufacturing sector, AEP's seventh
largest, is up 5.5% quarter on quarter and is being driven by improvements from a number of customers located
primarily in the Indiana and Michigan and SWEPCO service territories. This corresponds with the fact that U.S. auto
sales in the first quarter were the highest they'd been since before the recession.
The oil and gas extraction sector, AEP's ninth-largest industrial sector, is up 6.7% quarter on quarter and is being
driven by developments in the shale gas areas of our service territory, primarily the Eagle Ford development in Texas
and the Marcellus development in the East. These increases are coming mostly from gas processing facilities, some of
which have come online and others of which are still in development.
Turning to slide seven, I want to talk a little bit about the coal to gas generation switching that has occurred on AEP's
system and the outlook for the future. First, it is easy to see that coal-fired net capacity factors have decreased, while
gas-fired net capacity factors have increased. This result is more pronounced in the east part of our system, where
natural gas capacity is 14% of the total, versus the west, where it is 62%. In the east net capacity factors for natural gas
units increased to 47% in the fourth quarter of 2012 from 22% in the first quarter of last year.
Coal-fired net capacity factors correspondingly have dropped to 47% from 61%. The result is even more pronounced
when you focus on our east combined cycle plants, which reached net capacity factors of 78% in the first quarter of this
year, up from just 17% from the same period last year. If you were to exclude the new Dresden combined cycle facility,
which came online at the end of January of this year, the east combined cycle capacity factor climbs to 85%. East
combined cycle generation increased fully 149% quarter on quarter.
So what does all this mean? With our east combined cycle fleet operating at such a high capacity factor, we would
expect the rate of coal to gas switching to remain about the same through the balance of year; that is, most of our
combined cycle gas units are running close to flat out.
With our gas consumption and gas generation up and with the mild weather that we've experienced, our coal
inventories have climbed to 45 days full-burn inventory at the end of the quarter from 39 days at the end of last year.
We expect inventories to climb over the second quarter, and just as we've managed our inventories during the
recession, we'll continue to do so now. All of that being said, our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged, and our needs
for 2013 are about 80% met.
Turning to slide eight, let's take a look at the company's capitalization and liquidity measures. First, GAAP total debt to
total capitalization remained unchanged from last quarter at 55.3%, but the quality of that metric has improved, as we
added $800 million of AAA-rated debt to the balance sheet as we executed our Texas Central securitized debt offering
in March.

Securitization financing reduced costs to TCC's customers versus traditional financing and brought a significant cash
contribution to AEP. In addition, in February SWEPCO issued a $275 million 10-year unsecured note at an attractive
rate of 3.55%. Second, at the end of the first quarter, our credit metrics remained solidly BBB. AEP's FFO to interest
coverage stands at 4.7 times and our FFO to total debt is at 20%. During the quarter, Fitch reaffirmed AEP's ratings and
Moody's reviewed and left unchanged their ratings for the company in several subsidiaries.
Turning to liquidity, our sources included our core revolving credit facilities and cash on hand, which together totaled
approximately $3.5 billion. Our uses of liquidity included commercial paper and letters of credit, which together totaled
approximately $500 million. When netted against one another, the company's liquidity at the end of the first quarter
was nearly $3 billion.
Lastly, our pension obligation was funded at 90% at the end of the first quarter. This is an improvement from 86%
funded at the end of the year in 2011. As our pension funding approaches 100% through improved investment returns
and past significant corporate contributions, we are de-risking the investment portfolio. At the 90% funded level, our
portfolio asset targets are 40% equities, 10% alternative investments and 50% fixed income.
As you can see, the platform is strong as we seek a positive ESP order and transition to retail competition in Ohio. As
Nick noted earlier, due to uncertainty in our Ohio regulatory outlook, we are unable to affirm our previous earnings
guidance for 2012 at this time. As a management team, we are committed to an earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% and a
dividend level supported by our regulated earnings.
Thank you for listening today. And with that, Linda, I'll turn it back over to you to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from ISI Group. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I got a couple questions. First, can you comment on the staff position that was recently filed in
your capacity case, which I know is separate from you ESP filing? I know that they made some opinions on what they
felt was sort of a fair capacity rate, and while I know that that's completely independent from the ESP case, I'm
wondering if we can take anything from that as it might – as the ESP case unfolds.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, well, the capacity rate they came up with was actually pretty reasonable. It's the
adjustments I guess that there are some concerns with. And we expect to get the work papers here Friday and that'll be
helpful to us in terms of determining how exactly they came up with those numbers. But since that case is – the
hearings are ongoing now, I'd be hesitant to speculate on it, but certainly we'll review that and see what the effect will
be.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Right. But it appears that they've come to the conclusion that your sort of Tier 1 capacity rate
seems reasonable, but they didn't opine on the level of your sort of Tier II – what a Tier II capacity rate might be. Is that
fair or unfair?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Greg, I think the $145 that they netted to is clearly below what we'd view as acceptable. I
think the $255, which is – and they had something close to that on an adjusted basis before they took some adjustments
that were probably overstepping, is probably closer to what we'd consider to be reasonable.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, great. And then the second question, where do you stand in your current pending FERC
filing and when is the expectation that we might or might not get a decision on that case?

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: On the FERC capacity case you mean, Greg?
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Yes, correct.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, that capacity case is in and we're waiting on the FERC response to it. And we're
obviously unable to tell when FERC would actually render an order, but the case certainly is there and ready for them
to render an order.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.
Operator
Thank you. Next we'll go to line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, good morning, guys. I guess there's so much going on in Ohio in the quarter as far as ESP
on and off. Can you just help detail what would have gotten picked up in first quarter results from kind of the ESP plan
and what the reversals were kind of around costs and that sort of stuff that affected the first quarter results?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Do you have that data, Brian?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: I do. So Dan, obviously we've detailed what the customer switching is and that's reflective of
current capacity prices that are in play. There was some pickup in transmission operations on slide 11, as we picked up
some of the – they're paying us for generation and transmission. And some of that migrates to line 11 – or I'm sorry, the
transmission line on slide 11. And then of course we noted in O&M a previously recorded regulatory obligation that
has to do with about the $35 million partnership with the Ohio component. So it's really those pieces; it's the customer
switching and the partnership with Ohio component.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess, Nick, you talked about comfort with the environmental CapEx plan, the
affiliated CapEx plan. With the amount of coal to gas switching you guys are seeing and the lower run rate on the coal
plants, are you reevaluating that plan one more time before making any firm decisions given the lower economic value
for some of [indiscernible] (27:31)?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, Dan, we continue to look at the options that we have available to us, and obviously
we've committed to capacity in PJM. So it's a matter of how much we have to utilize those units. And obviously they're
being utilized less. As Brian said, the capacity factors are much lower. So that gives us some optionality in terms of
how the units are operated during the year.
And then in terms of retirements, we're looking at the dates associated with those as well. You have the – and really it's
a question of whether you need the capacity and does it stay online to 2014 or 2015 or even 2016, but if the gas market
is lower and capacity becomes available then we'd have to look at those options as well. So we are looking at, on a
regular basis, what those options can be.
I was just saying in the worst case, it appears that we're okay from a capital perspective. And then if we do get
extensions or if we decide to convert to gas in some fashion with gas burners or whatever we'll have that optionality to
do it. So it's really a capacity and energy question.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess, Brian, just one last question on the cost management. Of the 80, the 35 was
a reversal and kind of 45 was better cost management. Is that something we can continue to expect will happen on a
quarterly basis for this year or were there some things that kind of pulled out that we'd assume more of a normalization
in costs?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Absolutely, Dan. I think you've always heard from us that if weather and off system sales and
regulatory aren't coming in as we had forecast they would for the year, and all three of those things are true for this
year, that we would manage our O&M accordingly. And so we are currently in the process of a) having cut some
significant components of O&M, but we're in the process of evaluating how we might do that more aggressively, not

just for this year, but really, as Nick has talked about in the past, trying to reposition the cost structure of this company
for the competitive environment that we're moving into.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, I think that's one basic tenet of the February 10 discussion we had around capital and
O&M discipline in response to the environment that we're in. There's no question that where we're at in the economy
and as we follow along with that, along with the other issues that we have ongoing, we have to be able to be flexible
from that spending standpoint. And again it's in the overall context of that repositioning of the company to those
growth areas, and we are very focused on during this year working on those activities. And we want to reinforce
resources for those growth areas and certainly at the same time evaluate the rest of the organization and make sure
we're being as responsive as we can to the operating companies, which really go to the operating company model.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Got it. Thank you, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Thanks, Dan.
Operator
Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: When you talk about your residential and commercial being down on a weather norm basis, is
that being distorted by shopping at all or is that deliveries versus kind of generation sold?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Paul, that's total connected load, so it's not being distorted at all by customer switching.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then your sixth sense is negative on switching. I think you've got 21 in the budget that you
laid out on February 10. Are we running to plan?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Quarter to date, Paul, we are, but so much of that depends on what happens with this ESP
case and particularly the capacity case. And if we get a negative outcome on the capacity case and we go to something
that looks like RPM, that could significantly accelerate shopping. And so the run rate for the year, given the uncertainty
that we face after June 1, is something that's certainly in question. And we wouldn't anticipate that you could just
extrapolate the year-to-date numbers and come up with a reasonable outcome without knowing what the capacity case
gets resolved at.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then lastly, when you say you're 80% hedged on your coal buy for 2013, that assumes the
same kind of fuel mix as you've kind of laid out in the first quarter?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, the same kind of fuel mix I think, 80% hedged – it's give or take because you're
obviously looking year into year at what the actual coal requirements are going to be. So we continually and we're
becoming more flexible in terms of our coal contracting to ensure that we do have the flexibility if natural gas prices
continue to be low, which we expect they will – that we'll be able to respond from a contractual standpoint.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Is the building of coal piles more a function of weather or fuel mix?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think it's both, weather and – it's weather and natural gas prices, because I guess one of the
beauties of our system, we bought 5,000 megawatts of gas in the last few years or built 5,000 megawatts. And it gives a
lot of flexibility in terms of maybe we have a low gas prices that are competing on a marginal basis with coal-fired
generation, then we can make those adjustments. What we're having to change obviously is sort of this black swan
event of natural gas prices is making us think about what the future coal contracting provisions will be so that we
ensure that they're flexible. Because there was always an assumption that coal was going to be lower than natural gas
and that's not the case. So we need to be flexible on both sides.

<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And now we'll go to the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Jonathan, morning.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Can I ask first on the sales numbers in Q1? Obviously the weather was particularly
abnormal and then this negative nearly 3% number you have normalized in residential, is that – how confident are you
that that's kind of a good reflection of real underlying usage or is the weather model just sort of thrown off by a very
unusual winter?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Jonathan, it's hard to tell at this point. If you look at that chart on slide five, you'll see there's
been some pretty extreme volatility in that residential number Q over Q. Second quarter of last year was up 4.4% and
then it went to moderately negative in the third quarter. So I think until we see a trend that we can hang our hat on we
really need to watch that data.
We don't see anything that is a give up the ghost on the residential customer count or usage for us, but obviously we're
watching that and we'll continue to watch that quarter to quarter. We don't like seeing it down, 2.8% versus last year.
But as you stated it is an extreme weather year and making sure that our weather normalization calculations are right
when you have such extremes as we're having right now, and to be frank with you as we had last year, you really need
to watch the trend over time.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So you're kind of leaving the full year forecast where it is till you get a little better
sense of the rest of the year?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Absolutely. That's right. That's right because even in today's dispatch, I think there was – in
the Columbus Dispatch, there was an article on housing sales and housing prices moving up. So it's a very sensitive
part of the economy right now, and when you look at it, we've had industrials, and as long as we have sustained
industrial pickup, you'll see commercials come back in and residential will obviously come back in as well, and I think
that's going to be positive for AEP.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And then if I could on another topic, you've obviously talked a lot about hires,
talked about positioning for a more competitive future. Can you talk a little bit about competitive activity outside of
your territory? How active are you guys able to be given the amount of focus I'm sure you have at home right now?
And obviously you've talked about a little about the BlueStar integration, but just what are you doing strategy-wise in
terms of going after margin and how – where would you describe yourselves on the trajectory of getting where your
business plan needs to be?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Jonathan, I'm pleased with the progress of the integration of BlueStar, and they are also
participating in Illinois markets, participating in other markets as well. As I said earlier, though, we want to make sure
that we're only participating in markets that we understand. And that would be primarily MISO and PJM-related
markets in Texas. We continue to pursue the – even getting a name for the company in Texas; I mean you can't name it
AEP, apparently. So we'd have to name it something else, but we're starting that business back up. And I think it's
important for us to make sure we take advantage of the back office systems of BlueStar, which was a major positive for
us in that transaction, and the people of BlueStar, we've been very pleasantly surprised that – not that it was a surprise,
but certainly the people involved have been very good for our business and have mixed very well with the AEP retail
people.
So as you said, there's a major emphasis right now on movement in the Ohio market and we're going to make sure that
happens, but also we'll continue to progress in these other markets as well. So I'm very happy with the progress there,
and remember, it's primarily put in place as a hedging activity for the anticipated generation to be separated in Ohio. So

we're very much getting prepared for that.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So you talked about this as a cost saving opportunity but isn't there a – are you not
going to have to add a whole load of people and capability and infrastructure?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No, we got a pretty significant number of people with the BlueStar acquisition, so it really
helped us from a marketing standpoint, but also from the back office and systems standpoint. And we want to make
absolutely sure that as we move forward that our back office systems are keeping up with the marketing systems up
front, so we can ensure the financial integrity of the business. And we certainly believe that there's margins to be made
out there. And when you look at the DSM activity and the other energy support services that can be provided, those
services provide margins as well. So I'm happy with the way that's progressing to really develop a platform for us for
the future.
That's one of the silver linings in all this. I mean, I think Ohio certainly wants to move to competition and we're moving
to competition; we support that and we support it because there's an opportunity, a real opportunity here to grow the
business in a different way. And we just need to make sure there's a transition that makes sense for us to get there, and
that's what we fully support.

Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Jim Von Riesemann from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Hi, good morning everyone, hope you can hear me.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Hey, I just have a quick question on clarification. Nick, did you say earlier that you're
affirming your 4% to 6% earnings growth or were you affirming your strategy to get to that 4% to 6%?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: We're still affirming our 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: How do you get there if you had to withdraw 2012 guidance?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, withdrawing – as far as the guidance is concerned, it really is determinative based
upon what the Ohio outcome is. So it depends on what base you're starting from. And I think you could still have
earnings growth focused on the regulated businesses, the other regulated businesses, including transmission,
distribution, all the operating companies, and also the additional transmission business, and that's really confirms the
growth rate. So that's – and then from an Ohio standpoint, you really do have to look at the risk involved with the case.
It's not a normal case. It's something that we're very focused on and that outcome will be determinative of what that
guidance range ultimately winds up being.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Okay, thanks. I just needed that clarification. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Hi, good morning, Nick. Just hopefully a quick question. We spent some time in
Columbus this week and kind of one of the takeaways was you had another filing of an ESP last week. I think there's
two other filings on, there's capacity filed – capacity proceeding. It seemed that most of the intervening parts if not all
including the commission are pretty fatigued dealing with all these ESPs and capacity and everything else. I mean is
this an opportunity for AEP to maybe reach a settlement? Maybe the parties – there are some tight budgets there,
people have the staff. Is this an opportunity maybe for AEP to reach a settlement with interveners regarding ESP and

the capacity filing?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I just think – we've been at this for over a year and a half and there's a lot of people with
fatigue about this case. And we would very much like to get this thing over with. I think if you had a recognition of the
other parties involved, that yes, AEP does have a transition; yes, AEP does have a unique situation with its pool
agreement and with the commitments made on behalf of the customers in PJM. Those are contracts that we need to get
out off.
And if given that time, there's an opportunity for settlement. But based upon the last scenario we went through with the
stipulation, it's pretty apparent unless there's some dramatic shift in the positions taken by some of these parties, it's
going to be very difficult indeed to get a settlement of the parties in this case. I think this is going to be a case where the
commission is just going to have to balance the interests involved and make a credible decision. And I think that's key
because if they do that then we get our cases filed at FERC again, we get moving along with all the precursors to move
into a full competitive environment with robust competitors and that's a tone, a positive tone that could be set for the
state.
So I think it's important for that to happen. I'm just skeptical whether there can be a settlement of all of the parties that's
delivered to the commission this time around.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And next we will go to the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning. Just building on the last question, you've laid out a potential timetable for a
resolution in Ohio. Just given what you're seeing today, could you talk a bit about just factors that could impact that
timetable and just general comfort with that timetable given the latest that you're seeing in terms of discussions?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think that – certainly we're committed to trying to get the case over with, and I think the
commission has also said publicly that they're focused on getting this case moved along pretty quickly. The procedural
schedule is set so that due process could be given to all the parties. But we also know that there's plenty of information
that's already been provided throughout the entire case. So I don't think there's anything new anybody's going to turn
over. There's no new rock to uncover here.
So it could give you ability to move along more quickly. I think that – I'm actually optimistic that the schedule will stay
pretty much intact because there's been plenty of time given for the parties based upon the issues that we've already
dealt with. I also believe that if you get a reasonable outcome in the capacity case or of FERC orders in the capacity
case, it could bring the parties closer together. And I just think that there are some major milestone precursors there, the
capacity rate in particular, that could have a benefit in terms of bringing the parties together. That's also an opportunity
for a quicker solution.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Thank you. And just following up on a different subject on coal hedging, you had mentioned
that you're fully hedged for 2012. Given what we're looking at in terms of the gas curve, which obviously continues to
fall, is there some possibility of essentially being overhedged? And how do you think about flexibility if you were to
need to reduce shipment deliveries, et cetera? Is there something where you have to deal with penalty payments or is
there quite a bit of flexibility here? Could you just talk a little bit to that?

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, Stephen, we have very good relationships with the coal suppliers that we have and
we're working through areas of flexibility that could exist. Also from a contracting standpoint we typically have a
varied mix of coal supplies long-term, short-term that can be managed. The issue that we have is that you have coal
that's specific to specific units and some inventories are low, some are higher, and we're looking at the possibility of
moving coals around to the various areas to mitigate the impacts of coal stockpile increases in the event natural gas
prices stay low. So all of those kinds of options are being considered and looked at and actively pursued.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay, great. And just where you look at today, is there a potential that the hedge level is
above the expected usage for the year? Or do you see it sort of essentially balanced?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, I think we will be okay, because obviously it all hinges on a long, hot summer, which
is what we usually hope for in this business. But if you have that kind of activity then we should be fine.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys, a handful of questions. One, we've talked a lot about the capacity case and the
ESP case. Can you talk about the deferred fuel case? It's a big number, $700 million plus of outstanding deferred fuel
balances. I don't remember the exact amount. How are you thinking about both the resolution of that case, whether it's
separate from or tied in to the capacity in ESP cases, and how do you get cash recovery, meaning, is it securitization, is
it over a long period of time? And also the impact on the customer bill because that's, like I said at the beginning, it's a
big number.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes. Of course we'd like to get it securitized and I think we have to get through the process
to make sure we can do that portion of it. You have the reg assets sitting out there and then you have the fuel sitting out
there – the fuel deferral. The reg assets appears to be a pretty clear path. The fuel issue we have to get through, but
Brian, you may have some more details on that.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes. So Michael, that's just in Ohio. We have a similar situation in APCo West Virginia
where we have nearly $400 million of deferred fuel that we are filing to securitize there and think we're on a faster
track to be able to securitize that close to $400 million than we are in Ohio. In Ohio the securitization law requires that
the fuel case be final and unappealable before you'll be able to securitize. So the amounts that we're looking at in Ohio
probably won't meet that threshold of having final orders until 2013, but we believe we could be there as early as this
year in APCo West Virginia with that $400 million.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And what's the total balance left, deferred fuel plus the capitalized interest on it on the
Ohio side?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It's about $500 million.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. One other question and a little bit unrelated to the fuel balance items – distribution
case. Is that also still separate from and how are you kind of thinking about how that also gets resolved? Or are you
kind of looking at, there's going to be some kind of global settlement in all four cases in Ohio come together?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes. The distribution case is pretty well done. And the ESP case really is. We still have the
DRR and those kinds of activities in there, but as far as the distribution case, it's done.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay, thank you guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Thank you, Michael.

Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Steve Fleishman from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Thanks. Just on the coal to gas switching data, the – following-up on one of the prior
questions; do you see any risk of [ph] force darn (49:41) of coal?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Or you think you have enough flexibility by the way you mentioned you don't need to do
that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No, we don't have any risk of [indiscernible] (49:48) there.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Steve, we didn't get there during the depths of the recession and we don't see the problem
being as acute as it was then, and so we just don't believe that's even in the cards.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, and also keep in mind, a lot of our contracts are relatively good compared to market
and rail rates are obviously good as well. So the coal that's actually running sits pretty well in the marketplace. And as
you go up higher in the stack and with the designer coals and so forth, that's where you run into those kinds of issues.
So we're flexible in that regard.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And I'm also just curious, I realize your western region has I'm sure much lower
coal to gas switching price points. Given that gas has continued to come down, is there a possibility that in the West we
see these numbers move much more?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I don't – you could see some movement, but typically you're constrained on coal in the
western footprint. The delivery cost of coal in our western footprint is very attractive because it's PRB coal with a good
contract, a good rail contract. So those – it'll be hard for natural gas to compete on a basis with coal in our western
footprint. And then from a natural gas perspective, you have older – many of the gas units are single-stage units with
higher heat rates, so you won't see them run as much as you would like a new [ph] commodity (51:28) cycle facility for
example.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then one last question on Ohio, it seems like at this point the capacity case is
going to run and be decided before the ESP; is that correct?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, we don't know the answer to that. It very well could be, but it could be part of the
ESP; we don't know at this point.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. So the schedule could get moved out so that they're decided more in line?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, and then you got to look at what FERC is doing as well, so that could play a part in the
picture too.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Okay, thank you.

<Q - Ali Agha>: Just wanted to clarify that the timeline – I know you've talked on that a number of times on this whole
Ohio issue. So one thing we do know is that you have temporary relief on the pricing on capacity that is there till June
1. But I know you'd asked to expedite the capacity case and the ESP case. Fair to say that that did not play out or is that
still a possibility? They're still looking at things July 3 and beyond. From your vantage point can you just lay out a little
bit again the chronology of events as you see this play out in Ohio?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, I think you do have a gap there between the end of May when the present capacity rate
drops off. And I think – you really have to go through the process of what the commission intended to begin with when
they put that in place. And our view is that that capacity rate was put in to keep the parties neutral – their independency
of all these other ESP cases going on. And there'd have to be in our opinion some mechanism put in place, whether we
request an extension of the soft gap measure that was put in place, or some other method. So we don't know exactly
how that would work out at this point. But certainly as May rolls around and we see the progress of the case, we'll be
making decisions on how we approach that with the Commission.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And also to be clear on your position on the capacity, Nick, I mean last time around you guys
were okay with the two pricing mechanisms where one was the PGM, RTO; the other was the fixed $255. I think
you've, if I'm not mistaken, have little different positions whether in the ESP or the capacity case where now you're
talking about just a non-PGM pricing related price. So just to be clear, what is your ideal position on how that capacity
should be priced during this transition?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think we have filed the two-step [ph] DOP (54:38) approach in the case and the $140
something rate was applied to those customers that already said that they would switch through the November
timeframe. And those customers that have already switched based upon that premise would be included – including
aggregation. And the $255 was placed there as a discounted rate. It's different obviously than the capacity rate that
we're after, the capacity case we're substantiating to $355 actual costs and we're doing the same thing in the PJM, but
this is – the capacity rate in those cases are discrete components of a larger case in the ESP.
So there's a lot of gives and takes within the entire model of the ESP. So that's where we can go to a $255 and $145
type of application on a tiered approach and it would still make sense and the overall sense with be stabilization charge
and those types of things. So that's really the context in which we presented those different capacity rates.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay, got it. And I know this is obviously an ongoing process, but any signals or signs that you can
share with us to suggest that the commission's views this time around may be any different from what played out last
time around?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: The only think I can say is I think we've addressed the hot button points that the commission
had expressed earlier. I can't say today where the commission is on the filling that we've made; only they can do that.
But when you think about the low load factor issue, we've addressed that. We've opened some portion up to auction –
energy auction and then going to a full auction even earlier than what was originally anticipated. And then also from
the capacity standpoint, I think we've fortified the record to show that switching is occurring at that higher-tiered $255
level. So I think we've done the things that we were asked to do and it's really – like I said it's up to the commission to
decide now.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Fair enough. And last question, also just clarifying your previous statement on the EPS outlook. So if
I'm clear what you're saying is once you've got clarity on the commission, the 2012 guidance, you'll come out with a
new number, but of that whatever that number is regardless of what the outcome is, you still believe 12% to 15%, 4%
to 6% EPS growth is doable?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Charles E. Zebula>: Thank you, Ali. Okay, one more question.

Thank you. And that will go to the line of Andy Bischof from MorningStar Financial. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Bischof>: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my call. In regards to BlueStar, you mentioned you had
about 100,000 customers. Can you remind me what the base was when the acquisition was announced?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: BlueStar had 22,000 customers as I remember and then AEP retail about 40,000 customers.
So they continue to make progress there.
<Q - Andrew Bischof>: Okay. And BlueStar has a pretty significant capacity in terms of servicing companies before
you have to add on to that backend capability curve?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Oh, absolutely. That's why we acquired BlueStar. And really they have some of the best
information systems relative to retail operations that we've seen and we obviously looked at several.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Andy, they were building that business for a much bigger scale than what they had, and the
management team over there, before we ever met them, had a very long view of what they wanted to do with that
business. And so they've been very thoughtful on how they put their systems together, how they put their infrastructure
together, and it was that planning and thoughtfulness that we wanted in the management team and the benefit of their
systems and long-range planning that we got with the benefit of with the acquisition.
<Q - Andrew Bischof>: Great. Thanks very much for taking my call.
