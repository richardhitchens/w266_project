Sherilyn S. McCoy
Good morning. I trust that you've had a chance to review our press release. The second quarter results are not good and
reflect the challenges we are working to address. Today I want to share my early impressions with you, provide my
perspective on Avon's current position and take you through an outline of top priorities for turning the company
around. After that, Kimberly will take you through Avon's second quarter results and our perspective on the remainder
of the year. And we will then open the line for Q&A.
Building trust with our investors and other stakeholders is extremely important to me. I will be very clear with you
today about the challenges Avon faces and our plans for addressing them. Today marks the 100th day since I joined
Avon. When I came on board in late April, I committed to taking a fresh look at every aspect of the company. I've by
no means completed my assessment, but I've spent enough time in the business to understand our key issues and start to
map out a path forward.
To get started, I conducted a review of the strategies, operations, and functions around the globe in order to frame and
understand Avon's situation. I visited major markets including Brazil, UK, China, Mexico, U.S., and the Philippines.
On each of these visits, I met with regional leadership and local management teams for in-depth business reviews, and
at each stop I spent time with Avon Representatives to hear directly from them what's working and what they need to
build their business. I also spent time with the North American field team and attended the North American district
managers meeting, which was a great introduction to the spirit and commitment our field team has to Avon.
I've seen key markets that are underperforming and I've witnessed firsthand the power of the Avon brand and sales
model in markets such as Mexico, where Avon is posting strong results. From all of this, I have one clear takeaway
about Avon's situation. It will take time, but we can fix this. I am confident that we can return Avon to growth. The
underlying dynamics in which we compete are very attractive. The direct selling model is extremely effective in many
markets and growing mid single digits globally, but we face complex challenges that have been developing for years.
Why did Avon's performance stall and how did we get to where we are today? There was not a single cause, and just as
important, there will not be a single solution. We had strategic missteps and challenges in execution and overall
performance. We lost focus on the basics, on Representatives and our core consumers. In a quest to improve operating
margin we moved to a higher end positioning. The product mix and pricing were off target. In some instances, we did
not stay competitive with the commercial sales model and Representatives' earnings were less attractive, which
weakened field health. We also did not keep pace with technology and service levels. And this resulted in challenges in
markets like Brazil. As a result of all of this, we have let down Avon Representatives, consumers and investors.
From a financial perspective, as sales growth declined, we did not keep the cost base in line. For example, we invested
in RVP without getting an appropriate return on that investment and RVP and marketing investments were fragmented.
In general, SG&A spend outpaced revenue growth. At the same time, we had higher inventory and not enough focus on
cash management and ROI for capital investment.
As the company tried to course correct, multiple restructurings caused energy to become internally focused rather than
externally focused on the market and our competition. We also had talent challenges with revolving doors and loss of
key people. A pattern of moving senior managers around frequently made it difficult to gain traction and build consist
processes. And despite, or perhaps because of, the multiple reorganizations, there remains a lack of clarity about roles
and responsibilities and accountability. And while all this was happening, the competition did not stand still. So after a
fresh look at the situation, it's clear to me that at this moment, Avon doesn't need yet another new strategy. We need to
focus on the core of Avon's business, Representatives, consumers and our people.
Going forward, the Representative and consumer will be at the center of our business. And we will get the right people
in the right jobs. Representatives remain central to Avon's success. We have to deliver strong earning potentials and
make decisions based on what best supports the growth of their business. As I travelled and met with Representatives, I

heard from so many of them that they are dedicated to Avon, the business and their customers. Providing them with
innovative products, better service levels and earning opportunities will keep them engaged, energized and productive.
For consumers, Avon products have to be relevant, accessible and competitive. The innovation pipeline and brand
positioning must be targeted to core consumers in key markets.
And people. This is a management intensive business. We need strong leaders in the markets with a hands on approach
to build capabilities. The management team needs to be – to take a more strategic and disciplined approach, which will
reduce volatility and improve consistency. Our people need to have the opportunity to stay in a role long enough to
build a track record of success. This is good for them, as it expands skill sets and confidence, and good for the
company, as it builds direct selling knowledge and increases accountability.
With Representatives and consumers back at the center of our business, and our people aligned and engaged, Avon will
once again be able to compete effectively. I am confident that we can turn this company around and reach a point of
sustainable growth. But how do we get there? We will be evaluating and identifying solutions across operational,
cultural and financial aspects of the business, with a focus on critical areas that I believe will successfully drive Avon's
turnaround.
Now, let me turn to the priorities that I'd laid out for the organization. First, we must stabilize the top line by executing
the fundamentals. Top line growth will come from a focus on the product portfolio, marketing, and Representative
earning opportunity.
Product portfolio: Putting our consumer-based insights to action, we need to get the right products in the right markets
at the right price. We have a strong and highly productive R&D organization and we have some great products, but we
need to include the right insights and mix of mid and lower value tier products to build a competitive portfolio.
Marketing: We need to market our products in a compelling and relative way and re-energize our brochures and other
sales tools for Representatives, while ensuring an integrated marketing approach.
And Representatives' earning opportunity: This is critically important. In general, we need to strengthen our sales
leadership model where top selling Representatives will have the opportunity to earn more. For example, we are testing
a new pilot in the Philippians in this area. We've also been successful with sales leadership in Mexico and are making
progress in the U.S. with the One Simple Sales Model. But we need better analytics and insights to ensure that we can
consistently develop competitive models in diverse and dynamic markets.
Second, improve income by more effective cost structure and cash generation. We need to continue to reduce
complexity and evaluate our SG&A by examining infrastructure and critical investments. With increased discipline, we
will work to evaluate how effective the spend is against critical activities. Our general managers are being held
accountable for their P&L, both top and bottom line, as well as working capital. Instituting a more rigorous approach to
understanding sales drivers and simplifying our processes will help us streamline and reduce spending where it makes
sense and identify where we can maximize our returns. We've also shined the light on cash generation by taking a close
look at inventory levels, improving inventory levels, managing everyday costs, improving our collections and reducing
bad debt in critical markets by addressing credit terms.
One area where we've under invested is IT. In the near term, we will also need to make investments to replace legacy
systems in the back office and those that impact Representative experience. Modernized systems will help reduce
complexity, increase productivity and improve efficiency.
As you know, I am taking a fresh look at every aspect of the company. As part of the stabilization plan, we are
reviewing our capital strategy, including the dividend, in light of the current state of the business. We know that the
dividend is important to our shareholders. As we complete this review, our intention would be to bring Avon's dividend
more in line with our overall performance and our peer group.
Third, invest in our people and build a culture of accountability. I've already discussed the importance of getting the
right people in the right jobs, developing and empowering them to make decisions and holding them accountable. I
firmly believe that the tone needs to come from the top and I've taken a very hands-on approach with the executive

committee and our regional business leads.
Kimberly and I meet with each region and key market on a monthly basis to understand progress and ensure that we are
delivering on our commitments. The Presidents of all four regions now report directly to me and I've been working
with them closely as they develop region and market specific turnaround plans.
As I build my leadership team, you can expect to see a mix of internal and external talent. There are several key
positions on my executive team where I believe we need a fresh perspective, so we have searches underway for heads
of Global Marketing and Strategy and for Human Resources. And as you saw last week, we have also started initiating
a search for a General Counsel. We will continue to evolve our operating model, and if there are changes, they will be
made based on what is best for Avon and for our Representatives. Many of Avon's executional missteps were caused
by silo mentalities. Moving forward, we are working as one team. We all have shared ownership for putting problems
on the table and solving them collectively.
Fourth, using technology to better serve our representatives and connect with consumers. We can make it easier for
representatives to do business with us and improve their earnings opportunity. We will also invest in our internal
capabilities to make us more responsive and better able to serve Representatives. This requires a multi-year investment
plan, which is underway. There are many things we can do in the short term to better support our Representatives on
digital social media and I've empowered our internal team to fast track these efforts.
For example, we've put a renewed focus and energy into developing intuitive, easy to use sales tools for
Representatives. We have many Representatives who are already social media savvy and we are tapping into them to
help beta test these new tools. We are also looking at the most effective ways to make social media training available to
all Representatives and we will be evaluating and reshaping our e-commerce strategy so that we can give consumers
better access to our products without eroding the Representative earning opportunity.
And finally, we will build a strategic roadmap to define our future. Our immediate focus is on stabilizing the business,
reducing volatility in the short term, and then delivering and posting consistent, sustainable performance. As we
accomplish this, we will begin to frame the longer term vision for Avon. I do believe there are tremendous
opportunities for Avon in the future, new markets to enter, new channels to explore and we will examine those in due
time. These are the five priority areas that the organization is working against. While there's a lot of work to be done, I
am confident we can get Avon headed in the right direction.
I want to provide a brief update on the FCP (sic) [FCPA] (14:10) investigation. We are in discussion with the SEC and
DOJ regarding mutually resolving the government investigations. While these discussions will take time, it is progress.
In closing, my confidence in Avon's future stems from the underlying strength of the direct selling business model and
our geographic reach; our ability to create high-quality products that meet consumer needs – none of our competitors
have a more productive R&D function; the goodwill and optimism associated with the Avon brand, something I've
experienced firsthand in my travels around the world; the energy and flexibility of Avon associates, I've seen the
passion and commitment our associates have for Avon. And when our people are engaged and working toward a
unified goal, we are a formidable competitor. The challenge we're facing didn't materialize overnight. They developed
over years. And their solutions will take time as well, but we will make progress.
Now I'm going to hand it over to Kimberly to review Avon's second quarter results.
Kimberly A. Ross
Thank you, Sheri, and good morning, everyone. This is my third earnings call and while this still makes me a relative
newcomer, I've now had enough time to develop a perspective on how the business is currently positioned, the
challenges we face, the strengths we can build from and the fixes we need to put in place. Working together with Sheri
over the past quarter, we have made good progress on the analysis and review needed to stabilize the business and
return to growth.

Sheri has already discussed in detail the challenges that we're facing. While these challenges are significant, it is
important to surface them in order to correct them. And as we said in the press release, our second quarter results are
not good. That said, the quarter was in line with what we had directionally indicated to you during our last call.
Let me start with key points from the release. Our constant dollar revenue was down 1.3% for the quarter. Currency
had a significant negative impact, resulting in a reported sales decline of 9.3%. Units declined 4% and price mix was up
3%, mostly driven by inflationary price increases in Latin America. Active Representatives were down 3%, largely due
to the double-digit decline in North America, where, as expected, we continue to feel the impacts of the redistricting.
Latin America was the only region to experience growth in active Representatives.
Gross margin was down 160 basis points to 62.8% due to the continued negative impact from higher product cost and a
70 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted operating margin was down 510 basis points to 6.4%
in the quarter.
In addition to the gross margin pressure, operating margin was impacted by revenue deleveraging, professional fees,
and wage inflation. Negative foreign exchange also contributed to the decline and had a negative 90 basis point impact
in the quarter.
We continue to have challenges across many of our key markets, as you will see in the regional updates, but with the
work we are doing with the regions and key market teams, we hope to improve accountability and reduce volatility.
Now to update you on the regions. Latin America: sales rose 3% in constant dollars with a decline in Brazil offset by
increases in Venezuela and Mexico. Brazil was down 1.1%, which was actually a bit better than we expected, as the
impact from ERP implementation last year ended up having less of an impact than we had originally believed.
Nonetheless, Brazil results are still down and they are being pressured by Representative satisfaction, competition,
assortment and pricing, which is ultimately impacting our active Representative count.
We are in the process of building back our direct sales capabilities and strengthening our talent pool, and in doing so,
strengthening our processes. These issues had developed over a period of time and were compounded by the systems
issues we had last year. These are clear areas that need to be improved upon and that we are improving upon, but it will
take time for the results to be reflected in our financial performance.
Elsewhere in Latin America, Mexico continues to perform well, rising 6%, and Venezuela is up as well, driven by
inflation, which is resulting in higher average order. Colombia and Argentina were both soft in the quarter. Colombia
was impacted by a continued high level of competition while Argentina was impacted by import restrictions, which led
to service issues. Latin America adjusted operating margin was 9.8%, down 470 basis points due to weaker gross
margin, primarily due to higher supply chain cost and inventory obsolescence. Foreign exchange and higher overhead
due to wage inflation were also factors.
As we think about the second-half, we are improving our commercial proposition and we expect to see benefits from
the fashion and home price adjustments in Brazil. We are also adjusting smart value pricing and ensuring a strong
product proposal for the Christmas season. Having said that, we still need to do a better job with inventory in Latin
America, and particularly in Brazil. We are planning to flow excess inventory in Brazil in the second half of the year,
which is likely to have a negative impact on our operating margin. Moving forward, our goal is to achieve a better
balance between flowing excess inventory and protecting our margins.
Europe: sales declined 5% in local currency, which was worse than we had expected, due to declines in active
Representatives. Average order was also a factor. The sales decline was primarily driven by Russia, Turkey, and the
UK, which are being negatively impacted by continued weak microeconomic environment, competition and
executional challenges. We need to improve field fundamentals, including the Representative earnings opportunity, and
we're working to improve the energy in the brochure and adapt the assortment to the current consumer trends.
Russia declined 6%. The competitive environment remains intense, which is impacting recruitment and price
competitiveness. We expect the environment to remain challenging in the balance of the year. We are taking steps to
address it, but expect some pressure on results in the second half.

Turkey is also weakened and was down 19%. We are seeing stepped up competition in this market coupled with
executional missteps in Representative activation and in assortment, pricing and brochure execution.
The UK was down 7% due to a week macroeconomic environment and declines in fashion and home, in part impacted
by slow movement of some of our products.
South Africa continues to grow, but at a slower pace due to our decision to implement a new tighter credit policy,
which will continue to impact results in the near-term. Adjusted operating margin in Europe was 12%, down 480 basis
points due to sales deleveraging, bad debts and a one-time prior period adjustment for brochure costs.
As we think about the outlook, we don't see any indications that European macros will improve in the near-term. Price
competition in this market is challenging, and consequently, we are increasing our focus on smart value. Importantly,
we are identifying missteps in our field and commercial marketing execution and we are taking corrective actions.
However, results are likely to remain soft in the near-term.
North America: sales were down 5% driven by lower active Representative, which are offsetting growth in average
order. In Q2, we completed the redistricting. All areas have been realigned and our focus is now on helping our DSMs
navigate their territories. Strengthening relationships between district sales managers and their sales leaders is critically
important and this will take time. While we are seeing fewer orders overall, average order in North America is up 7%
with growth coming from improved Representative mix as higher tier Representatives remain engaged. Additionally,
fashion and home is outperforming beauty, which given the higher price point, is also helping average order.
Adjusted operating margin in North America was 0.4%, down 600 basis points, driven by higher RVP mainly due to
the OSSM implementation in the U.S., lower gross margin due to unfavorable mix and higher brochure cost. Because
building new relationships in the field is taking longer than we originally expected, we are not forecasting an
improvement in financial results in North America in the second half.
Asia: sales declined 2% largely due to weakness in China, which was down 23%, partially offset by a positive
performance in the Philippines. As we said last quarter, our transitioning to a direct selling business has faced greater
than expected challenges. Sheri and I visited China recently and we are working with the local management team to
take a fresh look at the business. We are finding that despite our efforts to implement direct sales, our service centers
tend to exhibit a retail mindset, which is an integral part of the business. Therefore, in the short term, we need to
provide support to both retail and direct sales in order to help slow the continued decline of our Chinese business, while
at the same time we analyze how to return the business to growth.
The Philippines was up 7% due to growth in active Representatives driven by our strength in field management
processes and successful marketing initiatives. Adjusted operating margin for the region was 7%, down 30 basis points.
Sales deleveraging and lower gross margin due to mix were largely offset by lower RVP and advertising. In terms of
the outlook, we expect sales and Representative count for the region to continue to be challenged, primarily by China.
So the regional performance continues to face challenges, but again, we're in line with our expectations for the quarter.
Cash flow: while our cash flow from operating activities is lower than last year, we are making some early progress on
improving the focus on cash flow, but much remains to be done. Our key areas of focus are inventories, account
payable, prepaids and receivables, and particularly, doubtful accounts. Year-to-date, our working capital improved by
$235 million driven by improvements in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and prepaids, which improved due to
initiatives we've put in place. As an example, in Latin America, we are better managing our vendor payment terms and
we are taking a close look at reducing our prepaid expenses.
We are also making progress in inventory. We saw improvements in Europe and the U.S., which offset increases in
Latin America. I am particularly pleased that inventory in Europe and the U.S. improved despite the weaker sales trend,
as we had success in reducing fashion and home inventory in major markets and we adjusted the procurement in line
with softer forecasted sales. However, we have not yet made progress in reducing inventories in Latin America.
Consequently, as noted earlier, we are implementing initiatives in the second-half of the year to flow inventory in
Brazil, which will have a negative impact on our operating margin.

Going forward, for the company overall, we will strive to attain a better balance between flowing excess inventories
and protecting our margins, but achieving the right balance will take time as it will first require improvements in our
demand forecasting process and a near-term focus on maintaining service levels. I will continue to keep you posted on
our progress on improving working capital and cash flow overall.
Update on capital structure. In quarter two we took another step to improve our debt profile. As I indicated when I
started at Avon, I saw that the company had a fixed income profile whereby the maturity profile was too short with a
dependency on commercial paper. Additionally, the debt portfolio is largely comprised of floating rate debt. In Q1, as a
first step, we unwound swaps that allowed us to increase the percentage of fixed rate debt. As a second step, during Q2,
we executed a term loan with our relationship banks extending our maturity profile. The term loan is $500 million with
an option to increase by August 2 by an additional $250 million, of which we intend to increase by $50 million. The
proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.
Our commercial paper balance as of Q2 is $330 million compared to $709 million at year-end. Today, we have
declared our regular quarter dividend of $0.23 for the quarter. Going forward, we are focusing on developing a capital
structure that will strike the right balance between returning cash to shareholders and reinvesting for sustainable
growth.
As I said before, the dividend should be funded consistently through our income statement rather than our balance
sheet. And as we complete this review, our intention is to bring Avon's dividend more in line with our overall
performance and our peer group.
Now turning to cost reduction. In the quarter, we took a $40 million charge primarily related to further head count
reductions in corporate and in the regions. The annualized savings are forecasted to be $43 million, which will help
offset other cost increases.
Furthermore, in the continuing effort to reduce cost, in the second half, we will be consolidating our New York
headquarters into the building that houses our U.S. operations, which will lead to an additional non-cash restructuring
charge between $10 million and $20 million. Other than the move, we do not currently expect any additional significant
restructuring charges in the second half of the year.
Our key near-term focus is on stabilizing the business, but doing so in a way that ensures we are positioning ourselves
for long-term, consistent, sustainable, and profitable growth. We are striving to make decisions that are right for the
long-term, even if they are uncomfortable in the short-term. As Sheri noted, some of the fixes will take time.
Accordingly, we expect the results in the second half to be more of the same.
As with any new management team, we've been challenging the status quo to drive change in processes, practices,
accountability, talent development, and importantly, mindset. Additionally, we are as focused on what we need to do as
we are on what we need to stop doing, and both Sheri and I are challenging the organization to stay focused on our
priority areas. As I said to you before, we are continuing to develop our planning and forecasting capabilities and
implementing a financial management culture with a renewed focus on accountability, transparency and improved
accuracy in projecting business trends. This will help us better manage our business. It will also help us reestablish the
credibility and trust of our investor base. We are not yet where we want to be, but have made some progress and
continue to make this a priority.
We are seeing early progress from these changes from organizational efficiencies to more effectively addressing issues
to better connecting the dots throughout the organization. This may not translate necessarily into tangible near-term
financial results, but it is an important step in Avon's turnaround. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Sheri.

Turning this company around is a significant endeavor, but I am energized and up for the challenge. I remain confident
that Avon's future can be as meaningful and successful as its past. Thank you.
We will now open the call to your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara [Bank of America Merrill Lynch].
Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Good morning. It's Bank of America. Hey. And I guess just wanted a clarification. Given the
challenges that you're uncovering here, I guess are you saying that there is likely to be no near-term kind of meeting or
roll out of some strategy? I know you said Avon doesn't need a new strategy, they need, I guess, better execution and so
is that the case? There's no kind of countdown to the next three months where you might have some kind of a meeting?
And then I guess, Sheri, given the tone of what you were saying, I mean can you just characterize how severe these
challenges are in the business relative to, I guess, what you might have thought three months ago when you last spoke
to us? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Certainly. Thanks, Chris. Certainly as we look at where we are from a business standpoint,
I tried today to provide a framework and roadmap for how we're looking at the business and we see this as an
evolutionary process. And so our plan is really to continue to work against the five priorities that I've outlined and
update you on a regular basis. As I said, I will be working with Kimberly and Amy to figure out what's the best time to
come forward, but we will keep you posted of our progress.
The key point I would say is that while we look at this, there is no single issue, and at the same time, it's not going to be
a single solution. What's important though, from a message standpoint, is we know that we can fix this. We have to stay
focused on the fundamentals and really get ourselves in order as it relates to the five priorities, fixing the top line,
improving our cash position, making sure that we continue to develop our talent, servicing our Representatives through
technology and making sure we're connecting with consumers. And then ultimately, we'll come back and build the
strategic roadmap for the future. So right now, our key focus is on stabilizing the business. Thanks, Chris.

Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson [Citigroup]. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. With Citigroup. My first question is just housekeeping. Kimberly, do you have a
sense for if FCPA were to go away tomorrow, what the sort of incremental run rate of kind of an adding to the
whatever checks and balances in the organization, does that $100 million of expense go away or are we still stuck with
legacy of $20 million or $30 million or something like that over the long-term?
And then my next question for Sheri. I guess when you say that you don't think that Avon needs a new strategy, I hear
that and I understand the idea of focusing on the core and all that, but I guess my question is how do you know that you
don't need a new strategy? Have you engaged sort of external consultants? Are you only taking the words of the folks
inside the organization as to what they perceive the company's strength and weaknesses to be? I mean, is this not the

time to be contemplating a new strategy in some of these markets like the U.S. that just looks so, so structurally
challenged? Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. So I'll start first, Wendy. Just with regards to the FCPA costs, I think it's too early
really to make a comment as to how much we would expect to go away or not go away. So, you know, and obviously
this is a new update that we provided here today, but as we go – when we get to a position that we can provide you
some additional color, we'll do so on that.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: As we look at the strategy for the future, it's really thinking about what we need to do in the
short-term to stabilize the business. And as I mentioned, we've lost focus on the basics, which is our Representative and
our consumer, and I think this is critically important to put back in place and make sure that we're looking at integrated
approaches to ensure that we are delivering against the consumer and the Representative expectation.
That understanding and learning has certainly come internally from the organization, as I've spent time in the markets
and talked to the management teams and individuals in the company, as well as an external view. That does not mean
that as we get to the future and we look at – after we've stabilize the business that we won't look at new areas, new
markets, new channels, new approaches. I think what's important right now is that the organization looks at how we
stabilize and continue to execute against our core mission, which is to serve the Representatives and the consumers. So
I do recognize that we need to go back and look at new markets and new opportunities, but I think in the short-term, it's
critically important that we stay focused on our stabilization and turnaround plan. Thanks, Wendy.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz [Deutsche Bank]. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi, it's Deutsche Bank. Good morning, guys.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Good morning.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey, can you help me with the cash flow bridge going forward? So it sounds like working
capital should improve because you're going to kind of bleed off some inventory in the short term, which means
[inaudible] (38:13) going to go down so that probably doesn't really help the operating cash flow. And then it also
sounds like there's quite a bit of IT investment, which is obviously a short depreciation and a big upfront cost because I
think you said your systems were a little bit lacking. And, then, so along those lines, when you look at the dividend
next year relative to peers and I said – I think you said you wanted to make it more competitive relative to the peer
group. Is that on a dividend yield basis or on payout ratio basis? I know it's a long question, but it kind of all sort of fits
in.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, I think what you're – hopefully what you're – what – if I understand correctly, you're
trying ultimately get to where are we going with dividend. And I think the key thing is that we need to get the dividend
more in line with our overall operating performance and where we stand in performing. And obviously, when we take
into account the consideration of where should a dividend be, we need to take into account, where is the peer group
with regards to their payout ratios, where are they with regards to yield, where are we with regards to our forecast on
the business and our cash generation. So I would say it's the usual things of a list of items that get taken into
consideration to then determine where the dividend should be.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Great, thanks. And just not really a related follow up, but do you think you have the right
people in place or do you think there's going to be incremental personnel changes either from the outside or internally?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: We certainly have terrific people within the organization. We recognize there's an
opportunity in certain areas to bring new people in so that we have a fresh perspective. Ultimately, we'll have a mix of
people with long experience within Avon, a lot of direct selling expertise, but also recognize the opportunity to bring in
a fresh perspective. And – so really getting diversity of thought and perspective as we solve the issues and stabilize the

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman [Barclays Capital]. Please state your affiliation, then pose
your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks, it's Barclays. So my concern is just I hear you on the obvious importance of
stabilizing the business. My concern is just that – two things. One is we all know this is very much a momentum
business. So I fear that in looking to stabilize something that is sort of spiraling downwards – increasing in more and
more markets it almost feels like, because even though Mexico's strong, it decelerated. Russia, first quarter you guys
said it felt a little better, it actually got a lot worse. So, but it ends up being the same thing as it's been in the past, which
is a lot of Band-Aids. And there's a lot of Band-Aids put in place by a lot of the same people within the regions and
then you hit go on figuring out what to do next. So how does that fit, that concern fit with the idea of you're making
progress and moving forward on growth fundamentals, not just on cost fundamentals? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I think one of the things that you point out is it's a very management intensive
business. It's important to have people on the ground that are empowered to make decisions so that we can drive top
line growth. The elements of top line growth are really around making sure we have the right product portfolio, making
sure that we have the marketing so that we're getting the products to the customers in the appropriate way and certainly
the Representative earning opportunity. We need to make sure that we continue to focus on those and look at how we're
doing that and driving it for the long term.
So we really – what we want to make sure is we're not going at it and discounting to hit a quarterly number or a
campaign number. We need to make sure that we have the fundamentals in place. And so that to me is critically
important. It's not good enough to just focus on cost reduction and cutting costs; we need to ensure that we're driving
the top line. And so really working with the markets to understand the Representatives and the consumer needs and
making sure we're getting the right product, right marketing and the right earnings potential in place are critically
important. And the management teams are working against that with the regional leads. And that's an area where
Kimberly and I meet with the teams monthly to really talk about that. But you're absolutely right that top-line growth is
fundamentally important and critical to turning this business around. Thanks, Lauren.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Because my follow-up on that would just be that, for example, in the U.S. with One
Simple Sales Model – this is actually I think a good example. What you're doing inherently is destabilizing to the
business, yet is a change in strategy and is, in my mind, unquestionably the right thing to do, but it is destabilizing to
the business. But you're willing at this point to take that hit for a few quarters, improve the productivity, improve the
mix of the Reps, those sorts of things. So why not follow that sort of path in all of your markets now rather than maybe
doing it 18 months from now, when you can say, okay, Russia's been flat for four quarters or whatever the example
may be.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, I think that there are specific – one of the things that, if you look at the individual
markets, it's not a one-size-fits-all and they come from different places in terms of the direct selling model as well as
the consumer needs and customer insights piece. So what I'm saying is that we will in each market make sure we
understand the Representative earning opportunity, understand the customer and put the appropriate plans in place to
make sure that they're driving that. So we do need to be able to do that, but that doesn't mean that the model that works
in the United States would be appropriate, for example, for Brazil today. What we're saying is that we need to have the
local management understanding what's critically important to drive their business and that will be a combination of
things, but that's the area that we'll be focused in moving forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian [Morgan Stanley]. Please state your affiliation, then pose
your question.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi, it's Morgan Stanley. So I was hoping to get a bit more detail on the level of
investment you think you need in the business going forward in RVP and in general relative to current levels. You'd
indicated that RVP spending hasn't been productive enough historically, but also a need to step-up a focus on the Rep
earnings potential. So as you think about the level of investment going forward, is it more reallocating current spending
to more productive areas or better execution that can drive a market share improvement or would you anticipate a large
ramp up in spending behind the business going forward to fix the market share issues and some near-term margin
compression?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: This is an area of key focus for us, an area that we need to do additional work in. What we
need to understand is all of the levers and how they work together in terms of the Representative earning proposition.
So we will be looking at various aspects of RVP in conjunction with advertising, in conjunction with the product
portfolio and really making sure we have an integrated approach. To me, it's not so much the amount that we spend, but
it's the effectiveness of our spend. And so this is an area that the teams will be working on much more aggressively and
understanding it with the nuances and differences within each individual market. So we will have more for you in the
coming months on this, but this is a key area of focus for us.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And I know you're not going to give us a long-term margin target at this point, but
I was hoping at least conceptually you could give us some thoughts on why your margin levels are lower than other
direct selling peers out there. Are there significant areas of opportunity relative to that peer set you're not fully
capitalizing on at this point, or are there more structural reasons in your mind, whether it be product category mix or
price points, et cetera, that are driving that gap?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, I think it gets to the point of our SG&A spend out of line with our revenue growth.
Certainly that to me is an area that we need to continue to focus on and look at. We also have a very diverse group of
markets that we compete in; understanding that in terms of what we need to compete is critically important. This is an
area that we will continue to look into as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky [Wells Fargo]. Please state your affiliation then pose your
question.
<Q - Joe Lachky>: Hi, thanks. Wells Fargo. Just wanted to talk about Brazil for a second. Have you guys stabilized
the system issues there, particularly where are the order fill rates compared to historical levels? And also if you could
talk about the inventory strategy going forward? How you plan on flowing off that inventory and how that will effect
results going forward? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, certainly on the service level issues, we have made progress at moving in a much
better direction versus where we were a year ago at this time. But if you look at historical levels, we're still a bit higher.
So it's an area that we are continuing to put resources against and focus on. As it relates to inventory, I'll turn it to
Kimberly and she can talk to the specific things that she and the team have implemented.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, one of the things we're focusing on for flowing the inventories for the second half of
the year is, in the region, they're going to have, and particularly in Brazil, some additional flyers in order to move some
of the inventory. Obviously the trick then is to better understand where that will cannibalize from other products that
we normally would have flowed in the catalog to make sure that we then get the right balance of ordering products
versus flowing the products that we have in the portfolio. So a couple things, first of all is flowing some of the excess
inventory we have there, but then finding the right balance going forward to ensure that we maintain lower levels of
inventory. So that's where we're working on the demand forecasting side of it in the regions. And it's not as simple as
just say, reduce inventories and everything's in place. So there is some additional steps that we need to take there to – in

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj [Sanford C. Bernstein]. Please state your affiliation, then pose
your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Yeah, I'm from Bernstein. So I think it's a fair assessment, at least one of the fairest I've heard so
far, about the issues in the structure of a plan, at least kind of the bones of a plan, including the dividend has to be better
aligned, we have to reinvest, we have to cut some cost in SG&A and a bunch of other complexities. But it's not – so I
don't know how to put this, but it's not like you're rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic anymore, which I think
was what we had heard for a number of years and so – but it does feel a little bit that you're sticking the finger – you're
kind of sticking your finger in the hole of the Titanic, so you're trying to stop it, but there's a lot more core issues you
haven't really addressed. And one of the ones that you really haven't touched on, and I want to hear your thoughts on it
is just direct selling being kind of a secularly challenged channel over time in the emerging markets, which are your
core markets. As retail presence grows, it just feels like it's an eroding channel. It's an eroding channel that you're going
to have to spend more money on, and I think you've seen that over the past few years and certainly through your visits,
you're going to have to spend more money on to keep growing with the markets. So how do you think about that? And
again, it may not be kind of a short-term issue, but it's a really important long-term issue, which I think is what a lot of
folks are raising on this call, that there are some core issues you have to deal with that can't be dealt with by, for now,
stopping the leak. And in that context, can you talk a little bit about what should we be looking for, for success, so
when should we expect growth again top line, bottom line? How do we measure? You're going to communicate with
us, but how do we measure your success along those lines? So kind of the – are you addressing some of the core issues?
What do you think about one of the ones that I've raised? And then how do we measure your success going forward?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure, thanks. As I look at the direct selling market, it's a very large market, $150 billion
globally and growing mid-single digits. It still is a very relevant and attractive business model, stronger in certain
markets than other markets, that's a given. But as we look at the opportunity to leverage the field base that we have
around the globe, I see this as an important opportunity to get our products in the hands of millions and millions of
consumers. Certainly there are things that we need to do internally to make sure that we're competitive in that space and
that's what we're focused on today.
Longer term, as I've said, when we look at the longer term plan, we will be looking at new markets. We will be looking
at new channels and we'll have an opportunity to look at how we continue to build the Avon brand and the Avon
business. But today, I see the direct selling area an opportunity still very relevant and an area that we're going to
continue to invest in, but again, making sure that we are focused on how we compete from a top line perspective as
well as a bottom line perspective.
As it relates to keeping you posted and informed on our progress, as I said today, I'm giving you a road map in terms of
how we're thinking about driving the business for the future. We will continue to update you on a regular basis and give
some more content as it relates to the components that we're driving against, the five priority areas, as well as our
success metrics moving forward.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: But I guess you probably have some sense at this point of is this the bottom?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, certainly, I think as I've said, there's not a single cause here and there certainly is not
a single solution. We are really challenging the organization to come forward with all of things and making sure that
we are challenging the status quo, identifying the issues, and really putting plans in place to address them. I mean the
positive component of it is the people in the organization understand what some of our challenges are. I mean, my
synopsis of what's happening is really based on input from them as well as external views and that to me is critically

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan [Stifel, Nicolaus]. Please state your affiliation, then pose
your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: I'm curious why you think the strategy to offer more value oriented products is correct for
the long term? I guess the macro environment supports it, but we've heard it before and it hasn't really worked or the
strategy has changed. And to that end, as GDP and per capita income increase in developing markets, why doesn't this
hurt the business longer term? Like you're offering more value products, you ultimately have people trading up into
higher end products, so it gets a lot harder to introduce new products at higher price points or raise prices on current
products. I guess I'm just trying to figure out why this makes sense right now and why it's a correct long-term strategy?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. As we look at the consumer dynamics and the Representative dynamics, I think it's
important to understand that what we need to have is really multiple tiers. And so one of the things that we did in a
couple of our markets is we really focused on the higher tier because we were driving toward a higher net per unit. And
we need to still continue to offer higher end, but to do that, we shouldn't be taking out the number of smart value or
lower – mid to lower tier products. And so, all we're saying is that we had made a conscious effort to move higher end
at the expense of mid and lower tier. And so all – what I'm saying is we're really bringing that back in so that we have a
tiered approach. Certainly, we would love to be relevant and move people up the value chain, but we need to make sure
that we have the appropriate offerings to drive units and then at the same time be able to move them up to higher tier
products.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: And maybe if I can just add one point to that. As we talk to our Representatives, what we
hear also is that some of the smart value products are what gives them a chance to be able to go knock on the door
multiple times in a certain time period with different customers and they create excitement in the catalog also. So it's
not just about going for a lower economically demographic customer, but also it's about creating some excitement in
the catalog.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thanks, Kimberly.

Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi [UBS]. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yeah, UBS. Good morning. Quick question on sequencing. It strikes me as you've identified a lot of
issues in the business. I'm just curious how you think about sequencing the fixes. For instance, where does the kind of
fixing the IT infrastructure, et cetera, fall into the sequence? Because it strikes me as you would have to do that before
you could stabilize the business. Any thoughts there would be helpful.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, in terms of sequencing, I think it's really important that we focus on our top markets
and that's where we're spending a lot of our time and energy. So Brazil, U.S., as an example. We – to actually satisfy
the Representatives, we need to make sure that it's easier for them to do business with us and so we know that the IT
systems and our service is critically important. We will continue to invest in that. At the same time, we're taking efforts
to make sure we have the right product portfolio and incentivizing our Representatives. So it's going to be done – the IT
component needs to be done in concert with some of the other components that we're putting in place, really to get to
the point where we are satisfying Representatives, so that they are feeling that they are not in any way going to be
disappointing their customer and also to incentivize them to recruit other people into the field for earnings opportunity.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere [RBC Capital Markets]. Please state your affiliation and pose
your question.
<Q - Jason M. Gere>: Okay. Thanks. RBC. So just one quick housekeeping and then a bigger question. So the next
two quarters you're saying that we're going to see more of the same for 2Q – as 2Q. So as we look into 2013, should we
start to see a little bit more stabilization of trends or in 2014 is maybe when we'll get back to a growth strategy? Or are
we thinking more stabilization for 2013 and 2014? I guess I'm just trying to figure out how long this kind of period of
stabilization kind of lasts before we start to see some acceleration off of what hopes to be trough earnings here. And
then the real question is really, you talk about entering new markets longer term, but over the last three months, as
you've kind of visited some of these existing markets, where have you been close to saying, maybe this is just not the
right place to be, where do we need a narrower focus, are there markets that you need to exit rather than continue to
expand? Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. Jason, just with regards to the timeframe, I can fully appreciate that you'd like to kind
of put a box around what the timeframe is. I think for right now, as Sheri said, the key thing is we're focusing on the
plan and putting more meat on the bones with regards to the stabilization plan. So thus for now, I've kind of given you a
bit of color for the rest of the year. I think we'll hold off for now with regards to giving you any color further down the
line until we have put some more meat on the bones with regards to the plan.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes, as it relates to markets we are – obviously, we see opportunity in other markets and
we will continue to look at those longer term. The immediate focus has really been on stabilizing our top 10 and
making sure that we're putting all the resources there. We have done a market analysis and market portfolio review and
we will continue to evaluate the performance of markets and make decisions at the appropriate time with respect to
some of the smaller markets that may or may not be performing.
<Q - Jason M. Gere>: So it's fair to say there will be some sacred cows here? I mean you could – I think a couple
years ago, Avon got out of Japan. Could there be markets where you decide that it's just not the right place for us to
compete anymore?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: If we feel that we're not competitive and that we're not going to be able to compete and we
would rather deploy funds in other markets to grow those, we will make those decisions. There are no sacred cows.

Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty [BMO Capital]. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning. BMO Capital. As you took a look at the – I guess you traveled around
to the five most – your five most important markets over the last quarter. And I guess I just have – because they are all
so different and we've heard enough I think maybe about Brazil, but could you give us your snapshots of the U.S., of
Russia? Is the U.S. ever going to get to a point where it's a major contributor to cash flow? And how could you see that
happening based on the review you've had? And as far as China goes, we've been hearing about the transition to direct
selling, I guess, for about three years now. And does Avon have a place in that market that is viable? I'd like your
thoughts on those.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. I'll start with the U.S. first. Well, as the U.S. implemented the One Simple Sales
Model late last year, which involved some significant redistricting and really moving away from a hybrid model to a
sales leadership model and the team has done a nice job in the execution. Obviously, it has been disruptive, but we're
very confident that the team is putting the right tools in place and is very focused on turning around. Obviously, we're
going to continue to monitor this, making sure that they have the right product portfolio, they have the right earnings
opportunity. Early days, we see some strong signs, as Kimberly mentioned, particularly with the top selling

Representatives. We need to work on getting new recruits in and retaining talent there, but we will continue to monitor
the U.S. and feel positive about the steps that we've taken there.
As I've traveled around, I do see the value of the direct selling model working extremely well in markets like Mexico
and Philippines where we have a very strong sales leadership model. We have experienced teams and we have the right
product portfolio and product mix. So we can see how those markets are continuing to do well.
I will be in Russia and Turkey and South Africa in the next several weeks. So we'll be able to give more detailed
perspective on those at a later date. Certainly China, the point that you make there, Kimberly and I were there. The first
thing I will say is China is a very important market. It's a very attractive market. We have not performed to our
expectations and we have struggled with the hybrid model. In the short-term, we've the decision to support the retail
execution as well as direct selling to stabilize the business. More importantly, we're taking a step back with the
management team there and taking a holistic approach to understand how best for Avon to compete in China.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay. And my second question is what management changes have been made if any
already and what do you – the idea of Avon having a Chief Operating Officer has been posed a couple of times, do you
think you need one or not?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: One change that I've made is that the regional heads, the presidents in each of the regions
now report directly to me and that enables me to stay close to the business. And we've instituted a review process
where Kimberly and I meet with the regional heads as well as some of the key markets, and particularly the markets
where we're seeing challenges, on a monthly basis to really understand – to make sure that they have the tools, that
they're focused in the right area and really to make sure there's accountability for performance.

Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante [Consumer Edge Research]. Please state your affiliation,
then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Consumer Edge Research. Good morning, everyone. I would like to go back to Sheri's
statement that Avon doesn't need a new strategy, but from a different angle on whether you can really afford it. You
have operating margins contracting persistently in the past seven years and this is in spite of having extracted over $1
billion in savings. So in a way your strategy involves buying top line growth by subsidizing a channel that is obsolete.
In the U.S., you've spent $465 million to generate $467 million in sales. Can you afford doing the same in Brazil and
Mexico? And then I have a follow up.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: If you look at the direct selling channel, what you see is growth in the mid-single digits.
You see many of the competitors in some of the markets performing extremely well. So I don't see the channel as
obsolete. What I do see is an opportunity for us to make sure that we are more competitive in the channel. That requires
us not only to look at our top line, but also to look at the cost structure and make sure that our spend is driving top line
growth. So that really will be our focus moving forward.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Coming back to your statement about moving to value, how can that reconcile to the Reps
making more money and your ability to attract Reps? Selling cheaper product, knowing that your Reps and direct
selling distributors in general can handle only a small client base is only going to undermine their own compensation.
So explain that what it seems to me a contradiction.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Okay. Moving to value, it's not that we're moving away from some of the higher end
products that we would carry in our brochure. Kimberly made the point earlier that by having lower value or lower
price points in our brochure, we pull people in to the brochure. The same time, we then offer them higher end skin care
and we also offer, in many cases, fashion and home, which drives incremental earning for the Representative. So we've
done a lot of work and what we see is, as an example, fashion and home is incremental. The consumer and the
Representatives may come in for a lower cost color product or skin care product, but then will necessarily trade up to a
higher end fashion and home. And that drives more earning opportunity for our Representatives.

Your next question comes from the line of Leigh Ferst [Wellington Shields]. Please state your affiliation, then pose
your question.
<Q - Leigh Ferst>: I'm with Wellington Shields. Good morning. My question is about your e-commerce effort and
balancing that with the Representative profit and how that ties – also how that ties into your reduced ad spending?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. This is an area that we are just starting to work on. Not that the team hasn't been
working on it prior to my arrival, but we're taking a fresh look at that and really try and understand how we continue to
make sure that our brand is relevant to the consumers. And so that's an area that we will be working with in conjunction
with Representative and put together a strategy globally. We will then, as it relates to the whole spend from a
marketing, it's really a matter of understanding the advertising spend, the e-commerce spend and the Representative
value proposition, and making sure that we have those integrated and aligned so that we're driving top line performance
in sales.
<Q - Leigh Ferst>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line if Victoria Collin [Atlantic Equities]. Please state your affiliation, then pose
your question.
<Q - Victoria L. Collin>: Hi. Good morning. Atlantic Equities. I wonder if I could just ask a question about the
portfolio again. You talked about a good performance coming from the fashion and home and also how you see the
year-end benefiting from the Christmas and seasonal products that you're hoping to bring out. Is there an element now
when you're looking at the business without implementing a new strategy, that you're looking to re-find the Avon
consumer that was there a couple of years ago that did enjoy the fashion and the home purchases and the seasonal
purchases? And does this fit in with also implementing and focusing on the low to mid-tier, that in essence you're
slightly re-inflating the products available so that you can draw consumers back in? And if this is the case or similar,
would it have an impact on the inventory controls that you're also trying to instigate? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. So what we're balancing is making sure that we are offering to our customers and our
Representatives a product portfolio that engages them so that they come to Avon and Avon is the destination; that's
critically important. And that requires that we understand the consumer insights both in the beauty space as well as in
the fashion and home. And we will continue to focus on that. What we need to balance that with is the complexity that
more codes or more SKUs add to the total proposition. And so what we've done is also instituted some guard rails in
terms of how we go into these markets to best manage our inventory. So we need to make sure we get the proposition
right for the Representative, but at the same time make sure internally we have the right guard rails around how we
drive that business and ensure that we can do that without creating additional complexity. Thank you for your question.
