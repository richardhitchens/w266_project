Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate Corporation first quarter 2012 earnings conference call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President of Investor
Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Robert Block
Thanks, Matt. Good morning and thanks for joining us today for Allstate's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call.
We'll begin this morning with prepared remarks from Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik, and me. Following that, we will open
it up for your questions. Joining us for the Q&A session are Don Civgin, Head of Allstate Financial and Esurance; Judy
Greffin, Chief Investment Officer; Sam Pilch, our Controller; and Matt Winter, head of Auto, Home, and Agencies.
Late yesterday we issued our press release and investor supplement as well as our 10-Q for the first quarter of 2012.
We also posted a slide presentation which will be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks.
As noted in our press release and 10-Q, Allstate adopted new deferred acquisition cost accounting guidance on a
retrospective basis as of January 1, 2012. Accordingly, all prior-period balances have been adjusted. The DAC and

shareholders' equity balances were reduced by $572 million and $376 million respectively when compared to the
previously reported December 31, 2011 balances. We filed an 8-K yesterday reflecting these adjustments, and we
added a few pages in investor supplement that add details on the adjustments. All of these documents can be accessed
from our website.
Referring to the first slide of the presentation, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding
Allstate's operations. Actual results may differ materially from those statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2011,
our 10-Q for the first quarter 2012, our 8-Ks filed yesterday on May 2, and our most recent press release for
information on potential risks.
This discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on
our website.
As always, I will be available after this call to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Let's begin with Tom
Wilson.
Thomas J. Wilson
Good morning and thank you for joining us on what I know is a very busy day for you. I'll cover our performance
relative to our 2012 priorities within the context of our overall strategy. Bob and Steve will follow with more details on
the drivers of our results.
If you go to slide two, our strategy is to sell unique protection products to different customer segments. The left side
prefers the personal assistance of a local agent, whereas the right side is very comfortable purchasing directly from a
call center or over the web. The lower segments, the segments on the lower half of the grid are less price sensitive than
the upper half. So we serve all four segments of customers.
Our 2012 priorities are to maintain auto profitability, to raise returns in homeowners and the annuity businesses, to
grow insurance premiums, and to proactively manage our investments in capital. So this strategy and those 2012
priorities are designed to enable us to achieve the goal producing operating return on equity of 13% by 2014.
Turning to slide three, it was a good start to 2012, with strong financial results for the first quarter. On a consolidated
basis, we generated net income of $766 million. That was an increase over the prior-year first quarter of 46%, and it
was driven primarily by improvements in operating results. On an operating income basis, we increased almost 44% to
$710 million or $1.42 per diluted share. The underlying property/liability combined ratio for the quarter was 88.1%,
which is 1.8 points better than Q1 of 2011.
We made progress in each of our priority areas. We maintained auto profitability in the first quarter, with the Allstate
brand standard auto combined ratio of 95.2, an increase of 0.2 points compared to Q1 of 2011. There is some pressure
on the cost side of the business, which we're addressing to protect our margins.
We continue to improve returns in homeowners with an underlining combined ratio for the Allstate brand of 67, which
is seven points better than first quarter of last year and essentially equal to the fourth quarter of last year. We remain
focused on our profit improvement actions in this line as continued improvement is a critical component to achieving
the goal of 13% operating ROE by 2014.
Allstate Financial's operating income was up, largely based on higher partnership income. While we've made some
improvement in returns in the annuity business due to higher partnership income, the low interest rate environment
continues to be a challenge for us in raising returns on that business.
Overall premiums increased, reflecting the acquisition of Esurance, higher average homeowner premiums, and growth
in the emerging businesses. Esurance's policies in force grew in the first quarter from the year end 2011, as the benefits
or our new marketing programs began to be realized. We did have an expected reduction in auto policies in the Allstate
agency channel, reflecting profit improvement actions in the auto line in Florida and New York and the impact of
raising homeowner prices for multiline customers.

Our investment results were very good despite the challenging interest rate environment.
Finally, from a capital management perspective, we raised the dividend and repurchased $300 million from the current
stock buyback authorization. Our book value per share increased 8% and 6.6% from the first quarter of 2011 and year
end 2011 respectively.
So now Bob and Steve will provide more details on the results for the quarter.
Robert Block
Turning to slide four, we show our top and bottom line results for Property-Liability. Overall, the results were mixed
for growth, but profitability was strong. Property-Liability net written premium of $6.46 billion grew 4% versus the
first quarter 2011, due primarily to the acquisition of Esurance, which grew net premiums and policies in force as
expected. Allstate brand standard auto net written premium of $3.9 billion declined 1.2% from the first quarter of 2011,
as auto profitability actions in New York and Florida and higher homeowner prices hampered growth. Unit growth also
declined from prior year. The volume of new issued applications was comparable to each of the last three quarters, but
did decline 10.8% from the first quarter of 2011.
Average premium on a gross written basis increased 1.8% compared to the first quarter of 2011. We received approval
for rate changes in ten states, averaging 5.8% in those states. Retention ratio at 88.7 was down slightly from prior year,
driven primarily by Florida and New York. The balance of the country experienced an increase in retention from the
first quarter of 2011.
Allstate brand homeowners' net written premium grew 2.7% from the first quarter of 2011, as rate actions designed to
improve profitability continued to more than offset the reduction in units. We received approval for rate changes in 13
states, averaging 7.9% in those states or 2% on a country-wide basis. For the quarter, net written premiums for Allstate
brand emerging businesses, Encompass and Esurance, all positively contributed to the top line. We also experienced
favorable sequential unit growth in our Canadian operations, Encompass, and Esurance.
Moving to the bottom half of the slide, the combined ratio for property/liability was 92.1, an improvement from the
first quarter of 2011 of 2.8 points. The underlying property/liability combined ratio was 88.1, 1.8 points better than
prior year and well within the annual range we provided earlier this year.
The next slide provides the loss trends and rating actions for the Allstate brand standard auto. On the top half of the
slide are the gross frequency and paid severity trends for bodily injury and property damage coverages, which account
for about 45% of the incurred losses for Allstate brand standard auto. For the first quarter of 2012, both bodily injury
and property damage frequencies improved relative to the prior year for the fourth consecutive quarter. While bodily
injury and property damage paid severities were above prior year for the first quarter, the increase moderated relative to
the fourth quarter 2011.
In the lower left-hand corner of the slide, we added a chart on approved rate changes. For Allstate brand standard auto,
we averaged about a 4% increase over the last four quarters, a pace which has kept the combined ratio relatively level.
In the lower right-hand corner, we provided the combined ratio results for the last few years. In the first quarter of
2012, the combined ratio was 95.2 for Allstate brand standard auto, an increase from prior year of 0.2 points. Taking
the combined ratio [ph] apart, the (9:15) loss ratio for the Allstate brand standard auto improved by 0.7 points
compared to the prior year's first quarter, while the underwriting expense ratio increased by 0.9 points. On an
underlying combined ratio basis, the results for the first quarter were essentially flat with prior year. We remain vigilant
in our efforts to maintain auto margins.
On slide six, we display similar charts detailing approved rate changes and loss trends for Allstate brand homeowners.
We continue to gain approval for rate changes in the 8% to 9% range country-wide. The chart in the upper right-hand
corner provides the trends for loss costs excluding catastrophes. Frequency results for the first quarter of 2012 were
below prior year, while paid severity was flat. The rate actions we have taken coupled with the moderating loss cost

trends produced an underlying combined ratio of 67.0, an improvement of seven points from first quarter of 2011. On a
reported basis, the combined ratio for the quarter was 80.2, 11.2 points better than prior year, reflecting the
improvement in the underlying combined ratio and lower catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2012 versus the first
quarter 2011. We continue to focus on raising returns in this business.
Shifting the focus to Allstate Financial on slide seven, we provide results for the top line, the bottom line, and returns
by product. The results for the first quarter continue to reflect progress towards improving overall returns while shifting
our focus to underwritten products. While total premiums and contract charges declined for the quarter, premiums and
contract charges for underwritten products increased 3.5% to $535 million compared to the prior year. Allstate agencies
continued to generate strong growth over prior year, with a 16% increase in issued life insurance policies.
We recorded operating income of $150 million, an increase of $37 million from prior year. The increase in operating
income included a $39 million after-tax benefit from the classification of equity method limited partnership income as
net investment income in 2012.
Allstate Financial reported net income for the first quarter of $112 million, up $10 million from the first quarter of
2011. The increase resulted from an improvement in operating income and the absence of a loss of the wind-down of
Allstate Bank in 2011, partially offset by current year realized capital losses compared to realized capital gains in the
prior year. Operating income return on attributed equity of 8.8% improved 0.5 points from the fourth quarter 2011, with
life insurance at 11.3% return while accident and health insurance provided a 15.5% return. The favorable movement in
the return for immediate annuities was driven primarily by the reclassification of equity method limited partnership
income and is consistent with our previously disclosed intent to change our asset allocation for long-term immediate
annuities. This shift may result in more volatile investment income but should lead to higher total returns.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Shebik.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, Bob.
We continued to proactively manage the investment portfolio, supporting our key objective of managing investment
yields and creating value. On slide eight, you can see the size and composition of our overall portfolio. Improved fixed
income and equity valuations along with the positive cash flow from our property/liability business more than offset the
expected reduction of Allstate Financial's spread-based liabilities, raising the portfolio valuation to $97 billion at
quarter end.
Our portfolio actions during the first quarter continued to optimize our fixed income portfolio's position on the yield
curve, shifting out of longer-term municipal bonds and shorter-term lower yielding Treasuries into intermediate-term
investment-grade corporate bonds. Additionally, we shifted from public equity holdings to high-yield corporate bonds.
These actions benefited us as credit spreads narrowed, improving fixed income valuations and also supported our
average fixed income portfolio yield.
Slide nine highlights the portfolio income and yield trends. As Bob mentioned, we made a prospective change this
quarter to classify our equity method limited partnership results in net investment income. We believe that this
presentation more closely aligns the results of our expanded strategies in alternative investments and private asset
ownership with the liabilities they support.
Including the effects of this change, net investment income for the first quarter was $1.011 billion and the total
portfolio yield was 4.6%, with both measures increasing compared to the prior-year quarter and the fourth quarter of
2011. If the results of these limited partnerships had not been reclassified, net investment income would have been
$915 million or $67 million less than the first quarter of 2011, driven by the expected reduction in Allstate Financial
liabilities. The total portfolio would have been 4.3%, consistent with prior year's first quarter, but lower than the fourth
quarter of 2011.

On slide 10, you can see we realized gains of $168 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of $72 million
compared to the first quarter of 2011. Realized gains in the quarter were primarily from the sale of public equities. Our
impairment losses were the lowest recorded since the third quarter of 2007. Derivative results also improved, reflecting
our reduced usage of derivatives to manage rate risk and favorable results with respect to our credit positions.
Finally, moving on to slide 11, we finished the first quarter of 2012 with $19.2 billion in shareholders' equity, an
increase of approximately $900 million from year end 2011. The statutory surplus for both property/liability and life
remain strong, and deployable assets at the holding company level increased to $2.7 billion at quarter's end.
We continued to buy back our stock during the first quarter, repurchasing shares worth $300 million. We now have
repurchased $406 million of our $1 billion authorization. We also raised the first quarter dividend at the February
Board meeting. As Tom mentioned, our book value per share rose to $38.57 a new high for Allstate, 6.6% above year
end 2011.
Now let's open it up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs; your question,
please.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Hi, thank you, just one question on ad spend and Esurance in particular. How are you
thinking about advertising there? Is the first quarter an indication whether from a dollars perspective or a combined
ratio perspective how you're thinking about Esurance? And just one follow-up, thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Good morning, Michael. This is Tom. Don might want to make a comment about the first
quarter seasonality at Esurance, but let me give you some perspective on how we allocate resources. Each brand stands
on its own. So the advertising for the Allstate brand is separate and distinct, and we'll invest whatever we need to do to
keep that brand strong and that business glowing. The same is true for Esurance. We look at the economics of those in
total. We do not put those together and have a total ad spend budget. We do what we think makes sense. Obviously, we
launched a new program in December of last year with Esurance. And along with that, we increased our ad spend. And
we like what we have there. Don, you might want to talk a little bit about just first quarter results on Esurance.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yes, first of all, Esurance does have a more seasonal business than Allstate, and so their first
quarter spend tends to be higher. We spent about $45 million in advertising in the first quarter. We did that partially, as
Tom said, because the launch of the new campaign, the rebranding of Esurance, we wanted to get some weight behind
it. I'm happy to say it's working as well as we expected it to. So we're seeing good response rates, good customer mix
changes. Conversion ratio is improving as we would have expected. So I think, as Tom said, we'll continue to spend
money so long as it's economic to do so. And at the moment, it feels like we're spending the right amount, subject to the
seasonality of the first quarter.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got it. And then just on Answer Financial, where does that roll into the financials? Is that in
other, or does that roll into a fee line somewhere? I just wanted to get an idea of where that was and what the
magnitude and year-over-year change there was?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: The year-over-year change is minimal. It's actually very small, but it rolls up into other, so it's
not under Esurance.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: So it's in the other line. Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse; your question, please.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Underlying combined ratio in home, high 60s past two
quarters. I think that's relative to your longer-term goal of low-60s, so we're not that far away. Would do you say that
you're making progress ahead of plan, or has the driver just been more benign catastrophe losses the past two quarters?.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Hi, Mike. This is Matt. I'll try to answer that for you. We had some great profit improvement
in that line. I'd say about 60% of it was temporary and 40% sustainable. So a large portion was cats and weather
ex-cats. But a significant portion was rates, inspections, correct class actions, non-renewal actions, and the blocking
and tackling that's been done. So I think we're – I wouldn't say we're ahead of plan or behind plan. I think we are
making significant progress about where we thought we'd be. And we feel confident that we're doing the type of
fundamental steps necessary to improve the long-term profitability of the business.
And we continued a plan that includes rollout of the new homeowners' product, House & Home, that helps us deal with
roof costs specifically. There is some pressure from pricing on roofing. Roof prices fell two years in a row from 2008,
but had their first increase of 12% in 2011. So we know we have to get out in front of that, and we are with our new
product. So we feel pretty confident that the fundamentals have helped us dramatically. But there's no denying the fact
that first quarter was helped also significantly by just lack of cats and the weather ex-cat.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: So if the 40% was sustainable then, so should we continue to expect high single-digit
rate increases in home going into the back half of the year?
<A - Matthew Winter>: I think that's an acceptable range to think about.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay. And then lastly on auto, can you talk about the competitive environment in auto?
And can you also comment on the knock-on effect raising home insurance rates is having on the PIF [Policies in Force]
there?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Sure. Obviously, there is an impact of taking homeowners rate actions on not only home but
also on our auto customers and our PIF. We're also in places where it's necessary taking rate actions on the auto side,
which is compounding that. So when you combine the two, it's having what I'd say is a chilling effect on our ability to
grow PIF right now, as we have a core focus on the profitability side. We feel like that's the right balance right now.
We believe that growth in the absence of profitability is the wrong strategy. And so we're pretty disciplined right now
as far as focusing on getting rate adequate both in homeowners and auto and accepting but not liking the fact that it can
impact our ability to grow.
The competitive environment is interesting. I think some of the multiline companies are now raising their homeowners
rates a little later than I think we did and a few early adopters. So my expectation is that we will no longer be alone in
the marketplace taking rate. Now that many of our competitors, even though you may think of them as auto-only
competitors, they're offering non-proprietary homeowners products in a tent bundle, so even those traditional auto-only
companies are getting some of this collateral impact on the raising of homeowners rates. That's especially true for that
market segment of personal touch loyalists who prefer to bundle their products and aren't looking for independent
providers of their individual insurance products.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Let me add to that. I think as you're thinking about growth, you really should start with
looking at the different customer segments and begin the analysis there, then drop into products. So as Matt just said,
the Allstate agencies service those people who want local advice assistance, want branded products, buy bundles, like
bundled product. And so when you're looking agent the efforts to maintain homeowner returns at the same time you try
to grow your auto business, it obviously compounds that. And of course, we have our issues in New York and Florida.
If you look at Esurance on the other hand, that's the self-serve side of that matrix. You can see that Esurance is growing
and competing effectively with GEICO and Progressive. And then if you look on the Encompass side, that was – we
were not running that business. It had gotten a lot smaller. That was really our issue. We've changed leadership. I don't
think we've got it all in the right – it's headed in the right direction, but we don't have it fixed yet. So I think really as
we're thinking about growth in the future, it's helpful to set that in the context the way Matt did of who are the customer

groups that you're serving and how do you grow within that customer group.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay. And just real quickly, in terms of Matt said taking rate actions in auto, there's this
chart on slide five that shows about 4% rate changes, and then how do I reconcile that with – in the supplement, page
18, it shows about 5.5% rate increases in auto.
<A - Matthew Winter>: I think on slide five you're talking about approved rate changes, and I think in the supplement
it's what has been earned in.
<A - Robert Block>: The difference is the 5.8% – this is Bob – that you see in the supplement, that's the average of the
rates taken in the states specific. What's on the chart is the four-quarter moving countrywide impact of rates, so they're
two different numbers.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: So would the supplement be a more leading indicator that you're accelerating?
<A - Robert Block>: If you took the four quarters of the supplement for the countrywide, you'd get to 4%. Add them
up, you get close to 4%.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Thank you.
<A - Robert Block>: Yes.
Operator
Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney; your question, please.
<Q - Bob Ray Glasspiegel>: Good morning, everyone. On the auto, I thought the frequency and severity trends in total
were quite benign. And with Progressive's commentary and GEICO reporting over 100, there is some nervousness
about what's going on in auto. You've been reporting steady seven to eight points better than the industry auto
underwriting and contracting. I'm just trying to understand the difference between what you're seeing and they're
seeing. I'm wondering if the fact that they're growing much more rapidly and you're contracting could be feeding into
it.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Bob, this is Tom. It's hard to comment on what other people's results are. Obviously, I think
Progressive got hit with some reserve changes that they had to make down in Florida. I can't speak to GEICO since
they don't publicly disclose all the stuff that you can really go over. But I would say when you look at our practices in
auto insurance we pay attention to it at a very local level; we have good operating discipline around it; we're watching
the trends. You see the countrywide ones, the frequency is down, but a lot of the frequency is down because of New
York and Florida.
So we're looking at a level below that. Matt and his team are on top of that. So they have a number of places where they
are managing; that's why you see ten states had some increases. So we believe in small, frequent adjustments rather
than large and infrequent in terms of managing our business from a customer standpoint.
<Q - Bob Ray Glasspiegel>: Okay, just a bookkeeping question. You have $4.6 billion of limited partnerships. What's
the amount of that that's impacted by the EMA [Equity Method Accounting] geography change?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: About 60% of that is impacted by the EMA. I think it's about $2.5 billion.
<Q - Bob Ray Glasspiegel>: And the split between PC and life of those two?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: PC is about two-thirds. Life is about one-third. You can see that in the underlying numbers
in the 10-Q; we have those splits.
<Q - Bob Ray Glasspiegel>: PC is bigger?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: PC is bigger, yes.

<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Looking at the policy count decline in homeowners,
it was negative 110,000. I want your thoughts; where are you in reshaping the homeowners portfolio through risk
management and price increases? How many years just before we get to stability? And I also noticed that the decline in
auto was a little higher but about the same. Is it possible that Allstate has begun to grow in unbundled homeowners
policies?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Josh, you broke up on a few of those, but I think we got it. Matt, do you want to...
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes, I think I heard enough. If I start answering a different question than you asked...
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: I can ask again if you want. You guys can take it for what you want and I'll steer you if I
get misdirected.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Okay, good. Now I lost my train of thought on what your original question was.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Homeowners, reshaping the portfolio. Where are we in the long-term process? And are
you growing in unbundled auto at this time?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Okay, so I don't think it's prudent for me to guess a percentage of how far we are along in our
path. I would say we've made significant progress in taking a look at our homeowners' offerings on a state-by-state and
region-by-region and even locality basis to determine where we believe we have long-term prospects of making an
acceptable return for the acceptable level of risk. And we began that process and have done a great deal of work there.
As a result, we're making decisions about those areas where we will begin offering non-proprietary homeowners
products and brokering products so that we can serve our customers with a complete portfolio but not necessarily
always with an Allstate branded product.
And so we are doing a fair amount of work in our brokering operation and on our E&S segment to take a look at I'd say
a more refined view of looking at our markets and determining what products should be offered where. That takes some
time. It takes some time to build up the brokering capability, to build up the linkages from a technology standpoint so
we can serve those customers the same way we would serve customers with our Allstate branded product. And we are,
I think, making excellent progress there.
To your unbundled question, look, homeowners is often the lead product in our marketplace. In some areas, it is their
number one go-to customer product, and then they follow with auto. It is possible that we are seeing some areas where
they're getting homeowners products and for whatever reason, we do not then get the follow-on auto. But our focus and
our incentives and our goal is to provide a bundled product offering, deep relationship with multi-products to our
customers so they can get the true full value of working with an Allstate agent.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Josh, it's Tom. Maybe to give you a little longer-term perspective too, in 2005, I think it
was, after Katrina, we looked and said, "Should we get out of the business?" We broke it into three buckets. One was
mega-cats, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Two was non-mono cats. And three was just the slip, fall, low-severity,
high-frequency events. And so we went at all three of those components. We first went at the cat thing. I would say
we've made tremendous progress there, and we're pretty close to being where we want to be. But there are a few states
where we've still got some more work to do. If you look at what we've done in Florida, what we've done around the
coast, we're down over 1 million policies in homeowners as a result of many of those changes.
The second piece was non-mono cats. That's the part that popped really in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. And as Matt
said, we've been hard at work on that for the last three years. And I totally agree that it's hard to predict when that one

will be done because you've got to figure out what the weather will be in the future.
And then the third piece was just the normal slip and falls. We got a little behind in 2008 – 2009 as cost increases due
to commodity prices and oil prices spiking in those periods. Our actual underlying severities on non-catastrophe related
stuff went up. So I feel like we've made a lot of progress on that piece, too. So I would say number one and number
three, we're pretty far along; on number two, a little harder. About 75% or so of our homeowners business that's written
comes with another product, so we're not there. That said, we'd like it to be a lead line. When Matt and his team get
House & Home rolled out, get the pricing right, we believe that being a provider of a wide variety of products for that
personal touch [indiscernible] (34:20) customer who likes to bundle stuff will be a competitive advantage for us.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: And quickly on Florida and New York, the loss ratios were off the charts. Have you
overshot the mark in terms of your trying to get profits out of there at the expense of new customers?
<A - Matthew Winter>: No. I don't believe we've overshot the mark. I think that those two markets are, obviously,
extremely volatile and extremely difficult. We have challenges there on the regulatory and legislative side. We have
some challenges in some of the PIP trends. We've taken firm and decisive action there. I do not believe we've
overreacted there. We're trying to reposition and stabilize and ensure that when we begin growing that it is all
profitable growth. And so I actually think the team and the agents in those two regions have done exceptionally well in
managing through very difficult circumstances and still maintaining good customer relationships and good customer
satisfaction. So I don't feel like we've overshot the target. I think that we hit pretty much the bull's-eye on both of those
and we'll continue our efforts in a careful, disciplined way.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: There were some reserve changes, too.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Okay, thanks for pointing that out. Thank you very much and have another good quarter
in 2Q.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Thank you, we hope to.

Our next question is from Jay Gelb from Barclays; your question, please.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thanks and good morning. I was wondering if you can talk about two issues. First, in Allstate
brand standard auto PIF, how much time do you think it will take to turn the corner to get to flat on PIF?
And then my second question is on Esurance. With a 128 combined ratio and about a $50 million underwriting loss, I'm
just trying to get a sense when you feel we might see signs of improvement there, maybe even heading towards
breakeven on the underwriting front?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We'll just say we don't want to do forecasts of growth, so we're working our way through it.
Unfortunately, I'm not going to give an answer on when we expect that to turn. But we are, obviously, hard at work.
Matt's team segmented – we do provide some information on where we're growing outside of areas where we have big
challenges like New York and Florida.
On Esurance, there's a bunch of purchase accounting stuff in there, so the combined ratio is really 106 when you strip
out all the other stuff. And we do provide – we added a new sheet to the investor supplement which has the loss ratio in
it, which should be able to give you the – which is page 26. And you can – we show in there the loss ratio, and you can
see the loss ratio is at 73. And then you can look at what we spent in marketing and you could do some estimates. We
do that so that you can see that we believe we're writing it at an economic rate that we're not just growing in funding by
giving the business away.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: How long does that amortization expense continue on the Esurance business?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: Less than five years.

<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. And then on the PIF, I understand where you're coming from. I don't know if you disclosed
what the Allstate brand standard auto PIF change would have been ex-New York and Florida or ex the underwriting
actions taken in homeowners.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: You can see the first piece. You can't see the second piece. But you should assume that Matt
has depth and understanding behind his comment that in those places where we take homeowner rates above 10%, we
have growth challenges in those places. Where it's less than 10%, we feel pretty good about our business.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes, the only thing I'd add, Jay, is it gets lost here, but we did grow auto PIF year over -year
first quarter in 24 states. So a lot of what you see is an aggregation, driven by a couple large states with a lot of rate
action taking place there that is causing a decline.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: I see, understood. Thank you.

Your next question is from Alison Jacobowitz of Bank of America; your question, please.
<Q - Alison Marnie Jacobowitz>: Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been touched on. But I was wondering if
you could talk some maybe about some of the smaller operations you have like Encompass and maybe the non-standard
side. Is there any opportunity there to turn things more dramatically around?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I'll start with what we would call, Alison – first, good morning. I'll start with what we would
label as our emerging businesses. Don might want to talk a little bit about some further growth in Esurance, other
things they can do there. Matt can talk about non-standard because there are a number of places where we are pushing
on growth.
Going back to our customers, we do believe that our customers want to buy in the Allstate channel a wide variety of
products. So we're doing quite well in motorcycles right now. We need to do better in a wider variety of stuff. We're
doing great in Good Hands Roadside, which is our pay-as-you-go roadside thing that we launched on a national basis as
part of Grow to Win last year. And so that business that we would call consumer household business and our motor
club business are doing well. We think we can continue to accelerate growth in those areas.
Encompass, when you look at it over the last four years, Encompass is a significant portion of the declines we have in
total premiums. We did not properly position that business in that channel, which are people want local advice but are
less concerned about who the company is. And they tend to be a little more price sensitive. So we got the wrong
business; we got it through the wrong agency owners. We've repositioned that business. You see a small growth in that
business in the first quarter of this year. I'm not satisfied that we have that completely positioned yet to grow. They
have more work to do. But we believe there's upside there because if we just get back what we lost, we'll pick up about
$700 million or $800 million of premium, so that's good growth.
Don, I don't know if you want to talk about potential to add products to Esurance and the positioning of the risk profile
in terms of preferred. Don, maybe you can go to non-standard and if you want to say anything else.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yes, Alison, it's Don Civgin. We've only had Esurance for one full quarter now. But I would tell
you I think we are just as happy as the day we made the announcement, if not more, at this point when we look at what
the opportunity – the breakout opportunity to your question is with Esurance. A lot of good things are taking place. The
integration is going quite well. Some of that is going be efforts to reduce costs so that we're taking advantage of scale
and process improvements and claims. Contract renegotiations have been very fruitful as well.
Tom is right. We're looking at launching a series of new additional products for Esurance, increasing the number of
states that they will be operating in because, if you'll recall, when we acquired them they were not in all 50 states. And
we are adding the benefit of our deep pricing knowledge, particularly as it relates to our customer segment, which is a
little bit different than theirs.

So none of that is rolled out yet; it's all going be part of the customer value proposition over the next year or two as it
grows. But I would tell you even in the first quarter, now we don't report year-over-year results because we didn't own
them a year ago. But if you look at their gross written premium compared to when White Mountains reported them last
year, they're up 6.5% in the first quarter. That's the result of some advertising and a new campaign and so forth. But
when you ask is there a breakout opportunity, I think there's a substantial opportunity for Esurance as they build the
value proposition around their customer.
<A - Matthew Winter>: This is Matt, Alison. I'll touch on non-standard a little bit. We've shown a slight improvement
in new business over prior year. We stabilized the Allstate Blue states, and we've had a little bit of a surge in new
business in the non-Allstate Blue states. But nevertheless, gross 30-day retention continues to decline and our items in
force continued to decline. We've slowed that down a little bit.
I've asked our group to take a very long, hard look at ways of getting more substantially back in what I'll call the near
non-standard or the near-standard niche here; possibly not the full non-standard all the way down market, but those
borderline cases. And so we will do a fair amount of work over the next three to six months to assess our opportunity
there. It's an area that I think has great long-term potential if done right and if done in a disciplined, careful manner,
which include some variations on the business model and how you bill and how some of the underwriting rules are
executed. And so I see it as a growth opportunity that we should be very careful about how we tap into so that we do it
right because, as I said before, growth without the profitability destroys shareholder value, and we're about building
shareholder value.
<Q - Alison Marnie Jacobowitz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from Dan Johnson of Citadel; your question, please.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe could you put a little more insight into the
alternative asset strategy that you've moved the accounting a little bit on? Just tell us a little bit about how big and what
you're interested in doing there, and then maybe just an update on the agent consolidation strategy. Can you throw out
some numbers in terms of where you're at on that? Thank you very much.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: Dan, it's Judy Greffin, and I can talk a little bit about what we're doing in alternative and
private assets. So, if you think about where we are today, we have a mix of private equity, private real estate, real assets
and infrastructure, as well as hedge funds. And we've had a longstanding program in private equity. We continue and
expect to have a longstanding program in private equity. Don't expect that one to grow that much over the next 12 to 24
months. Private real estate and real assets and infrastructure, though, we are growing those. We look at those as an
opportunity to own some good assets as well as assets that generate some cash flow. So we look at that and say that's a
nice alternative in this low rate environment to own some assets directly.
And then within hedge funds, we have reduced our exposure to hedge funds and expect that we'll look at that more
opportunistically into the future. So that is the total of those assets. And the reason why we're increasing the real assets
and real estate really has to do with not just the low interest rate environment, but also the strategy for Allstate
Financial, which we talked about earlier. And we look at those assets as a nice fit to our long-dated liabilities and see
that as a long-term asset choice for us.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Great.
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: Dan, this is Steve. What Judy has described is really the reason we moved the EMA income
from realized capital gains up to [ph] net (47:58) investment income. It's really much more closely aligned with our
operating income than it has been for the last several years.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Do we have the historical data set on that? Like if we went back into the AOCI or something,
can we see the earnings that have generated from those assets?

<A - Steven E. Shebik>: Yes, you can see that in the investor supplement and the 10-Qs going back by year and by
quarter.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Great. And, Judy, in terms of new money yields on more traditional fixed income investments,
what are we seeing today versus the average yields?
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: So our new money proxies for the property/casualty portfolio, which we keep around a
five-year, is around 2.75%. New money proxy for Allstate Financial, which is a little bit longer, is around 3.5%.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: And, Dan, I'll make an overall comment on the agency consolidation, then Matt might want
to talk about some things he has going on. First, the agency consolidation makes it sound like we don't want everybody.
Everybody counts. You can be a big agency. You can be a middle agency. You can be a new agency. We are seeking to
have all of them be more successful on behalf of our customers. And so we have programs around there. I think the net
of that is some people have chosen to leave, so we have fewer. But it's not like we're trying to get rid of a certain class
of agencies. If you're taking care of our customers, we're happy. We have to help you, support you, because bigger
agencies do have more capability, so we're helping to build those. Matt's got work going to help build the efforts or
capabilities for other agencies as well. Matt, maybe you want to talk about some of that.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Sure. So at a high level, there's such a diversity in markets and geographies that we cover that
having some artificial numbers about what is the appropriate size agency just makes no sense in a system like ours. So,
what we're all about doing, and
what Tom is referring to is creating an economically viable agency that's able to appropriately serve their customers
and grow and develop, so that these are vibrant businesses that are really serving Allstate customers the way they
deserve to be served.
And so we're allowing the economics of the system to drive things. And so in a lot of cases, we have smaller agencies
that see a path to getting to the right size for them in their geography to be supportable. And we're helping them every
step of the way, and we'd love them to grow. So we don't really have, in my opinion, an agency consolidation strategy.
We have an agency health strategy to help all of our agencies become vibrant, economically self-sufficient, and capable
of serving customers.
Next week in Las Vegas, we have a conference. We have opened up that conference. It was typically a recognition
conference for people who achieved a certain level of production. We've opened it up to additional non-qualifiers who
are paying their own way to go there. And we have over 4,000 attendees, from agency owners and exclusive financial
specialists who have attended, of which 44% of them are paying their – I'm sorry – 44% of them, this will be their first
national conference of any type, which is very powerful.
It's an opportunity for people who have not achieved levels of success that would have allowed them to attend a
recognition conference before be around people who have and learn best practices from their peers and colleagues,
exchange ideas in how to approach and serve the marketplace. And so we're really excited about that. And we, in fact,
have workshops and seminars available for every size agency there to help them all be successful. So I think we did a
bad job previously on explaining our strategy if you think of it is a consolidation strategy, because I don't...
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: I apologize for belaboring the question. But I thought the idea was to bring larger scale to the
agencies to help drive, a) customer satisfaction, which had waned a bit, but also basically economic efficiencies.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: That is true, Dan. And certainly the bigger you are, the better it is – easier to do that. But I
think what got lost in that translation was we can do some of that centrally for our agencies, so that even if you only
have 1,800 accounts, we can make you look and feel like a 3,000-account agency.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Great, I appreciate the answers, guys.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Sorry, okay.

Our next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair; your question, please.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks, good morning. My question is around buybacks. You're obviously making more
money. You have additional [ph] bid (53:08) capacity and the [ph] exposures (53:10) are shrinking. What's the
possibility to accelerate the current buyback? And longer term, what's the potential to actually increase the level of
buyback? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I think if you look at our track record, you'd see we – if we don't have a good use for the
capital we give it back to shareholders. You're correct in saying this is an accelerated pace on this one. This $1 billion
program was to be done by February 2013 and we're obviously ahead of pace on that. We just thought the stock was so
cheap, we just thought we ought to be buying it back faster. So we rushed and did it. We're making good money. We
still have – when we get done with this authorization, then we'll figure out where we're going next.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Okay, and one quick follow-up. You said that Texas auto loss ratio popped up. Is that
tornadoes, or is there some other issue in Texas?
<A - Matthew Winter>: It's cats and weather. It's tornadoes, it's hail, and it's actually rain in some areas.

Our next question is from Alan Straus of Schroders; your question, please..
<Q - Alan H. Straus>: Yes. Given the powerful cash flow, is the notion of issuing the preferred off the table again, or
is it still out there? Are you thinking about it?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Alan, this is Tom. When we announced the $1 billion share repurchase, we said there were
three places we would source the capital from. First was we had deployable capital at the holding company level.
Second, we said we obviously will have earnings. And we said if those are not enough, then we will issue the preferred.
Obviously, given what has happened with earnings, we haven't seen the need to that, so we don't feel like we need to
issue it at this point in time.

Our next question's from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital; your question, please.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Hi, just two if I may. The other personal lines segment, Tom, the combined ex-cats,
ex-development was the best in I think five years. Can you just talk about what went on in that line? And just is that
trendable, or were there some one-time benefits?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Overall personal lines?
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: No, other personal line segments, so the non-auto, non-home.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Other personal lines; I would say one quarter does not make – they had a good quarter.
There are some portions of that business that are not operating as well as we would like them to be. So for example in
there, you have manufactured housing and a few other things which we're not yet well priced on. We have some
businesses that we like a lot. There are seven or eight things. They're headed in the right direction. Last year, we had an
underwriting loss on those businesses, in large part because of catastrophes. But even when you exclude catastrophes,
we thought we could run a higher profit margin in those businesses given where the competitors are, and so we have

some work to do still. But we feel good. They had a good quarter, so we're happy about it.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Any particular lines that drove the outperformance; motorcycles or commercial or anything
like that?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: No.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Was it broad-based?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: No, it was pretty broad-based.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Okay, great, and then just one other one. On the idea of turning around the PIF, honestly I'm
not trying to pin you down on a number or timing, but just what initiatives are going to drive it? Obviously, you've
talked a little about the agency issues. But beyond that, are New York and Florida now able to start growing? Are they
fixed enough where you feel like you can start turning up the market support there? I think you mentioned in a prior
meeting about expanding the bull's-eye a little bit I guess to try to target some more customers who maybe you have
been giving a negative price test before. What are the initiatives that we're going to see? When PIF gets better, what are
going to be the reasons?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I would say Matt and his team have a whole variety of initiatives going on relative to
growth, most of which you've talked about. The one that we haven't spent as much time talking about either on the
positive or negative side is retention. Part of Grow to Win, which I think I've mischaracterized publicly, Grow to Win
was really one task component of our overall business strategy. And then we had more marketing programs for
customers. We wanted to launch Good Hands Roadside on a national basis. We wanted to do a number of local
programs to engage agencies in growth. And we had a program focused on retention, which we had our employees
calling out on behalf of the agencies. We called 1 million customers. And so the retention part is something that we're
hard at work on. It's a little difficult when you're doing things like New York and Florida and you're raising homeowner
rates to get overall retention. But I would say that's the other part of our growth program which you didn't mention.
And then Matt talked about non-standard.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes. I guess you mentioned broadening the target. And in fact, we are rolling out some
refinements to our auto pricing state by state that will have the impact of broadening the target. In the first state that it
rolled out in, the first pilot, it improved close rates by just over two percentage points, so that was very encouraging.
We have a carefully thought out rollout plan for this year of that capability. Don't forget we also have Claim
Satisfaction Guarantee that's being rolled out. We have a tremendous number of initiatives. We're trying not to
overwhelm the field with initiatives, yet provide growth oriented initiatives where they're most needed.
My firm belief is as the need for taking rate and doing reinspections and rate reclassifications, et cetera, diminishes, it
will free up agent time and agent capacity to focus on the things they like doing the most, which is growing and serving
their customers. So we feel like the trend line is good. It's hard to tell you exactly when we're "ready to grow" in New
York and Florida, but we're on the right path.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Matt, do you think this is a particularly good time to be broadening that appetite given two
of your largest competitors seem to pulling back a little bit due to their margin issues?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Very good, thank you.

Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore; your question, please.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Hi, good morning. On the homeowners, we've seen the decline in frequency and severity. How
much of that was because of the underwriting actions you've taken, and can we expect to see that in the future?

<A - Matthew Winter>: Vinay, I mentioned earlier that whether it's 60:40 or 50:50, some percentage is temporary due
to weather and cat, and some is very sustainable due to rates, inspections, correct class actions, non-renewals, the
actions we're taking to ensure that we're increasing what I'd call the underwriting muscle in that line. And so I think it's
very sustainable, and I think we're feeling very good about it.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: That's great. Just to follow up on New York and Florida, personal auto, those states seem to be
fixed. When do you think that you guys can – about having flatter PIF growth in those two states?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Everyone keeps circling around this one. If you look at the business model in the way it
renews and that customer flows work, it takes a while to overcome declines in retention and declines in new business,
so I don't think you should expect to see those turn around soon. We're obviously working on them. They're different in
each market. Florida's got some new legislation passed. Florida's also got some pricing components to that, so we're
watching that one closely.
New York we feel good about the operational position we're in. It's little less fluid in terms of being able to adjust if
you don't have it quite right. And we have a relatively sizable decline in both retention and new business. Now we've
rolled out some new pricing in New York. So we're about growing in the right way, but I don't think you should expect
to see us start talking about growth including New York and Florida being up in the near term.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Thank you.
<A - Robert Block>: We're going to take one more question.

Our final question today is from Brian Meredith of UBS; your question, please.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Hey, good morning. It will just be a quick one here for you all. On the paid severity going
on in the quarter, I know last quarter you talked about used car parts inflation causing that to move up. Is that still the
case? And do you think that's going to continue here for another couple quarters, or is it an aberration here?
<A - Matthew Winter>: This is Matt, Brian. Yes, we saw the third consecutive month that the Manheim Index showed
an increase in used car prices. In fact, every month of that quarter we saw increasing used car prices, which certainly
drove some of it. We also, remember, had a very good weather quarter, which decreased the number of small
fender-benders, so that the accidents that occurred tended to be the larger ones not related to weather. And I'd say that's
the predominant piece. BI is moving along with the relevant index, the medical CPI, and PIP is within our expectations.
So the thing that we're pretty focus on is PD severity. Frequency looks relatively benign with gasoline prices, and the
continued benefits from New York and Florida.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Brian, it's Tom. If you want to look at used car prices over a longer period of time, there are
some measures out there. And what you would see is that from 1999 through 2009, they were down slightly, flat over
that entire ten-year period, which of course happened to coincide with massive amounts of new car production and
sales in the United States. Of course then in 2009 when new car sales went way down, then you saw the opposite. So
our job is not to predict that but is to react to it. That's exactly what Matt's team is doing
Robert Block
Okay, thank you all for joining us today. We're off to a good start in 2012. We obviously have more work ahead of us
this year, but we do have our four priorities we're focusing on, which is maintain our auto profitability, raise returns in
homeowners and annuity businesses, grow insurance premiums, and then proactively manage our investments and
capital. Successful execution of those will keep driving shareholder value up. Thank you and we'll talk to you next
quarter.
