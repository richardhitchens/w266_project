I would now like to introduce Mr. John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs.
John B. Thomas
Good morning and thanks for join us. Today we'll discuss our third quarter ongoing earnings results as well as provide
new information regarding the separation of Abbott's proprietary pharmaceutical business into a new independent
company called AbbVie.
Joining me on today's call is Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Abbott; Tom
Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Abbott; Rick Gonzalez, who will become
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of AbbVie; Bill Chase, who will become Executive Vice President,

Also joining on today's call is Brian Yoor, who will become the new head of the Investor Relations at Abbott
post-separation. Brian has been with Abbott in numerous financial roles for 15 years, most recently as Controller of our
Diagnostics division. Larry Peepo, who is also on today's call, will remain Divisional Vice President, Investor
Relations at Abbott. I will be moving over to AbbVie to head Investor Relations and Public Affairs.
Today, Miles will begin with an update on the separation as well as our outlook for the new Abbott. Tom will provide a
brief overview of our third quarter performance and then provide some additional context for how we're planning to
launch two new independent companies in January of next year, including their respective capital structures as well as
annual dividends. He'll also provide some additional detail on 2013 for the new Abbott. Following Miles, Tom and
Rick will provide an overview of AbbVie and its future outlook, and Bill will cover AbbVie's third quarter results and
provide some further context on 2013. Following our comments, as we normally do, we'll take any questions you might
have.
Before we get started, some statements may be forward looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, including the planned separation of the research based pharmaceutical company from the
diversified medical products company and the expected financial results of the two companies after the separation.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual
results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and there is no assurance as to the
timing of the planned separation or whether it will be completed.
Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are
discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2011, and the interim reports filed on Form 10-Q for subsequent quarterly periods. Abbott
undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent
events or developments.
In today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our
website at Abbott.com.
And with that I'll now turn the call over to Miles. Miles?
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, John, good morning.
One year ago this week, we announced the most significant transformational event in Abbott's 125-year history, our
decision to separate into two leading public healthcare companies with completely new and unique investment
identities. So today in addition to reviewing our third quarter earnings, we're going to give you some additional insight
into what these two companies will look like going forward beginning in 2013.
With regard to our third quarter results, Abbott delivered another quarter of strong performance, with ongoing earnings
per share growth of more than 10%. In addition to generating strong operating results, we are continuing to prepare for
separation. We've completed a significant amount of work since last October, and both companies are ready to operate
independently beginning January 1.
Over the past year, we've taken a number of steps to prepare AbbVie to become a new company. We've named the
leadership team, designating several senior leaders who will move from Abbott to AbbVie, which will complement the
strong commercial and operational leaders who are currently part of our proprietary pharmaceutical business.
As we announced last year, Rick Gonzalez will become AbbVie's Chairman and CEO. Rick has more than 30 years of
Abbott experience and has been Executive Vice President of our Global Pharmaceuticals business for the last two
years. Laura Schumacher, Abbott's current Executive Vice President and General Counsel and a more than 20-year

Abbott veteran, will lead that function at AbbVie as well as a number of corporate functions, including licensing and
acquisitions, external affairs, and investor relations. And Bill Chase, who is currently Vice President of Licensing and
Acquisitions at Abbott, will become AbbVie's CFO. Bill has been at Abbott for more than 20 years, also serving as
Corporate Treasurer and the Controller of the International Pharmaceutical division.
We've also continued to strengthen AbbVie's mid and late-stage pipelines since our separation announcement last year,
and we've seen impressive progress from later-stage development programs such as hepatitis C, which you heard a little
bit about earlier this week.
In addition to an advancing pipeline, we understand that investors do seek a positive return while that pipeline
continues to progress. As you know, AbbVie generates robust cash flow and is committed to returning cash to
shareholders. AbbVie is expected to pay a strong, attractive dividend, which Tom and Bill will discuss in more detail
later in the call.
So the separation we announced one year ago is nearing completion, and our shareholders will soon benefit from two
fundamentally different investment opportunities with distinct strategic profiles and business priorities.
The AbbVie Form 10 has provided some perspective on the pre-separation financial profile of AbbVie, and a Form 10
amendment filed last month outlined the AbbVie capital structure and pro forma interest expense. We recognize that
investors and analysts need more information to help them model both companies separately. So as a next step in this
process, today we'll provide some additional information on separation related aspects of the AbbVie P&L, including
the tax rate, interest expense, and costs for AbbVie to run as an independent company. We'll also provide some other
aspects of the P&L profile for both companies.
Although it's too soon for specific 2013 EPS guidance, our intent is to help you establish a baseline for both companies,
each of which will have a different profile after the separation. Tom and Bill will cover the profiles for the two
companies in their remarks.
We've structured both companies for future success and have taken the actions necessary to support the unique
attributes of each company. AbbVie will be a large cap biopharmaceutical company with a number of differentiated
growth brands, including a sustainable biologic, HUMIRA, and a compelling pipeline. It generates significant cash
flow and will have the appropriate capital structure to support strong returns for shareholders, including a strong
dividend.
As you know, I will continue to serve as Chairman and CEO of Abbott, so let me take a few minutes now to provide
some brief comments on what the new Abbott will look like in the future. As of the first of next year, Abbott will be
one of the largest diversified healthcare products companies in the industry. It will be comprised of four roughly equal
sized businesses: Nutritionals, Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Diagnostics, all competing in large
markets and aligned with favorable long-term healthcare trends. Our pipeline includes transformational medical
technologies, next-generation diagnostics systems, new formulations, new packaging, new flavors, and other brand
enhancements. Our geographic mix is very well balanced, with one of the largest emerging market revenue bases of
any large cap healthcare company.
With leadership positions across this portfolio, expanding margins, and strong cash flow, Abbott will be well
positioned among its peers to deliver top tier growth. We've made a number of important strides in 2012 to continue to
position Abbott for long-term growth: launching our bioresorbable vascular scaffold, ABSORB, in Europe, parts of
Asia, and Latin America; breaking ground on manufacturing plants in India and China; completing 60 launches year to
date across our Nutrition business around the world; consistently driving above-market growth in core Diagnostics; and
implementing a number of geographic and product expansion initiatives in the Established Pharmaceuticals division,
just to name a few.
At the same time, it's well recognized that all of us are managing through a difficult business environment. Like other
multinationals that have a significant global presence, we've been impacted by a slowing global economy both in the
developed world as well as in emerging markets. In particular, we saw pricing and market pressures in Europe impact
our businesses more significantly this quarter.

Foreign currency has also been a headwind on sales throughout the year. This resulted in somewhat lower Abbott sales
growth than originally anticipated, yet we continued to deliver on our financial commitments.
While we face the same market environmental challenges as our healthcare peers, we've structured Abbott to have the
right portfolio of businesses and geographic diversity to take advantage of favorable trends ahead of us in healthcare.
So as we look to 2013 and beyond, let me walk you through our long-term growth strategies to provide additional
insights on how the new Abbott will generate growth over the next several years. I'll begin with Nutrition, which
produces tremendous cash flow and a high return on invested capital.
We're a leader in global nutrition, participating in a compelling growth market that's approximately $35 billion today,
expected to exceed $50 billion by 2016. It's driven by favorable demographics such as an aging population and the
under-penetration of nutritional products, given the increasing rate of chronic diseases as well as the rise of the
emerging market middle class. Our long-term strategy in Nutrition is to drive strong top line growth by building our
product portfolio with a steady rhythm of innovative, differentiated new product launches, expanding aggressively in
key high-growth emerging markets, and leveraging our number one global position in adult nutrition to grow and
further penetrate the market.
At the same time, we plan to significantly improve our gross and operating margins. We've made good progress. In the
U.S. year to date, we've continued to drive double-digit growth of our key pediatric and adult nutritionals by refreshing
and improving our brands with products like PediaSure Clear, Similac with Lutein, Ensure Clear, and Glucerna Hunger
Smart.
Outside of the U.S., we're investing in the product pipeline and the infrastructure, including state-of-the-art
manufacturing facilities in China and India to drive share gains in key markets. China is the world's largest pediatric
nutritional market at more than $7 billion, and it's expected to grow over the next five years. We have ample
opportunity to improve our share position in this market and others.
And finally, the global adult nutrition market is expanding as the world's population ages, life expectancy increases,
and the unfortunate incidence of age-related diseases rises. Our global leadership position in adult nutrition is a clear
competitive advantage as we further develop and shape this market.
In addition to driving sales growth, we're improving how we do business in Nutrition so that it's more profitable. We
expect to improve our operating margin from the low teens in 2011 to our target of more than 20% by 2015. This is
something that we've successfully achieved in Diagnostics, and we're showing good progress now in Nutrition. We're
reducing raw material and packaging costs, improving manufacturing processes, and building more efficient plants
closer to our customers, simplifying our distribution, and ensuring the products, customers, and markets that we invest
in are profitable.
In 2012, we expect to deliver approximately 200 basis points of expansion in our Nutrition operating margin. We're
confident in our ability to deliver on our longer-term objective as we have implemented a number of our planned
actions in 2012, and we expect to continue our progress in 2013.
In our Established Pharmaceuticals division, home to our branded generics business, we're generating international
sales from a large and growing portfolio of hundreds of products that have broad use throughout the world. EPD is
more like our Nutrition business than it is Proprietary Pharmaceuticals. It has a development organization that moves
fast to refresh and improve key brands, and it markets products to customers in the developing world who typically pay
out of pocket for their healthcare. In many of these markets, despite the expiration of patents, product growth is
sustained by brand equity, which is established by customer trust in products that are reliably supplied of high quality,
affordable, and tailored to the needs of each market.
EPD is relatively new organization within Abbott, in place for less than two years now, where we have a number of
early-stage geographic and product expansion initiatives now underway. Our long-term growth strategy is to increase
the breadth of our product offerings by launching new and improved formulations and registering products across
multiple geographies, reinforce our position in the developed markets through portfolio expansion, and accelerate and

capture new sources of growth by targeting faster growing emerging markets where we have strong positions. In fact,
operational sales growth in key BRIC markets, which comprise more than a third of EPD sales, increased nearly 20%
year to date.
While austerity measures have negatively impacted EPD sales in Europe, as faster growing emerging markets become a
larger percentage of EPD's sales base, we expect to see improving growth for EPD to achieve our long-term target of
mid to high single-digit sales growth.
Next, I'll cover Medical Devices, which includes our Diabetes Care, Vision Care, and Vascular businesses. In Diabetes
Care, we're advancing our new product pipeline with products such as FreeStyle Insulinx, with the goal of simplifying
the glucose testing process. And we've improved operating margin with a shift to more profitable channels and
customers, streamlining of our manufacturing, better sales force execution, and more efficient SG&A spending.
In Vision Care, we are leaders in the refractive segment and number two in cataract. Our cataract business is the
largest, most profitable, and fastest growing of our Vision Care businesses. We're launching new products to continue
to grow our share in this segment as well as capture growth in countries such as India and China, where we're
introducing new products tailored to these specific markets.
And in Vascular, our growth strategies focus on expanding our leadership positions across our three business segments,
Coronary, Structural Heart, and Endovascular. This includes targeting emerging markets where interventional
procedures are growing double digits, driven by an aging population with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease.
Penetration rates in emerging markets are also much lower than the developed world and have the potential to
significantly expand with increased awareness and improved treatment of heart disease. Emerging markets comprise
more than 20% of Vascular sales and on an operational basis have increased 20% year to date.
In our Coronary segment, we're focused on expanding our global drug-eluting stent leadership position. This year we've
launched XIENCE PRIME in Japan and XIENCE Xpedition in Europe. Xpedition combines the impressive safety and
efficacy of XIENCE PRIME and sets a new standard for deliverability. We are on track to launch Xpedition in the U.S.
early next year.
In September we launched in Europe and other international markets ABSORB, our BVS [Bioresorbable Vascular
Scaffold] technology or bio-absorbable technology that acts like a drug-eluting stent; but unlike a metallic stent has the
added benefit of slowly absorbing over time, much like sutures do after a wound heals. The result is a vessel that can
naturally flex and pulse similar to an untreated one. ABSORB puts Abbott in a unique position to offer the only
technology of this kind.
In our Structural Heart business, MitraClip is an example of how Abbott is pushing the transcatheter valve market
forward with a first-of-a-kind technology. MitraClip can have a dramatic impact for many of the hundreds of thousands
of patients who experience a diminished quality of life from significant mitral regurgitation, which is the leaking of the
heart's mitral valve. It's on the market in Europe and we're working to bring it to other markets around the world,
including the U.S. It has significant long-term potential given the number of patients who go untreated today.
And finally, our Endovascular segment represents a significant opportunity for growth. We're applying our expertise in
developing best-in-class coronary devices to the faster growing endovascular market. Today, Abbott is
under-penetrated in this market that's growing at a high single-digit rate. We expect growth in this segment to improve
with numerous new product launches and new indications over the next several years. We're also evaluating our
bio-absorbable technology for use in the periphery.
The last of our four major segments is Diagnostics where, year to date, operational sales growth is in excess of 7% and
operating margin continues to improve. Our relevant global in-vitro diagnostics market is very large at nearly $30
billion. While diagnostics comprise less than 5% of hospital costs, their findings influence the majority of healthcare
decision-making. Abbott is well positioned with global leadership in the largest segment, immunoassay diagnostics.
We've successfully improved cash flow generation and profitability in our core Laboratory Diagnostics business and
have now refocused our long-term growth strategy on the top line as well.

We're leveraging our global leadership position to capture growth in emerging markets. One of the largest opportunities
is China, a nearly $2 billion market that's growing roughly 20%. We've been consistently growing near double the
market pace as we expand our share. We're delivering customized solutions that deliver results more efficiently, and
we're launching next-generation platforms over the next few years. We haven't seen market changing innovation in
Diagnostics in more than a decade, and we expect to lead this effort as we expand our product portfolio significantly.
Molecular and point-of-care diagnostics round out our diverse portfolio of Diagnostics offerings. These businesses
allow us to develop solutions for newly identified disease targets, predict patient outcomes, and perform bedside testing
to accelerate treatment decisions. We're growing both businesses as we increase penetration of systems and tests and
expand in emerging markets.
Margin improvement has been and continues to be a key focus in Diagnostics. From 2007 to 2011, we improved our
operating margin from 8% of sales to more than 18% of sales, more than doubling the operating margin in dollar terms.
Our long-term goal had been to exceed 20% of sales by 2015. We're ahead of schedule in our progress toward this goal
as we continue to expand the gross and operating margin profile of our core Laboratory Diagnostics business. Year to
date, Diagnostics operating margin is more than 19% of sales, and we now expect to well exceed our long-term target
over the next several years.
So in summary, over the last 12 months we've prepared both Abbott and AbbVie to be successful independent
companies come January 1. AbbVie will be well positioned within its pharmaceutical peer group with a strong dividend
and an advancing late-stage pipeline that's getting increased visibility, and that's certainly evidenced by the very strong
HCV data released earlier this week.
The new Abbott will be one of the largest diversified healthcare investment opportunities and over the long term one of
the fastest growing. But like all multinationals, we're managing through a more difficult economic environment now.
And this year, we're making a number of business transitions that put Abbott in a better position going forward. This
includes working through the decline in Promus revenues, initiating a number of geographic and product expansion
initiatives in EPD, and simplifying our Nutritional supply chain. We're making good progress on all fronts.
As we look to the future, we see tremendous opportunity ahead. Our businesses, the majority of them in leadership
positions, are aligned with favorable demographics that will be driving growth in healthcare. We are well balanced
geographically, including a broad base of customers, many in emerging markets where income levels are rising and
socioeconomic conditions are vastly improving. And we'll maintain Abbott's financial heritage with robust cash flow
generation, upwards of $4 billion, and significant opportunity for further operating margin expansion. All told, the new
Abbott will be well positioned among its peers to deliver top tier growth.
So now let me turn the call over to Tom, who will provide a brief overview of Abbott's third quarter results and the
outlook for the remainder of the year. He'll also cover key financial aspects of the separation, including capital structure
and dividend for both companies, and 2013 financial profile information for new Abbott. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Miles.
Today, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.30, an increase of 10.2% over the
prior year and above our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.1% on an operational basis, which
was more than offset by an unfavorable 4.5% impact from exchange rates. As we saw last quarter, there continues to be
a significant impact from exchange on top line results. Emerging markets remain a significant growth contributor, with
sales in the quarter of $2.6 billion, an increase of more than 10% on an operational basis.
Regarding sales for what will become the new Abbott businesses, there have been two factors that are transitional in
nature that have impacted growth trends. The first is the decline in the Promus related revenue in our Vascular
business, as we no longer provide product under the previous distribution agreement. And the second is the shift to
direct distribution in certain international nutrition markets as part of our gross margin improvement initiative.

Excluding these transitional factors, new Abbott operational sales growth is in the mid-single digits year to date.
We saw continued improvement in the adjusted gross margin to 63.8% in the quarter, up 340 basis points from the prior
year. Half of this improvement was due to exchange, while the other half resulted from the various margin
improvement initiatives we're implementing across our businesses. Year to date, we've seen our adjusted gross margin
ratio increase 310 basis points over the prior year, with nearly half of this improvement driven by the effect of
exchange, changes in foreign exchange rates on the ratio. Again, the remainder of this improvement resulted from our
margin improvement initiatives.
Those of you who have followed our results over the years know that the extreme volatility in exchange rates has both
positively and negatively impacted the adjusted gross margin ratio, depending on the year, by as much as a full
percentage point or more. You may recall that 2010 was favorably impacted, 2011 negatively impacted, and we are
again seeing a favorable effect this year through three quarters. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect this
trend to reverse, with exchange negatively impacting the ratio by as much as a full percentage point. As we see things
today, we'd expect this trend to continue into next year, with exchange negatively impacting the gross margin ratio for
both Abbott and AbbVie.
Turning to our full-year 2012 outlook, we're narrowing our ongoing earnings per share guidance range to $5.06 to
$5.08, reflecting growth of 8.8% at the midpoint. This 2012 guidance continues to reflect a full-year outlook for the
company in total, as the separation is expected to be effective January 1. We're pleased with our overall performance
this year, delivering ongoing earnings per share growth ahead of our original guidance provided back in January despite
the challenging global economy and currency headwinds affecting sales.
Regarding the fourth quarter, we expect reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits, which includes an
estimated negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Both our fourth quarter sales forecast and EPS expectations for
the year assume that a generic TriCor enters the market in the fourth quarter. We expect a gross margin ratio of around
63%, including the exchange effect discussed earlier.
As we are now further along in our separation process, as Miles indicated, today we're in a position to give you some
more information regarding certain aspects of the financial profiles of new Abbott and AbbVie once separated. While
we're providing this additional information today, I'd again note that it's too early in the process for either company to
provide EPS guidance for 2013. Between now and January, we'll continue our usual planning process, for the profile
information we provide for each company today could change somewhat over the coming months. Each company will
be ready by its fourth quarter earnings conference call to provide more specific details of its 2013 outlook, including
EPS guidance. Those forecasts will reflect the latest assumptions on business and economic factors, including foreign
exchange.
As we've previously indicated, the primary rationale for the separation is the fact that these two businesses have
evolved differently, and as a result they have different investment identities. These differences are broad and deep, and
they affect how each company plans to structure and run its business going forward. So let me start with dividend
policy.
The dividend has always been an important component of Abbott's investment identity. We had previously indicated
that we expected the combined dividend of the two companies to be at least equal to Abbott's pre-separation annual
dividend. And we expect AbbVie to be even more focused on shareholder returns in the form of dividends, paying a
larger portion of the dividend.
With this in mind, today we're announcing that we expect AbbVie to pay an annual dividend of $1.60 per share,
starting with the quarterly dividend to be paid in February. This, like all dividends, will be subject to approval by the
future AbbVie Board in January of 2013.
We're also announcing that we expect the new Abbott dividend to be $0.56 per share, in line with its peer group and
growth prospects, again starting with the dividend to be paid in February and again subject to approval by the Abbott
Board. In the end, this combined annual dividend rate of $2.16 for the two companies exceeds the current annual
dividend rate of $2.04, and this increase is expected to be implemented one quarter earlier than in past years.

Regarding debt and related interest expense, as Miles indicated, last month we provided the pro forma capital structure
for AbbVie and an amendment to the Form 10. Consistent with our previous commentary, the pre-separation debt has
been apportioned roughly in line with each company's share of the pre-separation cash flows after dividends and capital
expenditures.
As a reminder, this rebalancing of the debt will be accomplished by the following actions. First, AbbVie is expected to
raise just under $16 billion in total debt. Second, AbbVie will provide a net cash distribution to Abbott of around $8.5
billion. And finally, Abbott will use the proceeds of that distribution to execute a tender for a portion of its debt
outstanding and to pay down a portion of its commercial paper outstanding. As a result, new Abbott expects to carry
approximately $7.5 billion in debt as of the separation date, consisting of long-term debt, commercial paper, and other
short-term borrowings. Abbott expects to have around $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet post-separation.
As detailed in our earnings news release today and as discussed last quarter, as a result of the low interest rate
environment, we expect one-time charges to be incurred in the fourth quarter related to the debt extinguishment costs,
driven by higher interest rates on the existing bonds compared to the rates currently prevailing. The resulting capital
structure of each company will determine ongoing interest expense for each going forward. For new Abbott, net
interest will be driven by its remaining debt outstanding, including the impact of existing interest rate swaps, partially
offset by interest earned on cash balances. As you know, interest earned today on cash is very low. As a result, we're
forecasting net interest expense of a little more than $100 million in 2013 for new Abbott. Bill will discuss the outlook
for AbbVie's net interest expense in a few minutes.
Regarding taxes, we believe that the tax rate for new Abbott will be approximately 21.5% in 2013. We will need to see
what, if any, Congressional actions may occur at the end of the year or the early part of 2013 that determine our final
estimate for the tax rate.
Regarding AbbVie, as an independent company focused on returns to shareholders, management plans to establish an
appropriate balance across its global cash flows to provide maximum flexibility. As a result, we expect an ongoing tax
rate of around 22% for AbbVie. While this rate is above the historical average for this business, it's reflective of a shift
in emphasis from investing in successful ex-U.S. growth opportunities in the past to a stronger emphasis on shareholder
returns going forward. This rate will support AbbVie's strong dividend policy.
We're also in a position at this time to clarify the profile of some other line items of the new Abbott P&L. Bill will
discuss AbbVie's profile in a few minutes. As we see our 2013 sales outlook today for the new Abbott, we'd expect
reported sales of roughly $23 billion based on today's exchange rates. This would reflect growth in the mid to high
single digits over where we expect to end 2012.
Regarding the gross margin for new Abbott, for modeling purposes today, we're forecasting a ratio of roughly 55%
excluding non-cash amortization, reflecting underlying business trends and the expected impact of foreign exchange
rates on the ratio I mentioned earlier. I'll discuss how we expect to report non-cash amortization expense going forward
in a moment.
We expect R&D investment for new Abbott that's in line with the investment needs of our various businesses, which
averages out to between 6% and 7% of sales. We expect the SG&A ratio to be around 30% of sales for new Abbott,
again, in line with the competitive profiles of our various businesses, with ongoing efficiency efforts to generate SG&A
leverage over time. Our outlook for SG&A includes an estimated impact from the medical device tax under the U.S.
Affordable Care Act that begins in 2013. Finally, we would expect minimal non-operating income and roughly $30
million of loss in the exchange gain loss line of the P&L in a typical year.
Before I turn it over to Rick and Bill for their thoughts on AbbVie, let me discuss a change in our reporting for next
year regarding non-cash amortization that will affect both companies. As you know, Abbott has historically recorded
non-cash amortization expense as part of cost of goods sold and included it in our non-GAAP ongoing earnings per
share metric. This expense has well exceeded $1 billion annually in recent years, as we've completed several strategic
acquisitions that have reshaped Abbott. The majority of this non-cash amortization, approximately $850 million at
$0.42 per share in 2013, relates to new Abbott. Going forward, cash EPS; that is ongoing EPS excluding the impact of

non-cash amortization, is a more meaningful non-GAAP metric for assessing new Abbott's earnings power and growth.
This is particularly true as amortization expense begins to decline in the coming years.
So beginning with the guidance to be provided for 2013, by January of next year new Abbott is expected to provide
ongoing earnings per share guidance on a cash basis. As a result, we will remove amortization from cost of goods sold
starting in 2013 in order to calculate the adjusted gross margin ratio. We will, of course, also continue to reconcile this
guidance to EPS on a GAAP basis, which would include amortization expense on specified items. AbbVie plans to use
a similar cash EPS approach as it begins to report independently next year, which Bill will cover in more detail in a few
minutes.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Rick for an overview of the prospects of AbbVie, followed by Bill who will
review the third quarter results for Proprietary Pharmaceuticals as well as the financial profile for AbbVie. Rick?
Richard A. Gonzalez
Thanks, Tom. It's a pleasure to have the opportunity this morning to discuss our strategic vision and outlook for
AbbVie.
As Miles mentioned, since the separation announcement one year ago, we have been focused on delivering strong
performance in 2012 as well as preparing to operate as an independent company. I'm pleased to say we're succeeding
on both fronts. Our research based Pharmaceutical business is delivering another strong year, with year-to-date
operational sales growth of 8%.
We're ready to begin as a new company on January 1. January 2 will be our first official day of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ABBV. Between now and then, we will continue to actively reach out
together with Abbott to the investment community at large through our road shows, our meetings, and our other
communications. Our goal is to help investors better understand our distinct investment identity. Today, we have an
opportunity to begin that dialogue.
First, it's important to understand that AbbVie is not a traditional pharmaceutical company. AbbVie will blend the
stability, global scale, resources, and commercial capabilities of a pharmaceutical company with the focus, culture, and
agility of a biotech, creating a unique biopharmaceutical company.
At launch, AbbVie will have a number of strengths and attributes that will position us well for continued success when
we begin trading as an independent company. These characteristics include: a track record of outstanding operating
performance; a specialty-focused commercial portfolio with numerous market-leading, differentiated therapies.
Foremost among them is HUMIRA, which will continue to be a significant driver of growth for AbbVie; our strong
financial foundation with annual operating cash flow of approximately $6 billion; a commitment to return cash to
shareholders, including an attractive $1.60 annualized dividend, which will be recommended for approval by the
AbbVie Board, and a commitment to grow that dividend; a compelling late-stage pipeline with several assets that have
$1 billion-plus peak revenue opportunities, including HCV and an advancing mid-stage pipeline that includes key
assets with compelling proof-of-concept human clinical data. Finally, we have a strong and experienced and highly
committed leadership team to drive AbbVie's continued success.
Before Bill discusses some financial considerations for 2013, I'd like to provide a high-level perspective on our unique
product portfolio and our advancing late-stage pipeline. I'll start with our current product portfolio, which includes a
balance of differentiated growth brands as well as sustainable performers. We compete in markets that offer significant
growth potential, and we hold strong category leadership positions in our therapeutic segments.
Certainly, HUMIRA remains the cornerstone of our portfolio and is a strong driver for AbbVie and will remain so. Not
many brands are able to achieve and sustain the level of performance we've demonstrated with HUMIRA. Clearly,
HUMIRA has a strong clinical profile. But our commercial, our development, and our regulatory execution on
HUMIRA have been outstanding. HUMIRA's performance continues to be exceptional, as evidenced by the strong
double-digit growth this year.

Several factors are driving that performance. First, strong patient demand has led to global market share gains in both
dermatology and gastroenterology. Second, the addition of new two indications for patients, UC [Ulcerative Colitis]
here in the U.S. and Europe as well as axial SpA [SpondyloArthritis] in Europe; HUMIRA now treats a total of eight
approved indications and four more in late-stage development. Finally, the global biologic market growth remains
strong, and HUMIRA continues to outpace that growth.
We expect HUMIRA demand to continue to grow given the relative modest biologic penetration rates across all market
segments, but in particular the dermatology segment, where biological penetration rates are still mid-single digits. And
while much has been said about the potential changes in the competitive landscape in the coming years, we've planned
for these factors. We continue to have a high level of confidence in HUMIRA given its extensive clinical track record,
strong product profile, and proven clinical performance.
HUMIRA is clearly important to the AbbVie story, and we will focus on growing and protecting this market leading
brand. But our portfolio includes a mix of differentiated growth plans, sustainable performers, and a handful of
maturing products that we will transition through over the next few years. Within this mix, we continue to hold market
leadership positions across numerous therapeutic categories.
For example, Lupron is the leading hormonal therapy for palliative treatment of prostate cancer. Synthroid is the
number one branded synthetic hormone therapy for thyroid disease and one of the most widely prescribed products in
the U.S. AndroGel has strong leadership position in the growing testosterone replacement market. Creon is the leading
pancreatic enzyme therapy for conditions associated with cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis. And Kaletra and
Norvir remain leading antiviral medicines for the treatment of HIV.
AbbVie is focused on maximizing the performance of each and every product in our commercial portfolio. We've
structured our specialty sales force for efficiency and agility, and we will leverage our competitive advantage and
capitalize on the market dynamics. This includes continued geographic expansion, where we expect to add
approximately $1 billion in incremental sales over the next five years from emerging markets.
In addition to sustaining our position within the industry as a proven commercial leader with a strong track record of
execution, our goal will be to further shape AbbVie into an innovation driven biopharmaceutical company. To that end,
we will continue to invest in R&D at a rate of approximately 14% of sales next year.
As I discussed last October, we're extremely encouraged with the progress of our new product pipeline. We will launch
with numerous medicines in mid and late-stage development that have truly breakthrough potential. All told, across our
emerging pipeline we have 30 compounds in human clinical trials; 15 biologic compounds across several therapeutic
areas; six ongoing Phase 3 programs, including several that represent $1 billion-plus potential; four new HUMIRA
indications currently in Phase 3 development, which collectively adds significant new growth opportunity for
HUMIRA; and 10 compounds or new indications in mid-stage development, including several that will advance to
Phase 3 within the next 18 months.
We're focused on delivering truly innovative medicines to address the most pressing areas of unmet clinical need.
Although we don't have time today to detail the entire pipeline for you, I'll briefly discuss some of the interesting
mid-stage and late-stage compounds in development.
Let me start with our mid-stage pipeline. There are 10 active programs, several with strong proof-of-concept data. I'll
high light three promising assets poised to move into Phase 3 over the next 18 months. ABT-199, our next-generation
Bcl inhibitor, which has shown strong activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia; we will present additional data in an
upcoming medical meeting and we expect to initiate Phase 3 in 2013. ABT-719, our novel investigational compound
for the prevention of acute kidney injury; it's currently in Phase 2b development and is expected to enter Phase 3 next
year. ABT-126, our alpha 7 agonist, currently in Phase 2b trials for Alzheimer's and schizophrenia; we expect to
present Phase 2 data next year and start Phase 3 mid-2014.
Now let me turn to our late-stage pipeline, which also includes 10 compounds or indications in Phase 3 development.
As I mentioned earlier, we have four new HUMIRA indications currently in Phase 3 trial. Several of these will be

unique to the HUMIRA label and will help us further differentiate HUMIRA from competitive products.
Daclizumab is our next-generation biologic in development with Biogen for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.
Results from one of the two pivotal trials demonstrated strong efficacy and disability performance. Results from the
Phase 3 study, which recently completed enrollment, are expected in 2014.
Bardoxolone is a compound in development with our partner Reata for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, a
growing market with few treatment options. The Phase 3 study, which is an outcomes trial, is now fully enrolled.
Elagolix is a compound in development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids. It has a unique profile with the potential
to provide symptom reduction while avoiding significant bone loss or other adverse effects that sometimes can be
associated with this therapy.
And Duodopa is a therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. We recently completed our Phase 3 registrational
program, and we're on track to complete our U.S. registrational submission by year end.
Finally, turning to our HCV program, where we are making significant clinical progress, we continue to have a high
level of confidence that AbbVie has the potential to achieve a strong leadership position in this space. As I stated
previously, our goal is to bring to market a potent, well tolerated, easy to administer treatment that delivers very high
cure rates without interferon. Data to date confirmed that we're on target. Earlier this week, we released top line Phase
2b data from our Aviator trial, the most comprehensive set of interferon-free combination data in genotype-1 patients
available to date. Results in patients who have reached post-treatment week 12 show that our 12-week regimen, which
includes all three assets in our HCV portfolio plus ribavirin, produce 99% SVR12 or cure rate in naïve patients and
93% SVR12 in previous null-responding patients. Additionally, SVR12 rates for other eight and 12-week programs in
the study ranged from 89% to 92%. Importantly, all combinations were very well tolerated, with an overall rate of
drug-related discontinuations of less than 2%.
By way of comparison, current oral antivirals paired with ribavirin and interferon for either 24 or 48 weeks produce
SVR12s in approximately 75% of treatment naïve patients and just over 30% of previous null-responding patients. So
our results suggest a very compelling improvement over standard of care achieved without the use of interferon and
with just 12 weeks of therapy.
While we're somewhat limited in how much we can discuss prior to the data presentation next month, I will say that
we're very impressed by the Aviator results. The data demonstrates that our approach, if validated in larger
confirmatory Phase 3 trials, represents a significant advance in patient care. Today, we're pleased to announce that we
recently initiated our comprehensive genotype-1 registrational program with the start of our first Phase 3 study. We're
on track to begin the remaining Phase 3 studies in the coming weeks. This global registrational program includes the
study of naïve and experienced patients with HCV genotype-1 infection as well as certain special populations.
We will evaluate three direct-acting antivirals with and without ribavirin for 12 weeks in genotype-1 patients. As a
reminder, genotype-1 represents the most prevalent patient type in developed markets, including approximately 70% of
patients here in the U.S. Our Phase 3 [ph] triple-DA (47:20) cocktail will include: a co-formulated, two-tablet therapy
containing our protease inhibitor, ABT-450, and our NS5 inhibitor, ABT-267, administered once a day; plus our
polymerase inhibitor, ABT-333, which is one tablet administered twice a day. We will evaluate it both with and
without ribavirin.
We're also conducting additional exploratory clinical trials to determine if a once-daily ribavirin-free co-formulated
treatment of ABT-450 and ABT-267 can provide high cure rates in specific HCV populations, providing an avenue for
further simplification. The timing of our registrational study supports commercialization in early 2015, putting us in a
strong competitive position. It is our goal to be the first to market on an interferon-free therapy for genotype-1 patients.
So in summary, we have an excellent foundation for AbbVie. We have a strong base of sustainable leadership positions
across our specialty focused commercial portfolio, including HUMIRA which will continue to drive significant growth;
a compelling late-stage pipeline, including several programs with $1 billion-plus potential; a strong and experienced
management team; a solid financial foundation, including strong profitability and robust cash flow; and a commitment

to return cash to shareholders, including a strong dividend.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill Chase, who will be AbbVie's Chief Financial Officer, for additional information
on our expected financial profile in 2013. Bill?
William J. Chase
Thanks, Rick. It's a pleasure to be here this morning and to have the opportunity to be part of the AbbVie team.
Through Rick's remarks, you should now have a good understanding of how we're viewing the broader identity of
AbbVie. I'd like to take a few moments to expand on this from a financial standpoint. I'll also provide some color on
our third quarter results and then discuss certain aspects of the AbbVie financial profile which will become evident
when we begin operations in 2013.
As we build AbbVie, we're keeping a close eye on what we feel is the most important for the investor: first, a
sustainable top line supported by product that are leaders within their categories; second, robust cash flow that will
support an attractive and dependable dividend; third, a continued commitment to driving efficient operations; and
finally, a financial policy that balances both the short and long term. We recognize the importance of growing the
dividend, and we're implementing plans to deliver this while also ensuring that our new product pipeline is
appropriately funded.
I'd like to now take you through how we're tracking against these objectives. In the third quarter, worldwide sales for
what will be considered AbbVie increased approximately 7% on an operational basis, excluding a negative impact from
foreign exchange of roughly four percentage points. Global HUMIRA sales increased nearly 16% on an operational
basis and 10% on a reported basis.
HUMIRA performance in the U.S. was driven by continued strength across therapeutic categories, with particularly
robust growth in the germ and gastro segments, where HUMIRA continues to outpace the market's double-digit
growth. International HUMIRA growth was 7.5% on an operational basis. This growth would have been higher when
normalized for the timing of tender shipments. Year to date, global sales of HUMIRA are up 19.3% and international
sales are up 14.5%, both on an operational basis. So as you can see, we're well on track to achieve our 2012 global sales
growth outlook for HUMIRA of low double-digit reported growth.
Moving on to some of our other major products, AndroGel achieved U.S. sales of nearly $280 million. AndroGel holds
the leadership position within the testosterone replacement market. Global sales of Lupron were nearly $190 million.
Our six-month formulation, approved last year in the U.S., continues to perform well, driving share gains and further
expanding our category leadership. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $132 million in the quarter. Synthroid maintains
strong brand loyalty and retains more than 20% market share despite the entry of generics into the market many years
ago. And finally, U.S. sales of Creon were $92 million. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme
market, where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. We are confident that our portfolio of
products provides a strong and sustainable base for AbbVie, generating significant cash flow as our late-stage pipeline
continues to develop.
Turning to our outlook post-separation, as Tom mentioned, we plan to set AbbVie's annual dividend at $1.60 per share
subject to approval of the AbbVie Board. This dividend level represents a strong payout and should support a healthy
initial valuation for AbbVie given current dividend yields in the 3.5% to 4.5% range for many of our pharma peers.
And as Tom said, in the coming weeks AbbVie expects to raise just under $16 billion of debt. After a net cash
distribution to Abbott of approximately $8.5 billion, AbbVie will begin operations with around $7 billion of cash on the
balance sheet. This cash includes the $2.5 billion of funding raised for future operating and financing needs, as noted in
our recent Form 10 amendment.
I'm quite pleased with the strength of our financial position as we start operations. Our capital structure and its strong
cash flow will ensure our ability to support both our dividend and the funding of our operations going forward.

Today we're also providing our current estimates of our P&L profile, as we know this will be important as you begin to
model AbbVie in the coming months. We have mentioned previously that 2013 and 2014 will be a time of transition
for our product portfolio as our lipid franchise experiences the entry of generics. We fully expect generic competition
throughout 2013 for TriCor and for generic events to play out during the year for TRILIPIX and Niaspan, and we're
planning for this appropriately. And as Tom noted, our forecast for the fourth quarter assumes the launch of a generic
TriCor, and we recommend that you model less than $200 million in U.S. TriCor/TRILIPIX sales in the fourth quarter.
Given the expected timing of generic TriCor late in 2012, the year-over-year sales and gross margin ratio impacts will
be more acutely felt by AbbVie in 2013. As a result, we're forecasting 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our
combined lipid franchise, including TriCor, TRILIPIX, Niaspan, and SIMCOR, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2
billion next year. We plan to cover a significant portion of this decline through growth of key marketed products,
including HUMIRA. So as we see it today, we'd expect AbbVie's total sales to be somewhat above $18 billion in 2013
at current exchange rates.
As Tom mentioned, AbbVie expects to report adjusted EPS on a cash basis, removing non-cash amortization from cost
of goods sold. For modeling purposes today, we're forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 76.5% excluding
non-cash amortization, which reflects the impact of both lipids and some unfavorable foreign exchange.
We're very pleased with our pipeline and expect to appropriately fund R&D investment to drive long-term growth. As
Rick mentioned, we expect R&D expense of around 14% of sales.
We expect SG&A to be around 26% of sales. This includes the incremental costs of becoming an independent company
as well as AbbVie's share of Abbott's corporate costs. While some analysts and investors have estimated these
incremental expenses at 1% to 2% of AbbVie's sales, or up to $360 million, we have managed AbbVie's costs to be less
than 1% of AbbVie's sales. This reflects our initial efforts to minimize these costs, and it remains our goal over time to
offset as much of the remaining costs as possible through efficiency efforts.
Given our debt outstanding and average interest rates, we expect net interest expense of approximately $400 million for
AbbVie in 2013. The gross interest expense; that is before interest income, was reflected in the pro forma adjustments
in the September amendment to the Form 10.
We're also forecasting minimal other income as an existing agreement that was previously generating other income
expires in 2013. And we expect a tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013, as Tom previously discussed.
As outlined in our Form 10, we expect roughly $435 million or $0.21 per share of non-cash amortization in 2013. This
is important to note as we expect AbbVie to provide its 2013 ongoing EPS guidance on a cash basis; that is, excluding
non-cash amortization for comparability purposes to most of our peers. We will also reconcile this guidance to EPS on
a GAAP basis, which would include amortization expense and specified items.
As I said earlier, I'm very pleased with how we're positioning AbbVie for future success, including our overall capital
structure, the strength and durability of our cash flows, the sustainability of our on-market products, and the emergence
of a leading late-state pipeline. I look forward to meeting many of you in the next few months and in the coming year.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John for some final comments.
John B. Thomas
Thanks, Bill.
Before we open the call for questions, let me give you a brief overview of the next steps in the separation process. We
continue to expect that Abbott and AbbVie will be independent companies on January 1, 2013. This is, of course,
subject to the final approval of our Board of Directors' declaration that the Form 10 is effective and other customary
conditions. A few weeks prior to separation, we'll issue a news release describing the special dividend distribution of
AbbVie stock, including the distribution ratio and the record date. We expect that when-issued trading of both
companies' stocks to begin in mid-December, with regular way trading of both companies to begin on January 2 on the

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning.
<A - Miles D. White>: Good morning.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Miles, I thought maybe we'd start with a strategic question. As I think about the DMP
[Diversified Medical Products] strategy or the Abbott strategy going forward, I feel like investors see Nutrition as a big
source of leverage. They see established pharma and as we've seen this year as a source of growth, but they have
questions on the device franchise. So I guess how do you see the development of the device franchise? Is this a growth
asset? Is it a leveraged asset? And what impact do you think M&A is going to play in the development of the device
franchise over time?
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. Thanks, David. I'd characterize the device franchise in the following way. I think we're
in a transition period. We've just launched a number of new products in our Vascular business. For example, we're
lapping our Promus arrangement with Boston Scientific. So we've got a number of things that are in transition there. So
I look for growth out of the Vascular business and on a continuing basis because, as you know, we've established a very
strong franchise there with our entire XIENCE franchise. I think we've got growth potential, tremendous growth
potential really with ABSORB and with MitraClip and, frankly, with our endovascular franchise. So I expect that to be
a growth business. And we simply have to lap the circumstance of Promus and we've got to get our new products
launched, which we're underway with. I think we've got opportunity there, a lot of opportunity, including in emerging
markets.
On the front of the Ophthalmology business, part of that is market and economy driven and part of that is new product
launches, which we have a number of coming. And then part of it's expansion into emerging markets, so it's a similar
story. But I'd say we're in the let's get all the ducks lined up to achieve that and be ready to do that. That business has
been somewhat disappointing over the last couple years. But as you know, the Lasik part of it and others are very
dependent on economic conditions, and that has really been a headwind for that business. So I look for that business
also to be a growth contributor in the future.
And then finally, Diabetes Care, I would characterize in two ways. One, it's clearly a tougher, more competitive market
over time. There has been a lot of price pressure, reimbursement pressure, and so forth, particularly from governments
in Europe. On the other hand, we've got a particularly innovative pipeline and system of products coming that I think
really change diabetes testing for the Type 1 and Type 2 tester going forward. The first product in that lineup, Insulinx,
is in the market now, and I'd say I've got a pretty exciting product line coming there. So I look for that business to also
improve from a growth standpoint going forward, so I'm looking for growth out of all three. All three happen to be in
transitional phases right now, but they've got a nice cadre of products coming.
At the same time, we've put a fair amount of emphasis on gross margin improvement in all of them, and we've seen a
lot of margin improvement over the last few years out of Vascular. We've seen it out of our Diabetes Care business. I
think all the prospects look good there. But in terms of the evolution of the performance of businesses, I'd say
Diagnostics, for example, is ahead of others on those tracks, also with a healthy pipeline of systems that's in
development. As I mentioned, there hasn't been a lot new in the diagnostics or core laboratory diagnostics arena in the
last many years actually, several years. And the pipeline of products under development there I think are quite exciting

for us and for the market, and I look at that across the board. I think the evidence from our Nutrition and
Pharmaceutical business, EPD, the expansion in the emerging markets, the number of products that have entered those
markets, they're all laying the foundation for growth in what are going to be growth markets anyway.
So as I look forward, my expectations are optimistic. I'd say from time to time a number of analysts, including yourself,
have challenged us on our market assumptions, and I think that market has been tougher and slower to recover or
slower to pick up than I had certainly hoped and any of us had hoped. But at the same time, you've got to be prepared to
grow through the market. So I've put a lot of attention on our organic or internal capability in innovation, R&D, and
[ph] new (1:03:36) products.
One of the things I'm quite pleased with as we split the company is that both companies have what I consider to be an
appropriate critical mass of spending or level of spending in R&D. As you'll know, over the last 10 to 12 years we've
been steadily, I'd say, restoring or improving spending rates or investment rates in R&D. If you'll note in the AbbVie
profile on the split, they'll spend 14.5% in R&D. If you went back ten, twelve years ago, we would have struggled to
spend at that level in R&D. So I'm pleased with the performance of the company over the last ten or twelve years and
the growth, we've also improved the investment and spending rates in both R&D and SG&A to pretty healthy levels, so
that the company is capable of sustaining organic innovation and sustainability going forward, which has been a focus.
You asked me about M&A. I'd say M&A remains, from my point of view, only opportunistic. I'm putting an awful lot
of our focus and emphasis right now internally. And I think that's important, particularly during the split when we'll
have transition service agreements and we've got to get through the separation and let the dust settle and so forth. I also
never forecast M&A transactions, but I'm mindful that the foundation of the company has to be operating well and on
an organic basis. Otherwise, I think – well, that's what I think we need to pay attention to.
So I don't rule anything out, but I'm not looking for anything big, and we're not particularly active, as you can see over
the last year. We haven't been. There are a few categories or areas where we're particularly mindful whether or not
there is opportunities to adjunctively add to the business or enhance the strategic strength of a business. We're always
watching that. We're always tracking that. But I'd say right now, I don't have anything that I could forecast on the radar
screen, and my focus is primarily organic. I know that's a long answer. It's more than you asked for, but I thought it
would cover a number of things you'd be curious about.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you, a similar question to both Bill and Rick. I appreciate the granularity that you provided
today on AbbVie going forward. But I'm wondering if you could – you gave us a good sense for operating margin in
2013. But since, again, this business is going through so much transition with base business not changing much but
facing competition in the lipid business and then new products likely to come to the market 2015 and beyond, can you
give us a sense for where you see opportunities for operating margin leverage? The gross margin level you said was
76.5%. Where can that go realistically driven by continued growth of HUMIRA plus new product contributions? And
then how should we think about SG&A and R&D going forward?
And then lastly just on HUMIRA, obviously, this franchise has done extremely well. When we think about HUMIRA
2013 and beyond, just wondering what you are thinking internally about tofacitinib [tofa]. Are you assuming, as I think
the market is, a restricted third-line label? If it's a second-line label, how would that affect your thoughts on HUMIRA
going forward? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay, Jami, this is Rick. That was a long question.

<A - Miles D. White>: She's getting all her follow-up questions in now.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Yes, I think if you look at our business over the next three or four years, your perspective
on it is correct. We're going to go through a transition period where we're going to have relatively flat to slightly down
top line for the next couple of years, driven by the loss of exclusivity primarily on our dyslipidemia franchise. And then
the underlying emerging growth that we continue to see out of HUMIRA offsets the majority of that. Going forward,
we anticipate that HUMIRA will continue to drive growth. Those markets are still areas where we can continue to drive
penetration. As you know, the penetration rates really across all three segments are relatively low. And we continue to
see uptake of these kinds of products going forward as we expand into more and more patients and we expand
geographically.
Starting in roughly 2015, you'll start to see the emergence of our pipeline going forward and you'll see top line start to
accelerate, particularly in the second half of 2015. From a margin standpoint, we still have an opportunity to be able to
improve margins between now and then, gross margins. And we continue to work on operational improvements. There
will be some mix improvement over time, although some of that will be offset by the loss of exclusivity of some
products that also have relatively high margins, so there will be a little bit of a mixed bag there. But I think generally
speaking, we're focused on operational improvements in those areas.
From an SG&A and an R&D standpoint, as I said in my comments, we have a strong late-stage pipeline. We have a
number of assets that are in our mid-stage pipeline that we believe have compelling enough data that they will likely be
able to advance into Phase 3. This is an innovation driven business. We're certainly going to drive everything that we
have that we think can be successful going forward. So we have a commitment to be able to support R&D at a level
that's appropriate based on those programs that advance. As I indicated, I think for 2013 you should be assuming in the
range of about 14%.
On the SG&A front, I'd tell you that in general, both R&D and SG&A, based on what we know about the industry,
we're one of the most efficient operating models, and I think we operate very efficiently in the SG&A area. We're
always careful about how we build infrastructure and make sure that we're as lean as possible but yet effective. And so
that's an area that we always focus on. It's an Abbott tradition, and we plan on continuing that as part of AbbVie.
On the tofa front, I think our read in the U.S. is consistent with what you described. I think based on the label that we
would anticipate on the data that we've seen publicly, we would expect it to be third-line. We've anticipated both in our
planning process. Essentially, I think I believe that ultimately if it comes out behind TNFs based on the profile, we feel
very, very comfortable with how HUMIRA will perform against it. Even if it came out with second-line, I think we feel
very comfortable with how HUMIRA will perform against tofa. And so we're obviously doing a lot of work in that
area. We've done a tremendous amount of market research to understand the positioning of that product and how
HUMIRA stacks up against it. And we feel confident with how HUMIRA will perform going forward. I think that was
everything.

Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Weinstein from JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Thank you. First question let me just ask. You were talking about some of the short-term
transient headwinds facing what I'll call new Abbott post-spin. The organic growth rate by our math this quarter for
new Abbott was 2.4%. Is there any way you could try and quantify? And if it's tough to do it right now, I understand.
But could you try and quantify what the impact was of Promus this quarter and the distribution change in Nutritionals
so we can try and get a more apples-to-apples look at how new Abbott is performing?

<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Mike, this is Tom. As we did describe in our comments, those were the two transitional
factors that masked the real growth rate of new Abbott. I'd say each of those, on average, Promus is probably in the 1.5
point range, and the direct distribution is closer to approaching 1%. So if you adjust for those, we did have growth more
in that 4% range. And as I mentioned in my remarks, if you look at the...
<A - William J. Chase>: You're talking about Vascular at 4%.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yes.
<A - William J. Chase>: New Abbott.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: New Abbott. And as I mentioned in my remarks, if you look at our year-to-date adjusted
for those items, we're in the mid-single-digit range, so that gives you a feel. Clearly, we expect, particularly in the
nutrition area, when these direct distribution plans are completed that that's going to be a really nice acceleration in
growth next year and will be a big part of our ability to move this growth rate up from what you're seeing this year in
new Abbott.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay. Tom, I wanted to ask you about the dividend and the tax rate. What you laid out
in the dividend is really consistent with what we had modeled out, so there was really no surprises there on how you
split it and what basically you're forecasting for 2013 on the dividend. But you indicated on the call that Abbott's tax
rate is going to go up by about 10 points from where it had been and where the Street is modeling to where it's going be
in 2013, which obviously has a big impact on people's earnings models for AbbVie and the combined Abbott going
forward. I think our math on it was that it's about 8.5% negative hit to combined Abbott's EPS going forward from that
increase and the AbbVie tax rate. So is it that you need to shift that much of your profits in order to support the AbbVie
dividend going forward? Is that why the tax rate is going from 12% to 22%?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Mike, I think the key thing here is and it's really the point we've been making from the
very first day we talked about this. But these are very different businesses going forward, and they're operating
independently. And AbbVie, a lot of the cash flow historically has been efficient capital that we've been able to deploy
to a lot of opportunities that have really helped the overall Abbott portfolio and performance. And going forward as
separate companies, AbbVie is much more focused on returns. And it's essential that a dividend gets set at an
appropriate level, particularly given the focus on yields that investors have on these stocks these days. So making that a
big priority for that company, it was important to rethink the balancing of the cash flows at what would be an
appropriate sustainable level going forward.
Obviously, we continue to be hopeful that over time, Washington will continue to focus on this area. It could provide
additional opportunities for both companies if we move to a more competitive tax system. But the rate at which AbbVie
will be starting its existence is a very good sustainable rate given the profile of the business, the expectations of the
investors, and what the future holds as opposed to what was appropriate in the past.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: So this is a surprise to the Street today and that's why I'm focusing on it because
obviously we didn't model it this way. I know people weren't modeling it, and that's in part because of the comments
you guys had made last October on the tax rate.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Mike, as Miles indicated, it has been a process since last October to provide additional
information to investors as we get closer to the point at which investors are going to separately value these stocks.
Today is a big step in that regard. Obviously, we're going to be talking to people about the companies as we get out and
talk to investors over the next couple months. And it's important that they have this information and understand the
rationale and that it really sets AbbVie up to be very well positioned for its objectives.

<A - Miles D. White>: The one thing I'd say that's clear to us as we've gone through the separation, when you split two
businesses that do look very different from a profile standpoint or a return standpoint or, frankly, the expectations of
investors, one thing I've noted is some analysts and some investors are pretty good at projecting what they think each
business will look like. But what we don't want is for analysts to have to guess on a lot of the parameters that help them
model the business because it's so much a part of how they'll value the businesses and so forth.
So our intent both with the amendments to the Form 10 and to the additional information we put out today isn't to
surprise but, frankly, to take out uncertainty where there is wide ranges of assumptions, whether it be about interest
rates or interest costs or, frankly, dissynergies in transition costs or the costs of running a company separately and so
forth. And if there is different – if there are changes like tax rate in the structure of the P&L of the company, we want
you to know what those things are so you can model. And there's a time when we know that. There's a time when we
can finally give clarity to analysts and investors about those things. And when you put them all together, it's our intent
to try to take out the difficulty of modeling each company separately for you and other analysts and investors. But other
than that, I think it's just new information today that, frankly, so many of you have been asking for to give you more
ability to know what they're going to look like.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: I appreciate that. So, Tom, what is the payout ratio that that implies for AbbVie going
forward?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Roughly in the dividend you're talking about, Mike?
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Yes, just given the higher tax rate.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Roughly 50% payout on cash earnings for the dividend.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay, perfect. I'll let some others jump in here. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Thanks, Mike.
<A - Miles D. White>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Hi, good morning, two questions for Rick. The first is on the HUMIRA franchise. If you
look at the HUMIRA franchise just this quarter, OUS came in a little light. And you mentioned the timing of tenders,
but I've got to believe that European austerity is having an impact as well. And if that's the case, is this going be a
headwind for the HUMIRA OUS franchise over the next couple years, and are there any offsets? And then as a
follow-up on HUMIRA, the patents in both the U.S. and Europe expire over the next five years. Is there a strategy in
place that can extend the patents? And then I'd like to ask a follow-up on hepatitis after you've answered the HUMIRA
questions.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. So, Glenn, on the growth rate in the third quarter, there were essentially two
tenders that moved between quarters. One moved out into fourth quarter. One moved back into second quarter. If you
essentially adjust for those changes, HUMIRA is continuing to run about mid-teens, so there isn't any material impact
on HUMIRA. Having said that, clearly the impact across everyone's business in Europe is being felt with some of the
austerity measures that are being taken. I wouldn't say that we feel differently than we've felt for the last couple of
years; 2010 from a price standpoint was probably the most difficult year, the most challenging year. If you look at this
year, it's in that range but slightly below that from a price erosion standpoint. What we've modeled for 2013 is close to
2010, so we're planning in that range. But it hasn't had a material impact on the performance of HUMIRA going
forward, and we don't expect that going forward.
As far as biosimilar competition in 2017 or 2018, which is what you're talking about, obviously we've spent a lot of
time working on that strategy. You have to remember that beyond just the molecule patents, there are a number of

process patents that will be important in the process and a number of other things that we continue to look at. And as
you know, if you look at biosimilars, it's a very different ball game from small molecules. We do not believe that it will
be an interchangeable or a substitutable product. And they will have to sell based on their own data if and when they
come to market, and we believe that HUMIRA's track record will stack up nicely against them. So it certainly will have
an impact. We recognize that, but we think it's a manageable impact, and we believe we have a number of strategies to
be able to protect HUMIRA going forward.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: So from a modeling point of view, we should assume some generics entering the market
2017 – 2018, correct?
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: You should assume some biosimilar activity based on some entering the market around
2017 – 2018, correct.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I had a question on your hepatitis program. So we've
seen very good, very strong data from the current regimen. But the current regimen also the protease inhibitor is
boosted with ritonavir. And, there is a lot of questions out there whether or not this will limit the ability to take market
share because of ritonavir's interaction with other drugs. What's your best guess is as to what a ritonavir booster will do
in terms of [ph] limiting (1:21:18) the market share for your platform? And then as a follow-up, the data in the nulls
was really, really strong, and this could really establish you as a major player in that segment of the market. How big
do you think the null market would be? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Let me start with ritonavir. There is obviously been a lot of questions around ritonavir. I
think it's important to recognize that the dose of ritonavir in the HCV cocktail or in the PI specifically is one-twelfth the
dose, the labeled dose in ritonavir. So we have not seen any of the side effect profiles that people talk about like GI side
effects, lipid profile side effects in any of the clinical trials. And we've now done a substantial number of patients, as
you know. The tolerability in the trial had less than a 2% discontinuation rate and a very low rate of any drug-to-drug
interactions.
So we don't – everyone can talk about ritonavir and, obviously, our competitors are talking about it. The reality is the
data speaks for itself, and you're going to get a chance to see the data. And a patient doesn't know or a physician doesn't
really care whether it has ritonavir in it or not. What they care about is high cure rates, tolerability, and ease of use of
the protocol. And I think in those fronts based on the data that we've seen thus far, we're pretty confident about what we
have. And I think the data will play out over time. We'll do our Phase 3 trials. It will be an even larger cohort of
patients, and we'll have an opportunity to see that. But there's nothing in this data, and I can tell you we have been
through this data very, very carefully. There's nothing in this data that concerns me from a tolerability standpoint with
ritonavir.
Now the nulls, the null performance is very, very impressive. As you know, we haven't seen anything from any other
product that even comes close to this level of performance. The way we calculate nulls, and we've spent some time
looking at this, it would suggest to us that nulls alone are somewhere around a $2.5 billion to $3 billion opportunity, so
they're a pretty sizable opportunity. And obviously, the market will continue to grow as more and more therapies come
out there. So we believe that could be a very significant differentiating factor for our therapy, but we'll have to see all
the data that comes out over the course of time. Certainly, 93% performance in null responding patients is something
that the industry has not seen before.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: All right, thanks. Thank you, Rick.

<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Hi, Rajeev.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Hello. My question first was on new Abbott. And just not getting too much into guidance, but
I was just hoping you could help us think about outlook a little bit in the sense that you've talked about margins
impacting or FX impacting the margins next year. And obviously, margin expansion is one of the attractive points for
that company. Maybe you could help us understand the way rates are currently sitting. How much is that going to dilute
the margin expansion next year, and can we still expect some net margin expansion in that business?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Sure, this is Tom. As you've seen from Abbott's performance over the years, certainly
within the year, currency has been a little less impactful to us than maybe some other companies. And there really is a
function the way things flow through our business. As you know, sales when currency moves, that's an immediate
impact, whereas the impact on cost of sales tends to lag through the inventory process. We've had quite a bit of that this
year, and some of that's going carry into next year.
And so I'd say, as we've been saying all along on the quarters with the favorability of exchange that we've been
pointing out in the gross margin improvement, some of that was a bit transitional this year, and it's going flip back a
little bit the other way next year. So I just think it's normalizing. And if you look at underlying what's really going on in
these businesses, it's very quite positive, as we have talked about in terms of improving the gross margins
fundamentally. And I think once we get through this one-time adjustment, if you will, of getting the margin back to a
more normalized level, you'll be able to see the growth of that margin as we've been talking about.
<A - Miles D. White>: Rajeev, this is Miles. I would just add to that the following by way of background explanation.
One of the reasons that exchange doesn't translate from the top line to our bottom line as much as it may at other
companies, and other companies, frankly, do the same thing. We try to put our cost base, our manufacturing, et cetera,
also in the same markets where we may experience exchange fluctuation in sales, in top line because there's a natural
hedge there in cost, et cetera. So for example, over time to the extent that costs and manufacturing and other things are
in some of the growth markets where we are growing and we are putting our plants there, et cetera, for the products that
we will sell there, there's a natural hedging there that helps mitigate the top line impact of exchange down to the bottom
line. So some years, that's a plus for us on the margin line. For example, this year while the top line is experiencing
negative exchange, the gross margin line is experiencing positive exchange.
It's important to point out though that on that gross margin line, it's not all exchange. There's a big chunk of that
improvement in the gross margin line that is actually actions taken to improve our cost structures or mix and whatever
the case may be. So if exchange improves on the top line next year, as Tom says, that will have a dampening effect on
the continued improvement of gross margin, but we expect to continue to improve from our own actions the gross
margin line. It just won't benefit from an extra boost from exchange, so it's a mitigated thing both ways. At the end of
the day, what we're looking to do in the way we structure our own approach to exchange is to mitigate its volatility on
the bottom line.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: No, thanks for that. I think clearly what's important is what happens on an underlying basis,
but it's just helpful to have expectations in the right place as far as the numbers go, I thought. I did have a follow-up on
Nutritionals. I guess the growth there was a little bit lighter than what we were looking for in Pediatric. And I know you
talked about some of the distributor issues, but those are obviously things that you've known for several quarters.
Maybe just particularly on ex-U.S., you could talk about if any of the underlying market dynamics have changed
materially this quarter and if you're thinking about the markets there any differently than you have been in the past.
Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: I'd say a couple things and then I'm going to let Tom weigh in here too. There aren't really
distributor issues. There's one circumstance, a fairly significant one, where we bought out the distributor and there's an
adjustment we're going through while we let that inventory wind down and the sales wind down and come back into
our own system. In effect, we're going direct in a lot of our markets and some of our significant ones overseas. So
there's a transition there as you do that that clearly is dampening. It's not an issue per se. It's a deliberate action on our

part to go more direct for a lot of favorable reasons. Tom?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I guess I'd just say that really the items we noted on the distributor changes are the drag
on what one might expect, and we do expect in the fourth quarter upper-single growth in this business. So you're going
to see a better rate we believe in the fourth quarter, and we think it's even got better potential in 2013. So I think once
you get through this transition, you'll feel confident that those types of growth rates are possible for this business, and
we plan to deliver on them.
<A - Miles D. White>: You asked if there's an underlying fundamental downshift in some way. Not that we see, no,
we're not looking at that or expecting that.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Miles D. White>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Emerging market growth this quarter, it
was over 10% and it was 12% last quarter, so it seems like it's in that 10% to 12% range. Is that a realistic rate going
forward? And maybe if you can talk about AbbVie versus Abbott, if there are differences there? Then I just had one
follow-up.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Certainly, in the quarter – and we said this in the October meeting last year and
throughout – emerging markets is much more a part of this story and a much more important part of the growth
opportunity on the Abbott side. And in fact, in the quarter, even though overall company grew double digits, it was
stronger on the Abbott side and a little bit below that on the AbbVie side, so it clearly is a more important part of the
story.
Now with that said, I think AbbVie, and we've said this also, does see opportunity there. And I think somewhere in the
range of $1 billion of growth in emerging markets over the five-year period is still a part of their story. But clearly, the
performance was better in the quarter on the Abbott side and really is a bigger part of the story. The other thing I would
say is some of the tenders that Rick talked about when he was talking about HUMIRA also tended to dampen down
AbbVie in the third quarter, and I think that is a bit transitional.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Thank you, and then one for Miles. At the analyst meeting last October, you laid out
some goals for the new Abbott to grow high single digits and EPS at a double-digit rate. And then today, you're saying
you could grow mid-single digits in 2013. Could you give us a little bit of an update on the long-term goals for the new
Abbott and why maybe next year's mid-single digits versus your original high single-digit goal? Thank you.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: That's mid to upper, Larry. I just wanted to clarify.
<A - Miles D. White>: Larry, I'd say this. There's no difference in our long-term goals at all or even our long-term
expectations. I think there are a number of things that are different now than last year but only relatively speaking. So
for example, I'd say right now 2013 I'm looking for mid to high single digit. And I think at that meeting last year, I
distinctly remember at least one of you, if not a couple of you, were more cautious about the economy, et cetera, going
forward, and you proved to be right. I'd say right now the difference in my outlook is more about market conditions
than anything else and how slow a recovery in a number of markets around the world will come.
I think the biggest change that I see is slower market growth rates in emerging markets. But I'm cautious about how I
describe that because when people in general look at a China, and this is any company that's doing business in China
today, not necessarily in healthcare or medical products, people say gee, the Chinese market has really slowed. It was at
9%, now it's at 7%. Slow is a relative term; 7% looks pretty attractive as a matter of generality compared to developed
markets and a lot of developing markets. But I'd say that the underlying market growth rates in a number of the

economies around the world are slower, particularly in emerging markets, than we might have originally expected, and
I think all industries are experiencing that right now. And then who knows whether these things will recover as fast as
everybody would like or not.
The whole world now is pretty interlocked, so that if the developed markets are slow, it does roll back into a number of
the developing or emerging or growth markets. So the single biggest difference I think in our outlook is the underlying
market growth rates or expansion rates, which I think in relative terms is a more near-term thing than a long-term thing.
I think all those markets overseas that we view as growth markets are growth markets for the long term. And my
expectations are high single-digit top line for the long term and mid to high in the nearer term. Our goals haven't
changed, but we just have to be realistic about the underlying market conditions. Our objective is to do better than
market in any circumstance so that we're growing and gaining share, et cetera, in our targeted geographies and targeted
segments of the business.
So I'd say there's no change to my expectations. There's a change to my assumptions about the conditions in which we
operate. That affects exchange too, although we all understand exchange. I think the biggest change or surprise to my
own expectations for the year was the exchange impact from growth markets. Historically, with AbbVie as part of
Abbott, Europe is a huge part of exchange for us. That's less true for new Abbott going forward. It's much more a
market basket of a lot of currencies around the world, which is different. And a lot of those currencies have performed
differently this year. So I think a lot of this is adjustment to conditions. And frankly, I think our underlying
expectations, which are generally driven by our own performance, the new products we bring to market, the share we
gain, the market opportunities we access, there's no change in my expectations about those.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thanks very much, a couple of questions on hep C. Rick, you commented with respect to the very
good data, the very good 12-week data in genotype-1 that you would be the first in the market in 2015 against
genotype-1, and I'm curious if that statement was correct as I wrote it down. And second, what are AbbVie's
expectations with respect to the competition being in the market at what time?
And then the second question around hep C is around nulls. You did provide some commentary around the market and
that's very helpful, although I'm curious, and I seem to recall that the null data that has been presented is without
cirrhotics. Is that correct? And then I have one financial follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. As far as the nulls are concerned, it is without cirrhotics; that is correct. We're
going to do a cirrhotic trial now. So it's nulls without cirrhotics. As far as the timing, you heard the comment correct.
We do anticipate that if we hit the window of early 2015, based on how we've modeled out timelines for competitive
products, it would suggest to us that that could be the first product to enter the market for genotype-1. There may be
products that enter the market for genotype-2 and genotype-3 prior to that. In fact, I think there could be, in all
likelihood, products that enter the market after that. Now that's based on a set of assumptions that we're making that
essentially are based on our competitive intelligence of how long we think trials would take to be able to start up. I can
tell you all of us recognize that this will be a race to get to market, and we anticipate early in 2015 is the timeframe that
we should be able to hit. And based on what we know today, we're assuming that that would be first to market. But
we'll have to see how it plays out over time.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Yes, sir, I understand the race all too well. The one financial question though was around
AbbVie's debt to EBITDA. Are you happy with that debt to EBITDA, at least in the short term; i.e., would you take
excess cash beyond the dividend to pay that debt down? And if not, does the high tax rate really imply a fair level of
repatriation of capital? And that is again for AbbVie. Thanks very much.

<A - William J. Chase>: So, Tony, what we've done is we've structured AbbVie with what we think is a very strong
responsible balance sheet at the onset. As cash is generated, yes, I think one of the priorities we would have is we
balance our cash. And we do look at it as an exercise in balancing between returning to shareholder, funding the
business. But one of the other items is ultimately paying down debt as well, and we would look to do that when we
have maturities through the next couple of years.
In regards to the need to repatriate, I think if you look at AbbVie, we've got a pretty strong balance sheet. We've got $7
billion of cash starting out. The 22% tax rate will allow us to appropriately balance geographic cash flows between our
needs and our uses. And so I don't think any additional repatriation would be necessary.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thanks very much.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Ellan, we're running out of time here. We want to be respectful for people's time, so maybe
we can take two more questions, please.
Operator
Okay, our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi there, thanks for taking my question. One part of capital allocation you haven't discussed
yet for either AbbVie or Abbott is share repurchases. Can you just outline any thoughts that you have there? Thank
you.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yes, both companies do anticipate continuing their share repurchase programs. As you're
aware, Abbott has been more active this year than we have been in the last couple. And the specifics of that, each
company is going to have to talk about it at future dates. Second question?
<A - John B. Thomas>: Okay?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: One more question, I guess.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Is that it? Operator, go on. One more?
Operator
We'll move on to our next question. Our next question is from Danielle Antalffy.
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Hi, guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Just if I could focus in for the legacy
Abbott device business, on the Vascular side, another cardiovascular company just this morning talked about pressure –
cardiovascular procedure volumes in Europe. I'm just wondering if you could talk about what you guys are seeing over
in Europe and how that could be impacting stent sales going forward.
<A - John B. Thomas>: I don't know what the other company said this morning, Danielle. But we are seeing definite
pressure on PCI volumes or procedure volumes and so forth and procedure rates. What we see, and I think it depends
on what geographies you're in. For us, the pressures in Europe are somewhat offset by the growth in procedures in
developing markets or growth markets, other markets. But I think for some time, at least for the near term, we can
expect to see some continued pressure on Europe, perhaps the U.S.
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Okay, great, thanks so much. And then just again on the Vascular business, Evalve, I wasn't
there but I talked to a few docs that attended the ESC [European Society of Cardiology] meeting. And it sounds like
there's more excitement being ginned up for the MitraClip. Just wondering what your status is on that filing here in the
U.S.? And should we view this business any differently after hearing some more positive data points coming out of the
ESC meeting in August? Thanks so much.
