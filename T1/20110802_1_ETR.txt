MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for introductions and opening comments, I would like to turn the call over
to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Miss Paula Waters. Please go ahead, Ma'am.
Paula Waters
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and
CEO, Wayne Leonard, and Leo Denault, our CFO, will review results.
In an effort to accommodate everyone with questions this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two
questions. After the Q&A session, I will close with the applicable legal statements.
Wayne?
J. Wayne Leonard
Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance, which Leo will review
with you in a moment.
Quarterly operational earnings per share topped the second quarter record set just one year ago, despite the effects of
depressed power pricing on the Wholesale business as higher price contracts roll off. We continued to pursue a full
agenda of strategic initiatives that will take some time to fully play out. In the meantime, the commodity markets,

which are showing some signs of long-term recovery, will continue to be a drag on earnings for at least the next couple
of years.
I'll begin today by providing an update on the progress that we've made on some of those key initiatives. Starting at the
utility, our utility companies have worked hard for a long time to secure regulatory structures and mechanisms that
allow a real opportunity to earn returns commensurate with investment alternatives of comparable risk. You will see
that these efforts are coming to fruition as you review the financial results.
For example, since the end of 2001, average residential rates have increased a little over one-half of 1% per year over
the near 10-year period, or almost flat for 10 years, while Utility operational earnings per share at the midpoint of the
2011 guidance is nearly double the operational results 10 years ago. At the same time, our operational and our safety
performance and environmental record continues to set new company standard. Our voluntary CO2 emissions
reductions put us over 20% below the year 2000 level.
Formula rate plan filings for 2010 reflect earnings consistent with each company's bandwidth ranges in Louisiana and
Mississippi, and we are above the range in New Orleans. Unseasonable weather in 2010, both a warm summer and a
cold winter, contributed to these results, with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New
Orleans near the top end or above the range.
In total, the New Orleans 2010 FRP filing reflected a $7.6 million decrease in electric and gas rates. Also included in
the Entergy New Orleans May filing was a request to increase storm funding by about $20 million to replace the cash
storm reserve after expenditures for hurricanes Gustav and Ike, allowing the cash storm reserve to reach the approved
$75 million level on schedule by 2017. The electric and gas rate changes are expected to be effective in October.
Turning to Texas, legislation was enacted in May allowing for a special rider to periodically adjust rates for changes in
distribution adjustment. The Public Utility Commission of Texas is now in the progress for preparing the rule-making
and rate filing package to be completed by late September.
Entergy Texas also continues efforts to achieve a purchased power capacity rider after the PUCT reopened a
rule-making earlier this year. The introduction of a distribution rider and a purchased power capacity rider, coupled
with the transmission rider already authorized, would provide Entergy Texas additional tools similar to those in place in
other jurisdictions that efficiently and effectively promote the public interest and align shareholder and customer
economic interests. If final rules are adopted, ETI has the opportunity to file for one or more of the three riders in 2012,
depending on circumstances related to a more complete review of overall cost.
The utility also continued to execute its capital investment commitments related to last year's resource selections and
the summer 2009 long-term request for proposal. In June, Entergy Louisiana filed a request seeking Louisiana Public
Service Commission approval to construct the 550-megawatt Ninemile 6 combined-cycle plant. The total project cost is
estimated at $721 million, excluding interconnections and transmission upgrades.
Under the current proposed structure, Entergy Louisiana would own the plant, retain 55% of the energy and capacity,
and sell the balance under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New
Orleans. The June LPSC filing also requested approval for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to enter into the PPA for its
25% share of the output of Ninemile 6. Entergy New Orleans also filed with the city council seeking authorization to
purchase 20% under its life-of-unit PPA with Entergy Louisiana.
LPSC approval was requested by January 2012 in order to issue full notice to proceed and maintain the construction
schedule for a targeted commercial operations date by the summer of 2015. Regulatory filings were also submitted
seeking acquisition approval and rider recovery upon transaction closing for the 620-megawatt Hot Spring power plant
in Arkansas and the 450-megawatt Hinds power plant in Mississippi. Closing on both acquisitions is targeted for
mid-2012, subject to receipt of federal and state approvals and other closing conditions.
In transmission, on May 12 utility operating companies each filed reports detailing the rationale for joining the
Midwest ISO. Total net production costs savings range from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion compared to $0.8 billion to
$1.1 billion by joining the Southwest Power Pool over the 10-year period from 2013 to 2022, compared to the status

quo. Production costs savings are projected to be realized for customers in all operating companies. The reports
emphasized the known benefits to our customers are the mature, functioning, large Day 2 Market.
Then on July 1, FERC issued an order on the joint operating agreement between SPP and MISO that confirmed
additional power flow between MISO and Entergy would be available, over and above the 1,000 megawatt
interconnection assumed in the cost/benefit analysis. That's the Ameren tie that you often hear about.
At issue was whether the joint operating agreement allowed sharing of available transition capacity, often called loop
flows, between MISO, SPP and Entergy Arkansas in the event Entergy Arkansas joined MISO. FERC found, consistent
with past FERC policy, that if Entergy Arkansas joins MISO, the joint operating agreement will allow market flows
between MISO and the Entergy System across the interconnected SPP member facilities for the shared flow gates.
While additional details need to be resolved between MISO and SPP on compensation matters, FERC's decision on the
JOA and the ability to utilize surrounding transmission lines above the 1,000 megawatt interconnection previously
assumed for purposes of a conservative analysis will only serve to increase the potential benefits of joining MISO.
Beyond the clear economic benefits of MISO, other factors favored MISO over the alternatives. Its mature operating
Day 2 market, larger geography, load and generation resources, scale and diversity, and transmission cost allocation
policies that are better aligned with our principles on cost causation. For years, we have advocated the efficiency of the
cost causation principle, despite – or what we've often called participant funding – despite pressures to move to a more
cost-allocation-based tariff, or what others called rolled-in rates.
Speaking about FERC Order 1000, after its July 1 issuance, FERC Chairman Wellinghoff stated that a fundamental
principle of the new rule is that if there are no benefits, there will be no cost allocated.
FERC's policy requiring cost allocation to be roughly commensurate with the benefits is more aligned with the
efficiency and equity of cost causation principles and should provide the protections for our customers similar to those
that we have long fought for. However, the effectiveness of the new rule will depend on how this implemented in the
various regions.
Since the May 12 filings, utilities have continued to participate in technical conferences and meetings and have
provided additional details on the analysis as requested by regulators. The Arkansas Public Service Commission has a
hearing scheduled for September, and the docket addressing the system agreement and MISO.
Joining MISO marks a significant transformation of the Entergy system, providing greater independence,
transparencies and efficiencies, addressing the exit of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi from the system
agreement, as well as providing substantial benefits for our customers, contributing to the ability to maintain affordable
rates for Entergy's Utility customers. Utility continues to target a system-wide cut-over to MISO by December 2013.
Moving on to Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Starting with Vermont Yankee, last Monday, we announced that
Entergy's board of directors voted to proceed with the October refueling outage. This decision followed the board's
careful deliberation on the merits of the case we filed and the arguments put forth by all parties at the preliminary
injunction hearing conducted in June. The Court has put this case on an accelerated schedule for a mid-September trial
on the merits of the case.
Given that we are in litigation, that's about all we can say about that for the time being. However, even with this
expedited trial schedule, this litigation could well continue for an extended period of time, given the potential for
appeals to the Second Circuit and a writ to the U.S. Supreme Court, as many have speculated where this will all
ultimately end.
Turning to matters in New York, progress continues on the regulatory front related to license renewals. The Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board issued rulings in July, continuing its work to determine the issues that will be the subject of
hearings, and the NRC staff determined the supplement to the safety evaluation report is warranted to document their
updated safety reviews. As a result, hearings at the ASLB likely will not occur earlier than mid-2012, with further
delays possible given the complexity of the issues and the number of parties involved.

In June, we filed notice with the NRC that the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation had not
issued a final decision on our water quality certificate application within the one-year timeframe required by law. The
significance of this is simply if the NRC agrees that a waiver has occurred, then a new water quality certification is not
a requirement for the NRC's issuance of Indian Point's renewed license. But it does not change the need to comply with
the New York State water quality standards, which are the subject of the proceeding of the state pollutant discharge
elimination system permit or SPDES, where the cooling tower versus waste water screen issue being addressed.
Although the SPDES process protects water quality, it is not linked to the NRC license renewal process, like the water
quality certificate process is.
ALJ is planning to move forward with the joint proceedings for both the water quality certificate and SPDES, pending a
waiver by the NRC. Hearings on several issues are now expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2011. Written
testimony on the first round of issues will start July 22, so that process is under way. Final decisions by the DEC on
these trial matters representing the subset of issues in SPDES proceeding are estimated to be up to two years away, and
it could go beyond that.
In spite the likely extended timeframe to resolve issues on Indian Point's license renewal effort, yesterday we signed a
contract extension with Con Ed for 500-megawatts of capacity and energy out of Indian Point's units 2 and 3. The terms
of the PPAs prevent us from sharing all the details. However, we can tell you that the contract is unit-contingent and
contingent on license renewal for a five-year term extending through 2017. It contains market-based pricing
mechanisms within the pre-determined range, permitting low cost energy to West Chester and New York City while
allowing Entergy to meet its goals of hedging energy volumes in periods after license – current license expiration.
The vital role of Indian Point in the region was clear in a draft report prepared by the Charles Rivers Associates for the
New York City Department of Environmental Protection. Key findings of scenarios without Indian point included
higher wholesale electric cost to consumers, beginning at 1.5 billion each year, and after consideration of subsidies for
uneconomic replacements and likely lower carbon levels, higher costs quickly rise to over $2 billion per year, the loss
of 1,100 direct jobs and associated ancillary jobs supporting the plant, substantial grid reliability issues, and increased
air pollution estimated at 15% more carbon emissions and 7% to 8% more NOx.
Underscoring these results was the release by the EPA in early July of its final rule on cross-state air pollution. While
we cannot say that we completely understand how EPA did its modeling – and believe me, we tried – or that we agree
with the results, or that challenges are not likely by a number of parties – this rule is now final. However, based upon
where we stand today and our reading of the rules, New York will need to reduce its summer season NOx emissions by
at least 44%, assuming purchase of emission offsets from other states and by 54% without those offset purchases. In the
summer ozone season in 2010, Indian Point provided over 7 million megawatt hours of NOx-free generation.
New York will also have to reduce its annual NOx and SO2 emissions. Any emissions in excess of allowed amounts in
the state could expose the generators to maximum penalties of $37,500 per ton, per day – and I would emphasize that's
per ton, per day, and that's a big number – and requirements to submit extra penalty emission allowances under the
Clean Air Act. We expect the generators will reflect the cost of NOx and SO2 emissions in their bids and wholesale
market prices will increase, as a result.
Now summing it up for New York, I know the Indian Point license renewal is of significant interest to everybody. It is
certainly to us. We believe the arguments for license renewal are very strong, and they're supported by the facts, as
evidenced by the water quality certificate filing at the New York state DEC and New York City filing for license
renewal.
The NRC process also requires that Indian Point obtain a consistency determination from the New York Department of
State under the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act. Indian Point will file this application in due course, and we
believe the factual case supports obtaining the CZM consistency determination, especially since Indian Point is an
existing facility, not a new one, and since the plant is not seeking permission to change its operations in the coastal
zone.

Now perhaps because of the significance of Indian Point, or maybe because of the proximity of the plant to many of
you who conduct business or reside in New York, there has already been considerable rumors and speculations and
questions that we typically refer to as kind of Inside Baseball stuff. There's an unusual amount of digging on questions
that typically don't come up until much further into the regulatory process, when a public record is starting to emerge.
Specifically, speculations on the probability of some sort of settlement of the issues that would provide needed
direction to both Entergy in operating the plant and the state for long-term energy planning. We agree that would make
a lot of sense for everyone, given the importance of Indian Point and the Entergy environmental needs in New York
and surrounding areas.
As a point-of-view company, we always have a position on the various issues individually or in total, and an economic
valuation of what make sense for our stakeholders at any point in time. Protracted litigation is always an option, but due
to the inherent uncertainty and the cost, the certainty equivalent between the settlement and protracted litigation
produce different results in our analysis. Utilizing sophisticated decision risk analysis and statistical techniques and the
best judgments of experts in each area.
In other words, some sort of commercial agreement among all the parties is always the preferred option. On the other
hand, when the parties cannot find common ground, then we were always prepared to not only rely on the regulatory
review process to make our case, but exhaust court appeals as necessary to secure a fair or reasonable outcome.
In Vermont, we went down various paths to achieve a fair and reasonable outcome, but the non-negotiable demand
from the state to shut down the plant in March 2012 despite the NRC license renewal until 2032 gave us no choice but
to seek relief in Federal Court.
In New York, it is well known – and we disclosed the facts in the spin-off process that offered a number of options to
the state, in order to meet their objectives and still achieve our business objectives, including a more efficient structure
to own the non-utility nuclear asset. In the end, the State's demands on Entergy would have been a step backwards in
terms of our economic efficiency goals compared to the structure we already have in place. We relied on the regulatory
process, and as you know, we did not succeed. And we chose not to appeal to the courts in that instance.
In other words, our record supports the fact we practice what we preach. We are dynamic – emphasis on dynamic –
point of view company. And essentially, everything has a price. That is everything except our ethics and playing in
gray areas of the law, like disclosure issues. Having said that, it is neither appropriate nor advisable to discuss any issue
related to any dialogues or any [indiscernible] (19::49) that is not part of the public record in the various regulatory
processes.
We will not answer questions on things like whether we have talked to certain parties, the positions of the company on
various issues or whether they are negotiable, or speculate on other positions, or disclose those positions that we might
become aware of them, or any other question that could fuel speculation or create mistrust or otherwise interfere with
the regulatory process.
Like I said, there have already been a lot of questions or observations that start to feel like almost reverse psychology,
in order to solicit responses in areas where we have had a long-held policy of not speculating on. I know there will be a
lot more misinformation or rumors through the renewal process duration, but to selectively respond to any one in
particular, despite how much we might want to, given the nature of the rumor, is a slippery slope that we are
determined to stay off. So you're going to get a lot of "no comments" on questions in that area. Our "no comment" will
not stop others speculating, but it will not fuel those rumors.
I just ask that you trust that we always have your best interest clearly in focus, and we have an open mind on how to
best protect and promote that. You all love certainty. Who doesn't, with the exception of maybe some option traders out
there? But unfortunately, we cannot provide that to you today. But we are very early in the process, and as these things
typically unfold, sometimes things get better.
At Pilgrim, we are pleased to report the completion of two open items requiring resolution before the renewal process
the new license can be issued. First on June 30, the NRC staff issued the supplement to a safety evaluation report
completing the additional safety review of the license renewal application. Then two weeks ago, the ASLB issued a

decision rejecting on-remand from the NRC last year, the only admitted contention remaining for them. An appeal of
this rejection by the ASLB is possible, and other late-file contentions remain outstanding. However, the NRC
regulations allow for the issuance of Pilgrim's 20-year license renewal while any appeal for late-file contentions are
pending.
Before closing, I would you remind of the utility's extraordinary efforts to respond to windstorms, tornadoes and floods
affecting all aspects of operations this year. Efforts included protecting generating units along the Mississippi River
from potential flooding, close monitoring of transmission facilities to keep targeted lines in operation, and restoring
approximately 216,000 customer outages from multiple storms, primarily in Arkansas and Mississippi.
Not only are our employees the best at responding to these challenges, but they did so more safely than ever, with the
fewest number of reportable accidents over any six-month period in the company's entire history. The utility is
well-prepared and battle-tested as we face the peak of the hurricane season ahead.
Lastly, in nuclear operations, in May, the Nuclear Energy Institute announced two of the top industry practice awards
recognizing safety innovations for two of Entergy's nuclear plants. The scrutiny of the safety of the nuclear industry has
never been greater, and our employees throughout the company continue to show they are committed and up to the
task.
And now, I will turn the call over to Leo.
Leo P. Denault
Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover quarterly financial results and cash
performance, an update of our share repurchase program, our 2011 earnings guidance, and then I'll share a few closing
thoughts on our long-term financial outlook.
Starting with our financial results on slide two, second quarter 2011 earnings were higher than one year ago at both the
utility and parent and other, while they were lower at EWC. Second quarter earnings included accretion from share
repurchases. The lower share count is due to the effect of repurchases completed both 2010 and 2011, including
initiation of repurchases against the $500 million program during the quarter.
Higher utility results were driven by sales growth across all customer classes, including the effect of warmer than
normal level. Overall, retail sales growth on a weather adjusted basis was also higher than last year driven by continued
strength in the Industrial sector. Parent and other results were higher on the reversal of the tax reserve, and at EWC,
lower power pricing continued to affect results.
Turning now to the details driving quarter-over-quarter results. At the utility, slide three shows higher net revenue was
one factor driving the quarterly earnings increase. Overall retail sales grew by 2.9%, and for the second year in a row,
weather was a significant factor.
In Entergy's service territory, cooling degree days were 38% above normal for the second quarter. The region's
temperature ranked second-hottest in 117 years of available data for the second quarter. Texas and Louisiana
temperatures were especially warm, ranking first and second, respectively. In June, it was particularly warm across the
service territory, with stations averaging at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit above the monthly norm.
Residential sales grew 3.7% but decreased slightly on a weather adjusted basis, while the number of residential
customers increased 0.7%, the usage per customer on a weather-adjusted basis declined.
The trend of increasing industrial sales continued with 2.8% growth this quarter. Industrial expansions in Texas and
Louisiana contributed about 40% of the total industrial increase. Texas is showing the strongest growth of all
jurisdictions, especially in the industrial sector.
Recent reports from the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank noted the positive outlook for refiners and petrochemical
companies along the Gulf Coast. Also on a positive note, consumer confidence in the west south central region, which

includes Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, ranked first in overall confidence among the nine regions in the United
States. These bright spots were partially offset by weakening in small industrials as well as the paper and wood
products segments. These trends have affected Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi, which saw a decrease in
industrial sales compared to strong results in 2010.
Regulatory actions in 2010 also contributed to this quarter's net revenue increase, including rate adjustments in Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy Texas, partially offset by a formula rate plan decrease at Entergy New Orleans.
Also contributing to the utilities earnings increase was lower interest expense. More than $1.3 billion of refinancings
have been executed at an average coupon of 4.6%, a decline of over 100 basis points. As of June 30, the weighted
average coupon rate for the utility's debt portfolio was 5.6% or 30 basis points lower than last year.
Moving on to EWC, the quarter-over-quarter decrease in operational earnings was due primarily to lower net revenue
and a higher effective income tax rate. Net revenue for EWC's portfolio declined as a result of lower energy and
capacity pricing. For the EWC nuclear fleet, the average realized price for the second quarter this year was $52.38 per
megawatt hour or 9% lower than last year. Capacity pricing has also declined over the last several years due to low
demand conditions driven by recession, coupled with a degree of energy efficiency program success and high levels of
demand response.
The collapse has been more severe over the last 12 months in New York. For example monthly spot prices in New
York's rest of state zone ranged from $0.15 to $0.65 per kilowatt month in the second quarter of this year compared to
$0.64 to $3.52 a year ago. The August spot auction for New York rest of state came out a few days ago at just about
$0.05 per kilowatt month.
A major driver that has affected New York capacity markets over the last two months and which will continue to affect
in-city and rest of state prices, unless otherwise resolved, has been the addition of roughly 550 megawatts from Astoria
II that is not been mitigated as expected.
There has been some discussion about creating a new capacity zone in New York for the Lower Hudson Valley area,
potentially by the summer of 2014. Such a development could improve capacity pricing for our Indian Point units
longer term. Other help in the capacity markets will likely come over several years from retirements of certain
generators that currently rely heavily on capacity revenue and were facing increased environmental compliance costs
going forward.
Also these load capacity values may drive a retrenchment of load response programs or at least slow their growth.
System load growth remains a wildcard but there are some possible upside compared to New York's current load
forecasts, which are projected to remain below 2010 levels until 2014.
Operationally, the nuclear fleet produced the 91% capacity factor, slightly higher than the second quarter last year. This
capacity factor improvement is due to eight fewer refueling outage days this year. Non-refueling outage days were
comparable quarter-over-quarter. A higher effective income tax rate at EWC also contributed to the lower earnings.
In May, the State of Michigan enacted legislation that repealed its business tax, replacing it with a corporate income
tax. The new tax law, which will be effective January 1, 2012, eliminates the future deduction, which was available for
certain book and tax differences. Given that this deduction is no longer available, EWC wrote off the related deferred
tax asset.
Finally, parent and other results were higher this quarter, due primarily to lower income tax expense on other activities.
The lower tax expense is attributed to the reversal of the tax reserve, which results from the settlement of an uncertain
tax position. Our 2011 guidance assumes a 35% effective income tax rate, and the tax reserve adjustment recorded this
quarter is consistent with that guidance assumption.
Moving now to slide four, Entergy's operating cash flow performance for second quarter this year reflected a decrease
of approximately $140 million compared to the second quarter of 2010. This decrease in OCF was driven mainly by
two factors, lower deferred fuel cost collections and the previously discussed decrease in Entergy Wholesale
Commodities' net revenue.

I'll now turn to an update on a share repurchase program as reflected on slide five. During the second quarter, we
completed roughly $105 million of share repurchases. We purchased a total of 1.4 million shares at an average price of
$68 per share. About 75% of the repurchases were made through the existing $500 million board-authorized program.
The balance was repurchased to offset the diluted effects of grant exercises.
At the end of last quarter, $425 million remained on the existing $500 million program. Consistent past practice,
decisions on whether to buy back stock will be based on a number of factors, including current business conditions and
investment needs, our liquidity and financial flexibility to quickly respond to changing conditions or opportunities,
particularly since we are approaching the peak of hurricane season, and our point of view on the value of our stock.
Slide six details our current 2011 earnings guidance, which ranges from $6.35 to $6.85 per share on both an as-reported
and operational basis. The guidance range remains unchanged from the numbers we initiated last October.
As we assess our earnings performance to date, we believe we have made good progress to the first half of 2011 and
earnings have benefited from favorable weather. Consequently, we are well positioned relative to our full-year
guidance range. For the rest of the year, efforts will focus on continuing to produce positive financial results through
strong operational performance. Consistent with our past practice, we normally will affirm or revise guidance on a
quarterly basis, and will revise guidance only when we see factors that move our expectations outside of the overall
range we have previously provided.
In closing, I'd like to touch on two topics. First, I'll make a few comments about our EWC's sold forward table in the
release, and then I'll touch on our long-term financial outlook, looking ahead to next year and beyond.
On slide seven, we've summarized information from our EWC nuclear sold forward table on page 5 of the release. This
quarter, we have included a range for the average energy contract revenue per
megawatt-hour, rather than a specific price point. The range takes into account contracts with a collar, like the recent
extension of a Power Purchase Agreement with Con Ed that Wayne mentioned earlier. The lower end of the range
reflects contract floors and the upper end contract ceilings.
At the bottom of table six, the average contract revenue per megawatt-hour, which includes both capacity and energy
revenues, reflects the price that the contracts would settle, assuming current forward market prices.
Slide eight outlines key aspects of Entergy's long-term financial outlook. Starting with the utility, we continue to see
the long-term growth outlook consistent with the 6% to 8% compound average growth rate through 2014 off the 2009
base-year net income. One thing to note is the changes in utility net income can be lumpy due to several factors,
including weather and sales growth, timing of capital investments, and regulatory actions. All of these items do not
occur evenly from year-to-year.
For EWC, we expect declining revenues as price trends for energy and capacity play out over the next few years in both
sold and unsold volumes. As we outline in Table six in the release, assuming current contracts and forward markets for
EWC nuclear output, average prices decreased in 2012 and again in 2013, before recovery starts in 2014. Long-term
EWC offers a valuable option on positive effects of ongoing economic growth and environmental regulation.
Parents and other can vary from year-to-year. Parent interest expense depends on the level of borrowing as well as the
cost of debt, given the range of possible private and public financing options and the timing of their execution. And
income tax expense can fluctuate with resolution of unresolved income tax issues.
Our capital deployment philosophy focuses on maintaining a balanced investment and capital return program. Our
capital plan includes expenditures to support continued safe and reliable operations as well as value-added productive
investments. We also plan to maintain a capital return program which includes common stock dividends and share
repurchases. Our current long-term outlook remains to return up to $4 billion to $5 billion to shareholders from 2012
through 2014.

As we move into the next quarter, we recognize that many of you will continue to fine-tune your estimates for the
coming year and beyond. In that regard, we provided additional details on key business drivers in the appendix of this
webcast presentation.
Our over-arching aspiration remains top-quartile total shareholder return. Conditions in the commodity markets and the
interim uncertainties for the full agenda of strategic initiatives that Wayne reviewed earlier have left us well-short of
this aspiration in recent years. Nevertheless, the management team continues to focus on delivering results that will
create tangible long-term value we can return to you, the financial yardstick of our success. To that end, we will
continue to focus on safety, operational excellence, risk management, and disciplined capital deployment to maximize
the value of our company.
And now, the Entergy team is available for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: On the water permit, if the NRC doesn't agree that – doesn't agree to the waiver, and if the
water permit actually is denied, what would be the next steps?
<A>: If the water permit is denied by the state of New York, the remedy available to the company would be to appeal
it.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, and can the plant operate while that's going on? I guess that's the case with Vermont
Yankee. If you guys – if the case doesn't go your way in Vermont or New York, while it's under appeal, these plants
can still operate. Is that right?
<A>: Right. But particularly, I'll make note of the term, the timely file doctrine, that allows the plants to continue to
operate, assuming that the facility has sought relicensing from the NRC at least five years prior to plant expiration. And
in the case of New York, our point of view is that the timely filed doctrine would apply, that would allow the plant to
continue operating, while we were resolving the issues you just raised.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, great. And then just on the capacity markets in the Northeast, we have seen Astoria and
Ravenswood file for emergency – I don't know – petition at FERC, I guess – to basically have market mitigation –
buyer side market power mitigation. And we are seeing efforts in New England by generators to do the same.
Do you guys see the potential for – I guess ISO activity to potentially raise the capacity market by going after these
out-of-market revenue generators?
<A>: Yes, Paul. I mean we are part of many of those proceedings, both as a member of the ISOs but also at FERC. So I
think it's going to play out over the next year or so, both within the ISOs and then also eventually at FERC. So – and in
fact you have seen preliminary rulings coming out of FERC on PDM on the same issue.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right. So what kind of – can you give us an idea about what you think might happen in terms
of capacity pricing in the northeast as a result of this? Any sense? I mean, I know it's kind of foggy right now, but -
<A>: Well, if the mitigation takes places, as Leo went through the details of what's going on in the quarter, and both of
those markets, the prices are depressed. So with the market mitigation, they bid in anywhere from 75% to 80% of what
their newbuild cost is – is what they have to bid into. So logically, that's going to increase those capacity prices.

And we'll move next to Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Hi, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Without trying to pin you down on questions you don't answer, are there some external data
points we should be following as far as New York is concerned? Maybe the monitor discussions you're having, or the
process outside of kind of the more obvious New York decisions on the water permit?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Well, I mean, there will be, but I think the water quality permit, as we stand today, is
probably about as -maybe front and center as far as what options we will have or direction that we may head go going
forward.
There's – again, I hesitate to get into it, because it's early in the process. And for reasons I just outlined. And I
apologize. I can't at this point. But it just wouldn't be advisable.
But I'd say on the water quality permit, and in particular the issue there that we just discussed – what if it's not
approved, I think the question there that you have to keep in mind is, is it headed for conditional approval? Or rather
than rejection, put in cooling towers, versus flat rejection, or conditioned upon something else. And I think just
following those hearings versus making the assumption that it is a up or down, rejection or proceed. Other than that, I'm
not sure I can help you at this point.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay, that's -
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: As time passes, we will keep you updated on those things that we feel comfortable
commenting on, that are part of the public record. But today, there isn't much.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. That's fair. And then on – just on the hedging philosophy right now, obviously there's a
big step-up in percentage of generation that was sold for 2013 with the contracting. How should we think about kind of
the strategy on filling out '13 or maybe looking out at '14 to '15, what you guys would expect as far as selling more of
that power output?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Dan, this is Leo. We're pretty comfortable with the levels we are right now. We're going to
continue to execute on the hedging strategy, based on the limits we put in place. And the – our point of view about
them in the market. Obviously, we have limits that are based on things like financial policy, liquidity and credit ratings
and the like.
And we're in pretty good shape, where we stand right now, for where we want to be. We've had to spend a lot of time
figuring out the right way to hedge going forward. As Wayne mentioned, the idea of hedging out beyond on the current
licenses is one that we have to make sure that we put additional risk management structures around, and we do that
first, before we make any transaction decisions. But right now we'll really be just basing it on what our point of view is
going forward in the markets, and where we think things are going to go.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And just to make sure, so the out-year number is the '14, '15 – those hedge pieces are effectively
the Midwest plants plus kind of the Indian Point contract with Con Ed? Is that a fair representation of mix of what's
captured so far?

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yes, the majority. Yes.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And just one last question, just on the Cooper plant. Is there any exposure to you guys,
given the flooding issues there, as far as maybe additional spending or impact on payments they make to you guys for
running the plant?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: John Herron.
<A - John T. Herron>: Yes, Dan. No, there's no impact. The plant did very well during the flooding issue. And we're
continuing to watch. And actually, the river has already crested, is already declining. And the plant actually did very
well. So we don't see any impact there.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A>: Thank you.

And we'll take the next question from Ashar Khan from Visium.
<A>: Good morning, Ashar.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Good morning. Leo, I want to go back to the slide that was in your guidance for this year. There
was a $0.62 negative variance for the weather. And so based on what you provided in the release, you're up like $0.02,
if I'm right, on weather, year-over-year?
So am I correct? We are running nearly like on – based on what you provided last year for this year, we're running like
$0.64 ahead as you stand on weather for 2011 versus 10? As a positive thing?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, we haven't done third quarter yet, Ashar. So the third quarter is really kind of – as you
know, for us, given the location of our service territory, third quarter is a big quarter for us, could make or break us
either way. We could have weather that's below normal cooling degree days or above normal cooling degree days.
So yes, we're running pretty comparable to where we were last year, which was a pretty big year, both in the winter and
the summer. But until we get through the third quarter, I wouldn't declare weather closed in the books yet, one way or
the other. And obviously, we always go back at the end of the year, when we get ready to do next year guidance, and
we'll adjust back to normal weather for next year, as well.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. And my second question, if I can ask, can you address, what was average purchase price for
the shares that were purchased in the second quarter?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: About $68.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: $68. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Steven Fleishman from Bank of America.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yes. Hi, good morning.

water permit filing?

<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Go ahead, Chuck.
<A - Chuck Barlow>: Hey, Steve. This is Chuck Barlow. No, there's really not. There's not any pressure on the NRC
to make a ruling on that really until they get much closer to the actual ruling on our license renewal application.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. This is the waiver issue, correct?
<A - Chuck Barlow>: The waiver issue -
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Chuck Barlow>: – for Indian Point.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Will they take comments and other stuff as part of that? Or no, there's a process? Or it'll
just suddenly come out one day?
<A - Chuck Barlow>: I don't know the answer to that. We've made our filing. There had been responses filed with the
NRC by the DEC and by Riverkeeper. What their process going forward will be, we really have not been informed.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: And then Wayne, just – I'll do my best to try and interpret what you were trying to say,
but maybe I kind of read it as we're just going to hear a lot of things over this period, and hearing a lot of things early
on. And I guess one thing you're trying say – look, if in the end, it makes for shareholders to settle on issues, just to let
us know that you're going to be looking to what's the best risk/return option, I guess?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: That's right. I mean, you're very plugged in, as you always are, to a lot of these rumors. And
I think, what's really kind of precipitated a lot of this is the, it would make a lot of sense for both parties to come to
together with something that would give direction to the State and direction to us. Obviously that makes sense.
In the process of posturing, sometimes, things get in to the press that are just not true or whatever, and we can't
comment on those kind of things. And then, in the process of trade presses and others trying to get more information, I
do see there are rumors, speculation that have been leaked as fact, and – or postured, or we've positioned as not willing
to consider certain things. And that's just not true.
I mean, as you've known over the years, we've spent – some people in this room have spent careers at negotiating
tables. Sometimes it turns out well, and sometimes we have deadlocked. But that is our preferred position, and in this
case, it would be a preferred outcome. But it has to make commercial sense.
And I guess the point that we're trying to make is just a – not a warning, we don't need to warn you all – but just there
will be a lot of things out there that just aren't true. And we would like to respond to them, but that would only, like I
said, create distrust among a lot of parties, and we don't have the best record in New York already, coming out of the
Enexus spin, in terms of trust and things of that nature. And we're trying to rebuild that. And commenting on these
rumors, it always gets – words get turned around and things. And we're going to stay away from that.
And so we are, like you kind of described, we do continue to develop scenarios that would be in the best interest versus
a protracted litigation, and we're open to ideas at any of these processes. And hopefully, they won't have to go the
whole nine innings here.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. One last quick thing, I guess for Leo. Just on these the new data on the hedges with
collars. You might have said this and I missed it, but at current forwards or something like that, would you be at the
low end of the collar on these, or -
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: They'd be probably in the middle end of them at the moment.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. So probably the best thing is to assume middle, and then if things get a lot better,
it's higher, and if things get worse, it's lower.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Right. But if you look in the table, where we get down to the bottom of that table, where we
put in the percent sold on a total revenue basis, it's got capacity and energy in it. The energy portion of that is at what

we would settle at today, if it was the forward curve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: In that bottom section of the table where we present the percent sold on a revenue basis,
that includes all revenue, including capacity. That estimate is a single point. And that single point is using today's

And we'll move next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Good morning.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Can you hear me?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Yes.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Firstly, to follow up on the questions on the nuclear side, the ASLB had
previously issued a release suggesting it anticipated resolving the program renewal by the end of July 2011. Is there any
new comparable date we should be looking out for? Is there any kind of defined or prescribed timeline at this point in
the process?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Okay.
<A>: Currently, the end of year 2011.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And then secondly, could you comment briefly on you efforts to renew the
FRPs in Louisiana? It seems as if you suggested there could be a potential new rate case filing in the state.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Okay, Gary.
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: Yes. We made our last filing for this three-year term with the FRP in May, and those rates go
into effect in September. And so at this point, we will continue to work with the staff. We intend to work to continue to
FRPs and renew those for another term. They've been very efficient. They work well for our customers and for owners.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So you would anticipate resolving the FRP renewal by September or in the next
couple of months?
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: Really there are two different issues. If you look at the filing that rates went in – will go into
effect in September, so we will need to obviously have that approved by the LPSC. And our intent to resolve the FRP,
as far as renewals – hopefully by the time we would refile in May of next year.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And then thirdly, can you just quickly discuss the potential for a Texas rate
case, in light of the latest legislation, et cetera?
[004XY1-E Gary Taylor]Yes. If you look at Texas, I mean, all of our jurisdictions, I mean one of the fundamentals in
our plan is that each of our businesses earn their authorized return. The efforts in Texas, as Wayne talked about, if it
comes to fruition, especially the capacity rider, will help us do a lot of that.

The capacity rider may require us to file a base rate case, just to set the baseline. We've already done that for
transmission, and we proactively already did that for distribution in our last rate case. But we look significantly at
where that is. That's the biggest pressure on it. And depending on where they are with relation to ROEs and whether we
get these riders done, we'll require, whether or not we file a rate case, which we can do each year in Texas.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you.
<A>: Okay. Thank you.

We'll take the next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hi. You've talked at length about Cross-States Rule and the impact on the non-regulated
side. Just curious, how are you thinking about what it means for the regulated side of the business, in terms of potential
rate base growth opportunities, and in terms of your Arkansas coal plant that may need scrubbing, et cetera?
<A>: Okay. It's a complicated question. I'm going to start with – I'll let Rod talk about kind of the – how it affects that
side. And I'll let Gary follow-up specifically on how they're thinking about how it affects the business plan.
<A - Roderick K. West>: Good. The first part of the tag team is we're assessing the impact on the rule.
Obviously, the issues for us stem around timing, where the EPA, prior to what we knew as the transport rule before this
finding by the EPA, had a – we were assuming a 2014 effective date. We've now moved up, under the rules, to 2012.
That certainly has an impact. And then when you combine the notion of allowances, all of those effect a prospective
cost of compliance, and certainly the fines.
On the regulated side of the fence, which Gary can talk to, obviously there are assumptions made by the EPA regarding
the retirement of plants in our regulated space, quite candidly, that are needed, whether it's reliability purposes,
transmission, base load, load following, reliability must-run designation.
And there's a lot that we have to do to try and assess where that is. And it's a dynamic process for us. We're just not at a
point right now where we're taking a firm company point of view, because we ultimately have to determine what this
means for our customers, and that's an iterative conversation with the regulators. Gary?
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: Well, I'll actually cover it, Michael, probably in two parts. The first is really there is
mechanisms for environmental cost recovery to SOx and NOx in each of our jurisdictions. In the case of EGSL and
ELL and ELI, there are environmental adjustment riders that are available to cover those costs, as well as through
Arkansas Public Service, the APSC and the NPSC and the Public Utility Commission of Texas, have us recover it
through fuel.
The rule is new, as I think – which you just heard from Rod and changed significantly from what we saw and expected
in 2014. So we are in the process of actually evaluating what would have to be done to each of those plants. In each
case; there are technological solutions that would require some capital investment.
We've not gotten far enough down the road to really say what those are. We knew what they were going to be. We
didn't think they would be significant as it existed under – when it's 2014 and what was the proposed rule.
We believe, though, initially, as we're looking forward to it, that we would still be able to make those investments. As
Rod said, those plants are reliability must-run and I think we're going to be able to do that in a cost effective way. But I
think that's going to be more evolved as we're studying it right now. This is fairly new.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll follow up offline.
<A>: Thanks, Michael.
