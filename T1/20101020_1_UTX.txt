Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.
Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Katie, and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, solid results and end
market environment that continues to improve. Some key takeaways for the quarter, organic revenues grew 3% and
segment operating profits grew 9% adjusted for restructuring and one-time items, demonstrates the benefits of our
structural cost reduction and the resulting strong operating leverage. Segment operating margin set another record and

free cash flow was very strong at 125% of net income.
As you all know, the global economic recovery remains uneven. The global airline industry continues to gain traction
as airlines have kept capacity additions well below air traffic growth, leading to higher yields and capacity utilization.
On the other hand, commercial construction markets remain weak with the exception of emerging markets. In the face
of this economic picture, UTC will continue to focus on cost containment and rigorous process improvements in our
factories, our back offices and our supply chain.
Based on this strong year-to-date performance we are confident in raising our EPS guidance to $4.70. That's the high
end of our prior range of 4.60 to 4.70. While firming up our outlook of 4.70 or 14% EPS growth, we're also increasing
our estimate of restructuring costs in excess of one-time items by $100 million. That's now $0.28 per share for the full
year versus our prior guidance of $0.20.
Given unevenness of the global economic recovery we're going to continue to aggressively take out structural costs to
position UTC to grow earnings consistently in the years ahead.
Turning to third quarter results, as I mentioned, revenues grew organically at 3%. Carrier had another very solid quarter
with 7% organic growth driven primarily by continuing strength in the Transicold business.
Pratt & Whitney saw the expected recovery in the commercial aftermarket and Hamilton Sundstrand returned to
organic growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2009. On the other hand, Sikorsky's revenues declined 6%.
But they remain on track to deliver on the revenue guidance for full year of up high single-digits.
Earnings per share in the third quarter were 1.30. That's up 14%. Net restructuring and one-time items were a charge of
$0.09. Excluding restructuring and one-time items in the third quarter of both 2009 and 2010, earnings per share
increased 9%.
Restructuring charges in the quarter were 58 million and significant one-time items included an impairment charge of
$159 million or $0.17 per share, to bring our Clipper Windpower investment to market value as of September 30.
This week, as you know doubt heard, we've announced our agreement to acquire the remaining 50.1% of Clipper at
$0.65 per share. We continue to see wind power as an attractive, high growth market, and Clipper Windpower will
benefit greatly from the operational and financial strength of UTC.
Partially offsetting the Clipper charge was a net tax benefit of $102 million related to our decision to repay additional
high tax foreign dividends as a result of recent U.S. tax law changes. The accelerated dividend planning provides a
benefit this year but the tax law change is a negative going forward as it will limit our ability to utilize foreign tax
credits.
Cost execution continues to be exceptional across our businesses, resulting in segment margin expansion of 90 basis
points to another record of 16.3%. Year-to-date segment margin expansion is 110 basis points. Strong evidence of the
operating leverage, our relentless focus on cost control.
Five of the six business units improved margins on an adjusted basis with Carrier, Fire & Security and Sikorsky
increasing by over 100 basis points. Once again, Carrier led the way with 200 basis points of margin expansion to
12.1%.
E&D was up by $89 million over last year's third quarter and is now up $152 million year-to-date. We now expect
engineering and development to be up around 225 million for the year. Hamilton continues to support the 787 flight test
program, but program delays continue to put pressure on their E&D spend. Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky also
continued to ramp up new product development programs.
Okay. On to slide two, order rates. Order rates remained robust across the business with a few exceptions. Importantly,
commercial aerospace aftermarket orders improved in line with our expectations for double-digit growth in the second
half. Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sunstrand commercial spares orders increased by 35 and 13%, respectively.
Carrier's U.S. residential HVAC shipments actually declined in the quarter due to consumer related weakness while

Hamilton's short cycle industrial businesses continued to grow strongly.
Orders in our long cycle businesses were mixed. Otis new equipment orders were flattish while Carrier's commercial
HVAC, global new equipment and total Fire & Security were up 4 and 7%, respectively.
Slide three, in the quarter, free cash flow was 125% of net income, as I mentioned. Strong performance even as we
made additional pension contributions. Importantly, for the year, we now expect free cash flow to exceed net income.
In the quarter, we contributed $350 million in cash to our domestic pension plans, bringing year-to-date cash and stock
contributions to $800 million. We now expect total domestic pension contributions to be around $1 billion for the year.
We also maintained the pace of share repurchase at nearly 500 million in the quarter, and year-to-date we've now
repurchased over $1.6 billion in stock. For the full year we expect to repurchase at least $2 billion.
So another solid quarter, continued organic revenue growth and a focus on cost reduction that drove strong earnings
growth, margin expansion and good cash flow.
I'll come back and talk a little bit more about the fourth quarter and 2011, but for now let me turn to it over to Akhil to
take you through the business unit details.
Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations
Thanks, Greg, turning to page four, let me remind you that I will talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring
and nonrecurring items as we usually do.
Otis had another strong quarter with margin expansion of 60 basis points to a record 23.7%. At constant currency,
profits grew 5% on flat revenues as benefits from higher service revenue globally and the ongoing cost reductions more
than offset the impact of lower new equipment volume and pricing. Foreign currency reduced revenue by two points
and profits by four points.
New equipment revenue was down 3% in the quarter, excluding currency, as growth in the BRIC countries and the
Middle East partially offset lower volume in North America. Service revenues offset the new equipment decline driven
by continued growth in contractual maintenance and improving repair sales.
New equipment orders in the quarter were essentially flat at constant currency as robust growth in Europe and a modest
increase in China were offset by around 25% decline in North America. On a year-to-date basis, new equipment orders
are up 4% at constant currency, led by China, where orders are up over 15%.
In light of continued strong operating margin performance at Otis and the recent U.S. dollar weakness, we now expect
full year profit to grow by at least $75 million as compared to our prior guidance of around $50 million. We expect Otis
revenues to be down slightly for the year from the mid single-digit decline in new equipment.
On slide five, Carrier continues its transformation to a high returns business and posted record Q3 margin of 12.1%.
Profit grew 19% on flat revenues resulting in 200 basis points of margin expansion. As Greg said, organic revenue
growth in the quarter was 7%, similar to what we saw last quarter.
Continued strength in Transicold, Asian and Latin American HVAC markets more than offset weakness in shipments
of U.S. residential systems which were down high single-digit. Transicold's organic revenues were up 40% while
global commercial HVAC equipment organic revenues were up slightly.
Order rates for global commercial HVAC equipment were up mid single-digit at constant currency. Profit growth was
driven by strong conversion on organic revenue growth as headwind from commodities and a $30 million one-time
charge related an unconsolidated foreign joint venture was more than offset by carryover benefits from cost reduction
and restructuring. We reaffirm Carriers prior guidance of profit growth for the year of $250 million plus on mid
single-digit organic revenue growth.

UTC Fire & Security delivered operating margin expansion of 140 basis points on 20% higher revenues. Organically,
revenues increased 1% with the product businesses increasing low single-digits and the service and install businesses
flat. Net acquisitions, primarily GE Security, contributed 21 points of revenue growth. Foreign currency translation
decreased revenues, 2% year-over-year.
Third quarter orders grew organically 7%, following mid single-digit rate growth in Q2. Backlog is up at a mid-teen
organic growth rate from the beginning of the year. Orders in Asia as well as the global product businesses were up
around 20% year-over-year. Operating profit grew 35% driven by acquisitions and the continuing benefits of
productivity initiatives, integration of field operations and restructuring.
For the full year, we expect Fire & Security revenues to grow high-teens and operating profit to be up approximately
$200 million compared to the prior guidance of up 200 to $225 million.
Turing to aerospace on slide seven, at Pratt & Whitney, revenues were up 7% in the quarter, including 4 points from
favorable currency conversion at Pratt & Whitney Canada. Higher commercial aftermarket and military revenues were
partially offset by declines at Power Systems and Rocketdyne. As expected, large commercial engine spares revenues
increased in the quarter and were up about 25% as compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Book-to-bill in the quarter was slightly above one.
Operating profit was up 12%, driven by the benefits of favorable currency at Pratt Canada and higher overall volumes
which more than offset higher E&D and the absence of favorable contractual items recorded in the third quarter of
2009.
Operating margin at 17.2% was up 70 basis points. We remain confident in Pratt's full year guidance for an operating
profit increase of 75 to $100 million on low single-digit growth in revenues.
In the quarter, Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were up 1%. On an organic basis, revenues were up 4%. Aero OEM and
commercial aftermarket revenues were up slow single-digits while military aftermarket was down mid-teens. Industrial
revenues were up mid single-digits and up 14% organically.
Commercial spares revenues were flat to last year but orders were up 13%. Industrial orders increased approximately
30% on a constant currency basis. Orders were up across all industrial businesses with particular strength in the Sullair
compressor business.
Operating profit was down slightly due to the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of a business, adjusted for this,
operating profit was up mid single-digits.
This improvement reflects the benefits from higher volumes, continuing cost control and restructuring which more than
offset the impact of higher E&D on multiple new platforms including 787. In spite of the latest 787 delay, we continue
to expect Hamilton Sundstrand's operating profit for the full year to be up 25 to $50 million and revenue up slightly.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide nine, operating profits grew by 8% on 6% lower revenues. During the quarter, Sikorsky
shipped a total of 62 large helicopters, one more than the third quarter of 2009. 52 aircraft were based on military
platforms and 10 commercial.
Lower revenue in the quarter was driven by a different mix of aircraft deliveries. Q3 2009 included two high value
international development aircraft and three more S-92's. This impact was partially offset by increased aftermarket and
U.S. military aircraft volumes.
Operating margin expanded 150 basis points in the quarter to 11% from a favorable mix within military aircraft and
higher aftermarket volumes, partially offset by increased E&D spend.
Of note during the quarter, the X2 Technology Demonstrator aircraft achieved its goal of 250 knots. The X2 is already
generating substantial customer interest for high speed missions.

We remain confident in Sikorsky's 2010 guidance with revenues projected to grow in the high single-digits and
operating profit expected to increase 100 to $125 million.
With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.
Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Thanks, Akhil. Moving on to slide 10 now, organic growth cost traction momentum continues at UTC. Once
again, record segment margins and strong cash generation, the things you've come to expect from UTC. For the full
year, we still expect organic revenue growth to be around 2% and overall revenues to be around $54 billion.
Our strong year-to-date performance gives us confidence in our 2010 earnings per share outlook of 4.70, and the higher
restructuring positions as well for 2011. As we close out the year, we expect operating performance to remain strong,
even in the face of slower economic growth.
We're also going to see tougher compares for Carrier in the fourth quarter, higher E&D, and adverse FX. Even though
the U.S. dollar as weakened considerably in recent weeks, it's still significantly below last year's fourth quarter average
of 1.48.
Slide 11, just turning quickly to 2011, while we do face multiple headwinds such as higher pensions, taxes and
engineering investment, as well as slow recovery in many of our end markets, we are committed to double-digit
earnings growth in 2011.
At current discount rates, pension expense will be about a $0.20 headwind next year. Based on the recently enacted tax
law changes, we know that our effective tax rate will go up next year to around 31%, which costs us another $0.15 a
share. Our engineering investments, while positioning UTC for strong, long-term growth, will be a near-term
headwind.
On the plus side though, as we've said before, we will return to the UTC formula of restructuring equal to gains. And
this will result in a net benefit next year of $0.28. We also expect to see operating margin improvement next year at
Carrier, Fire & Security and Sikorsky as they all continue to track towards their medium term margin targets.
You should also keep in mind that 40% of UTC's revenues are in the highly stable and profitable aftermarket. While
these revenues are not immune to the economic downturn, we are seeing positive trends and expect continued growth,
some of which is in the form of pent up demand.
Given the strong RPM and improving airline profitability, we expect to see continuing improvement in the commercial
aero aftermarkets at both Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand.
FX and Commodities remain a significant question mark, given the volatility we've seen this year. In looking at FX,
while the euro rate has been around 1.32 so far this year, it's fluctuated between 1.19 and 1.41 just since June. As for
commodities, we have seen a run-up recently in prices. Copper for example has risen from around $3 to $3.80 over the
last three months and oil prices are back in the 80's. And while that increases our input costs, it also drives more
demand for UTC's energy-efficient products. These are uncertainties that we will have to manage as we always do.
In summary, we remain committed to our target of double-digit earnings growth in 2011, even in the face of some
challenging headwinds. We will provide specific guidance at our December meeting and you can be assured that the
UTC leadership team is focused on delivering to its 2010 commitments and establishing aggressive plans for 2011.
With that, let's open up the call for questions. Katie?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So to Greg, I just wanted to pick up on the 2011 road map. First of all, so I think you said 1.32 FX
rate year-to-date?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So I'm assuming at current rates the FX rate would be closer to 1.34 for the full year so I'm guessing
FX right now wouldn't be a material tailwind in 2011?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it's actually neither a headwind
nor a tailwind right now. I think the issue really is going to be on the commodity side because as the FX rate has gone
in our favor for these last three months, commodities are actually going the other way, so probably a 40, $50 million
headwind right now in commodities next year.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's not too big. And what about, obviously you mentioned the E&D and the Canadian
dollar. I mean, clearly moving targets right now but were you prepared to give us a placeholder for those two items?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: As we said before, on E&D at Pratt
we've got at least $100 million of headwind next year on programs that have already been announced and that's the
CSeries, MRJ and Irkut for the PurePower 1000. Obviously that could be even higher if we get a expected launch of the
Airbus A320 NEO later this year but I think 100 million plus right now is probably the best I can do for you.
On FX, probably in the 70, $75 million range in terms of a headwind for Pratt Canada as we see it right now.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And the – obviously you produce air conditioner units in Japan with the – with Toshiba which gets
exported. I mean, would that have a material impact next year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'm sorry, ask that question again?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: The Toshiba JV in Japan, I mean, obviously we've seen a big increase in the yen. Will that have – is
that having a material impact this year and will it have an impact next year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I mean, that's really not very
significant at all. Total FX at Carrier has not really been a -
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yeah, Nigel, we have a 40% share in the Toshiba joint
venture, as you know, and the profitability is not that great, not that big, so it doesn't impact us very much.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then on the A320 re-engine, there's obviously a big kind of to and fro with that program.
But what is your current understanding in terms of timing and the tone of conversations with Airbus?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We still are working actively with the
team at Airbus, and I think as you've heard many times they're trying to sort out where they are in engineering
resources before they launch this program. But we still fully expect this to be launched before the end of the year.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then finally, just to kind of putting all these together, the 2011 outlook, do you still think
you can do 10% growth next year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, absolutely. I think that's –
again, I think we feel more confident today with the euro where it is today and with our visibility into 2011. We feel
confident that target of 10% is doable.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And what could derail that target? I mean, if we see a big run up in copper? I mean, what do you
think is the single biggest risk to that 10%?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I think the two big risks you
have out there are going to be what happens with FX and what happens with the global economy. I think, again, we're
not immune from the global economy. I think, again, the end markets look to be improving, but any big shock to the
global economy could still be – make it tough.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, but you're more immune than most. Thanks, Greg.

Your next question will come from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
<Q - Howard Rubel>: Thank you very much. I'll just keep it to one question though. Could you explain what's left to
do at Carrier? These are great numbers, and where do you take it? I mean, I know you have a longer term target, Greg,
but what's really left to do from a blocking and tackling and then even a strategic basis?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think in terms of the blocking and
tackling, it's been pretty much done in terms of the structure at Carrier. We've divested about $2.2 billion of revenue. I
think Geraud's got another 500 to maybe up to $1 billion to go, but most of that is on track. I think we've got some
distributions still in the Northeast and Canada that we're taking a look at.
We've got some of our other operations internationally on the res side but that really is all in place. I think the cost
structure has been optimized now and you see these wonderful conversion rates on – kind of mid single-digit revenue
growth you're getting 19% earnings growth. It's a – I think that's the thing that gives us confidence as we go forward
margins are going to be even better.
As you look at this quarter, at Carrier, we had 200 basis points of margin expansion. That included a $30 million charge
that Akhil described. Absent that one-time charge, you would have seen 300 basis points of margin expansion so I
think the Carrier story is well on track.
<Q - Howard Rubel>: You're just going to change the bar at some point then?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's a great question for Geraud in
March.
<Q - Howard Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks, Howard.

Your next question is from David Strauss with UBS.
<Q - David Strauss>: Morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David Strauss>: Greg, it looks like you took up E&D guidance for 2010. You've obviously – have additional
restructuring spending you're talking about. How much of this was an attempt to pull some spending from 2011 into
2010?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's – as I think, we're going to take
E&D, we had said $150 million plus now we're looking around 225, so that's $75 million. I'd tell you about a third of
that is at Hamilton, part of that's on 787. We've also got increases really across the board. You have you some at Pratt,
some at Sikorsky and some of these new technology programs and also additional at F&S with the GE Security deal.

<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: We continue to invest in new game changing technologies I
think as Louis has talked about a lot and Greg has. So I think it's appropriate to see some increases in E&D.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: But in terms of – I don't really think
this is going to do much in terms of next year. This really isn't going to impact our view on next year's E&D bill if
that's your question, David.
<Q - David Strauss>: Yeah. And then I guess on the restructuring side as well, is any of this an attempt to kind of get
ahead of things for 2011?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Absolutely. All of this restructuring
that we're doing this year, really I mean, it's structural cost take out to position us to grow earnings, not just next year
but the years after that, there's a lot of good things going on.
<Q - David Strauss>: And then your FX assumptions for the fourth quarter where do you stand now in terms of
contingency at the 4.70 level?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, we talked about contingency I
think back in second quarter. We had about $100 million of contingency left. I'd tell you that's really all been taking up
even though we've seen good news on FX since then. We've had bad news on obviously- or consensus has moved up.
We've also seen E&D up and restructuring up. So again, right now I think we're very comfortable with 4.70 but I don't
have a big contingency left.
<Q - David Strauss>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question interest comes from Robert Stallard with RBC.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Greg, just a couple of questions on the aerospace aftermarket. First of all, I was wondering if
Pratt & Whitney, very strong quarter for aero engines sales there, was there anything unusual? Do you expect this to
revert back to a more normal rate next quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No. I don't think there's anything
unusual in the run rate there.
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Nope. No, Rob.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: So the 25% growth year-on-year was that very easy comps versus last year really?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's really the issue. I think last year
was down significantly, so again it's – orders remember were up 35%, sales were up 25% so easy compare to last year.
I think last year's third quarter was one of our worst in terms of order intake but a strong recovery. It's really in line
with what we've been talking about all year. We had visibility into what the airlines were doing. We were confident the
second half was going to be better. Really it's just no surprise here I think. Maybe a little surprise in the orders up 35
but I think it's in line with what we expected.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. And then secondly at Hamilton Sundstrand, commercial orders there up 13%. Do you
expect that to convert into revenues in Q4 into Q1? And also, is there any element to the 787 initial sparing in there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: There really isn't anything on the 787
but I will tell you that we expect aftermarket revenues to be up at Hamilton in the fourth quarter strongly. As you saw
this quarter, aftermarket revenues were only up slightly with 13% order growth. So some of these orders are a little

longer lead but we are going to see good revenue growth in aftermarket in the fourth quarter and that should continue
into early next year. We don't expect 787 provisioning really to be a major part of the Hamilton story until the second
half of next year at this point.

Your next question is from Deane Dray with Citi Investment Research.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hey, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: I'd be interested in hearing the thoughts on Clipper. It didn't sound as though this was your near
term plans to become a wholly-owned subsidiary. What are the expectations, and where might this be included on a
segment basis?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, this clearly was not the plan
when we made the initial investment back in January when we bought the 49.9%. I think as Louis has said, as I have
mentioned to you, the idea here was to make a small investment in alternative energy in a business that we saw had
very, very solid technology, but not very good operating disciplines. Unfortunately, the wind market was a lot worse
than anybody expected, and as a result of that, Clipper got into a liquidity problem. And of course they looked to us to
bail them out. And as we looked at this, the thought of lending money to Clipper was not nearly as attractive as actually
buying the rest of Clipper and controlling this business.
And really it's a – again, it's still a small investment in the scheme of UTC. We'll have about $375 million total cash
invested in this business and we'll see how it goes. We fully expect long-term that this is going to be a high growth
market. It's a $60 billion wind market, and this year obviously it's down. But the opportunity still remains long-term, I
think, for wind to grow. And we're going to do what you would expect with any UTC acquisition. We're going to put
our folks in there. We're going to use the ACE operating disciplines and we're going to make that place look like any
other UTC business.
The other thing we're going to do with Clipper, not surprising, is we have to expand it internationally. It's really been
just a U.S. play for the last few years, and the idea – step one after we get our folks there is we've got to expand into the
emerging markets. We have to find partners in China and India, and we have to grow that business. So look, it wasn't
what we had planned to do. I think it was the right thing to do, and it gives us an option in a great growth market.
<Q - Deane Dray>: That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question on Carrier on the residential side, if you could
just give some color regarding the cooling season, the split between OE and aftermarket, and especially how did the
Watsco joint venture play out versus expectations?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, the residential cooling season
was not what we had expected, especially with the record weather we saw across the U.S. Shipments I think were down
9% in the quarter for Carrier, and we think we're probably in line with the market. What we saw was a big growth in
repair versus replacement. And that really goes to the new 410A that was introduced back in January with a new
refrigerant – the cost to replace a system almost doubled when had you a compressor failure.
So I think what consumers did, what we would expect them to do is they're repairing their old units as opposed to
replacing the whole system. And that really caused havoc with the overall shipments for the industry in the quarter.
As far as Watsco goes, I think it's in line with expectations. It's about a little more than $10 million year-over-year
benefit to Carrier in terms of earnings from our Carrier enterprises business. Akhil, anything?

<Q - Deane Dray>: Great. Just comment on Carrier, still left to do. You said there was still some on the residential
side. Is that part of structural cost or is it distribution?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's distribution.
<Q - Deane Dray>: And is that the same geographic – you said Northeast, Canada?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, Northeast and Canada are really
the two big North American distribution plays still left, and again, actively working on those.

Your next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America [Bank of America Merrill Lynch].
<Q - Ron Epstein>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hey, Ron.
<Q - Ron Epstein>: Greg, could you, in terms of the China business with Otis, when you look sequentially from Q1,
Q2, Q3, did you see any acceleration in order activity?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think what we saw is deceleration in
the rate of growth. Obviously first quarter was very strong, up nearly 50%. This quarter in China at Otis, new
equipment was only up – order rates now only up about 3%. So it's still growing. Year-to-date, I think it's up about 7?
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: 15.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: 15? 15% and we expect it will be up
15% here for the full year, so fourth quarter ought to come back. We had a little bit of a timing issue year-over-year.
Last year's third quarter, as you'll recall at Otis was very strong in China, as there was a big rebound from the first half
slowdown. So again, tough compare, but for the year we still expect very strong growth there.
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: And, Ron, if I may just add a couple of data points. Last year
third quarter for Otis in China was 30% of the entire year – orders for China Otis. The average for last five years is
about 24%, so clearly it was tougher compares for China this quarter. But as Greg said for full year we still expect 15%
plus order growth.
<Q - Ron Epstein>: Okay, okay. And then another quick question if I may. At Pratt Canada, what are we seeing there
in terms of trends across the business jets, turboprops and helicopter stuff they do up there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I think there's no news on biz
jets, no good news, I guess, on biz jets in terms of a turnaround in that market. And you'll recall, that's about 50% of
our engine shipments come on the biz jet side. We are starting to see some recovery in the regional side, the turboprops,
and a little bit of good news on the helicopter engines as well. Aftermarket also started to pick up, up there, which is
good.
The real issue though is in biz jets where you still see 15% of the worldwide fleet for sale, and prices are still
depressed. So until that comes down to the 11, 12% range, we're not going to get much growth we think in biz jets.
<Q - Ron Epstein>: Okay. And then just one quick clarification, when – you said you took up the number for
restructuring, 100 million I think it was. And does that include Clipper or not?

Page 11 of 19
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It does include Clipper, but it also
includes the tax benefit that we had in the quarter and what we expect for the full year. So Clipper was a charge of
about $0.17. We're going get about $0.15 of good news from the tax benefits. Part of that 102 million came through,
$0.10 came through here in the first – I'm sorry for the first three months, and then you get the last part of the taxes in
the fourth quarter.
Now just on those restructuring projects, we still have a long list of good projects, and it's surprising after spending 1.4
billion restructuring over the last four years, to still have another robust list of opportunities is encouraging. So again,
the guys continue to work this. It's part of the culture out there and they are going to – they'll find more things to do.

Your next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Jeff Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just first, Greg, just to get into a little tax minutiae, it – I
know you love that – it appears that you're talking tax rate up more than kind of the average multinational on these tax
law changes, and it may be you're on top of it and they're not. But is there – from what you know about how others are
structured or peculiarities of your structure, is there something in particular that's disadvantaging you more than kind of
the average multinational around these changes?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Really part of it goes to income
distribution in terms of where your earnings are coming from and which pools they're coming from overseas. And
we've done a lot of work on this over the last year as we saw this tax law change coming. The good news of course is
it's not going to be implemented until January 1 of next year, which gives us an opportunity this year to drive or to
repatriate some of these high tax pools.
Maybe just as a data point for you, we were down in Washington talking to the Treasury about this issue, and this was
supposed to be a $10 billion revenue raiser as part of this bill that got passed back in August but Treasury's own
estimate was that it was more like a $40 billion revenue raiser. So we think there's a lot of other folks that are going to
be impacted, maybe not to the full two points that we are, but there's a lot of revenue that's going to be generated here
over the next 10 years for the Treasury as a result of this change. So we'll see. One of the keys still is the extenders out
there that hasn't passed yet, and that could actually be a benefit next year on the rate. So we've taken a conservative
view of next year for taxes. It certainly could be better than the 31-ish percent, but we'll see.
<Q - Jeff Sprague>: On extender you mean R&D and tax credit again?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Exactly.
<Q - Jeff Sprague>: Yeah. Okay. And what's that worth, about a point to you if it happens?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: About a half a point.
<Q - Jeff Sprague>: Half a point. And then just on Carrier, just a little more granularity if you don't mind. Obviously
the underlying core is much better, but how much of the margin benefit is – was just the addition by subtraction, the
absence of the divested revenues? Just give us a sense of really how strong the core was.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, if you think about that 200 basis
points of margin expansion we talked about, about a third of that came from the divested businesses, so call it 70 basis
points.
<Q - Jeff Sprague>: Okay. And could you give us a little bit more granularity on how Transicold performed in the
quarter, order sales and what the outlook is there?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, Transicold was up significantly,
up like 40% in orders for the quarter. And containers were way up, but we saw strength really across the business. I
think the lowest order growth rate really came in the North American truck trailer, and that was still up strong. Europe
was up strong and containers were, I want to say through the roof.
<Q - Jeff Sprague>: And I guess just finally, the weakness in Otis North America, I don't recall what the comps were
there. Obviously U.S. commercial construction is still weak, although there's some indicators that suggest things are
bottoming, even the ABI was above 50 this morning. Do you guys see light at the end of the tunnel in Otis North
America or even Carrier North America Commercial?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We should differentiate Carrier from
Otis because I think Carrier North America continues to do much better than what we expected. It actually had positive
order growth here in Q3. Otis North America, would say it's been a tough couple of years. And again, down about 25%
here in North America in the third quarter was a little worse than what we expected.
We have seen awards, which are kind of the leading indicator, actually start to pick up. But we saw that towards the
end of the second quarter. We hope that light at the end of the tunnel is really light and not a train. But I think the ABI
this morning was really the first positive sign that we've seen that the market really is going to – has bottomed and it is
going to recover. So this is a second half '11, maybe early '12 before going to see that play through in terms of sales,
but hopefully the worst is behind us.

Next question is from Joseph Nadol with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: Thanks, good morning, Greg and Akhil. First question is on the GE acquisition and F&S, if you
could just give us a little bit of an update of how things are going there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's a home run if nothing else. I think
that business, as you can see from the release and from the numbers, most of the operating profit growth and most of
the revenue growth is coming from GE Security. It's been nothing but a pleasant surprise. I think from the people that
we've got and the products and the technology, it's all been a home run. A little bit of restructuring there this quarter,
you think about, I think, F&S probably started its restructuring in GE Security. That's going well. We're in the process
of closing a facility in Ireland and doing some other head count things. But all of that's going along just as we had
expected, maybe even better.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: Okay. Very good. And then second question is on the Bombardier Global engine. You lost that
first selection. I'm just wondering if there was any color you could provide on that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think we work very closely with the
folks at Bombardier. It was a tough competition. It's unfortunate that we lost but we have a very strong position up
there with Bombardier on the CSeries, a number of other opportunities up there. So it's, again, a tough competition. We
put in we thought a very, very competitive offer, but in the end they elected to go with someone else.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: Are there still other prospects out there for business jet applications in the coming years for the
core or how are you looking at that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Absolutely. We started this core on the
Cessna Columbus, it was the PW 800, and we continue to do work that core. We think it's going to be a great engine for
the heavy long-range jet market, and we continue to work with customers to find the right application.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.

Your next question from comes from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Thanks, just a couple of follow-ups, Greg, on the 2011 outlook items. First, on pension, what
impact did stepping up the funding have in terms of mitigating the headwind, if at all, in 2011 versus your prior
expectations?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's been helpful, obviously. We
started out the year with about $500 million.
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: 400.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'm sorry, 400 domestically, and so
we're going to be up to $1 billion. You've got 600 million incrementally which will earn a little over 8%, so that
obviously helps to the tune of nearly $50 million. At the end of the day that's – as we think of it though, with pension
discount rate at 5.1% this morning, that's really – it hurts us quite a bit.
Year-to-date pension performance has been strong though. I think it's up about 11%. So the plan asset returns are doing
well, but you just can't get ahead of the discount rate. What we really need is just a little bump in discount rates, and I
think we'll feel a lot better about pensions. In the near-term though, we're just looking at maybe even doing more
pension funding next year, just to try and again, take advantage low rates that are out there and the arbitrage and put
some money in the plan.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. And then you did talk about the commodity headwind, if we were to mark-to-market
now. Talk a little bit about pricing, what you're expecting to be able to realize there. Obviously on the aftermarket
business is picking up, you would assume you'd get that as usual but maybe some of the other parts of the business as
well?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, the aftermarket catalog price
increases are already in place for next January, so I think that's all normal, usual – nothing unusual. But pricing remains
difficult, I would tell you in, several of our markets. China continues to be a difficult market. And North America for
Otis has also been – we've seen stiff pricing. At Carrier, pricing is always an issue. It's just one of those things that we
have to manage. We focus on taking costs out.
The good news I think on commodities is if we see commodities remain at this level, the competition has the same cost
inputs as we do, so we ought to see some pricing traction next year, if commodities remain high.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. And then the – wondering if you could talk what maybe the range of expectations you're
working with now on revenue growth for the aerospace aftermarket on the plus side?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Let me defer that question until
December. Louis is going to give you guys detailed guidance for each of the business units. We'll go into that. We're
really still trying to digest just these third quarter results. Again, we will see growth in the aftermarket next year, but let
me just defer that for six weeks until Louis is in front of you guys.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. Then just lastly, Clipper impact on EPS in 2011, you want to talk about that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Not if I don't have to. No, it's not
going to be significant. There will be maybe 0.03 or $0.04, maybe a penny a quarter, just based on the amortization of
tangibles and such.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you very much. So you mentioned that existing programs at Pratt, the R&D would
be up about 100 million next year. If Airbus actually launches the A320 re-engine and picks you, how much would that
be, given that you don't have partners signed up yet? And secondly, at one point you were talking about potentially
winning the engine for Gulfstream, the 450, 550 replacement. You didn't talk about that this year. What's the status of
that potential?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, let me take the NEO question
first. Obviously if as expected that does get announced here in the fourth question, we would expect it will start to ramp
up spending, but really not a lot of spending in the first half. You might see a little bit in the back half of the year, and
then that will really get going into 2012. So there is some headwind, but I wouldn't say it's significant. And we do have
partners already signed up for that. We have obviously MTU is out there, and we have others that are in the wings and
we continue to see a lot of interest from the partners in that potential re-engining application.
As far as Gulfstream, we continue to work with Gulfstream on their new platforms. We'll see what gets announced
when. When they're ready to make a decision, we'll let you guys know.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. But I mean, assuming they do make a decision, is that also essentially a 2012 issue? Or
could that be a 2011 headwind?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Probably – that's probably more of a
2011 headwind. As I say, we continue to work on the core of the 800 even though we don't have a firm slot for that. So
you'll see a little bit of pressure up at Pratt Canada anyways. If you were to actually get an announcement and a new
engine offering, we'd probably ramp that up pretty quickly up at Pratt Canada. So you might see – again, this is not
$100 million, but it's still a significant amount for Pratt Canada.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: And you had mentioned the increase in R&D this year, a part of it, is Hamilton Sundstrand.
The margins were pretty good in the third quarter. Is more of that increase going to hit in the fourth quarter? Or is the
R&D going to start down in the fourth quarter with aftermarket getting a little bit better, you might have a margin pop?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well E&D should start to go down
here in the fourth quarter. The 787 has been kind of the wild card out there. And again, as we go into next year, that
should be a significant benefit to us with 787 spending going down. It will get replaced somewhat by A350 and CSeries
and the other new platforms we're on. But we really ought to see a margin benefit from lower E&D and a stronger
commercial aftermarket here in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Got it. And then a technical question, what should we model for a tax rate in the fourth
quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Let's see, probably 27 – about 27%.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. And then, general question, many of the other defense contractors have seen
significant order delays, pressure on pricing, all kinds of things like that. Maybe you could comment about your
defense operations. What are you seeing there in terms of delays and pricing pressures?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, quite frankly, we haven't seen
much of that at all. But pricing cost is always an issue with a government customer. We're on great programs, I mean,
the BLACK HAWK remains the vehicle of choice for the Army and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, continue to see
strong international order growth there. But in terms of U.S. military, not much really going on. Remember, we have a
multi-year contract with the government for BLACK HAWKs that will go through early 2012. We're in the process of
negotiating multi-year eight, which will be for over 500 more BLACK HAWKs. And, again, good opportunities down
at Sikorsky. Also have opportunities internationally with the BLACK HAWK. You've got opportunities in India and
again other emerging markets.

Pratt on the JSF, obviously there's cost pressure there. I think we've met the customers' goal in terms of cost reduction.
We're on track for that. We are seeing, of course, pressure in the military side of Pratt for C-17. That production is
going down. But hopefully we'll see some orders in India that will keep that production line going for a while. We also
got an order this past quarter for 25 spare engines for the F-22, which will keep that production line going into 2012. So
again, there's pressure out there on cost, but, again, we've got, I think a very, very solid reputation with the customers
and on very, very good programs. So it's not as much. Again, military is 18% of our revenue so it's not insignificant but
it's just part of the whole balance at UTC.

We'll take our next question from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sam.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Can you talk – maybe this was related to Carrier in terms of the North American residential,
but it looks like from the second quarter, inventories grew by about $350 million. Can you – normally Q3 is when you
liquidate inventories so can you just talk a little bit about that?
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure, Sam, I think – you're right. The inventories did grow
from June but it's largely in the aerospace side. It was more Sikorsky and Pratt. Carrier did see a decline in the
inventories as you would expect.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Okay. And then on Fire & Security, if I just look again since the second quarter, revenues were
up modestly, $38 million but profits were up on the order of $24 million ex restructuring, and if we actually look
year-over-year it looks like your incremental margins are close to 20%. Is that really where you should be trending in
terms of where Fire & Security can ultimately get to?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well we're not going to set a new
margin goal of 20% today. But I think, clearly it shows that the 15% that Bill's got out there is very achievable. They
are getting good cost traction. Again, we've taken a lot of structural cost out across the business and they continue to do
restructuring. So I think these incremental margins are sustainable as we see a recovery in revenues.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Okay. And then just last question is on the accrued expense line, that jump in the quarter, is
that mostly to pension or is there something else that went into that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, there's restructuring, there's also
the pension. Actually the pension funding, I think, is down in other assets. You want to take a look at that?
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yeah. I'll come back to you, Sam, on that if there's any
change but I think Greg is generally right, yeah.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks, Sam

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning. Just first on the aftermarket business in commercial, obviously the
spares are up off easy comps, but have you seen any change significantly in airline maintenance behavior? I mean,
you've talked in the past about expecting a shift from light to heavy overhauls, have you seen any of that start to take
place?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, in fact, I think, heavy shop
visits in Q3 are actually up about 12% year-over-year, and that's 4000s, that's Vs. We've also started to see the
inductions of CFMs into our shops. So I think really it's in line with what we had been expecting the shift from light to
heavy overhauls.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay so I mean, you're actually seeing the profitability side of airlines having an
impact in terms of more discretionary things ramping up?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Absolutely.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then just a follow-up on Carrier, I mean you mentioned your inventories
were in good shape, but I mean if indeed this repair instead of replace trend surprised people negatively, which it
sounds like it did you guys, you would think there would be some excess inventory after the cooling season? And you
sound pretty cautious on pricing. I mean is pricing getting tougher at Carrier than it normally is or about the same?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No, I think it's about the same. In fact,
as far as inventories out there in the channel, I think channel inventories are actually down. And to me that's actually a
positive going into next year. The lead time on these air conditioners is not very long. So it's not like we're stocking a
lot of inventory. Again, we can quickly adjust to meet the demand, but channel inventory is down and inventory overall
at Carrier is down. So I think both positives as we go into next year.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And nobody is throwing in the towel and undercutting on price at this point?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Look, pricing is always tough at
Carrier, especially on the residential side, but I don't think it's anything unusual, more than what we've normally seen.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah.

We'll take our next question from George Shapiro with Access 342.
<Q - George Shapiro>: Yes, Greg, if you could just break out the mix of OE versus aftermarket at Otis? And did that
explain all of the margin increase or there was something else going on?
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: The margin, I think the mix was up about a point, more of
aftermarket, so that would stay about 25 to 30 basis points or roughly half of the margin expansion at Otis would be
due to the mix, but the rest is due to just the conversion on the – from the cost reduction and restructuring they've done.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Cost saving, yeah.
<Q - George Shapiro>: And for the quarter, if you could break out how much of the R&D increase overall was at Pratt
versus Hamilton?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, overall E&D was up about $89
million in the quarter. About 40% of that was actually at Hamilton, and a piece of that, of course, was on 787 as well as
we ramp up some of these other new programs. The rest of it was really spread between three places. You had increases
at F&S, Pratt and Sikorsky. So again, the Pratt piece was not terribly significant.

<Q - George Shapiro>: Okay. And then if you could – it would seem to me that the disparity in growth in aftermarket
at Hamilton versus Pratt is maybe geographically related to the fact that Pratt's more focused in North America. Would
you agree with that statement? And if so, can you just talk about what you saw geographically throughout the world?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think, generally speaking, Hamilton
is on every aircraft around the world, and so the decreases that we saw last year were not as dramatic as that which we
saw at Pratt. Again, Pratt is on a lot of older airplanes, they got more impacted by the parked aircraft last year. But as
those planes come out of the desert, and as the heavy maintenance comes back to us, I think you're going to see a much
bigger pop at Pratt than you are at Hamilton. And Hamilton is coming back. And then we'll have strong growth, but I
think you'll see more of a recovery at Pratt. Geographically, you're probably right. I mean, North America is really the
predominant market for the Pratt engines, but we've got exposure really around the world.
<Q - George Shapiro>: And Greg, how about if you look – tried to split the increase in the orders between North
America, Europe and Asia?
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: George, why don't I take it offline so we can -?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. I don't know that I have that
data here.
<Q - George Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

We'll take our next question from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hey, Doug.
<Q - Doug Harned>: On Fire & Security, can you talk about the restructuring effort, where it is right now, the efforts
that are underway and where you see that trajectory going? I'm trying to understand how far along we are in the
restructuring process as you're getting margins up?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I guess, I would say generally
speaking we're nearing the end of the major restructuring at legacy Fire & Security. We're just really starting the
restructuring of the GE Security business. We just announced the closure of a factory in Ireland, it was a GE Security
location, announcing some other moves. As far as the other major branch office consolidation work that we've been
doing across Europe for the last couple of years, we should finish that up in 2011. You'll start to see some benefits next
year; but all of the benefits will kick in by 2012.
<Q - Doug Harned>: And your expectation for how long that GE restructuring will take is what?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Probably about a year.
<Q - Doug Harned>: So about a year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, hopefully by third quarter next
year we'll pretty well have it complete.
<Q - Doug Harned>: And then on Carrier, and this is back on the pricing question, if you look at Transicold, which
you used to get great margins at. I mean, where are we today in terms of both where the margins are at Transicold
compared to, I'd say better times before the downturn? And also where capacity utilization is today, both for you and
the industry more broadly?

<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: I think, Doug, we've talked about this before. The markets are
still significantly lower than what they had been at their peak so capacity utilization is certainly below what it has been
for containers and truck trailers. But the margins are, because of all the cost actions that Carrier has taken, margins are
starting to move towards the peak that they have seen in the past. They are not quite there yet so there is still some
more room, but I think we've seen a nice turn because of all the tough cost actions, not just in the Transicold business
but also in the residential, U.S. residential business where significant actions have been taken to reduce the breakeven
point. We are seeing very nice conversion on the margin there.
<Q - Doug Harned>: But what this suggests is that going forward, you still have a good pricing opportunity in
Transicold that could be additive to what you've been able to gain in margin on the cost side?
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Pricing is always tough in this industry, as you know,
especially since the capacity utilization is still not at the peak level. So I wouldn't quite say that there's huge opportunity
but certainly Carrier – the broadest statement one can make is that Carrier is very confident and comfortable with the
target of 12% by 2012.
<Q - Doug Harned>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Yes. Thanks. I had a couple of questions, please. The first one is you gave an update on Otis in
China earlier. Could you give a similar sort of profile of the Carrier order trends there and how they were in Q3 versus
Q2? And then secondly just on M&A kind of just run through a little bit the moving parts. I mean the Clipper deal
obviously is fairly small. You've seen the dollar weaken which I guess makes it more expensive to do foreign deals.
You're obviously putting more into the pension and into your buy back. So when you net all of that together, can you
just give an update of how you see the M&A environment at the moment? Thanks.
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: So, Julian, let me take the Carrier question first. I think that
Carrier's performance in China, the orders for the Commercial business, which is what we have there were very strong,
north of 25% up in the quarter. So that just again shows the signs that China is not slowing down at all as far as our
businesses are concerned. Otis was a peculiarity because of difficult compares but certainly Carrier has done very well
in the quarter.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: As far as the M&A pipeline, we still
think that $3 billion number is the right number for this year. We're on track with the Clipper deal to close in on that.
As far as the pipeline, I would tell you there's still a lot of great targets out there but we still have a disconnect between
pricing expectations versus our own kind of disciplined approached to valuation. And as a result, right now, it's a much
better deal for me to go out and buy our own stock than it is to go out and buy somebody else's. So I think that trend is
going to probably continue here. As we generate a lot of cash, we're going to continue to buy back shares but we'll be
opportunistic. If there's a good deal out there, we'll go after it. We don't need to do a big deal I think, but certainly our
eyes are always wide open.
<A - Akhil Johri, Vice President, Investor Relations>: And also one last thing on this, we do try and return about
70% of the cash to the shareholders in the form of share buyback and dividends and that's something we keep in mind
as we look at all these things.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Okay. Thanks.

All right. Well, I want to thank everybody for listening today. Again, solid results in the quarter. We're confident in the
improved outlook. Now, if FX continues to be better as we've seen or if we get better operational performance, we'll
likely take up our restructuring to position us better for next year. And the goal here is always to outperform in any
environment. Again, it's been a tough year. We think we've got good results, solid results and we'll continue to strive to
do better next year. So with that, thank you very much and we'll see you all in New York in just about six weeks. Bye,
bye.
