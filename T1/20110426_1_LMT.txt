Robert J. Stevens
Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll proceed on the basis that you've had an
opportunity to read today's earnings release for first quarter results, which I felt provided a good start for 2011
including booking over $12 billion in orders that expanded our backlog to over $80 billion while achieving sales
growth of 3%.
Our focus, operational tempo, quality and overall execution remained strong. We were again able to generate
exceptional cash flow, with cash from operations of $1.7 billion. This robust focus on cash generation continues to be a
key element of our strategy to provide sustained return to shareholders while still ensuring appropriate investments in
our business.
Since we last spoke with you in January, the dynamic change in world events continues to demonstrate the growing
spectrum of complex global security requirements faced by our country and our customers. In addition to ongoing
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, instability on the Korean peninsula, an emerging China and a threatening Iran, just
this past quarter, we've seen unprecedented civil demonstrations for democratic reform across Northern Africa and the
Middle East, tragic earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan and New Zealand requiring an instant humanitarian response,
and actions to protect civilians in Libya from the risk of widespread massacre by government forces.
These events and others underscore the ongoing and at times unanticipated critical missions that our military must
fulfill. With this velocity of change and the volume and volatility of global events continuing to expand, more demands
on our military are likely.
For our company, these events are having the effect of changing some of the near-term priorities of our international
customers, delaying, for example, orders for F-16s in Iraq and C-130Js in the United Arab Emirates, while the need for
an integrated air and missile defense system in the UAE has been re-emphasized and elevated.
On April the 15th, agreement was reached on the FY '11 Appropriations bill, ending the continuing resolution that had
been in place since the start of the fiscal year that began last October. The final bill signed into law by the President
includes $531 billion for DoD based budget authority and $158 billion for overseas contingency operations funds. The
resolution of the FY '11 Appropriations bill was particularly important because it provides the resources and visibility
our customers need to maintain their operational focus.
With funding issues resolved, we're also able to reaffirm our previously stated financial guidance for calendar year
2011. Congress is now turning attention to the fiscal '12 defense budget, where the President has requested $553 billion
for the base budget and $118 billion for overseas contingency operations. However, as we've already seen, there'll be
much more discussion about the right levels of security investment.
Let me turn to some operational highlights and start with a view of the development, production and sustainment of the
Joint Strike Fighter, which is showing good progress. On the development program, momentum continues to build in
flight tests. In the first quarter, overall, we completed 199 flights against a plan of 142, achieving the highest quarterly
level to date. The maturity of the Stovall aircraft is showing marked improvement, completing 101 flights versus a plan
of 62, including 61 vertical landings.
The conventional and carrier variants are also performing well and overall test point productivity is ahead of plan and
software development continues to meet the revised baseline. On the production program, progress also continues. The
first two production aircraft flew for the first time in preparation for delivery to the United States Air Force that we
anticipate will occur over the next couple of weeks. Low-rate initial production continues to accelerate with 62 aircraft
in backlog, and we look forward to placing Lot 5 under contract later this year.

Working with our customers and our suppliers, we are turning our attention to lowering the cost of producing the jets
and the cost of their sustainment over time. In the quarter, Aeronautics also received a $725 million contract extension
to provide performance-based logistics for the F-22 Raptor. This contract extension builds upon our initial contract
award in 2008 and is focused on a fleet-wide sustainment program for all seven operational bases in close partnership
with the Air Force. The goal here is the highest possible aircraft availability and performance at the lowest possible
cost.
Turning to Electronic Systems, two key new business awards this quarter merit special attention. In ballistic missile
defense, we received a contract for $790 million to produce additional Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or
THAAD, weapons systems for the Missile Defense Agency. This order will double the number of THAAD systems in
the U.S. inventory, from two to four batteries. Recall that THAAD was activated in 2008 and is the only missile
defense system with the operational flexibility to intercept both inside and outside the atmosphere, providing a versatile
capability.
THAAD is a key element in our nation's ballistic missile defense system and has generated significant interest by
international customers as they seek a proven missile defense capability to counter the growing proliferation of
offensive missiles. Here again, we see an excellent illustration of how international work can stabilize programs and
where additional volume can directly contribute to cost reduction and affordability goals.
In our Littoral Combat Ship program, we received a contract from the United States Navy for $376 million for
construction of the second of 10 ships awarded to the Lockheed Martin team in December of 2010. The Navy's 10-ship
award procurement plan provides stability to the program, allowing industry to more efficiently meet customer needs
for an affordable, multi-mission surface ship. Beyond the two ships in our new contract award, our second LCS ship,
the Fort Worth, remains on schedule and on budget for delivery to the Navy in 2012.
Moving to Information Systems & Global Solutions, we achieved a key operational milestone this quarter on the Next
Generation Identification system for the FBI. The FBI announced achievement of initial operational capability on the
NGI system's ability to process fingerprint identification more effectively and more accurately, which will help in
solving investigations faster, preventing future crimes and apprehending more criminals and terrorists. We're really
proud of the ongoing partnership we've had with the FBI since 1999 in this key area of law enforcement.
In Space Systems, we've received a contract from the United States Navy for $340 million for the fifth satellite in the
Mobile User Objective System, or MUOS, constellation. When operational, MUOS will replace the current ultra-high
frequency follow-on system and provide ten times more capability in assured communications, including simultaneous
voice, video and data for forces on the move.
Operationally, a key milestone was achieved with the shipment of the first Orion spacecraft structure from the New
Orleans facility to our Denver test facilities. This delivery milestone supports the objective of Orion's first crewed
mission by 2016.
Across our business, we're focused on program execution and cost reduction while maintaining quality. This is a
challenging environment, but we have a strong and well-positioned portfolio of products that address the critical needs
of domestic and international customers in a complex global security environment. And we have talent throughout our
work force and a culture that challenges one another to do better and set the bar higher. I'm very grateful to be able to
work in a community of people who recognize our ability to contribute and want to do more.
Let me turn the call over to Bruce now to provide some additional detail on our first quarter financial results and our
outlook for 2011. And then we'll open the call for discussion. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please refer to the web
charts we've included today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our first quarter.
Company Name: Lockheed Martin
Company Ticker: LMT US
Date: 2011-04-26
Event Description: Q1 2011 Earnings Call
Market Cap: 25,091.14

Bloomberg Estimates - Sales
Current Quarter: 11740.722
Current Year: 46633.905
Page 4 of 15
We grew sales for the quarter by 3%, which is noteworthy given that the continuing resolution lasted beyond the end of
the quarter. Our EPS from continuing operations grew by 12% compared to last year, driven by higher sales volume,
higher segment margins and lower share count. We generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations, a record level for
the company, surpassing the previous record from the first quarter of 2010. We also grew backlog to more than $80
billion with a significant portion of the growth driven by additional efforts to complete the F-35 development program.
So we're off to a strong start in 2011.
Turning to Chart 4, we'll look at sales by the four business areas. Two of the four business areas grew in the quarter, led
by Aeronautics with 8% growth and Electronic Systems with 6% growth. Aero's growth was driven by the F-35 and
C-130 programs while Electronic Systems grew in all three lines of business. Both IS&GS and Space had lower sales in
the quarter with IS&GS reflecting the absence of the U.S. Census activity that finished last year. Space Systems was
lower due to reduced activity on the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and lower sales for the External Tank Program
resulting from the upcoming end of shuttle operations.
Moving to Chart 5 and our earnings per share in the quarter, our earnings from continuing operations grew 12% over
last year's level. Adjusting for the FAS/CAS impact to both quarters and the Medicare Part D charge that occurred in
last year's first quarter, our EPS grew by 9% with the Medicare Part D impact essentially offsetting the increase in
FAS/CAS expense between the two time periods. As I said earlier, the resulting increase was driven by higher sales
volume, improved segment margin and lower share count compared to last year.
Looking at cash from operations on Chart 6, cash generation was very strong at $1.7 billion, again the highest cash the
company has ever generated in a quarter. With our capital expenditures staying consistent with last year's level, free
cash flow of $1.6 billion was also a record. As you would expect, cash generation by quarter will be lower as we
progress throughout the rest of the year. I would expect the second quarter to be our lowest for the year as we have over
$1 billion in planned disbursements including two tax payments, a pension contribution and the payments owed under
the Voluntary Executive Separation Program.
On Chart 7, you will see our recent backlog levels compared with the results this quarter. Again, we grew backlog to
the $80 billion level driven mostly by the additional developmental efforts for the F-35 resulting from the
recommendations of the technical baseline review. Looking forward, I would expect backlog levels at the end of the
year to be very close to where we ended the year in 2010.
Chart 8 shows 15 of our largest programs which represent around 45% of our sales in 2011 and how we view the future
opportunities for growth in these programs over the next two to three years. As you can see, with the exception of the
F-22 program, we believe that these large programs are either stable or growing in the near future. Going forward, with
the future budget pressures we are likely to face, the strength of the portfolio is going to be the key determinant as to
which companies can experience growth in that environment versus which cannot. Clearly, the days of enough budget
growth to enable every firm in the industry to grow are over. We believe our portfolio is strong and well positioned to
succeed in that environment.
Moving to Chart 9, we will show our guidance changes in the quarter. We increased both our EPS guidance and cash
from operations as a result of the favorable resolution of several prior-year tax matters. As a result, EPS was increased
$0.25 to a new range of $6.95 to $7.25 per share, and cash from operations was increased by $100 million to a new
level of $4.1 billion. I should point out that the resolution of these tax matters actually occurred in the month of April
and when you see the impact of these items in our second quarter results, it will be reflected as an unusual event.
Finally on Chart 10, we summarize the quarter. Again, we're off to a good start in 2011, led by very strong cash
generation, which gives us great flexibility going forward. I think we're well positioned to achieve our goals set for the
year, though I would point out that the phasing of some of our objectives, such as cash, will clearly not be linear for the
rest of the year. And finally, with the threat of a government shutdown behind us, we can focus on meeting or
potentially improving upon our financial outlook for the year.
With that, I think we're ready for your questions. Shawn?

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Please
go ahead with your question.
<Q - Richard Safran>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Morning.
<Q - Richard Safran>: I just wanted to ask if you look at your share buybacks just relative to prior years, the $3.5
million that you did this quarter just appears to be a bit lower than what you've done before. So I just wanted to know,
is this reflecting some conservatism on your part? And if you could also – if you could comment on what expectations
should be for buybacks for the rest of the year?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thanks, Rich, this is Bruce. I'll answer that one. Well, to begin with, we did $281 million of
repurchases in the quarter, so we're actually ahead of the pace to achieve the $1 billion in repurchases that we had in
our guidance. Having said that, it probably was somewhat lighter than it might have been otherwise. And probably
there were a couple of reasons that drove that. First, as we neared the end of the quarter, the first quarter, it became
clear that a government shutdown was a real possibility, and frankly, we believe that a less disruptive path both for our
employees and our customers was for us to sort of just press on business as usual. We believed that a shutdown, if it
actually occurred, would be short-lived but we wanted to have enough cash to fund the activities in the event that the
shutdown did actually occur. And right in the middle of this, we knew we had some large disbursements that needed to
be made in the second quarter, such as the ones I mentioned – the VESP payouts, the taxes, two tax payments, and a
pension contribution and those needed to get paid whether we were getting paid during a government shutdown or not.
So we wanted to have the flexibility to deal with those as well. So overall, we've not changed our approach as to how
we plan the return of cash to shareholders either for repurchases or, for that matter, for dividend increases as we look
later this year.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi Investments. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Yeah, good morning, guys.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Just a follow-up to that question. You've got $3.9 billion in cash. You've spoken about
having $2 billion in excess cash. You're getting set to generate roughly $3.5 billion in free cash this year. At what point
are we going to see an acceleration of money coming back to shareholders, either through share repurchases or through
an increase in the dividend? I think clearly you've got plenty of dry powder, here so to speak, and I think as the prior
questioner alluded to, I think expectations were that things were going to be a little bit more robust than what we've
seen in the first quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about are those numbers right at this point and what you see going
forward in getting that excess cash back to shareholders?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes, Jason, I'll try that one as well. As I said to Rich's question previously, I think the first
quarter was probably a little lighter than it might otherwise have been had we not seen the potentiality at least of the
government shutdown occurring. I still feel very strongly that we are going to follow suit for what we've done in the
past relative to both share repurchases and dividend increases. We always take a look at the dividend increase in our
September board meeting. That is our expectation, is that we'll do that again during that timeframe so you won't see
anything happen sooner than that. And repurchases – without getting into specifically what we're going to do on a

monthly or quarterly basis, Jason, I think the history of what we've done in the past speaks for what we're going to do
throughout the rest of this year.
Operator
Our next question comes from Eric Hugel with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Eric Hugel CPA>: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a quick question with regards to what's going on in Japan,
especially considering most of your products are so heavy into electronics, are you having any issues with availability
or pricing of electronic components?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Eric, hi. This is Bob Stevens. No, we are not. We're seeing no disruption in our supply chain.
Of course, as embedded in your question, we're paying very considerable attention to the durability of that supply chain
over time but we're not seeing any disruption here.
<Q - Eric Hugel CPA>: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Sure.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: On the F-35, the program's leadership has recently stated that you received only $7 million of
$35 million of available award fee last year and also commented that there's about $370 million available this year.
Could you talk about what your expectations are now in terms of what you think you can receive? How the program is
performing with respect to capturing that award fee?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Well, I think Admiral Venlet's comment about earning $7 million of $35 million last year is
accurate. We achieved one milestone against which there was the $7 million earn-out. This year we have $52.5 million
of award fee earning potential that are spread across five milestones that we and our customers believe to be critical in
demonstrating forward progress on the program and enabling future activities to flow smoothly in this environment.
The first milestone is completion of all static structural tests; completion of the carrier version suitability testing at
Lakehurst, New Jersey – this is for carrier suitability; releasing the Block 2 flight test software update to the flight test
program; having the Stovall version, the F-35B model, engage in sea trials and getting that aircraft out to the ship; and
then finally, releasing the Block 1 training update to the Eglin Air Force Base Training Facility. Each of these
milestones is achievable. Each of them has $10.5 million of award fee potential associated with it, and it's ours to work
toward and earn. And I think we'll be able to discretely measure progress against that.
The remainder of the award fee pool we believe, through future negotiations, will be allocated in a similar way to
milestones that are perceived as being critical to demonstrate the performance of the airplane and bring the production
airplanes forward into their initial operational capability. We'll keep you advised as information becomes available on
how well we're performing against these milestones.

<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Bruce, you talked about backlog settling at around the $78 billion at the end of this year that
you had at the end of last year; roughly flat. How should we think about this by segment and, Bob, do you see any
further portfolio shaping?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, I'll start off. Maybe just to give a little color on the phasing of the backlog in total first
for the year. I think we're going to probably come down just a little bit in the second quarter from where we are right
now and if you look at us historically, we tend to drop – third quarter tends to be our lowest quarter for orders out of all
the quarters of the year. Then we kind of bounce back typically in the fourth quarter. I would expect that we will see a
very similar picture as far as the phasing of backlog for the year.
As far as by the segments and they're concerned, I would expect to see that Aeronautics will actually have growth in
backlog for the full year as will Electronic Systems. Space will likely see some reduction in backlog, somewhat
dependent upon the win or not in the GMDS, the Ground-based Missile Defense System competition that's coming up
later this year. And IS&GS is likely going to be a little flattish relative to backlog as from where they ended 2010. And
I'll turn it over to Bob for his side.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thanks, Bruce. I like our portfolio. Of course, we've worked over time to fashion it to have
the content that it has today. We think, given the strength of the portfolio, we have the ability to focus on good
execution. And if we focus on good execution, we should see future growth. So I don't want to signal to you any
unhappiness with the portfolio we have. But as a matter of business discipline and process, we have a continuing
assessment of the quality of this portfolio, its relevance in the strategic environment for our domestic and international
customers in the markets that we serve today and in the adjacent horizon markets that we might want to become more
active in tomorrow.
So there is an ongoing process here to evaluate this portfolio and to shape it appropriately. But I don't want to convey to
you any dissatisfaction with the quality of the portfolio or our judgment that with the substance that we have and the
maturity that we have and given the relevance and priorities of the programs and capabilities to meet demanding
customer missions, if we execute effectively, we ought to be able to grow the business and maintain the health of this
portfolio.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, Bob, actually somewhat harking off what you just said, when we dissect the parts of IS&GS,
kind of buried in it, Intel looks like it's trending down even ex EIG. So if there's one area where defense budget growth
should remain significantly above the total, it's probably in Intel, which sort of raises the question, what areas are you
losing ground on? Are you satisfied with internal performance and your wins there? Or is there a customer problem? Or
is it a budget timing issue?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Well, I think there's a little bit of maybe all of the above, it's got a lot more to do with the
specific program of GeoScout maturity and the delivery of mission components under the GeoScout program which is
trending the Intel down. I mean you're correct in your assessment that Intel is trending down. But let me say again that
the quality of the Intel work that we're doing and the significance of that work to a broader intelligence community
customer is of great value to us and of great value to them. So while we're seeing a little downward trend in here, that
shouldn't really convey a dissatisfaction on our part with the overall Intel community.
And, Heidi, I think one of the things we all look at in the future is how exactly will the great need to address the cyber
security environment mature over time? And how can we with our extensive experience in the cyber domain, not just
with the intelligence communities but really across the entire breadth of the federal government, how can we bring that
experience in a greatly focused way to make real contributions to greater security in the cyber domain? That's a

question that I think is getting answered with the passage of time.
There's not a discrete answer today, but we are focused on that and in two ways. I mean there's the infrastructure
component. What modifications will be necessary in a cyber domain to assure safety and security there? And then in
mission areas, the applications part, where we have considerable strength across the company. So I think that will also
be a part of the overall intelligence community story that we will write and tell over time.

Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Morning.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: My question is on the 8-K you filed a few days ago on compensation. And there were two
metrics that were mentioned. One was operating cash flow, it's going to be very important this year. The other is ROIC.
My questions are, why were these two selected in particular? And then, obviously, operating cash flow is very easy for
us to track, but I'm wondering if you could provide – since you no longer provide ROIC in your earnings statement,
wondering how that's tracking for the year?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah. The reason it was done, Joe, is that our Management Development Compensation
Committee, specifically, and the board, generally, do very much want to listen to our investors to understand their
specific points of view about tying our compensation to performance. And the board is very serious about this, and I
hope you all have a sense that they are. And in listening to the discussion associated with performance, they thought it
was advisable for me personally to tie my eligibility for options to, in essence, a double trigger, not just options that
vest over time, but having to meet very specific performance-based objectives. And I'm entirely okay with that because
this is a pay for performance environment for me and every member of the leadership team here.
The two parameters, operating cash and returns on investment, were selected because we and the board believe that
they are the most critical drivers of shareholder value. And I will tell you, if you like $1.7 billion in operating cash in
the quarter, if you like the allocation of cash in the way that we allocate it to drive superior returns, I think that you and
others would want to hear a management team talking in terms of shareholder value in addition to delivering value to
customers. And I think that closes the equation pretty well. So that is why it is done. We do give you significant
information on our cash generation. And we can certainly provide information about returns on invested capital.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Joe, I'll piggyback from what Bob just said. The metrics that we use, that we have been using
in the past for our long-term incentive program, have always been cash and return on invested capital. The ROIC
portion of that has always been an annual metric and that's what the metric will be for what was filed on the 8-K as
well. And so we're not going to show the quarterly performance, if you will, because it's not necessarily aligned with
the annual numbers that we've put in place for the compensation. We will definitely show that as we get towards the
end of the year in terms of the expectation and the actual ROIC performance for the year so that you can compare that
back to the 8-K.

Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr MBA, CFA>: Okay. Thank you very much. Bob, you made some comments about the
push-out of F-16s and C-130Js in the MidEast, but mentioned potential acceleration of sub-air defense. Could you give
us a little bit more color on what's happening there? What stuff is moving out and why? What stuff might be moving
forward and why? And time frames in which we might get some of these orders?

<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah. Certainly. And I don't think you're going to see a wholesale movement in the orders.
But quite specifically, Cai, we've – in conversations – been advised by the leadership in the United Arab Emirates that
they want to postpone their order placement of 12 C-130Js and take that discussion up at a future time. But in that very
same discussion, or in that environment around those discussions, re-emphasized and elevated the need for an air and
missile defense system because of the observation of the proliferation of offensive missile systems in a region of the
world that, as we all see today, is highly volatile and risky.
With the case that I mentioned in Iraq, which – around which there was an LOA for 18 F-16 aircraft, the Iraqis this year
reallocated those funds for domestic purposes rather than security purposes. Our sense here is that we'll reinvigorate
those discussions about the 18 F-16s during the balance of this year and probably have more to talk about in 2012 about
that likely order placement. And these are rough approximations.
So I would think the air and missile defense is going to hold this schedule and that the C-130s will be phased out for the
Emirates. The good news about C-130s, I think, generally is they're a pretty high demand aircraft that are giving really
exceptional service in their mission capabilities. And then we'll come back and talk to the Iraqis about F-16s later on
this year, presumably for an order next year.

Our next question comes from Rob Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: Thanks so much. Morning.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: Bob, I was wondering if you could impact – sorry, comment on what you thought the impact
of the CR was this quarter and how you think the rest of your year will now progress as the government gets back to
work.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Great, Rob. Well, I think, and hopefully we conveyed this to your clearly, as we were
concluding the government fiscal '10 and watching the activities for government fiscal '11, we anticipated the
likelihood of a continuing resolution.
Of course, the difficulty for us and you and everybody is estimating the duration of the continuing resolution. We and
others make assumptions about what the climate is like and what the likely debate will be and what the timing around a
conclusion of the CR would be. We did not think, for example, a CR would be in effect for the full year. But we did
think the CR would be in effect for a while. We incorporated those assumptions about timing and content and the
ability to proceed into our planning, into our guidance, into our discussions with you.
As Bruce mentioned earlier in his remarks, what we also elected to do, believing that sometimes CRs don't end on a
date certain but have some additional extensions, we felt it would be unacceptable and ill-advised to have a disruption
in the focus of our professional teams as we are executing against our program commitments for the want of extensions
to the CR that we believed wouldn't be long-term extensions. So I think what you're seeing on our ability to reaffirm
our guidance is that our assumptions were pretty close to the mark as to the overall timing and content.
Had that continuing resolution not resolved the way it had on April 15th, we'd be having a different conversation with
you today. And I'm quite sure our customers would be subjected to an enormously more difficult operating
environment because, under these CRs, the customers are compelled to re-plan and re-plan and re-plan and re-plan
almost on a cash to cash basis for the content of their operations, which is enormously demanding and time-consuming
for them. So we were really gratified that the CR was resolved foremost for our customers' interests and then also that
the resolution of that CR was more or less right on our timing expectation for the resolution of that CR. We've been
asked what's the likelihood of a CR in 2012, and we don't know and we'll probably have that conversation as we talk
more about our year unfolding with you.

Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Access 342. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes, good morning. Probably for you, Bruce, if I looked at the Aeronautics margin this
quarter, it was 10.4%, and the guidance is basically about 10.7%, and you disclosed a lot of detail as to what went up
and what went down. But my question is, was there any change in the booking rates this quarter? And how should that
margin progress through the rest of the year? And then also, if you might give an update on what revenues you're
looking for the F-35 given the change in schedule.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Well thanks, George, and I hope you were pleased. It sounds like you were with – we
did change our press release somewhat to have a little more detail into the programmatics by the segment. I hope that
was useful and to all the callers today. Relative to Aero and the margins in the first quarter, I tried to tee up in the
January call that the delivery of C-130 and in particular F-16s were more back-end loaded in the year. They were not
linear by any stretch. And so, for instance, C-130s, two-thirds of deliveries on C-130 are in the second half of the year
and more than 50% of F-16s are in the second half of the year. And so to a large extent what you're seeing in the first
quarter is sort of the absence of what's going to happen for the rest of the year, relative to the higher margin C-130 and
the higher margin F-16 business.
There was not a significant difference between comp and adjustments last quarter – excuse me, first quarter last year
versus first quarter this year. The one exception to that might be last year, if you recall, we did have in the early
low-rate initial production contract on the F-35s, we actually had some step-ups a year ago and those were not
replicated in the current quarter. Other than that, again, I think we're fairly consistent from an overall booking
perspective quarter-to-quarter.
As far as C-130 – I'm sorry, you asked F-35 growth for the year, I still think we're looking at just about $1 billion of
total growth from the 2010 level of F-35 sales to what we're expecting to see in 2011. And you should think of that as
being less than probably 45% or so of the sales of the Aeronautics business area in total. So growing fairly consistently,
as we predicted, even with the little slower ramp rate on the production, in large part because the development contract
has, in fact, extended out to the right as well.

Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Bob, I'd like you, if you could, talk about how the benefits of VESP
have started to show up in terms of what you're seeing in operational flexibility and improved profitability? And then if
you also might address the congressional language in the Appropriations bill about eliminating some of these
undefinitized contracts and how that might also help you?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah. Thank you, Howard. So we've described to you a series of actions that we began last
year in considerable earnest really oriented around the discussion about affordability and affordability initiatives. We've
heard Secretary Gates, Secretary Carter and others in the Department of Defense talk about them, provide some
outlines, some general orientation, some specific objectives.
We felt it was incumbent on us as partners in these mission areas to develop our own set of affordability initiatives.
They involve facilities, consolidations, reducing expenses, travel, air shows we just highlighted because it's kind of a
higher visibility thing, the Voluntary Executive Separation Program and scrubbing all expenditures and all budgets
here. The reason is the seriousness of purpose that we know and share about the new reality that we're in, where these
global security demands are going to stay substantially high and the resources that are available to meet the demands
are going to come down and we need to do our part.
I would tell you our sense back then and our sense now is let's get an early start, let's make significant moves on our
part on the recognition that it will take some time to see the effect of these changes in both the cost of our products to

our customers and our ability to generate returns for our shareholders. I'll tell you I think we're starting to see the effect
and it would be, I think, an observation, Howard, that you would find familiar after taking these actions but there
should be more to come. In the interim, we are looking at what additional actions we can take, because I think this is
going to be an environment where continuous improvement and continuous reduction is necessary.
I'll just offer one cautionary tone. We've been in this business a long time. I personally have done it a long time. I've
gone through a lot of cost reduction initiatives. It's very important not to cut programs in a way that reduce their quality
or their ability to perform over time. And I'll tell you some of this can be a little insidious, so we're trying to bring all
our experience forward because if you cut spares, if you cut cast or applications in some area you won't see the adverse
effect of those reductions in costs now but you will see diminished mission capability, diminished operational
availability, more cost falling into operations and maintenance because we have a longer sparing cycle and so forth. So
I think we are in a good position to communicate our experiences here with our customers and I think that dialogue is
going to be ongoing. So expect more of the same with regard to a focus on cost takeouts for us.
Relative to undefinitized contract actions, I think you know that we would prefer to be in a position of developing a
proposal, submitting it, and negotiating it fully and completely before we begin the execution on the mission capability
that's defined in the contracts. But there are extingencies to date that I think appropriately drive our customers to want
to move out with greater velocity and try to do some things in parallel, and that's how you end up with a portfolio of
undefinitized contract actions. I think that we can professionally respond in either environment.
We're certainly supportive of reducing the number of undefinitized contract actions as the language suggests. I think
our customers would like to do that. But I also know our customers are faced with some of these enormously
demanding challenges where they've got to take actions, change direction, perhaps buy some new things, perhaps
change the acquisition of things they're pursuing. And that's what the UCA is for, and I think if they use it judiciously
and in a disciplined way, we can certainly contribute in that regard.

Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Thanks, good morning. Just a, first, clarification on the slide that has your portfolio of programs
with the growth stable and down. What's the base year that you're thinking about for that growth? And the other kind of
clarification is, can you give us some color if over the last 12 months, the kind of pace of the programs that are in the
growth category, which ones have accelerated and which ones have decelerated?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes. Myles, I'll try a shot at this. I hope you found this chart useful. I think it's one of the
things that as we look at our portfolio and maybe the portfolios of others, one of the things that we have is a lot of
high-dollar programs that a lot of the other peers in the industry do not have. And what we were trying to do with this
chart is to give you the opportunity to say these are some of the bigger-ticket programs in the portfolio and this is our
view of how these programs are going to perform over the next two or three years, with the base year, to your question,
being 2011. And our reaction is, you can go out and take a look at the budget – the data, yourself, and convince
yourself as you see fit as to whether or not these programs are appropriately aligned in the categories that we put them
in. But again, these are big drivers of the overall sales of the corporation.
I think if I was to go kind of around the horn, if I understood your question on the green category, and say which ones
are growing faster or slower than others, F-35 obviously is going to continue to ramp up, as we've said, for at least the
foreseeable future until we hit sort of the peak production rate. C-130J has got at least another year before we likely
probably peak at the production rate of 36 aircraft a year and then it will likely be fairly constant for at least a few years
after that at that level. F-16, we've talked about in the past, is going to spike in 2012 with likely about 40 aircraft
deliveries for the year. And then we've got some work to do in 2013 to keep that number back up there or else it will, in
fact, drop off at that level.

Aegis is likely going to see some growth as we see particularly the Aegis Ashore but also the retrofit of some of the
DDG 51s, the destroyers in the U.S. Navy. Patriot and THAAD I'll lump together and say those we expect to have
growth over the next two, three years as well. LCS, again, once we get ramped up at the two ship per year level, which
I would guess we won't get into sort of that steady state until the 2012 timeframe would be my expectation and then
we'll stay fairly constant there as we build out the other, expectedly at least, 10 ships in the options.
And then advanced DHF is likely going to see a little bit of growth. We've got another couple of, I think, vehicles four
through six coming up in awards in the not too distant future and those will be higher dollar awards than the previous
satellites so I think there will be some growth there. Then GPS III, obviously, is really just not quite at its infancy stage
but very early in its development program. I think we just completed the critical design review and we're still a ways
away from production, so that one's got its future growth out in front of it. I hope that helps, Myles.

Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: A follow-up to that, Bruce. Could you talk about the nine programs that you have listed here
as growth, can you talk about what percentage of the portfolio they represent in terms of revenues today and, given
what you see on this chart, what does it mean overall for the margin profile of the company? Then a quick follow-up on
ES; could you comment? It looks like growth came in better than you would have thought in the first quarter, yet you
kept your guidance for ES sales growth unchanged for the year which implies down from here. If you could just
comment on that. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thanks Dave, for the questions. I don't know that I have off the top of my head, the top
programs in the green category on that chart are probably – I'm trying to do math in my head here. I'm going to guess
they're less than the 40% level of overall sales in the corporation. That's probably a little less than 40% would be my
guess and the rest of them make up the 5% or so of the sales of the corporation. I think relative to – you asked a
question on the Electronic Systems performance in the first quarter and I'll say we were – I'll speak for myself -
I was pleasantly surprised by the quarter results.
We'd kind of expected or I'd kind of expected that we might see actually some headwind in the first quarter, primarily
because of the lack of the PTDS order, the Persistent Threat Detection System, that we had some very rapid sales that
occurred in 2010. We were actually able to offset most of that through a combination of things: PAC-3 deliveries in the
quarter, some higher – a number of programs within MS2. In fact, all three lines of business within Electronic Systems
grew in the quarter and within GTL the SOF-GLS contract grew almost $100 million compared to last year. So that
more than offset the lack of the PTDS contract.
As I look for the rest of the year for Electronic Systems, I actually think we are going to see sequential growth
quarter-over-quarter. And I'll say first quarter was probably a little bit early to call, but I think we could have some
upside there on sales, particularly if we receive another PTDS order, which we're in conversations with the customer
about as we speak. And I also think, quite frankly, that EBIT is looking strong for the year relative to guidance. I think
margins should be at the 12% ROS level per quarter going forward and if there is some upside there, I think it's
potentially driven by missiles and fire control for the rest of this year.

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, I can. Yeah, you're fine. Thanks.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. All right. Just the first question is, I noticed the benefit you got from cash taxes in the
quarter, you mentioned some payments in the second quarter. Can you just tell us what your cash tax expectation is for
the year?
And then just separately before I get cut off was just can you just talk about the prospects of the government shutdown?
You talked about raising cash in the quarter. I presume that's why we saw payables jump, but can you just talk about
how the customers are behaving now? Are you starting to see contract awards since the bill was signed into law? And
really how is the customer behaving now and what should we see going forward?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, thanks, Sam. Cash taxes, we actually did get a refund in the first quarter. I think it was
some $250 million worth or so, and so our cash taxes for the total year are somewhat diminished because of that
refund, but you should think of them somewhere in the north of $800 million – $800 million, $850 million or so worth
of cash taxes for the year. And as far as customer behavior and what we're seeing for awards post-CR or
post-government shutdown threat, again, we – I tried to tee up in the January call that we really felt, just looking at the
profile of our orders for the rest of the year back then, that unless the CR was to extend – I think we said, beyond the
end of April kind of timeframe, that we really didn't expect to see an impact to the guidance we were providing.
And I'll say that's exactly kind of what happened; it fell on April 15, right in line with our expectations. And so I
haven't seen – we haven't seen a change in the first quarter and, thus far, I don't believe we expect to see a change for
the rest of the year. I'll ask Bob to see if he's got a different perspective than I do.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah. Sam, I think that while it might not have been highly visible from the outside in, what
happens under the CR is our customers have to go through extraordinary measures of phasing and shifting and
rebalancing, almost on a daily basis, and I'm not exaggerating. So I think one of the great benefits of not having a CR
imposed, but having an appropriations bill is they're back to a more ordinary focus on priorities and, in fact, doing the
kind of contract actions that may reduce the number of undefinitized contract actions that allow them to plan, that give
them the confidence that they have funds in place to go ahead and put programs under contract. So I would tell you
we've moved from a period of extraordinary demands on the customers under the CR to more ordinary workflow in our
customer communities.

Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: First off, Bruce, thanks for the extra level of disclosure in the release. That was very helpful.
I want to piggyback briefly on Cai's question on Iraqi F-16s. I – it's been pretty clear that the Iraqi government has been
tight on funds, and I think you hinted at that, but oil production has been on the rise, which should help this problem.
And so as you look at this order, is it dependent solely on funding? Or is there also an element of political stability?
And does an extended U.S. presence beyond the 2011 SOFA play a role here? Or is it simply a funding matter that's
just shifted out to the right?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Well, I think there – the dialogue that has occurred, I'd tell you very much in the open, is
about roles and missions and the recognition that the Iraqis will need to stand up an indigenous force structure, and part
of that force structure is going to have to include tactical aircraft and the selection of the F-16 was already made. In my
last visit to Fort Worth, that was about two weeks ago now, I met with a delegation from Iraq to listen to their planning
and their description of the circumstances that are driving the interest in the F-16.

What was conveyed to me and what I can convey to you now is unfettered support for both the need to have tactical
aircraft, the very strong desire to want to stand up an Iraqi government that is in full flourish with all the appointments
and things that a government needs to maintain their security as well as all the domestic programs.
There was some discussion about some short-term rebalancing to meet some extingencies, and as I mentioned, we're
seeing that in a number of places and frankly we're seeing that a little bit here at home, this shifting of some priorities
and the reallocation of resources. So that didn't surprise us too much. But what was conveyed was a long-term
recognition of the need for probably more than 18 tactical fighters and the need for that kind of capability in the air
force and the desire to be strong security cooperation partners with the United States for a long period of time. So I take
these discussions at their word, and we'll measure progress against milestones that were discussed, and have a better
feel for this as our fiscal year closes, and as we get into 2012, I think we'll have greater visibility here.

Okay. Our final question comes from Peter Arment with Gleacher & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Yeah, good morning, Bob and Bruce.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Peter.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Bob, I guess I'll just take this as an opportunity to ask more of a big picture question for you. I
mean you've seen the fiscal '12 budget in detail now and expectations are we're going to have – the out years are most
likely going to see some pressures similar to what happened here in fiscal '11. How are you thinking about getting more
balance in the portfolio outside of defense?
And I guess I'm thinking about your ramping up of your targeted adjacencies, maybe to offset some of those pressures?
And I realize you still have a very proactive process on the portfolio shaping and returning 50% of free cash flow to
shareholders. But what's the desire to get more aggressive on the strategy? Thanks.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah, you're very welcome. I think that we are aggressive on our strategy and have – by
aggressive, I mean very highly energetically looking at this portfolio and making our assessments of what the outside
world is likely to look at, and I know we talk a huge amount about deficit reduction today, but there is also the need to
maintain a security posture in a world that is showing much more volatility, and the U.S. military is such a reliable
partner.
I personally think the activities that unfolded in Egypt could have and would have been a lot more difficult had there
not been long and well established military-to-military ties, where the military stood so tall and in such a distinguished
way to maintain order in the civilian population. And I attribute a lot of that to having great, close personal and
professional relations with the U.S. military here.
We think our portfolio is very, very well positioned to the relevancy and the prioritization that customers will have,
recognizing the need for stability, the need to access sea lanes to promote trade, the need to have – to be able to assure
that there is no domestic unrest. So in that segment of our portfolio that we call the core, we think strong execution is
the best way to assure future growth. That includes a recapitalization of the F-35, as Bruce has talked about. It includes
our ability to provide not only our nation but our friends and allies with very effective systems that can blunt the effect
of offensive missiles that are proliferating very rapidly. We have a good family of air lifters, the C-5 domestically, the
C-130 internationally. These aircraft are used in all manners of not just military engagements, but humanitarian relief,
fire-fighting missions, all sorts of things. So I think there's growth opportunity in that core business.

Additionally, when we think of adjacencies, I think of Littoral Combat Ships as one of those areas that we regarded as
an adjacency. Over time, I believe there's a commitment to building out a fleet of 55 Littoral Combat Ships
domestically, and I think there's considerable and expanding interest in the Littoral Combat Ship internationally. And in
that international interest, I think there's interest in countries in regions of the world that have the financial capacity to
support the program interests that they have.
And then on our horizon markets, we think about cyber security and energy and healthcare information technology, and
we know those markets will mature at different paces. And these are market segments and customers and technology
applications with which we have considerable familiarity. So the issue often becomes, will you commercialize – or
whatever the right words are, will you go into markets where you have less familiarity, where you have less experience
with consumer behavior, where you have different approaches to pricing and risk management.
And at this juncture, we don't see any reason to do that. We don't have any plan to do that, because we believe strongly
in the missions in which we are involved, the need for the capabilities that we, and in some cases almost only we, can
provide the critical customers around the globe. And we think that even under difficult discussions about deficit
reduction that will occur over a very long period of time, discussions that we absolutely intend to participate in and do
our part, there will still be a very compelling need to invest in security, in recapitalization and in preparing for a very
uncertain future that will determine the well-being of 310 million Americans and we're very dedicated to that focus.
So I don't think you should look to us to having any significant departure from the strategic focus that we have had on
our global security business. What you should expect from us is to stay focused on execution, to continue to set high
standards for cost reduction and quality and importantly we need to go out in a demanding marketplace and win new
business and we intend to do that.
