David F. DeVoe
Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody.
As you've seen in today's earnings release, we are quite pleased with our continued progress in fiscal 2012. We reported
second quarter segment operating income of $1.5 billion. This is a 16% increase over last year. This improvement was
led by a more than doubling of the contributions from our Film Entertainment segment as well as strong, double-digit
growth increases at our Cable Programming and Television segments. These increases more than offset declines at our
Publishing and Other segments.
There are a number of items in this year's second quarter worth highlighting for you. In the quarter, we recorded $87
million in costs related to the ongoing investigation in the United Kingdom, which is reflected in the Other segment and
significantly affected our operating income.
We reported a $125 million pre-tax income in "Other, net" line, which primarily reflects the noncash gain related to the
consolidation of Fox Panamerican sports. Additionally, equity earnings of affiliates includes a $44 million pre-tax gain
from BSkyB's share repurchase program. And lastly, we took a $36 million restructuring charge primarily related to our
international newspapers.
Reported net income in the quarter was $1.06 billion with reported earnings per share of $0.42 as compared to reported
earnings per share a year ago of $0.24.
Excluding the net income affect in both years of one-time items consisting of the four items I just highlighted as well as
the comparable year-ago charges, second-quarter earnings per share this year are $0.39 compared with the year-ago
adjusted result of $0.29, a 34% earnings per share improvement. In addition to the operational achievements, the
improved earnings per share result reflects a $0.02 per share benefit from reduced shares outstanding as a result of the
repurchases under our buy-back program.
With that, I'd like to provide some additional context on a few of our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Networks.
This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating nearly 60% of News Corporation's segment
operating income. Second-quarter Cable segment operating income contributions increased 20% over last year's level
to $882 million.
This growth continues to be top-line driven with segment revenues up 9%. Affiliate fees at the Cable Networks
increased 11% over the year-ago level with domestic channel affiliate fees up 9% and international fees up 19%.
Second quarter advertising revenues were up approximately 6% over last year at both the domestic and international
cable channel businesses. And please note that the domestic channel ad trends includes an adverse impact on our
regional sports networks from the delay of the start of the NBA season.
At our other domestic channels, advertising revenues were up 14% in the aggregate, driven by particular strength in
FX. At our international channels, the Fox International channels continue to report double-digit advertising revenue
[ph] while rough, at STAR, (4:48) its strong local currency advertising growth was offset on a U.S.-dollar-reported

basis due to the weakening of the Indian rupee.
As noted in today's press release, the NBA lockout resulted in a net earnings benefit to the Cable segment in the quarter
of approximately $55 million, with reduced rights and production costs more than offsetting the advertising and
affiliate fee reductions. This benefit will reverse itself in the second half of our fiscal year as those NBA costs now shift
to our third and fourth fiscal quarters, consistent with the timing of the games under the revised NBA schedule.
At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $189 million increased 25% over the second quarter a
year ago. This growth was driven by over 20% advertising increases at the broadcast network and higher retransmission
fees that were partially offset by higher programming costs for our new fall series.
Season to date, the Fox Network 18 to 49 ratings are up 10% excluding the Super Bowl on the strength of such new
shows as X Factor and New Girl, as well as strong ratings from the NFL.
At the stations, advertiser revenues were below year-ago levels due to lower political spending. Excluding politicals,
local station ad market spending in the quarter was essentially in line with a year ago.
At our Film segment, second-quarter operating income was $393 million. This is more than double the $189 million we
reported a year ago. And it reflects significantly reduced theatrical releasing costs. The second quarter also includes
strong worldwide home entertainment performances of Rio, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and X-Men First Class.
Additionally, our television production studio generated higher profit contributions, led by the growth of digital
distribution revenues from licensing library content to Netflix and Amazon. Year-to-date, we've recognized
approximately $200 million in total from our Netflix and Amazon deals with the majority falling in the second quarter.
Turning to SKY Italia, segment operating income in the quarter of $6 million improved $18 million from last year's
reported loss of $12 million. This improvement primarily reflects slightly higher subscription and advertising revenues
as well as lower programming costs and is a very good result, given significant slowing of the Italian economy. ARPU
of 41 euros declined 1 euro from a year ago, but increased 1 euro sequentially from the first quarter of this fiscal year.
And this primarily reflects the pricing increase announced in December.
We have 23,000 net new subscribers during the quarter, with quarter-ending subs totaling – just slightly more than 5
million. [ph] Insurance (7:39) continues to run at annual rate of about 12%. Excuse me a second.
And just turning now our Publishing segment, operating income of $218 million declined 43% from the year ago. This
$162 million decrease reflects lower advertising revenues at the Australian newspapers and integrated marketing
services business, as well as the impacts from the closure of News of the World in the United Kingdom. Dow Jones
earnings contributions were up slightly, and Chase will provide more detail to these businesses in a few minutes. And
just to correct myself, the operating income was $218 million in the quarter. It didn't decline by that.
And in our Other segment, we reported a second-quarter segment operating loss of $191 million. This is $35 million
higher than a year ago. This increased loss primarily reflects $87 million of costs related to the ongoing investigations
initiated upon the closure of the News of the World that more than offset the absence of MySpace losses. These UK
investigation charges are predominantly fees to outside lawyers and advisors working on various investigations and
committee hearings in the United Kingdom.
Before I turn to guidance, I'd like to update you on our $5 billion buyback program. Through February 7, the company
has spent nearly $2.7 billion repurchasing over 160 million shares, reducing News Corporation's total shares
outstanding by 6.1% compared to the start of our fiscal year. And as we announced last July and confirmed in
November, we fully intend to complete this program by the end of our fiscal year.
Finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2011. As a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding for fiscal 2011
the $125 million litigation charge, resulting in a base of $4.975 billion in segment operating income for comparative
purposes.

As we now look to our results for this year, the cost of the United Kingdom investigations are substantially higher than
the amounts we reflected in our guidance at the end of the first quarter. Due to the fluid nature of the ongoing
investigations, inquiries, hearings, and judicial proceedings, we're unable to reliably forecast these costs for the full
year. As a result, we are excluding such costs from our guidance for the full year.
These costs, which are predominantly fees to outside lawyers and advisors, have totaled approximately $104 million
through the first half of the year, including the $87 million reported in this second quarter. And we will continue to
report the amounts incurred on a quarterly basis.
After excluding the full-year effect of the United Kingdom investigation costs, and based on all the assumptions
inherent in our projections, we expect that our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2012 to
continue to be in the low- to mid-teens range, above the $4.975 billion fiscal 2011 segment operating income base
levels.
I think at first glance, this growth forecast may appear rather conservative, given the strong results generated in our first
six months of fiscal 2012. However, there are a number of timing items worth highlighting for you.
As mentioned previously, the approximately $55 million benefit realized in the second quarter from the NBA lock-out
reversed in the following two quarters. Additionally, the majority of the anticipated Netflix and Amazon revenue for
this year have already been captured through the second quarter. And also note that Fox's big animated release this
summer, Ice Age 4: Continental Drift, will be released July 13, with a majority of the releasing costs, but no revenues,
hitting this year's fourth quarter. And this compares to a very strong second half of fiscal 2011, led by the profitable
theatrical performance of Rio in last year's fourth quarter.
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Chase for his comments
Charles G. Carey
Thanks, Dave, and welcome, everybody.
The last quarter's been one of steady progress on our key strategic objectives. In our U.S. Cable and Broadcast
business, our goals are to build unique and distinctive channels that can be market leaders in their competitive arenas;
to invest intelligently in key content that can strengthen these channels; to be opportunistic about ways to grow new
franchises; and to generate revenues that reflect the fair value of that content. We're executing pretty well on all these
fronts.
Our big channels like Fox, FX, and Fox News continue to be leaders and distinguish themselves from our competitors.
Emerging channels like Fox Soccer, Fuel and Fox Movies have added exciting new dimensions to their businesses.
New long-term arrangements with the NFL, UFC, and FIFA for the World Cup will anchor growth for both our
broadcast and cable businesses. We continue to look for ways to grow new franchises, like the X Factor on Fox and the
new Charlie Sheen sitcom on FX. We're building new properties like MundoFox to take advantage of a unique
partnership opportunity with RCN to tap into the rapidly growing Latino market. And we continue to complete
retransmission and affiliate agreements that recognize the value of our content.
We see long-term growth opportunities through authentication, and believe it is the right strategy for content owners,
MVPDs and consumers, but it just needs to be executed better.
The advertising markets, while not quite as robust as they were six-plus months ago, remain solid. In the March
quarter, the broadcast network is still seeing scatter-pricing at a premium to the strong up-front pricing, and the stations
excluding last year's Super Bowl are seeing a March quarter up around 5% on last year, with the business getting
stronger. We're also taking share from our competitors with Fox television stations setting market share records in the
December quarter.

The cable side is more varied, with FX continuing to see strong double-digit growth, while local sports at the lower end
are up mid-single digits.
The International Cable Channels business – our strategy's much the same, with a higher focus on growth to take
advantage of both underlying market potential and opportunistic expansion. Competitively our channels have never
been stronger. From STAR in India to our group of Latin American channels, our market share and competitive
position continues to improve.
We're investing in key content on a global basis to further differentiate our channels. We set ratings records with the
launch of American Horror Story, and we look forward to the global premiere of Kiefer Sutherland's Touch next
month.
We continue to add key new franchises to build on this strength. Most recently, in Latin America we acquired control
of Fox Panamerican Sports, a leading Latin American sports business, and launched Fox Sports Brazil. We're working
on some exciting new opportunities in Asia, too. These businesses continue to perform ahead of expectations with
results in the developing markets of Asia and Latin America significantly offsetting a bit of softness in a few Western
European markets.
At our distribution platform businesses, our goals are to grow market share through premium content, technology
leadership and superior customer service wrapped around our unique brand offerings. In Italy, we successfully tackled
the competitive challenge from our major industry competitor as well as a challenging regulatory environment to
regenerate growth and excitement in our business. We recently added a renewed key sports right to continue to expand
initiatives like HD and DVRs.
While this business is pretty resistant to economic headwinds, it's not immune. We do expect short term growth to be
impacted somewhat by Italy's macro issues, but we are extremely bullish on its long-term potential.
In Germany, our growth has been even more dynamic. This growth strategy requires capital. We just entered into
another capital support agreement, and while Germany is still a work in progress, the management team has done a
great job the last year and has established real strength and growth in a business in Europe's dominant economy.
As a media company, we believe the explosion of consumer demand for digital content, driven by the upsurge in
emerging platforms and international opportunities, makes this a great time to be a content leader. However, we equally
recognize this is a business driven by quality, i.e., hits, not quantity, and we strive to find the right balance for success.
It is also a business that requires discipline and expertise to navigate challenging economics.
All these complexities require a great management team, and we have teams on both our Film and TV Production
businesses that are second to none. These businesses have proved adept at managing the slowdown and transition in the
home entertainment market, exploiting the digital market in a disciplined manner, and maximizing international market
opportunities.
In our publishing segment, this is clearly a tough year, as we're seeing significant year-over-year declines in the U.K.
papers, the Australian papers, and our integrated marketing business. We expect fiscal 2012 full-year results for each of
these businesses to be down around $100 million. Actually we expect the U.K. to be down $150 million plus for the
full year.
In the U.K. the impact from the closure of the News of the World has been exacerbated by a very tough economy. But
as we've said many times, we're committed to making things right in the U.K. I
In Australia, the economy has also severely impacted our business. We have a new management team in place that is
focused on restructuring this business to address the challenges, and we tackle them from a position of strength, due to
our world-leading franchises.
At our Integrated Marketing business, our issues stem from the changing dynamics of the in-store side of our business.
On the coupon-side, business is operating on plan.

To address these challenges we're executing a strategy that includes expanding categories of stores, adding or
significantly expanding our relationships with key customers like P&G, and completing multiyear agreements to
recapture some of the lost growth in this business.
The one publishing segment that is up year-over-year is Dow Jones, although we believe we're just scratching the
surface of the potential for this business in today's digital world. We just announced a new CEO who is already at work
on plans to deliver on that potential.
I want to be clear. While these publishing businesses face the challenges of a maturing print market, we believe there's
a real opportunity for quality branded news, particularly as digital platforms continue to evolve. We are committed to
being a leader in news and information, and we remain confident in our ability to transition these businesses.
Bottom line, we feel really good about the momentum to our business and believe we have a lot of upside over the next
few years to our overall results.
With that, I'll turn to questions.
Reed Nolte
Operator, we'd like to go to questions from the investment community now, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Oh, thanks. I wanted to ask you about affiliate fees. Could you talk about the outlook? I
know you have a new distributor deal in place for fiscal Q3. Can you give us any sense of the growth for the back half
of the year? And on the international affiliate fee side is that increase all subscriber growth? Are you seeing any
increases in the press up of affiliate fees?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: On the first, the second half, I don't want to get too far into quarter to quarter. I think these
are better looked at year to year. The second half of the year will be higher growth than the first half.
But I think we said before we feel pretty good that as we look out over the next couple years, the type of growth we've
had – that sort of 10%, 10%-plus growth in affiliate fees is something that we can sustain. And we obviously have an
array of deals coming up. The most recent was DIRECTV, which will give a little headwind to them. And it'll give a
little tail wind to them for the second half. But I think to get it into too quarter to quarter gets too sensitive to some of
the timing of deals.
But in aggregate, I think we believe we have a momentum. The momentum you've seen in the last few years is the
momentum we believe we can continue as you look out the next few years.
In terms of international, it's certainly both. We're investing in those channels, we're building better channels. And
there's the question. Both subscriber growth and rate growth are very much at the heart of the strategies we're deploying
as we build these businesses around the world.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Can I just sneak in one other thing? You mentioned investing in things like the Spanish
language networks. Can you just give us a sense of how big that investment spending will be over the next year or so?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: That, particularly because of the partnership with RCN, is the type of business we really like
building. And I think that's an investment that's in the tens of millions. Multiple tens, but it's not 10 or 20, but it's tens.
Not three-digit millions.

We think we have a really unique partner that has really created a product for that marketplace that is distinct from
what's there. We like the growth in that market, and we think it's a real opportunity with a unique partner to build a
really attractive business in an exciting segment of the marketplace.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Jessica. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
And that question comes from the line of David Bank, RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Thanks very much. Two quick ones. The first one is, Chase, could you give us a sense right now
of what the average affiliate O&O retrans fee is across the group right now?
And the second question is – thank you for the clarity on the buy-back commitment through the end of the year. Just to
push a little further, could you comment or reiterate on your overall capital plans, in terms of your allocation for M&A,
your – anything more you want to say that goes beyond the year, even generally, for capital allocation. Thanks very
much.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes, I think we haven't in the past and probably don't plan to get into what are the
retransmission rates we're looking for. I will say we're on target with what we set out to do, and continuing to work
both sides with both the O&O side and the affiliate side of it.
And the scenario that we think is critical to us – and I will say we think we are certainly making headway, but still what
we're getting would not reflect the value of our content competitively in the marketplace. But we're trying to be
constructive and consistent. And to date, we are pretty much right on target with our plans. But we haven't really put
the rates out there, and I don't think we plan to put the rates out there.
In terms of capital, I don't think we're in a – that different place than – and I'd sort of say what I said in the past – I
think continues to be sort of pretty much the – where we're at today. I mean we continue to have – we recognize an
overly liquid balance sheet. We recognize we'll still have an overly liquid balance sheet when we finish this buy-back.
I think we are trying to work towards a place where we've got a appropriate level of leverage. Enough cash in the
balance sheet for flexibility, but not that excess liquidity we've got now.
We'd rather be building businesses than acquiring businesses, but I think if we can find businesses to acquire, that – or
buy – that meet our thresholds – and that's the threshold to me that is sort of a mid-teens return – we think those are
investments to make.
I mean take I guess the Latin American investment, it achieved two goals for us. One, we had a minority stake. We can
take the, I think we said that before. We think that's a good opportunity for something we own a third of, to take full
control and make it an operating business, as opposed to an off-balance sheet investment. I think we should be – the
businesses we're in, we should be striving to the ones we like to own, and if it doesn't make sense, you know, go the
other way.
So that's a business that achieved that goal, and we're very excited about the growth. I mean it far exceeds any of the
thresholds we have for return on that investment. We're very excited. Latin America has been a real area of growth for
us in the Channels business. We think this adds a real dimension to that business. And we're very excited about the
ability it has with it to building of businesses. I mean it's an early stage business in Latin – and it brings with it the
opportunity to build a sports channel in Brazil, which we didn't have before.
So I think we can find opportunities like that, that bring those sorts of dimensions to it. We think that's the type of
opportunity we're clearly looking to pursue.
<Q - David Bank>: Just one quick follow up. Do you think it's fair to infer then, given the kind of numbers you are
talking about for that opportunity, is it fair to infer that at this point, we could be expecting the kind of

intermediate-term run rate of capital returns to shareholders that we're seeing right now? Or is that – we just can't infer
that?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Look, I mean, we have – recognize I get asked the question about sort of a buy-back beyond
this buy-back. And as I said, we recognize we continue to have liquidity, excess liquidity. Our stock continues to be
undervalued. We think another buy-back is something we'd certainly probably think makes sense.
We haven't made that decision at the board. We'll make that decision before we certainly get to the end of this
buy-back, which as Dave said, would be no later than June.
But I think this is one – a role like this, you sort of got to – it's – I think you can look to where you're going in terms of
what's liquidity, what's the leverage, what's the strategy in terms of how you invest. And we'll make those decisions as
we go along. And I guess we've tried to lay out that philosophy.
<Q - David Bank>: Thank you very much.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Can we go to next question, please?
Operator
– comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Thanks. A question – also I'll throw a clarification in there. The clarification first.
You said FX was strong double digits in the March quarter, and I was just curious if it was a similar growth rate in the
December quarter? Or a little bit lower? A little bit higher? Where obviously it's a good comparable to other groups
that are out there.
And then, Chase, the question is, I think you said in your prepared remarks, you felt execution on authentication needs
to improve. I think everyone on the call probably has their own opinion on this, but I was curious to see if you would
expand on your view relative to that comment? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Sure. I mean what I was really talking about FX, it's probably more scatter pricing. I mean
sort of in FX today, you'd see we had strong upfront, but we're probably seeing scatter pricing as probably in the
neighborhood of 20% up in the March quarter. What we have, anyway.
If you look at the revenue in the quarter, probably the second quarter is a little stronger than the third. But FX has –
look, we're thrilled with the momentum behind FX and everything they've done. FX has been a great story for us.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: I was really trying to get to the overall ad marketplace, whether it was sort of similar in
March to December? Or better or worse? And FX as a proxy, so -
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think actually if you took it in aggregate for the Cable group, it'll be stronger, so -
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Okay.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: In terms of the authentication, I think it is the right solution. I think – I guess my degree of –
I don't know – call it frustration with it is we were talking about it when I was back at DIRECTV over two years ago.
So I mean I think in this world, you can't spend three or four years getting something going. So I think all of us just
have to do a better job of moving these things forward. And I think it just takes – take too much time.
I think it is the right solution. And I think it is the solution that, again, I think serves everybody's purpose, including
consumers, of bringing a much more exciting proposition to the marketplace. I think the product we provide, if we can
continue to enhance it, actually is a great value for the consumer.
But we've got to do our job and make sure we're delivering. Delivering great service. We've got create exciting content.
We got to add new dimensions to it to excite them. And if we can add all those things – I think somebody like Apple's

We've got to do our job, but we can't take the time we've taken to try and get this going.
And I think the secondary concern is a little bit – is sort of historical perspective to try to move this forward in a
wall-guarded mode. And I think for consumers, this kind of technology's going to run over walls. So I'd rather see a
much more open architecture around authentication.
But I want to be clear. I think it is the – I think TV everywhere authentication, whatever you want to call it, is the right

Comes from the line of Michael Nathanson, Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Thank you. I have one for Dave on housekeeping and one for Chase on RSN.
So Dave, everyone's called out the impact of the NBA so far on these conference calls. Can you give us a sense of what
organic advertising and affiliate fee growth would have been, apples-to-apples with NBA in the numbers, or kind of
just get me apples-to-apples for the quarter?
<A - David F. DeVoe>: Yeah, I thought I said it, actually. But it's 14%.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: 14% for advertising and affiliate fees?
<A - David F. DeVoe>: Slightly less than that. About 9% apples-to-apples, yeah.

Next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield, BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: Hi. Could you talk to your education initiative? I think it remains a major source of
concern for investors in terms of kind of what you're going to do with future spending in this category. I don't think
anyone really knows much about your plans. Where is it going? Would you ever consider buying a company such as
McGraw-Hill or Pearson to accelerate your strategy? Just anything you can tell us would be helpful.
And then just to follow-up on the RSN side of the business, Time Warner Cable appears to be doing just fine without
MSG, notwithstanding what they're trying to do with the new net in L.A. How do you think about the sustainability of
your RSN business? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: -- we get to the education business, I'll start off by saying we're not buying Pearson or
McGraw-Hill.
The education business, we're very much in an early-stage building mode. It is a business – I talked earlier on in
different context about our desire to build businesses, not buy businesses. That's what we're doing here. And we are
currently investing in the business through hiring people and putting – investing really in people and technology. It is
very much ramping up right now.
I think as we look at this full year, we will probably invest, or I guess realistically sort of take a P&L loss of sort of $75
million plus, probably for the year. The majority of that will be in the second half of the year. Because if that's where
the ramp-up interface of this is, we think it's the right way to build this. We don't have any legacies. We're not burdened
by protecting any historical businesses.

And we think building is a real opportunity to create value. We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital
technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past.
And we think we've put a team together. Joel Klein has hired a number of really world-recognized experts in this field.
And we think we have a team that has a real vision for how they're going to capitalize on this.
I think our plan for everybody there is probably in the next few months, probably before the next earnings call, would
be to provide a bit more visibility to what those plans are, where we're going with that. Again, there's a lot going on
today in that arena. And I think we will try in the coming months to provide better visibility to it.
What was the second part, Richard?
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: Just in terms of the RSNs. If you look at...
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I don't know what – I don't really know what – what's really happening in New York.
I mean first, New York's a pretty unique animal. Anybody who's been in a New York apartment, go and try and see
how many choices you've got for a provider. So it's not a typical market, in terms of what are the consequences of not
having key programming.
I think we're pretty comfortable in the importance of sports, the value of sports. And ultimately, as David Hill always
says, sports are tribal, which means local. So as we look at the business, we feel very good about it and continue to
believe that we can do exciting things.
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: And, Chase, just a follow-up. When do you think will be the earliest we start to see actual
revenue start to flow in from the education side?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Again, I think it's probably better – they're moving fast. But I think it's better to let – rather
than give piecemeal, I think Joel is probably the right person to give you a better and a more complete understanding of
it. He'll do that.
But I think to sort of do it piecemeal probably won't do justice to it.

It comes from the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. One question on the prepared remarks and then one follow up.
On the newspaper publishing segment, Chase, I think you mentioned $150 million headwinds this year at the U.K.,
$100 million in Australia and $100 million at inserts. So $350 million total. Did I get that right for the year? Is that...
<A - David F. DeVoe>: For the year, yes, that's right.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay, thanks. And then on the Netflix Amazon number I think you said $200 million
fiscal year-to-date, most of which already been booked. Is that...
<A - David F. DeVoe>: Right. That's revenue.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: That's revenue, right. Chase, what do you think happens to that business if you say over
a two to three year period. I don't know if you define it as a business but at least the new digital licensing revenues that
the industry is generating. I think there's a lot of debate about the sustainability of those business models long term, but
I would be curious to hear your thoughts and if you think that business gets meaningfully larger for revenue line for
News Corp over a three to four year period, as these initial contracts re-up.

<A - Charles G. Carey>: I don't see how that business doesn't get larger. It seems every time you – we get somebody
new talking about coming into the business, creating a digital platform. And last week it was Verizon and Verizon Red
Box. I'm not sure I can figure out the partnership. But Verizon they're still going into digital distribution.
So I think without question, I think that business gets much larger. And I think even the existing players – obviously
Netflix went through a bit of a roller coaster, but they seem to have – to their credit, refound their footing. And we have
long – and one of the nice things is, essentially with existing players, when we booked it this year, we have recurring
annual revenue because really we have structured to give us the ability to continue to renew and extend and put product
in every year to try this. And then as you get new players coming in, it gives us an ability to expand the market around
new players.
But I think this is arena that has enormous growth in it, as you think about everybody, including the big guys that are
sort of – whether it's the Googles or what have you that talk about it – the Googles, the Apples – that all sort of – not
clear where they're going, but ultimately I don't think anybody is not saying that video isn't a core part of their future.
And which is why I made the comments about I think the importance of value of content, our desire to invest in
content, our desire to be a leader in content and make sure we have really unique – whether it's acquired or created. It's
going to be both. But control as much content as possible to take advantage of it.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Would you expect someone to go out with a full virtual cable product – live linear
channels, as well?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think we may hear some talk. I think there's a lot more – but I think there's a lot more
complexities around that. Whether it's capacity complexities or other dimensions.
I think in some ways – I mean you hear some of the buzz. In many ways, I think the greatest opportunities are always
when somebody figures out and develops something new for the market, as opposed to just me-toos.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Right.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I'm not smart enough to already have figured that out. And I guess the guy who does will do
well.
But I think you'd like to figure out how do you create new experiences that take advantage of these technologies, not
just certain me-toos.

Comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente, Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Hi. Thanks a lot. I just have a question about advertising. I'm trying to square
away – it seemed like if you back out the NBA lockout, you talked about 14% growth. And I take a step back and look
at the TV station trends. I think you said last quarter was sequentially in line. So I'm interpreting that as flattish last
quarter.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Flat without politicals. With politicals in, it was actually down more like I think 12% or
something. So think that's flat ex-political.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Okay. Right. So I guess my question is, bigger picture, why – it seems like the
national Cable TV advertising marketplace seems like it's pacing and trending a lot stronger than the TV station group.
And in your mind what are the biggest reasons why that is?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Actually, I'm not sure I'd say – again we've – I'd say on the TV side or the broadcast side,
our scatter market could just be a solid scatter market. We just went through – actually cancellations for the June

quarter just came in at the low end of what would be an historical number.
On the station side, we're up 5%. Actually, if you take out – if really do an apples-to-apples and adjust because there
was an NFL game that fell in there, it's probably more like 7%. So you've got a solid business on the station side.
So I think it may be a bit more us, and I think for us, we clearly have some franchises on the Cable side – Fox News is
going into a political cycle, so it'll have some benefits of the political cycle. I talked about the strengths of FX and I
think – the success it's had. And I think it benefits from that.
And look. We're investing in more content there. So we expect to be delivering for us there. Not that we aren't investing
in content on forecast side too.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Okay. Thanks, Chase. And just one quick follow-up, which is I think you
answered a question before about capital allocation. And I'm not sure if you mentioned dividend as part of your
considerations there. If you look other U.S. media companies their dividend yields are a bit higher. And I just wonder is
dividend growth or higher dividend yield a consideration at the board level when you go through that conversation?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: For sure. I think dividends – we did increase it just a bit.
<A - David F. DeVoe>: Yes, we increased it last – we increased from $0.15 to a $0.17 dividend -
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes, but I mean – it is, it should be. I guess I always have a bias when your stock's
undervalued to a buyback. But it should be worth the dialog, and I think it very much fits.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Fair enough. Thank you.

That comes from the line of John Janedis, UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thank you. Can you give a little more color on [ph] thick (40:32) relative to the $1 billion
operating income goal? Realizing it gets only about a third of revenue from advertising, to what extent could maybe a
weaker global macro environment impact affiliate fee growth under the renewals? How does the global ad market
look? And how many channels do you expect to launch this year?
<A - David F. DeVoe>: We just launched – is it four? Four, or three, I guess.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes, it's tough to do a channel on because a lot of times you've got like so many countries. A
lot of times you're launching something regional or country.
So I think in general, in many ways, I think we're looking at opportunities. I'd probably say the focus is a little bit more
on quality as opposed to quantity. I think we like, but I think quality always wins out, and you want to have big strong
channels. And so I think if I was sort of biased that it's sort of I suppose just a pure land grab of volume and channels.
I think there are opportunities, like as I said, I think sports in Latin America is a truly unique one. And mentioned we
got a couple things in Asia going on that I think are equally exciting for us.
But I feel like the opportunity's to add channels but in many ways, I'd probably say right now, the greater focus is on
continuing to improve the quality of those channels to drive that upside --.
<A - David F. DeVoe>: We're pacing right on that plan for the first -
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes, I know – any time you try to predict global macroeconomics, I wish I had that type of
crystal ball. Most of our growth is coming out of places that are not where everybody's talking about. We're getting a
little bit of – I would hit a few western European countries. But even there, some those are fine. And certainly Asia and

Latin America continue to be strong and are not – but people talk about problems.
And these are businesses that – again what I said in the comments – they're not immune to these economic challenges.
But they hold up pretty well against it. You stack up industries and say what's the impact on it, one of the great things
about some of these subscription businesses is they're pretty resilient when it comes to large issues.
Now obviously, if you had something truly catastrophic – I don't know how anybody sort of predicts what that means.

Comes from the line of Alan Gould, Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alan S. Gould>: Thank you. Chase, you've just hired an executive from Bloomberg to run Dow Jones. How
much of an opportunity is there to take Dow Jones more into the digital realm than it is? More into the professional
area? And will this require a major investment?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: No, I think – and I know I only just touched on it. I think it's an enormous opportunity. Like
the digital world is going to make quality information I think more valuable than ever. And if you want to talk quality
information, I mean The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones is at the top of the heap.
I think to date, a lot of focus has been on the Journal as a consumer product. I mean we've sustained other business, but
I think we really have not taken advantage of the opportunities to develop the broader digital franchises that can be
grown out of – we've grown, so I'm not saying they haven't – the people there have not undertaken initiatives, but I
think there's a real set of opportunities for us to create products.
And I guess you can sort of get to B2B, B2C, where I'm not sure it's not sort of a continuum. In many ways, what's a –
is a professional individual a consumer or a businessperson? And I think that's sort of what we're going to create. What
we need to create is products, but have a continuum, from sort of obviously The Journal at a base. And the ability to
create products that tier up from that, whether they're targeted or deeper, that take advantage of digital technologies.
And in many ways, a little bit like we talk about elsewhere, one of the great benefits we have in building these things is
we can take advantage of the digital technological infrastructure that's been put in place. And we're not building with
some of the legacy infrastructures that others may have.
I think mostly it's taking advantage of what we got and focusing this way. I don't think it's – I know there will be some
degrees of investment, but I don't think it's a big investment undertaking. I think it's just mostly focusing on the right
opportunities.

<A - Charles G. Carey>: You mean how much of the home entertainment? I'm not sure I can do this. But I mean
clearly it's more. The DVD business is still the majority of it. So the growth is certainly Blu-ray and the electronic or
digital distribution are the growth areas. Look, they are the future.
DVDs are going to be around a long time. People like them and people continue to have them. So – but I think as you
said, where is the business going longer term? It's going to continue to migrate towards a form of sort of digital
distribution. That is the longer term future.
I don't want to imply that DVDs don't have real legs. I mean actually Blu-ray has been pretty good growth story.
Blu-ray growth rate is sort of like 20% or something right now.
So we're going to – we're certainly not going to just – we're going to continue to make sure we manage that business
diligently, and make sure we focus in, both – long term is obviously always where we're driving towards, but be
intelligent about the short term. And I think the DVD business continues to have legs.

made about expecting $150 million decline from the U.K. papers. Is that about circulation, advertising, restructuring,
costs for a Sun on Sunday? Or what is that?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: No, the vast majority is the impact of having closed the News of the World. Obviously that -
<Q - Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson>: Just lost incomes? Lost revenues?

that has a lot of – I don't know if you call them fixed costs – a big infrastructure in terms of sales and circulation and
other overheads that supported multiple papers. And one of the four papers that it supported and generated revenue
