Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. Good morning. This morning, I'll review our 2010 performance as well as our outlook for 2011. Tom
and John will walk you through the details of our fourth quarter and full-year results as well as our 2011 outlook and
then we'll take your questions.
As you can see from our earnings news release, Abbott reported another year of industry-leading performance in 2010.
Despite the strength of this performance, it was a challenging year for Abbott as it was for the entire healthcare industry
and for the global economy.
In 2010, the healthcare industry as a whole faced a number of significant headwinds. These pressures have been well
documented and include the slow recovery of the global economy, the costs associated with U.S. healthcare reform,
European pricing pressures and austerity measures and a regulatory environment in which it's, frankly, more difficult to
get products approved. Each of these factors is considerable in and of itself. Combined, they added up to a significant
impact on our business. Despite this, we delivered. We managed through the challenges as we've always done and
delivered double-digit EPS growth.
However, this is the environment we're operating in and so we have to continue to respond in ways that protect our
shareholders and strengthen the long-term sustainability of our business. This morning, we took actions in our
pharmaceutical business to reduce commercial and manufacturing operating costs primarily in the U.S. You will recall
that we took similar actions outside of the U.S. last year in conjunction with the Solvay integration. At the same time in
2010, we built for our future by expanding our emerging markets infrastructure and investing in and expanding our
pipeline.
As we announced this morning, Abbott achieved full-year, ongoing EPS growth of 12%. We also drove a 200 basis
point improvement in gross margin to more than 60% of sales and delivered another record year of operating cash flow
of more than $8 billion, well exceeding our 2009 level of $7.3 billion. And we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in
the form of dividends. Our payout ratio is strong at more than 40%. We've increased our dividend for 38 consecutive
years making Abbott one of only a handful of U.S. companies to deliver with such consistency.
Our results, again, underscore why we've remained a broad-based healthcare company with a diverse mix of businesses
and geographic operations as well as numerous sources of earnings and cash flow. Out of that diversity, we can achieve
strong, reliable performance. That's our identity and that's what you expect from us. As we announced this morning, we
expect to deliver double-digit earnings growth again in 2011. I'll talk more about the year ahead in just a moment.
In 2010, our sales and earnings growth came in many different forms: from our existing products, from new product
launches, from geographic expansion and from acquisitions. We maintained commercial leadership positions in a wide
range of attractive growth markets and importantly, we not only grew our sales but we improved the profitability of our
operating businesses.
So let me highlight a few examples. In our vascular business, which includes more than 100 brands across more than a
dozen segments, our XIENCE family of drug-eluting stents captured the number one global position with its successful
launch in Japan early last year. We also hold the number one position in metallic stents and guide wires and expect the

forthcoming U.S. launch of our TREK balloon to help us capture the number one market position in that category as
well. As a result of our success, Abbott vascular has quadrupled its operating margin from 2008 to 2010 to more than
$900 million.
In pharmaceuticals, we successfully completed the acquisitions of both Solvay Pharmaceuticals and Piramal Healthcare
Solutions which added significant commercial infrastructure in emerging markets, hundreds of new branded generics as
well as two market-leading products, CREON and AndroGel. HUMIRA, our biologic for the treatment of autoimmune
diseases delivered growth of nearly 20% for 2010. We're well positioned with this product over the long-term including
continued double-digit growth in 2011.
In Vision care we hold the number one position in LASIK and the number two position in cataract lens technology
launching several new intraocular lenses last year and a new contact lens solution.
Our nutrition business is one of the strongest globally. It generates high return on invested capital and significant cash
flow.
Outside of the United States, we expect to maintain double-digit growth with stronger growth in emerging markets. In
the U.S., our underlying perm performance is strong. However, as you know last year we had a recall of some of our
infant formula products. We've addressed it and our recovery is tracking slightly ahead of our expectations as we work
hard to recapture our share.
Within core laboratory diagnostics, Abbott holds the number one position globally in blood screening and
immunoassay diagnostics where we launched a number of key assays last year and expect to launch a dozen more this
year.
Our molecular and point of care diagnostics businesses are smaller in size, but are growing at a strong double-digit pace
and over the last several years we've significantly improved cash flow generation and expanded operating margins in
our diagnostics businesses. We expect steady improvement going forward.
In 2010, we also took a number of important strategic steps to continue to position Abbott for long-term, sustainable
growth in an increasingly difficult environment and rapidly changing world. We focused on building our infrastructure
in emerging markets as well as our pipeline. I'll start with emerging markets which will play a critical role in the
success of the healthcare industry going forward.
Today, Abbott is one of the best positioned healthcare companies to capture growth in this segment. Over the past
several years, we expanded our product offerings and strengthened our emerging markets presence across our
businesses and in 2010, we took several actions to frame our future in these regions. In addition to completing the
Solvay and Piramal acquisitions, we entered into a licensing agreement with Zydus Cadila in India.
These actions together expanded our presence in many of the most populous, fast-growing markets. They brought us a
large portfolio of stable, branded generic products and together with our existing business made us the largest
pharmaceutical company in India, an $8 billion pharmaceutical market that is expected to double in the next five years.
We also create our new Established Products Division, or EPD. Similar to what we did with our international nutrition
business several years ago, we carved out EPD from our international pharmaceuticals organization to give it the focus
it needs to drive profitable growth of our branded generics portfolio, particularly in emerging markets. These products
have strong brand identity and customer loyalty that make them more profitable than traditional commodity generics.
In 2011, we expect EPD sales of approximately $5 billion.
These actions have given us the right commercial footprint to become one of largest pharmaceutical companies in
emerging markets which are expected to grow at three times the rate of developed markets. This is driven by population
growth, rising incomes and modernization of health systems and an increase in the treatment of chronic diseases. These
markets represent one of the greatest opportunities in healthcare, not only in pharmaceuticals, but across our business
segments.

We're also focused on maximizing the growth potential of our international nutritionals business. After
pharmaceuticals, it's the second largest segment of our business in emerging markets. We expect to more than double
our nutritional sales in emerging markets over the next five years, with sales in China alone approaching $1 billion by
2014.
Abbott is particularly well positioned to take advantage of the growth we're seeing in emerging markets as evidenced
by our results today. In 2010, our total sales in emerging markets broadly defined were more than $8 billion or 25% of
Abbott's total sales. In 2011, we expect sales to exceed $9 billion for this geographic segment and by 2014, we expect
more than $14 billion in emerging market sales reflecting a compound annual growth rate of more than 15%.
As important as capturing new geographic growth opportunities, is the development of our new product pipeline. At
our core, we're an innovation driven business and developing new life-saving and life-changing medicines and
technologies for patients is vital to our long-term success. In 2010, we invested 10% of our sales, or $3.5 billion in
research and development across our broad-based pipeline. We made progress advancing our own internal pipeline and
aggressively enhanced our mid and late-stage pharmaceutical pipeline through licensing and acquisitions. We added a
total of four new molecular entities that are in late-stage development and by the end of this year, we'll have nearly 20
new molecular entities and indications in Phase II or III. This includes unique compounds for Hepatitis C [HCV],
Chronic Kidney Disease [CKD], neuroscience and pain management, women's health, immunology and oncology,
among other areas of high medical benefit and opportunity.
Let me highlight a few of the more promising opportunities. We've made significant progress with our internal hepatitis
C program. The HCV treatment landscape is expected to change rapidly over the next several years and will evolve
considerably even after the newest therapies come to market. In HCV it's not about arriving first, but arriving with the
best treatment. Last year, our program moved faster than any competitors and we believe we're in position to become a
significant player.
We're one of the only companies with compounds spanning multiple mechanisms of action. We have one of the best
HCV protease inhibitors in development based on data that's shown unprecedented anti-viral activity. We'll present
additional data on that compound as well as our other HCV compounds throughout the year. We expect to have five
different Phase II HCV programs underway by year end.
Through our agreement with Reata Pharmaceuticals we acquired international rights to bardoxolone excluding certain
Asian markets. It's a compound for chronic kidney disease that we expect to enter Phase III in the first half of this year.
Chronic kidney disease is a significant cost to the global healthcare system driven by a patient's eventual need for
dialysis. Bardoxolone has the potential to prevent and possibly reverse the progression of CKD. To date, no treatment
has been shown to reverse disease progression. Bardoxolone could change the treatment landscape as well as have a
significant economic benefit to the healthcare system.
In our neuroscience pipeline, we have 14 compounds in human trials to address a myriad of conditions from pain to
Alzheimer's disease to multiple sclerosis. Daclizumab is a biologic for multiple sclerosis that we obtained through our
acquisition of Facet last year. It's currently in Phase III studies and has the potential to offer enhanced efficacy over
many existing MS therapies along with a favorable safety profile.
We also continue to make good progress in oncology. Our pipeline includes a number of new molecular entities in
clinical development for more than a dozen different cancer types. Elotuzumab, which we also acquired through the
Facet acquisition, has demonstrated very good response rates in relapsed multiple myeloma, the second most common
blood cancer in the U.S. We anticipate initiating Phase III development with our partner company early this year.
So as you can see, we have a lot moving forward in our pharmaceutical pipeline and look forward to numerous new
trial starts and new data presentations throughout the year. We also expect 2011 to be an active year in our medical
devices pipeline.
In the vascular business, we're working on well-staged advances and truly game-changing technologies that have the
ability to restate the market. These include devices such as XIENCE Nano and XIENCE PRIME in the U.S. as well as
our Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold or BVS technology called ABSORB. We recently received European approval for

ABSORB and are several years ahead of any competitor in this space. Given its unique attributes, we believe ABSORB
has the ability to revolutionize the treatment of coronary artery disease.
Another potential breakthrough technology in our vascular pipeline is MitraClip, which treats significant mitral
regurgitation. It's the most common structural heart defect and causes numerous downstream effects such as congestive
heart failure, stroke and eventually death. MitraClip is on the market in Europe and is under U.S. FDA review. We
continue to work toward an Advisory Panel for MitraClip in 2011.
In our vision care pipeline we expect 20 new products and technology advancements over the next five years. In
diagnostics, we have a number of new assays and next generation systems launching over the next several years that
collectively will contribute to our future growth. This includes our Ibis molecular technology which has numerous
applications including forensics, biopreparedness, public health surveillance and biopharmaceutical testing.
So as I look back at 2010, despite the many challenges that are impacting our industry, Abbott had another productive
year. As we look to 2011, we have a realistic view of our future. We're planning and preparing for a similar
environment. It's not getting any easier. However, we have a very experienced management team that has navigated
through some difficult headwinds before, and I have every confidence that we will succeed.
We'll continue to respond and structure the company to be successful going forward. At the same time, we're enhancing
R&D productivity and expanding geographically to capture new growth opportunities in the years ahead. As our
industry continues to evolve, so does Abbott.
We expect our earning per share growth trajectory to remain at the top of our peer group, maintaining Abbott's
long-established position as a dependable, durable, high-performing leader in the healthcare industry. Our diversified
base of earnings and our ability to manage through adversity differentiates Abbott from many of its peers and as a
result, despite challenges in the global business environment, we're confident in our strong financial position and we
continue to target double-digit earnings per share growth in the years ahead.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom and John for a more detailed overview of the fourth quarter as well as 2011 and then
we'll come back and take your questions. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Thanks, Miles. As you can see from our earnings news release this morning, we had a strong fourth quarter, delivering
double-digit sales and ongoing earnings growth and we're very pleased with our overall performance in 2010 as we
delivered top-tier results.
For the fourth quarter, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $1.30, an increase of 10.2% over the prior
year, consistent with our previous guidance. Sales growth in the quarter was 13.4% including an unfavorable 0.4%
impact from exchange rate.
The adjusted gross margin ratio was 60.6%, up 230 basis points from the prior year. The ratio reflects improving
operating performance across several businesses including vascular, pharmaceuticals, diabetes care and diagnostics.
We also had strong investment spending in the quarter, including the contribution from the Solvay Pharmaceuticals
acquisition. Ongoing R&D investment was nearly 10% of sales, reflecting continued progress in our broad-based
pipeline. This includes opportunities in medical devices and nutritionals as well as promising clinical programs in
HCV, oncology, chronic kidney disease and neuroscience.
Overall, as we look at 2010, we delivered double-digit ongoing EPS growth despite a number of factors that impacted
our industry. We improved our competitive position in emerging markets and added to our late-stage pipeline and are
taking actions to improve the overall efficiency of the company while continuing to invest in the business to drive
future growth.

Today, we issued 2011 ongoing earnings per share guidance of $4.54 to $4.64. As Miles noted, this reflects another
year of double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range. Before I get into the specifics of guidance for the year, let me
discuss some of the factors that have influenced our outlook for 2011. This includes a number of environmental factors
that are impacting the industry around the world.
As we outlined last year after the passage of U.S. health care reform, there are new aspects of the bill that will become
effective in 2011 for all pharmaceutical companies. For Abbott specifically, these represent an incremental cost of more
than $200 million in 2011. This is in addition to more than $200 million in increased rebates resulting from the bill that
were implemented in 2010.
The new aspects of the bill for 2011 include the pharmaceutical industry fee and additional rebates related to the
Medicare Part D donut hole. In accordance with industry accounting guidance, the pharma fee must be recorded as an
SG&A expense. Additional costs associated with the Medicare donut hole will be recorded as reduction to net sales in
the U.S. pharma business.
Our 2011 outlook also reflects the carryover impact on pharmaceutical pricing from the European austerity measures
implemented last year and an estimate of actions anticipated in 2011. As you know, significant actions taken by several
European countries largely occurred in the second half of last year. So there's an incremental impact in 2011. Our
forecast of the combined incremental 2011 impact of these 2010 and 2011 pricing actions exceeds $250 million.
Our 2011 guidance assumes that we continue the recovery in our U.S. nutritionals business that we have seen in recent
weeks following the recall last year. Inventories in the distribution channel are near normal levels. The recall will create
difficult sales comparisons for this business in the first half of 2011 as John will discuss in a few minutes.
And finally, as you know, Abbott has historically reported the quarterly results of our international businesses on a
one-month lag. We will be eliminating the one-month lag beginning in 2011 resulting in more timely reporting of
international results as well as certain internal efficiencies. As you are aware, in 2010, our reported international results
reflected the 12-month ended November 30. For 2011, our international results will reflect the 12-month ended
December 31. We do not expect any material variations in comparisons of sales and ongoing results to the prior year
due to this change.
So with these factors and assumptions in mind, let's turn back to our outlook for 2011. Regarding sales in 2011, we
expect high single-digit growth including the contributions from the acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals which
closed in February, 2010 and Piramal Healthcare Solutions which closed in September, 2010. This is particularly strong
growth given the expectations I mentioned for the impacts of U.S. health care reform, European pricing and our U.S.
nutritionals business in the first half. We are assuming a neutral impact from foreign exchange on full-year 2011 sales.
Also for 2011, we're forecasting adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 2010 which was 60.2%, reflecting
underlying favorable product mix and efficiency initiatives partially offset by the impacts from U.S. health care reform
and European pricing measures. We're forecasting continuing strong investments in R&D to drive long-term growth
with R&D up around 10% of sales.
We forecast SG&A at somewhat above 27% of sales. This reflects some SG&A leverage despite our continued
investment in emerging markets infrastructure across the businesses and the negative impact of the pharma fee
associated with U.S. healthcare reform which is inflating SG&A growth over 2010, as I mentioned earlier.
We're forecasting net interest expense of approximately $475 million in 2011 and we're not forecasting share
repurchases in 2011 as we plan to build additional liquidity this year. Now let's turn to our quarterly earnings outlook.
We're forecasting quarterly ongoing EPS growth in 2011 that's fairly consistent with our full-year growth guidance of
approximately 10% at the mid-point of the range. Today, for the first time, we're providing first quarter ongoing EPS
guidance of $0.88 to $0.90, the mid-point of which would reflect double-digit growth. We're forecasting specified
items for the first quarter of approximately $0.32 per share, primarily associated with acquisition integration, cost
reduction initiatives and in process R&D related to the Reata collaboration.

We're forecasting mid-teens sales growth in the first quarter, including the impact of the Solvay and Piramal
acquisitions. We've assumed an unfavorable impact of exchange on sales of approximately 1% and a gross margin ratio
approaching 60% in the first quarter.
We forecasted tax rate at 15.5 to 16% in the first quarter. As a reminder in the first quarter, we expect to begin
reporting the results of our new division, Established Products or EPD, in our earnings news releases. Our
pharmaceutical business will be reported in two parts. Our Patented Products business, with its U.S. and ex-U.S.
divisions and EPD, which will be focused on ex-U.S. sales of branded generic products.
So in summary, our global diversified business strategy is continuing to deliver sustainable results. In 2010, we
achieved our key financial goals and continued to shape Abbott for the long term. Our diversified business mix,
market-leading products within our core franchises and the strategic actions we've taken all provide a strong foundation
from which we expect to continue to grow in 2011 and beyond.
With that, let's turn to the business operating highlights. John?
John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs
Thanks, Tom. This morning, I'll review the quarterly performance of our major business segments: pharmaceuticals,
medical devices, diagnostics and nutritionals.
Let me start with our global pharmaceutical business, where worldwide reported sales in the quarter increased more
than 22% driven by 30% growth in our international pharmaceuticals business and more than 14% growth in our U.S.
business. For the full year 2010, worldwide reported sales increased more than 20%. Sales included the contribution
from the Solvay Pharmaceuticals acquisition, which closed in February, and the Piramal Healthcare Solutions
acquisition, which closed in September.
In our proprietary pharmaceuticals business, global HUMIRA operational sales, which excludes the impact of foreign
exchange, increased more than 15% in the quarter. Performance was driven by strong international operational sales
growth of more than 17% and U.S. sales drove up more than 13%. Full-year global sales increased 19% which was in
line with our expectations.
Internationally, strong double-digit market growth continues in the major European countries where HUMIRA holds
the number one share position and HUMIRA growth in the U.S. continues to outpace the overall market. We're
continuing our development efforts with HUMIRA as well, including the study of new indications and other product
enhancements.
To that end, we recently submitted our U.S. regulatory application for ulcerative colitis and we're expecting to submit
our application in Europe shortly and we're evaluating other incremental applications currently in mid to late-stage
development. We also continue to launch HUMIRA indications into new countries around the world, including the
recent approval for our ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease indications in Japan.
HUMIRA clinical data continues to compare favorably versus existing agents or potential new competitors. At the
recent ACR, or American College of Rheumatology meeting, we presented data across the rheumatology indications,
including long-term radiographic inhibition data. Based on an outstanding clinical profile across our full range of
indications, more than 13 years of clinical experience, as well as our strong managed care standing, we're well
positioned for continued growth with HUMIRA. To that end, our full-year 2011 forecast, we expect global HUMIRA
reported sales growth in the low teens.
Moving on to our lipid franchise, where sales of Niaspan, our HDL raising therapy, were $286 million in the quarter
and that's up nearly 13% and significantly outpacing the growth of the overall lipid market. Full-year Niaspan sales
were more than $921 million. Our focus on high-risk patients as well as the HALTS data, which showed significant
benefit in this patient population, has driven market share growth over the past year. So in 2011, we expect another
year of double-digit growth for Niaspan.

Global Trilipix/TriCor sales in the quarter increased more than 19%, including the international contribution from
Solvay. In the U.S., sales were flat. In 2011, we expect a modest decline for TriCor/Trilipix in the U.S., and
internationally we expect sales of nearly $300 million.
U.S. sales of two key products that we picked up from Solvay, AndroGel and CREON were $216 million and $92
million, respectively. AndroGel holds the number one share position in the testosterone replacement market, which is
an attractive category where growth is being driven by increasing diagnosis and treatment of low testosterone. CREON
also maintains a leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market and over the past year, we've captured significant
market share in the U.S.
U.S. sales of Synthroid remain strong at $450 million for the full year and we expect continued steady growth in 2011.
As you may be aware, last year CMS finalized the policy regarding the bundled payment rate for end-stage rental
disease treatment including certain drugs used as part of the therapy. As a result, rental care providers have sought
significant price reductions for impacted drugs and that includes Zemplar. Based upon the latest pricing and resulting
contracts for 2011, we're expecting U.S. Zemplar sales this year of approximately $250 million. This is a reduction of
more than $200 million versus the prior year and that's been incorporated into our 2011 guidance.
In terms of our 2011 outlook for U.S. pharmaceuticals overall, we expect mid to high single digit growth. In our total
international pharmaceutical business, which includes both our proprietary business, as well as our new Established
Products Division, we expect low double digit growth, including the partial year contributions of Solvay and Piramal.
As discussed, we'll report sales from EPD this year beginning with first quarter earnings. We continue to expect sales
for this new division to be approximately $5 billion in full-year 2011.
Let me now turn to our medical devices business, where our vascular business delivered very strong performance in the
fourth quarter, particularly in international markets, where growth was robust. Worldwide reported sales increased
nearly 14% in vascular and international vascular sales grew 37% driven by the continued success of our Drug-Eluting
Stents [DES] XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME. Global DES franchise sales in the quarter were approximately $470
million and that's up 25% from a year ago.
We continue to expand our position with the number one drug-eluting stent globally. In international markets, which
now account for 60% of our DES business, XIENCE's PRIME continues to capture share. In Europe, for example,
XIENCE PRIME has driven an approximate 8 share point gain for Abbott's total DES franchise since its launch while
our next closest competitor has lost between 8 and 10 share points. We also recently expanded our XIENCE PRIME
indication in Europe for Critical Limb Ischemia, or CLI. CLI is the most advanced form of peripheral artery disease
and can ultimately lead to limb amputation.
XIENCE also maintains its leadership position in Japan with total XIENCE share in the 45 to 50% range. Japan is the
second largest DES market, as you know, with market sales of 500 to $600 million annually.
And in the U.S., XIENCE maintained market share leadership with more than 30% share in the fourth quarter. Also in
the U.S., PCI volume in the fourth quarter was down modestly versus the prior year and DES penetration remained in
the high 70s.
As Miles mentioned, earlier this month we marked the CE mark approval of ABSORB in Europe. ABSORB is the
world's first drug-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold, or BVS device. It restores blood flow by opening a clogged
vessel and providing support to the vessel until the vessel dissolves completely, leaving patients with a treated vessel
free of a permanent metallic implant.
We believe ABSORB will change the way coronary artery disease is treated in the future. ABSORB will be made
available in select sizes to a limited number of centers in Europe later this year and into 2012. This will enable
physicians in these centers to increase their clinical experience with the technology and to continue to develop the
therapy. A full-scale European commercial launch of ABSORB with a broad size matrix is planned by the second half
of 2012 and we expect to begin our global trial for U.S. approval later this year.

We continue to broaden our product offerings in other vascular segments as well. Our next generation balloon, TREK,
is picking up share since its launch last year in Europe as more physicians are discovering its best-in-class deliverability
and broad size matrix. We plan to launch TREK in a range of sizes in the U.S. and Japan here early in 2011.
And regarding our carotid business, today, an FDA panel is reviewing CREST clinical trial data as part of our
submission to expand our indication for our Acculink carotid stent system. The CREST data demonstrated that carotid
stenting was equally safe and effective as surgery in both patients at standard risk for surgery as well as those who are
at high risk for surgery. Today, Acculink is the only indicated – is only indicated for high risk patients.
So looking ahead to 2011 in our global vascular business, we expect low to mid-single digit reported sales growth with
stronger growth expected in the first quarter.
Turning to our global diabetes business, worldwide reported sales were up nearly 2% in the quarter. We continue to
grow our retail prescription share through expanded consumer outreach and patient education. In addition in 2010, we
significantly improved the profitability of our diabetes care business as a result of a more favorable product mix and
operating cost reductions. And we expect continued margin improvement in this year, 2011. Looking ahead to 2011 in
our global diabetes business, we expect low to mid-single digit revenue growth.
Let me move on to vision care and AMO where worldwide reported sales were $280 million in the quarter and more
than $1 billion for the full year 2010. As a reminder, as we noted on our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call, we
transitioned AMO to a calendar reporting structure in 2009, so fourth quarter 2009 results included an additional month
of international sales. Adjusting for this, international sales were up double digits this quarter. U.S. sales were up nearly
7% in the quarter as we continue to gain momentum with our Tecnis Multifocal 1-Piece IOL and our new RevitaLens
contact lens solution. As we look ahead to the full year 2011, we expect high single digit reported sales growth for
AMO.
In worldwide diagnostics, reported sales were up 4% this quarter with U.S. diagnostic sales up more than 8%. In core
laboratory diagnostics, which includes amino chemistry and hematology, reported global sales were up 1%. We
continue to expand our presence in emerging markets. In China, sales were up more than 50% as we introduced new
customers to our leading ARCHITECT systems.
As Miles mentioned, we continue to improve the profitability and cash flow of this business as well, while expanding
the menu of our leading ARCHITECT system. In the fourth quarter, we introduced a new assay in Europe to measure
levels of vitamin D in blood, which will help physicians better treat a number of conditions, including low bone
density. We also have a number of test launches planned for 2011.
In our molecular business, reported sales were up 21% driven by our M2000 platform and its expanding test menu. In
the U.S., we have seen steady uptake of our new Abbott RealTime HPV assay. The assay runs on our M2000 system
and is intended to help manage care for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection undergoing anti-viral therapy. We're
on track to submit a PMA filing for a companion diagnostic to an oral cancer therapy on the market for non-small cell
lung cancer in the first half. And we expect to place our 1,000th M2000 instrument this year.
In our point of care business, reported sales were up nearly 19% driven by the continued success of our CHEM 8 test
and cardiac menu. So as we look ahead to the full-year 2011 in our worldwide diagnostic business, we expect
mid-single digit sales growth.
Turning now to our worldwide nutritional business, where reported sales – global seas were flat in the fourth quarter.
As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the product recall we announced last September. International nutritional
sales were up nearly 8% in line with our previous forecast.
In the United States, Abbott Nutrition continues to maintain its strong market position in both infant formula and adult
nutritionals. In 2010, we launched several new product innovations, including PediaSure SideKicks and newly
reformulated Ensure shakes that offer a variety of nutrient blends to address key health needs, including immune health
and muscle and bone strength.

Since our last earnings call we have made significant progress in our Similac recall recovery efforts. Today, as Tom
said, our inventory is near normal operating levels. Since the initial recall in September, Similac has maintained its
number one hospital share position as well. As a result of the recall, there will be a difficult comparison for this
business in the first half of 2011, when we expect U.S. sales to be down in the mid-single digits. We expect to recapture
share over the course of the year.
Worldwide sales for adult nutritionals including Ensure and Glucerna grew 8% in the fourth quarter. Our Ensure
product line with Revigor, a proprietary ingredient, continues to do well. Revigor helps to rebuild muscle mass lost
naturally with age. Abbott will continue to deliver product enhancements to better meet the changing nutritional needs
of the baby boomers.
So as we look ahead to the full-year 2011 in our global nutritionals business, we're forecasting a modest decline in our
U.S. business as we regain share in infant nutritionals. We expect double digit growth for our international business
once again.
Turning to our broad-based pipeline, since Miles spent time this morning discussing many of the compounds and
technologies in the portfolio, let me spend a few minutes outlining some of the milestones we expect to occur this year.
We've taken significant strategic actions to add to and advance our pipeline and we expect a good deal of activity.
Starting with new product launches and approvals, as you know, we recently received CE mark for ABSORB, also U.S.
clearance for our complete RevitaLens solution and approval for our Crohn's and AS indication for HUMIRA in Japan,
so we're in various stages of launch for each of these three products. We also expect to launch our next generation
TREK balloon in the U.S. and Japan in the coming weeks.
We're also on track for our U.S. clearance of our small vessel DES, XIENCE Nano, during the second half of this year.
We continue to expect a panel for MitraClip this year. As I mentioned, we also recently submitted our U.S. regulatory
application for HUMIRA in ulcerative colitis and we expect a decision on that later this year.
In addition, this year we expect U.S. decisions on several new formulations of existing pharmaceutical products,
including Lupron 6-month Depot and AndroGel 1.62 and our next generation IOL, Synchrony, remains under FDA
review.
As previously announced, we discontinued our joint collaboration for the development CERTRIAD and we withdrew
our regulatory applications for ABT-874, our IL-12/IL-23 biologic for psoriasis.
Regarding CERTRIAD, Abbott and AstraZeneca made the joint decision to end the collaboration due to the
commercial attractiveness of the product based on regulatory feedback and delays.
Regarding ABT-874, following feedback from regulatory authorities indicating the need for further analysis, including
the potential for additional studies, we withdrew our applications and are evaluating next steps including possible
resubmission at a later date.
Moving on to new clinical trial starts, we expect to start a global Phase III study of our CKD compound, bardoxolone
in the coming months. During the first half, we expect to initiate the Phase III program for elotuzumab with our partner
and we're working with regulatory authorities on next steps on elagolix, including potential initiation of a Phase III
program. As Miles indicated, our HCV program is progressing rapidly and we expect to begin a number of combination
trials this year. And we expect to begin our global study of ABSORB by year end which we plan to use for U.S.
approval.
And finally, in terms of key data presentations upcoming, we expect the following: additional Phase II data on our
protease inhibitor ABT-450 at the EASL meeting later this quarter and data on our polymerase inhibitors and NS5A
inhibitors as well. Also during the first half, we'll have 52-week results from our bardoxolone Phase IIb study and
during the second half of this year, we expect to present data from the daclizumab Phase II SELECT trial and long-term
data for XIENCE, ABSORB and MitraClip will be presented at various medical meetings throughout the year. This
includes two-year data from our MitraClip device this spring.

So in summary, we're pleased with the work we completed throughout 2010 to position Abbott for sustainable growth
in what is a difficult environment. And as Miles and Tom mentioned, we expect to again deliver double-digit ongoing
earnings per share growth in 2011.
With that, we will now open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thanks. Good morning, can you hear me okay?
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Great. Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple items and maybe just to start. Tom, can you
just help us with what you think the acquisitions contribute to 2011 revenues and what that means for organic growth?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Overall, again,
we're forecasting high single digit sales growth, around 3% of that is Solvay and Piramal and the rest is organic, so very
solid mid to upper organic growth in 2011. As I mentioned, you know, as we currently view it, the forecast has very –
there's no exchange impact in 2011.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay, thanks. Miles, while we've got you here, can you talk about the sustainability of 10%
earnings growth in your view? There seems to be a bit of a disconnect between how management's looking at its
long-term outlook and how the Street's modeling Abbott as we go out beyond 2011.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I'll tell you, Mike, we target it as a matter of
our investment identity. We've been able to do it on a very consistent basis. As you can see, our investment profile in
R&D and SG&A is up. We have expanding margin, you know, we're not burning any shingles, but we've felt the
impact of health care reform and all the regulatory actions that others have identified, the pricing pressures in Europe
and so forth.
There's an awful lot of pressures on this industry. At the end of the day, you rely on new products. You rely on
geographic expansion. You rely on share gain and you rely on managing, and you know, I think the actions that we
initiated today are part of that. You know, things like health care reform don't come without consequences to a
business, but at the end of the day, you manage all of these things.
I think our investment identity is double-digit grower and I don't see any reason at this point why we would shift away
from that. I think it's harder, a lot harder than it used to be. It's hard to sustain. Obviously a lot of companies in our
industry are finding it very difficult to sustain that, but I think you take care of business and make sure your pipeline is
robust and that you have good growth platforms in a lot of geographic markets and I think we've done that.
With regard to the disconnect with the Street, I don't know how to comment on the sentiment of the Street. I think the
company has consistently delivered against the expectations we've set. That appears to not have been recognized on a
consistent basis by the Street. I don't know how to explain that. You know the sentiment of the Street much better than
I do.
I think if there's a place where, you know, the investment community is disconnected from Abbott, it's in appreciating
the other parts of the business. We tend to get an awful lot of focus on one drug, and you know, it's a wonderful drug
and I think it's doing terrific things for Abbott and it's a fantastic product, but the fact is I think analysts underappreciate
the nutrition business. I think they underappreciate the branded generics or established products business and emerging
markets. I think analysts, in general, are only beginning to learn about those markets in a real depth. I think there are
smaller businesses here, smaller relative to others that are growing at a very rapid rate that have great growth potential

and when I look at models of where the main disconnects are, it's not so much in estimating patented pharma. It's in
estimating the performance of all the other businesses that represent the diversity of Abbott and in particular, in other
geographic markets.
So if I were going to advise analysts where to look for how sustainable is the growth future of Abbott, I would
encourage them to look, not only at the patented pharma pipeline, which I think also is underappreciated, but I would
look at the established products business, nutritionals, the diagnostics, the devices and in particular the geographic
expansion opportunities, because that's where most of the disconnects are, Mike.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: That's helpful. Tom, let me just ask one question. I had a bunch of people kind of ping me
on it in the middle of the call. The first quarter guidance relative to where the Street was at was below the Street. You're
looking for, as you said, a more even cadence of earnings growth over the course of the year. Just anything you can add
to that in your first quarter and the difference between where you guys are coming out and the Street?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Mike, obviously this
is the first time we've provided guidance. As I look at the models in the first quarter, it's clear that they were very, very
inconsistent with what the full-year forecasts that all the analysts were projecting. My only speculation is they really
didn't have any information and to have growth rates far in excess of our full-year growth rate, which is really what the
Street has, is not – it just is not reasonable.
You know, we have got health care reform lapping in the first quarter, we have got European price hitting us in the first
quarter and as John mentioned, the recall in nutrition in the U.S. is going to be a very difficult comparison in the first
half of the year. I think it's a combination of just lack of information by people modeling the quarter and a lack of
understanding of some of these comparable – you know, comparisons to 2010.
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: The other thing I would add, Mike, is
just from an IR perspective, we don't get all the numbers in the first quarter as you know, and the data that we looked at
picked up only eight or nine analysts and some of those had growth rates of 25, 30% and so there was a little bit of
modeling adjustments that had to go on there as well.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Got you. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Thank you, our next question is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Good morning, Miles. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Let me start with a big-picture question. J&J and others have been sounding some pretty somber,
serious notes about the outlook for the economy, pricing, utilization and I think J&J yesterday said lower price is sort
of, "The new reality." It's not going to come back as the economy comes back. I just would be curious your perspective
on where do you think we are in a recovery? Are you more concerned as you look at 2011 and just maybe your
thoughts on incremental pricing utilization pressures.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think J&J and others have characterized it right,
Rick. I think it is a tough environment. I don't expect it to get better. I don't expect the pressures to ease up. I think the
characterization of tougher economy, pressure on utilization, pressure on budgets, pressure on pricing, pressure on
access or the regulatory systems, I think all of those things continue. I would not forecast they get better.
I think the pressure then becomes, do companies know what to do to navigate and adapt to that environment? And I
would tell you that to a varying degree, I think companies are very rational and figure out, you know, what to do to
adapt to run their businesses. I think we've done that really well. I think that our performance over the last several years
and particularly in positioning our company going forward, demonstrate that. Whether that's widely recognized or not,

that's kind of up to you guys to judge.
But, you know, we've seen varying degrees of performance out of the companies in our industry, but I will tell you this
industry has lost a lot of jobs in the United States and overseas. It may continue to do so. Companies will adjust their
cost structures. They will adjust how they market their products. They will adjust where they invest.
But what I don't think companies will do is give up or quit on the obligations they have to investors. Companies will be
rational and we're the same. You know, we know what to do to deliver against the expectations of the investors and the
shareholders that we're responsible for. We know how to change and adapt our business. Some of that is short-term
actions. Some of that is long-term strategic shaping and positioning of the business.
You'll hear a lot of companies talk about the future being in emerging markets. Several of us, not all of us, have
positioned ourselves, I think, very well there, and I hit on that today because I think that it has been underappreciated
where a lot of future growth opportunities are, segments are shifting. I think our U.S.-based investors primarily
understand patented pharma. Don't necessarily understand pharma in an emerging world. Don't understand diagnostics
or other things.
We have an education task there and an information task to inform investors and shareholders and analysts and so forth
more about what we know about those markets, more about what we know about our pipelines. I think all of us as
companies are reshaping our pipelines to product areas where we believe that there is real medical opportunity and
frankly, some prospect of navigating a regulatory system that currently says no more often than yes, and I think that we
will all adapt that way.
We are large companies. The R&D that we invest in is expensive. It's years in the making so that adapting isn't quick. It
takes time, but I think the characterization of other companies who have described the market have characterized it
properly. I think at the end of the day, what differentiates us all is how well we adapt to it and how well we manage to
live up to our shareholders' expectations.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Thanks. Tom, gross margin in 2011, I think if I understood you said maybe a little bit better or
whatever your language was versus 2010, but shouldn't we see some meaningful gross margin improvement? Solvay is
integrated. HUMIRA has continued to grow. Vascular is doing great. Product mix is favorable. What could push gross
margins to the higher end of the range?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Really, the
environment, Rick. It's all the things we talked about. We've got to do all of those things to offset, you know, these
European pricing pressures, which, hopefully, we've had the bulk of them hit and we're going to get back to normal
levels. That is our expectation. This last lapping of U.S. health care reform and you know, some of the comps on
nutrition and things like that are slowing a bit, you know, the rate of our improvement in gross margin but I think we
will see steady progress this year. We do think the ratio will be above 2010 and hopefully, when we get through some
of these transitional things, you know, we can move that a little quicker.
<Q - Rick Wise>: One last one for Miles. Miles, since we've got you on the line, maybe you could just give us your
latest thinking on your portfolio priorities in or out and maybe specifically are you interested in building out the Evalve
business with a TAVI offering?
I am just going to put in a personal note here. Hey, Miles, if you feel like we don't understand the patented pharma
pipeline, let's have a New York pharma analyst day and get the guys out. You know, it's been a long time. I would love
to have that.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm laughing, Rick. I knew would you ask me a
couple questions and I love the fact that you're predictable.
<Q - Rick Wise>: I'm not sure that's a good thing.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I will tell you, back to your original piece of this in
terms of the portfolio, I would say right now, I like the portfolio we hold. I'm always, as I've told new the past, always

aware and I'd like to think that we stay on top of where opportunities may exist for us.
I would say in general right now, I don't see a licensing or M&A environment that's particularly robust. That's okay.
We like the hand we're holding. There's a relatively small handful of things that might appeal to me or us should they
be available at reasonable value and whatever the case may be, but we're happy with the hand we hold and I think right
now, we're putting an awful lot of focus on operating well and in this sort of environment.
While if there were an opportunity, it's probably a good time to take advantage of it, at the same time, I think it's
important to operate really well. Because given all the pressures you highlighted earlier, it's your own execution and
operating well that helps you to navigate it and meet the, you know, sometimes unrealistic expectations of investors,
but whether they're realistic or not, our job is to meet them and I think you have to execute well and operate well on all
the operating aspects of your business and that means for us: integrate the businesses we have, structure our businesses
well, position them well in new markets, execute well in our pipelines and our regulatory efforts and so forth.
That's where we're focused and that means that a lot of activity, you know, on the M&A or other fronts would probably
be less, but as you know, I haven't passed a really good opportunity if there's been a really good opportunity and I think
our track record there speaks for itself. I don't see a lot of that right now out in the marketplace. So I'm focused on our
geographic expansion efforts and our execution and the things you're talking about, margin improvement, etcetera.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Very helpful. New York analyst meeting. Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We'll think about it.
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: Under advisement, Rick.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Lewis>: Well, good morning.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - David Lewis>: I apologize, Miles, but I may have a sentiment, single stock question. Just first starting off on
HUMIRA, I mean, clearly management has a view about the sustainability of HUMIRA that is a little different from
sentiment or consensus. So maybe just you can share with us some of the things people are not appreciating about the
sustainability of the HUMIRA franchise and related to that is if management is correct and HUMIRA is more
sustainable, there's a dramatic amount of underappreciated cash flow from Abbott over the next several years. And
considering it sounds like right now, the M&A environment in your mind is not as robust, could we see some of that
cash flow begin to return to shareholders in the form of an accelerated dividend or increasing buybacks as we get a year
or two out here?
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You know, I will give you a couple things. First of
all, with regard to sentiment on HUMIRA, I don't know that there's anything a company can do to change the sentiment
on a particular product or business or whatever. I can tell you after 12 years in this job that there have been so many
times that I have listened to sentiment and three years later, that sentiment was clearly wrong. I have never seen an
analyst yet that went back and said, "Boy! I was wrong."
I would tell you we're not whistling through the graveyard about any kinds of futures here. We know that some of the
competitive offerings coming will compete. They will have success. They will have some level of success and we also
know it will take them some years to establish themselves to have that success. That's a fact. That's modelable. That's
modelable by us, by them, by you, by any number of people. We know that biosimilars will have some impact on the
product over time.

The question is magnitudes and trajectories, and HUMIRA is a very large product, as you know, and we've obviously
studied all those things very carefully and in a lot of detail. I think that the analyst community or the Street or
investment community sometimes takes a fairly precipitous, sudden look at things and things that things happen very
quickly when they don't, and I think that the trends, whether it be competitive products or biosimilars or other things
that will affect the biologics market will happen less precipitously than what you see happening to an oral solid that is a
primary care drug. The models are not the same. They're not going to be same.
That is not to say there won't be impacts on HUMIRA. There will be. Obviously, HUMIRA's growth will slow. At
some point, it will begin to decline, but it will be a large and robust product because it's a very, very fine product in
terms of what it does. It will be successful for a long time.
That said, it's also our job to replace the sales and profits of that product with others. And that's where I go back to our
pipeline. I think the pipeline is somewhat underappreciated. The biggest difference, I think that we may have with the
Street over the trajectory of HUMIRA is what the shape of that trajectory looks like and over how many years and you
know, whether pipeline offerings coming and so forth obviously replace and continue the growth in our patented
pharma business over time.
So I would tell you, I don't think we have taken an unrealistic view of it, but you know, I don't know how to combat
dueling models and dueling projections between what the company thinks and what, you know, what analysts may
think of competitive offerings. I think competitive offerings will be successful. I just don't think that they're going to
be, based on all of our analysis, as immediately successful in such a precipitous manner and I think when you look at
the entire mix of products, whether it's in the coming portfolio or how HUMIRA does or the geographic mix, etcetera, I
don't happen – we don't happen to share Wall Street's view.
The only unfortunate thing of that is we'll only be right once we've been right which is years out and if investors choose
to believe otherwise, well, they're going to miss a company that keeps steadily growing double digits. I can't say how
many times I've had people project we couldn't keep doing this and it's not smoke and mirrors and it's not magic, we
manage. And you know, I guess we can do a better job communicating and explaining.
But you know, at this point, I'd say I think a lot of the fears around HUMIRA have been overblown. It will face
competition. It will decline at some point. The rate and timing of that will be, I believe, different than what has been
projected and beyond that, there's an awful lot of very strong and powerful things coming in our pipeline to sustain our
growth. So, you know, I think we've managed it.
What was the second half of your question, David?
<Q - David Lewis>: Sorry, Miles, just on cash flow. To the extent that if you are correct and that trajectory is slower
from a competitive perspective, the amount of cash that will generate for HUMIRA is fairly dramatic the next several
years. The question is, what will you do with that cash?
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we're going to generate a lot of cash and you'd
be right. We will generate a lot of cash and we've obviously been a fairly steady dividend producer and we've allocated
our cash, I think, pretty well over time, whether it be share buyback or M&A activity or whatever it may be. We are
fortunate that we have very strong cash flow and the last several years, we have exceeded the projections and frankly,
even our own plans for cash flow, as we did again this last year.
So, Tom, do you want to comment on cash flow a little bit and then – obviously, we're not going to project too
accurately for David what he wants us to project.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: We have been
growing cash flow very nicely, as we mentioned, well in excess of $8 billion in 2010. Very nice increase over 2009 and
I think to echo Miles, I mean, this balanced approach over the years, we've had steady dividend increases for 38 years.
We have a very strong dividend payout. We do have a – we've done share re-purchase over the years and from time to
time we build cash to maintain strategic flexibility and in order to execute on the M&A, which I think most people
would agree we've done an outstanding job on.

And there will be also be some investment in the business, organic, as Miles mentioned, in terms of emerging markets
investment and this balanced approach has served us well and I think over time as the business grows and improves and
cash flow goes up, we'll continue to apply that.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: David, the one thing I would add to this, to your
question and I realize, you know, at the end of the day, it's how much you can model and how much you can analyze
whether it's HUMIRA or cash flows or the rest of the businesses or anything else. The one thing I would suggest that is
worth something here is track record. If you look at the track record of performance of the company and its
management, we are consistently delivering, and whether we projected it for you well enough in advance, I can't say.
But up to now, whether it's been capital allocation or the performance with our products and so forth, I think we've
consistently delivered, so to the extent that track record matters and I would say that's worth a little something looking
forward even if we differ on our models.
<Q - David Lewis>: Okay, thanks very much, Miles. I will jump back in queue.

Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn Novarro>: Thanks, good morning, guys.
<A>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Novarro>: Two questions for Miles. Just one more touching on the longer term outlook. Some of the
concerns that I hear center around 2012 because in 2012 TriCor will likely face generics and the PROMUS contribution
will be less. I'm wondering, Miles, can you address the challenges and potential offsets and you can still grow earnings
double digits with those two headwinds?
And the second question I have, Miles is regarding the...
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Glenn, can we take them one at a time or I won't
even remember it?
<Q - Glenn Novarro>: Okay, sure.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. I'd tell you first of all with regard to
PROMUS, we're doing our best every day to take PROMUS with XIENCE. So I'm not sure that I would consider that a
huge issue there. It's our objective to make XIENCE number one and it is.
So let me come back to the headwinds in 2012. Yes, we obviously face some things going generic, but as a portion of
the entire company, I don't want to minimize the magnitude of any given product, you know, it will be significant, but
we've navigated that in the past. We went through that with Depakote when it went generic and nobody noticed
because the variety of growth sources that we rely on, whether they be new products or geographic expansion or
anything else, are significant.
I would tell you that in general, whether it's sales growth, geographic expansion or margin expansion, at this point,
now, barring what I don't know, which is environmental to a large degree, I have not changed our target in terms of
2012, which always starts with double digit, bottom line. I haven't seen any reason yet to back off of double-digit
earnings as a target for 2012 and I can tell you that after 2010, which I think was one of the most difficult and
challenging years for this company and for all the companies in our industry because health care reform was not trivial.
It was a huge impact on all companies in our business, negatively, and the European pricing pressures that all of us as
multinationals experienced in Europe, regulatory issues, any number of things, devaluations in particular countries, you
name it, recalls, products removed from the market. If you look across the industry, we all experienced these things.

The cumulative effect of all of those was significant, and I emphasize that with a capital S, and we're all adjusting and
adapting to it. Having said that, we're forecasting double-digit growth for 2011, and at this point, barring the
unforeseen, I'm targeting it again for 2012.
<Q - Glenn Novarro>: Thank you, very helpful. My second question was on the lipid franchise. CERTRIAD has gone
away. TriCor will face generics next year. Does the company remain focused on the lipid franchise longer term, or does
this become de-emphasized beyond 2012? Thanks
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's a mature product area. It becomes de-emphasized
beyond 2012 because, frankly, the environment broadly defined is not supportive of a lot of innovation there. I think
that's how I would put it.
<Q - Glenn Novarro>: Okay, great. Thank you, Miles.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Miles, I just wanted to continue along the questioning that I think Rick began on,
portfolio strategy. I know you like your portfolio and your portfolio businesses have clearly served you very well with
respect to revenue and earnings growth. But you are not in any way getting paid for your diversified earnings stream.
I'm just wondering, when you were asked the question, you focused on potential for licensing deals, M&A, but you
didn't talk about the potential to spin off or sell some of these businesses for which you are not getting any credit for,
and just, you know, one example is your nutritionals business. Obviously, if you slapped on a Mead Johnson multiple, I
would presume that you would capture far more value for that business than you are right now. So I mean that is one
strategy that you might want to consider if you think the Street isn't appreciating your non-pharma assets. I'm
wondering if you can just comment on that.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't make the strategic decisions for the company
based on transactions the Street might like to see. I think the nutritional business is an incredibly strong and attractive
business. I think it's my job, our job to grow the business and to educate our investors about the value of that business. I
think that it is a long-term, strategic growth driver, margin driver and cash flow contributor and it will remain part of
Abbott. I think that one of the things that we sort of suffer from is the success of HUMIRA. The more successful it is,
which I like, the more worried others get and the more people focus on, "Gee, this one product seems to dominate a lot
of your performance."
I think that it's easy then for people not to pay a lot of attention to the other pieces of business. While it might be easy
for investors to say, "Gee, pure play companies are a lot easier for us to value," etcetera, that is not what the identity or
strategy of this company has been. One of the reasons that we can navigate the environment we are is because of the
variety of sources of sales and/or growth that we have whether it be devices or geography or whatever.
If you look at the history of this company, there was a time when diagnostics or hospital products or any number of
other things were the growth drivers and pharma wasn't a big deal. You know, pharma became a big part of this
company in the last ten years. Before that, it really wasn't. And I take a longer term view of the company, rather than a
short-term one to two-year or three-year view. We have held our value far better than most of the companies in our
industry over the last decade. Many of them have lost two-thirds of their value as PEs have collapsed and we have not
lost our value.
Now we've grown. We've almost quadrupled the size of the company. We held our value. It doesn't feel particularly
good to say it held, but it's better than the performance of most of our industry in terms of value. So I have to take the
view in the long term as well. And because of the R&D lifecycles in pharma and because of the time it takes to
establish products or to establish presence and leadership positions in geographic markets, you can't look at it in one,

two and three-year chunks. You have got to look at it in 5, 10 and 15-year chunks.
We wouldn't be the leaders globally in the vascular device business if not for the fact that, you know, Rick Gonzalez
and I started looking at that 12 years ago and putting the pieces in place to position ourselves for the opportunities
we've had. You don't have the opportunities you have in pharma without looking out 10 or 12 years at where you're
going to put your investments and going through those things in the pipeline.
I don't think you are going to be leaders in emerging market by suddenly deciding to go there once they're established.
You have to put your footprint in place early and it's got to be a big footprint and you have to put the infrastructure in
place, the distribution, etcetera and the man power, and they pay off longer term and as I have explained on previous
calls, we – in putting ourselves into emerging markets in the fundamental way that we have and India being a prime
example, that's an investment that we expect to pay off in a 5 to 10-year timeframe and beyond, not in the next five.
So, while it might be reassuring to investors to break up the company or spin pieces or sell pieces, I think that flies in
the face of the overall longer term view of the company, which is, we are a broad multinational, diverse company with
a broad source of or group of sources of income and cash flow and that's what's allowed us to thrive and do as well as
we have over the last 10 to 12 years. I don't think that's been wrong.
I think that's been proven to be right because so much of our industry has been merged out of existence in some fashion
or another or struggled with real volatility in terms of their ability to manage sustainability and stability in their
businesses. So while I think you're right to criticize how well we've explained or communicated the roles or the
contributions of those other businesses in our portfolio, I don't think the answer is necessarily to separate them or spin
them off.
I have shown in the past that where I think the situation is right and the circumstances are right, I will do that. I did that
with hospital products and Hospira, that's been a terrific, successful spinoff. At one point, I thought it was correct to
sell our diagnostic business. In retrospect, I'm glad we didn't because this year diagnostics turned in its highest profits
and highest cash flow ever in its history and is doing extremely well.
So I take your point but I think the portfolio, Jami, is actually correct. I think that in separating EPD or emerging
markets business there from patented pharma, we really have two very distinctly different pharma businesses and I
think that the growth that will be driven out of EPD is a very different kind of growth and profit from what is driven out
of our patented pharma business.
So I think we've got to do a better job of explaining where we see these businesses going, how we see them shaping
over time. I think all people are concerned about the long-term sustainability of the patented pharma business because,
frankly, it's not a very supportive environment out there in the Western developed economies for the kind of innovation
that patented pharma companies do.
In our case, that means we not only try to pay attention to what we're doing in the patented pharma business but we
must also pay a lot of attention to the other growth sources in the company that are not patented pharma.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Miles, I take that as a no.
[Laughter].

soapbox and explain, specifically with regard to the JAK-3 inhibitors, like mid-decade or so, how you scale that threat
relative to your current RA and psoriatic arthritis franchise with HUMIRA?
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm not quite sure I understand the question, Bruce.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: You know, so, like, in our models, the U.S., the RA, psoriatic arthritis market in 2015 is going to
be about $9 billion. How much of an impact would the JAK-3s reasonably expected to have on the HUMIRA franchise
in that timeframe?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: You know – this is
Tom. We have been talking to some investors...
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I was going to say, ask Pfizer.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: We have been talking
to some investors lately and just to put this in perspective and you can never totally count on analyst forecasts,
obviously, but if you go out to 2015, if you were just to take the JAK compound from Pfizer and assume it gets through
the regulatory process, which obviously these days is no slam dunk, you know, the forecasts for that on average were
around $1 billion in 2015.
To put it in perspective, you know, we've had a lot of competition in the RA, in the biologic space. A lot of products
have come in and gotten very little market share because it's really the big three products have tended to continue to
maintain the majority of the share in these markets, and so, you know, this would be another competitor but if you
believe those forecasts, you believe $1 billion dollars and you look at Abbott's global market share in this space of
around 25%, that would say in 2015, on a multibillion dollar product, and obviously in 2011, we're forecasting, you
know, well in excess of $7 billion for this product given our growth guidance today, you know, that's around $250
million of competitive impact on this product out that far, and that's the middle of a decade.
So I do think that, you know, obviously, there's been, I think, a bit of an emotional reaction, perhaps not totally
consistent with the forecast in terms of what it means. And to Miles' point, we have so many other things going on and
underappreciated growth opportunities that that is a really minimal impact out that far. So hopefully that puts in
perspective a little bit about this one product still in Phase III, not approved, could potentially impact the market.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: That's great, and one of the products – I was very impressed with the bardoxolone results, and
you know one of the questions that people have raised is, you know, like with inotropes and cardiac failure, are you
kind of burning out the kidney? Can you speak to that? Also, your scaling of the potential of a drug like that in ex-U.S.
markets?
<A - Larry Peepo>: I haven't heard anything, Bruce. This is Larry, regarding your concern. From what we've seen thus
far in the Phase II data and certainly we'll see more of that Phase II data here, the 52-week data later this year. We
haven't seen anything, you know, of that nature. In fact, obviously the efficacy has been terrific and so has the safety
profile of the drug. As we look at the geographies that we have rights to with bardoxolone, you know that chronic
kidney disease is a significant drain on all of the medical systems and really a significant cost to all the worldwide
healthcare systems and clearly, dialysis is about a $75,000 a year process. If you can forestall and/or eliminate that
need, that's a considerable amount of savings and you know, as we look at the model, again for our geographies, which
is ex-U.S. excluding some of the Asian markets, we have a significant profile of this product easily exceeding $1
billion in peak year just for our geographies.

<Q - Catherine Arnold>: Thanks, everyone. I wanted to ask you guys if you could talk about Piramal on a couple of
points. You have given guidance that the business in India should achieve about $2.5 billion by 2020, and I'm
wondering if we should be thinking about that as a very front-loaded growth curve. If you can comment on that first,
then I have a couple follow-ups.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: This is Tom. We were
very much on track with our expectations for the Piramal acquisition as we put the 2011 forecast together and with a
market that's growing 20-ish percent or a business we think is going to grow 20-ish percent and as Miles indicated, the
payoff for this really is in the second five years of a 10-year timeframe and obviously at that type of growth rate, you
know, you're going to see the majority of the growth in the back period, but in the early years, off of, you know, a
smaller base, it's roughly a $0.5 billion business. At 20% a year, that gives you an idea of the type of growth we expect
out of this over the next two, three, four years.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, just to correct that, Catherine, the business is
actually a little bigger than that when you factor in all the pieces of the business. That was just Piramal. Abbott has a lot
more pharma business in India beyond that from Solvay, Knoll and Abbott legacy business. So you look at the growth
rate on top of India for that business, it's a fairly steady growth rate. It doesn't all happen in a hockey stick at the end. It
doesn't all happen right at the beginning either. It's a fairly steady growth rate driven by market expansion.
<Q - Catherine Arnold>: With that, can you quantify or at least directionally give us a sense for how much of your
Indian business is Piramal versus Solvay versus Abbott?
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's all Abbott now.
<Q - Catherine Arnold>: Of course. I think you said that Piramal was around $400 million
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Last year.
<Q - Catherine Arnold>: Yeah, so I'm thinking about the base and taking the base and getting the 2.5 billion and that
might be something that is not well understood and projections in the models, as per previous conversations...
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You may be right, because we haven't given a lot of
visibility to the various pieces of that and as we integrate it, that's a good point. We'll take that as advice to explain, not
just India but frankly our position in the significant emerging markets that we're targeting and I understand it would
probably be easier for you to either understand it or model it if we could characterize what's well established, in place,
etcetera, what's integrated and what is new product, etcetera and what's coming. I assume that's your point.
<Q - Catherine Arnold>: It is.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Several hundred
million dollars on top of the Piramal base there.
<Q - Catherine Arnold>: So Piramal is maybe slightly over half?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: I think that's fair.
<Q - Catherine Arnold>: Okay, and then my last question is when Piramal reported recently, they had disclosed their
discontinued operations and there was a pretty big reduction in net income and one of the key products, Phensedyl, I
just wonder, I assume that it's some kind of weird inventory thing or something of a one-time nature. Could you
elaborate on that?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, they reported
their quarter through the close date, which was in early September. So you were looking at, you know, a partial quarter
for them. I know that caused some confusion in the fall and tried to clear that up with folks as questions came in, but
again, it was more of a partial quarter concept going on for them in their reporting.
<Q - Catherine Arnold>: So their quarter ended September 30 wasn't a full quarter?

Thank you, our final question is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Charles Butler>: Thanks very much and sticking with the theme on being misunderstood, if we stay with
emerging markets, one of the areas that I think everyone's puzzled about is really what the gross margins that get
returned to the total business might be and if, in fact, you look at the total business and you make the observation that
margins, at least on the gross side stay, you know, roughly flat or even move higher as you alluded to this year and I
assume you will allude to in '12, the argument becomes given the growth in those markets, how is, in fact that possible?
And connecting those dots, if you will, on the margin side can help us understand the value – or the greater value
outside of volume and revenue, for the entire EM business. Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Tony, we'll take a crack at it. I'll give you some
background. First of all, it depends on the business and if we take pharma first because it's a branded generic business
and a branded business with a breadth of the product line and the offering is different than what I would call a
commodity generic business, the profitability of the business tends to be considerably higher and the gross margin of
the business tends to be consistent with the kinds of gross margins we see in other Abbott businesses.
That's true in pharma. That's true in nutrition and those are the two single biggest growth drivers and we're selective
about how we compete with our other products. I would tell you that in the base core of whether – pharma, in
particular, costs are considerably lower in that business, which contributes to that profile when you compare it to a
patented or developed market business. So the cost structure, infrastructure, a whole lot of things are commensurate
with the locale of the business, the kind of business it is, where we manufacture, where we source, etcetera, and that's a
fundamental part of the business. It's one of the reasons why we separate the business completely from our patented
pharma operations, in R&D, manufacturing, regulatory sales, you name it. It's just got its own independent cost
structure and so on.
Similarly, we are moving in the same fashion with our nutrition business. But we enjoy pricing in a lot of these
emerging markets, comparable to the U.S. and therefore profitability comparable to the U.S. And then we're very
selective about the remainder of the businesses. I would tell you that while the – perhaps the historic notion has been
that these are low-margin businesses, no, they're not. They're low cost and healthy margin and you have to be selective
about where you compete.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: The only thing I
would add there, Tony, is, you know, certainly below the gross margin level, these are businesses that require over
time, as Miles indicated based on the lower cost structure and just the nature of the markets, lower R&D and SG&A
commitments and so the op margin on these businesses are very healthy
<A - Miles D. White, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me give you an example. In India the prices on a
number of our products are very, very low. And yet the margins on those products are still very, very healthy. It doesn't
fit a Western model. It's a different model.
<Q - Charles Butler>: Thanks a lot, Miles. Thank you, Tom.
