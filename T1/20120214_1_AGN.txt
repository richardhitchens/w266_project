With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Patty. And good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2011 was an extraordinary year for
Watson. We continued to execute on our strategy for growth and ended the year with a number of important
accomplishments which will provide a solid foundation for Watson as we continue our growth trajectory. But first,
looking to the fourth quarter of 2011, we delivered record growth and profitability with net revenues up 62% and
non-GAAP earnings per share up 90% to $1.77. Adjusted EBITDA increased 78% to $393 million. Excluding the
launch of generic Lipitor, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.13, up 22% from last year.
I would now like to highlight a few of our accomplishments in 2011. In our Global Generics business, net revenues
increased 44% from the prior year. In the U.S., we launched 16 new products. The most important launch of the year
was generic Concerta, which we launched in May. We expect this product to remain a strong contributor to Watson's
growth and profitability. Additionally, our launch of the authorized generic Lipitor on November 30 represented an
important accomplishment for our Generics business and the importance of an integrated supply chain.
We expanded outside the U.S. through the launch of more than 180 new products and had solid execution in our key
markets around the world. We also strengthened our presence and expanded our capabilities in Europe through the
acquisition of Specifar.
Our Global Brands business continues to grow. We added new products to our portfolio, Generess Fe and Androderm
two-milligram and four-milligram. We continued to see strong sales of key promoted products including RAPAFLO,
GELNIQUE, and CRINONE. We took steps to expand our brand business in Canada and recently launched RAPAFLO
and GELNIQUE with our new commercial team.
And our Antares Oxybutynin Gel product received FDA approval and is scheduled to launch in early 2012. We also
announced the collaboration with Amgen to develop and commercialize a portfolio of oncology biosimilars. This

coupled with our continued work on rFSH positions us well to be a major player in the biosimilar space.
Supporting these businesses is our focus on quality and global operational excellence. In 2011, all of our manufacturing
facilities maintained their satisfactory GMP status. During the year, we invested in expanding capacity to 4.5 billion
doses in Goa, India; added laboratory capabilities in Malta; and expanded the capacity of our Salt Lake City facility,
which manufactures patches and gels. The Salt Lake City expansion is on track to be completed this quarter.
Now I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items from the first few weeks of 2012. On January 24, we announced the
acquisition of Ascent Pharmaceuticals in Australia, strengthening our presence in Australia and in Southeast Asia. The
integration is well underway and we are currently focused on evaluating additional synergies across the two
organizations.
Additionally we launched two new products in the U.S., generic LOVENOX and generic Yaz, which further
strengthens our U.S. generics portfolio. Both launches are progressing well.
We also announced the settlement with Mallinckrodt to market a generic version of Exalgo in November of 2013 and a
settlement with Ortho-McNeil-Janssen to launch generic ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO.
We also announced a new global R&D technology center in New Jersey which will support development of generic
pharmaceutical products, in particular, inhalation technology and respiratory products.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd to take us through some of the financial results. Todd?
R. Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul. I will now review our results on a consolidated and divisional basis. Net revenues for the fourth quarter
were $1.545 billion, an increase of 62% over the prior year, reflecting strong growth in all three divisions.
Net revenues for our Global Generics division were $1.172 billion, up 81% year-over-year, which includes sales of
generic Lipitor, the largest product launch in company history [ph] following sales (7:20) of generic Concerta that was
launched in May. The addition of Specifar also contributed to the year-over-year revenue growth.
Sales of extended release products were $385 million, up 101% year-over-year on sales of generic Concerta. Sales of
oral contraceptives were $95 million, down 3% compared to the prior year. Price declines in our base oral contraceptive
franchise were offset in part by the launches of generic SEASONIQUE and Lo SEASONIQUE in the third and fourth
quarter respectively.
Ex U.S. net revenues were $152 million, up 2% from the fourth quarter of last year, the prior year includes $25 million
in revenue received from a development partner, which is excluded from our prior year non-GAAP results. On a
non-GAAP basis, ex U.S. net revenues increased 23% year-over-year, reflecting the acquisition of Specifar and a
number of product launches in certain key markets.
Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was 43.8%, down 6.8 percentage points year-over-year primarily due to
the lower margins on sales of the authorized generic versions of Concerta and Lipitor.
Moving to Global Brands, net revenues were $121 million, up 17% on higher sales of promoted products including
RAPAFLO and CRINONE and new products including Generess Fe. Global Brands' adjusted gross margin was 78.4%,
down 1.9 percentage points due to lower margins on our value brand of Ferrlecit.
Finally, net revenues from our Anda Distribution division were $252 million, up 24% on higher new product launches
compared to the prior year. Anda's adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 14.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior
year.
Turning now to operating expenses, consolidated GAAP research and development for the fourth quarter was $67.2
million, down 32% year-over-year. Our GAAP results for the current year period includes a $13.1 million reduction in
expense due to the revaluation of contingent liabilities associated with our PROCHIEVE product development efforts.

And the prior year includes $24.9 million of additional expense associated with the development milestone payments
and revaluation of contingent liabilities.
On a non-GAAP basis, R&D spending in the fourth quarter increased 12%. For 2012, we expect R&D spending on a
GAAP basis to be in the range of $360 million to $380 million. This includes $13 million of projected milestone
payments primarily related to Esmya product development. These milestone payments have been excluded from our
non-GAAP earnings forecast.
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect R&D expense to increase approximately 20% year-over-year with roughly 65% of
this increase attributable to our Brand division. Brand R&D costs include all spending related to biosimilar
development, including costs associated with our co-development arrangement with Amgen and cost of our Eden
development group in Liverpool.
SG&A for the fourth quarter was $213 million, up 3% over the prior year on higher selling and marketing expenses in
both our Generics and Brand businesses, partially offset by lower G&A cost. SG&A expense also increased as a result
of the acquisition of Specifar. The prior year period includes a charge of $40 million associated with our drug pricing
litigation. For 2012, we expect SG&A on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $820 million to $850 million. On a
non-GAAP basis, we expect 2012 SG&A cost to increase approximately 12% year-over-year.
Net asset impairment charges during the fourth quarter were $53.1 million. This relates primarily to changes in our
forecast for two significant pipeline products, PROCHIEVE and the authorized generic version of Xopenex.
Amortization expense for the fourth quarter was $151 million. For 2012, we expect amortization expense to be
approximately $440 million which includes approximately $90 million of amortization related to our atorvastatin
product rights and amortization of product rights acquired in connection with the Specifar and Ascent acquisitions.
On a non-GAAP basis, our income tax rate was 35% in the fourth quarter, down from 35.9% in the prior year period.
Our income tax rate on a GAAP basis was 39.5%. For the full year 2012, we expect our effective tax rate on a
non-GAAP basis to be approximately 37%, a slight increase from 2011 due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit and
higher offshore R&D cost at a lower effective tax rate. The tax rate will also be impacted by product mix as higher
profits from outsourced products reduces the manufacturing tax benefit in the U.S.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization and impairment charges and other charges detailed in Table 4 of
our earnings press release, earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.77 per share, up 90% year-over-year. Non-GAAP
earnings for the fourth quarter includes a $0.64 per share contribution from generic Lipitor. For 2012, we expect
generic Lipitor to contribute approximately $0.75 per share in non-GAAP earnings. This contribution will be heavily
weighted to the first half of 2012.
GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.75 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $393
million, a 78% increase. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $222 million, and cash and marketable
securities were $224 million at year-end. We remain well positioned financially following the acquisition of Ascent
Pharmaceuticals, with a pro forma debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.3 times. Our current capital
structure allows us to invest significantly in the growth of our business.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2012 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. Now I'd like to provide you with an update to our 2012 preliminary forecast that we provided at our
Investor Day on January 24. This update accounts for the launch of generic LOVENOX as well as other changes in our
business from January 24 to today. As a reminder, we have not included any potential sales of generic Lidoderm or any
contribution from our progesterone gel product for the prevention of pre-term birth.
Our forecast includes assumptions for increased competition on our oral contraceptive franchise and extended release
products with the exception of generic Concerta. We do not anticipate any additional generic competition on Concerta

in 2012. Date certain launches included in the forecast are generic versions of Actos and Xopenex, as well as other
undisclosed launches throughout the rest of 2012.
Regarding generic Xopenex, there has been a change in circumstances and we are now – and we now expect to launch
the product in August of this year, with one additional generic competitor, an AG. We originally believed that we
would be the only generic Xopenex for the first 180 days after our launch. On January 23, we learned that Sunovion,
formerly Sepracor might launch its own generic product during our period of exclusivity.
In order to be prudent and since we had not completed an investigation nor confirmed Sunovion's intentions, we revised
our assumptions for generic Xopenex to include a competitor during the exclusivity period prior to giving our
preliminary forecast on January 24. Since January 24, we have been informed by Sunovion that they intend to launch.
The results of our investigation so far indicate that prior to our acquisition of Aero, Aero had entered into an
understanding with Sepracor that would allow Sepracor to launch its own authorized generic product during our 180
days. This arrangement was not disclosed to us during due diligence or even subsequent to that.
So for today's forecast, we continue to assume one additional generic competitor during the first 180 days. We are
continuing our investigation of this situation to decide on appropriate next steps. We of course, intend to do everything
possible to maximize the value of this launch.
So, with that, our updated forecast is as follows: Our estimated full-year net revenue increased to approximately $5.4
billion. We now expect Global Generic segment revenue to be between $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion.
On the Brand side of the business, we expect net revenue of $500 million to $525 million. With the Anda Distribution
business, we continue to anticipate revenue to be between $850 million and $900 million. As a reminder, Anda's results
do not include the sale of Watson products.
We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion to $1.375 billion for the year. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per
diluted share in the range of $5.50 to $5.80 per share.
In summary, 2011 was a record year for revenue growth and profitability. We have executed on our strategy that has
been in place since 2009. We have a balance sheet in place to capitalize on opportunities to grow the company and we
expect to meet or exceed our growth objectives of double-digit earnings growth for 2012 and 2013.
Lastly, and most importantly, I would like to thank all of our employees around the world for their hard work and
dedication to the global growth of Watson. With that, I'll turn it back to Patty for Q&A.
Patricia Eisenhaur
Thanks, Paul. Terese, we can get started with the Q&A.

Operator
Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hey, Marc.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Can you talk about LOVENOX a little bit and the launch? Maybe give us a sense of pricing,
and has there been anything different in the launch just because of the – you have one channel, the other guys have the
other channel? How that's working out?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hi, Marc. It's Siggi here. Yes, as we explained, we have the retail channel and our
partner has the hospital channel. We have launched the product. We are building up stock at the moment. We launched
everything we had in hand on day one, and we expect that over the next few weeks we will have a full stock to launch

into the market. The price is as expected for this launch, and it's progressing very well at the moment.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: And is all the pricing the same? I mean, your price into your channel and your partner's
pricing? How's that working?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: We don't compare prices.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Co.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Good morning. Just want to ask about -
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Hi. How are you Paul?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: I just want to talk about Lidoderm and maybe a little bit of a discussion, I know there were in
some of the pre-trial briefs that talked about settlement negotiations. Can you talk about whether the terms are still on
the table that were originally proposed if – has there been any changes in terms of any of the dialogue?
And then maybe if Siggi could just give us a sense of on LOVENOX, what percent of sales is in the retail channel for
that product? Thanks a lot.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure, Ken. Settlement discussions are things that move around all the time. Obviously we're
moving and focused on the trial and we're looking forward to today's closing arguments. So we remain focused on
trying to win the trial and getting prepared for launch. Regarding any potential settlement, those things take time. They
may or may not occur and right now we're focused on the trial. So I guess that's where I'll leave it.
With respect to LOVENOX, Siggi?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, on LOVENOX, we estimate that around 35% of the overall volume is in the
retail channel.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Hi, thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hey, Tim.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: So, Paul, you increased your revenue guidance by about $100 million, your bottom line guidance
for 2012 by around $0.25. Is that all attributed to LOVENOX or is there some other products that you'd sort of included
in the new guidance?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, Tim, it is primarily attributed to LOVENOX. There are, of course, moving parts and
certainly our forecast changes and our expectations for products change all the time. So there's been other additional
changes, but it's primarily LOVENOX.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: And just a quick follow-up to that, I mean, how much share do you think you can grab in the
LOVENOX market in the retail channel?

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, before I let Siggi answer that, I mean, one of the things we don't want to do is get too far
ahead of ourselves when we talk about the commercial sensitivity of our products. So we don't mean to be short with
you guys; it's just a question of we can't give out too much information, but Siggi?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, the retail channel is mainly by Sandoz at the moment, Sanofi is there and we
expect that an AG from Sanofi to come in the market. I think that a four player market we expect that a fair market
share, in a four player market for Watson.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Okay, great. Paul, I don't mean to hog this call but there was this FDA draft guidance on
biosimilars that came out last week, what are your thoughts on that?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'm going to let Fred answer that but I think I'll just say I'll start with saying that I think it
was a good first step but it was simply a first step. Fred?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yes. So actually we have a nice opportunity to analyze this both as Watson as a
partner with Amgen, so we've had a lot of discussions about the guidance. I think they went a good step forward to get
some clarity on certain issues and left other things off the table, particularly did not address the naming issue. There is
no clear path for interchangeability. There are opportunities for extrapolation of indication -- you can go from different
dosage form to different dosage form. But I think they really are leaving it kind of as a product-by-product specific type
program and are encouraging a lot of interactions with FDA as you go forward. So I think that's how we're approaching
it. It's a terrific first step. It did put some clarity on certain pieces but there's still a lot more work to do.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Okay. Great, thanks.
<A - Patricia Eisenhaur>: Thanks, Tim.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Ronny Gal with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Ronny.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: And thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Three of them actually, the first one, can you
tell us a little bit how you intend to put together the respiratory business, especially when it comes to inhaled product,
and do you think you can – those products actually will be substitutable, are we primarily looking at [ph] chronic
(23:33) 505 (b)(2)s?
Second one is should we expect some biosimilars from your partnership with Amgen to reach the clinic this year in
2012? Are we going to start seeing them?
And last, staying on the biosimilar thing, I was wondering if Fred thinks that given the guidance it might be time to
retry Premarin. I know that some – a couple of you guys have been with Barr when they've tried to do this. Is there
enough there – when I read this analytical chemistry thing I'm just looking at this and going, hmm, is there something
there?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Ronny, I got to tell you, I'll start with that one first. That has been something we've worked on
for a lot of years. It is obviously something we will have looked at and will continue to look at. I think seriously, the
biggest issue still remains access to the raw material and not so much anymore the question about whether we can
characterize the product. So it is just the continuing problem of finding a source that is really viable.
Regarding the respiratory business, I think our respiratory efforts are going to be wide-ranging, and I think they will
include partnerships where appropriate. And your question about whether we'll use a 505(b)(2) or traditional route will
really depend on a product-by-product analysis. We've got – there are some products where I think 505(b)(2) is going
to be the more appropriate pathway and I think there is going to be some products where we may be able to use the

traditional route. So we're taking a broad view of respiratory. And I think you'll see stuff from us coming reasonably
soon.
So, Fred, I'll turn it over to you for biosimilars.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah. So as far as where we are with the Amgen collaboration, we have given
little and probably will give no guidance on when we go into clinic and when we don't. We are controlled a little bit by
our relationship and I think that will be a decision will be made jointly by both parties as to announcing and/or not
announcing where we are with respect to the individual products.
I love your question on Premarin, although, it's still a reminder that Premarin was approved under a drug application
and not under a BLA, so there are some differences, still, as how that might be approached, so...
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Patricia Eisenhaur>: Thanks, Ronny.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Douglas Tsao with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Morning.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Just, [ph] Greg or (26:03) – Paul, sorry; in terms of Lipitor, what we've seen in terms of
market share is your share has sort of trended down away from your expectation of a split with Ranbaxy. I'm just
wondering if you thought that was going to normalize, or what you're seeing right now, and has that been adjusted in
terms of your forecast for this year -- or for 2012.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, Doug. It's Siggi; let me take this one. I think first of all, I think the picture that the
IMS is painting is not a very accurate one. The reason for that is that there is an overestimation of, I think, what is in
the mail order channel, but also, a few of the customers we have don't report their data to IMS. I know IMS tries to
estimate how much that is, but that leads to the differences between what we see [ph] as our sales (26:51) and what the
IMS shows. So we are very happy with our sales, with our market share. I think we will continue to gain market share
from Pfizer going forward, but overall, we are very comfortable where we are today.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay, great. And then one follow-up on LOVENOX, and Siggi, you might want to take this,
is in terms of your production and your supply right now of the product, given the fact that sort of your, the faucet got
turned on very quickly from your ability to launch, you had some product in supply. How is that going to play out
through the rest of the year, and are you going to be able to get manufacturing back up in time to have a sort of no
interruption?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Yeah. Hey, Doug, it's Bob Stewart here. I'll answer this one. With respect to Amphastar,
they are ramping up production as we speak, and we expect that we're going to get continued supply from them as
Siggi mentioned before, building up our inventories to ultimately take a reasonable share in the market.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

<Q - David George Buck>: Just a couple of quick ones, for Specifar, can you give some sense of the contribution for
either fourth quarter or all of 2011 and what type of growth rate you'd be expecting in 2012?
And then for the OC business, it sounds like you're assuming declines was a little bit lighter than we had thought in the
current quarter, about $95 million. Should we be expecting that to be sort of the high water mark as we enter 2012 on a
quarterly basis or is that expected to go up with the Yaz launch?
And then just a quick follow-up, clinicaltrials.gov, is that where we should be seeing the Amgen products [ph] for the
associated reporting (28:37)?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I think the requirement for the website is entering Phase III now.
<Q - David George Buck>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Todd, do you want to handle the Specifar?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Sure. For Specifar, we're expecting roughly $150 million to $175 million of revenues in 2012,
that's up from $60 million in 2011 and Ascent would be at about the same revenue contribution for 2012.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I think on the OC question, we are getting continuous competition on the OCs on the
base business. As you rightly said, we just launched Yaz and Yaz will be a good product for us during 2012, but we
still estimate that there will be more competition on OC throughout the year 2012.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Dewey Steadman with JPMorgan.
<Q - D. Dewey Steadman>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk about the
dynamics of the Toprol market now that Mylan has entered the market? And what are your near-term expectations for
pricing and share in that market?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, let me take that. So as you said, Mylan entered the market at the end of last year.
They took some market share from I think all the players in the market. The market is overall moving a little bit down.
As we estimated, we said that at the beginning of 2011 the competition came later than we expected. I think going
forward, we don't know what's happening. We have said in our forecast that we estimate that there will be at least one
more player during 2012 for this market. But overall we don't comment on pricing or market share anymore than that.
<Q - D. Dewey Steadman>: Okay. And then on PROCHIEVE, beyond waiting for the FDA response at the end of this
month, can you just comment on any steps you're taking there and how that might change – or a delay in PROCHIEVE
might change your business development priorities going forward, either branded or generic, and the relative size of
those business development opportunities?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Okay. Yeah. So PROCHIEVE, you saw the announcement yesterday, we did transfer the NDA
from Columbia to Watson, that kind of puts us in the front seat with the FDA instead of in the back seat. And we intend
to work very closely with them. We have been doing a significant amount of analysis based on what was presented at
the advisory committee of the data, all the way down to case records. And we will be approaching the agency once we
get a response from them and see how can we get this important product in the marketplace. Paul, you want to do...
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. Dewey, on your question about business development efforts, I think we're – just so
we're all clear, we're still very committed to our brand franchise. We have a great pipeline. We intend to exploit that
pipeline to its fullest potential. We'll continue to evaluate PROCHIEVE and the ability to use progesterone to get an
indication for pre-term birth. We'll do everything we can to convince the agency that it's an appropriate product at the
appropriate time for a much needed indication. But we will continue to look for business development efforts across all

Thank you. Your next question comes from Elliot Wilbur with Needham.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hey, Elliot.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Hey, Paul. Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Thanks for taking the questions. First is for you, Paul, I guess. Going back to the Analyst Day on
the 24th, you had given a growth bogey for 2013 of approximately 10% bottom line growth, which I think at the time
did include a contribution from LOVENOX and Lidoderm. Obviously, LOVENOX came much earlier and with the
increase in bottom line guidance this year. Just wondering if that's still an appropriate growth metric to think about?
And then a follow-up question for yourself and probably Todd as well, if I look at your SG&A guidance in light of
what you did in – or what you spent in 4Q and annualize that, obviously you get a number sort of over $850 million, I
understand there may be some one-time accruals related to Lipitor there. But I guess with the recent build out of the
sales force and the acquisition of Ascent, it still seems like there is multiple levers that you're using to kind of ratchet
down SG&A. I was just wondering if maybe you'd give us a little bit more insight into that? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. As to the growth target for 2013, it remains the same. Our challenge internally and
externally is to achieve the 10% – greater than 10% growth, and that's what we're focused on. I think – I'm sorry,
approximately 10% growth. That's an important metric for us and that's what our entire team is focused on doing and
that is our growth target. Todd?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Yeah. In terms of SG&A, we've got roughly year-over-year there's – there will be a $50 million
increase that's – in SG&A that's acquisition related for – because a full-year of Specifar and also the Ascent acquisition.
The fourth quarter is not a good proxy for run rate. It was a little higher. There were some unusual items that we
incurred in the fourth quarter. So really if you look at kind of the average of third and fourth quarter and then you trend
that out and take into account the increases because of the Ascent acquisition and the full-year of Specifar, I think you
get much closer to our guidance range.
<A - Patricia Eisenhaur>: Okay.

Thank you. Your next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q>: Hi. It's -
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, David.
<Q>: Hi. It's Chris actually for Dave. He dropped unfortunately. But he gave me a list. I was wondering if you could
please just give some more clarity behind the 2013 EPS target, specifically how important is Lidoderm, what other P4
challenges are in there and when should we expect incremental competition in 2013 on Concerta please?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, we have not given specific guidance around 2013. What we've said is we intend to target
a growth rate of approximately 10%. We did say at Analyst Day and we'll repeat here that we do have a number in for
Lidoderm in 2013, so we do include it. But we do not include all of the additional potential patent challenges that could

occur in 2013.
So there is a lot of possible levers that can could be pulled to achieve that growth. From internal growth and then of
course, there's the opportunity to achieve or exceed it through external growth. So we have a lot of levers to pull to pull
things forward.
I'm sorry? As to the Concerta, I think we have forecasted additional competition in 2013 for Concerta.
<Q>: Okay. And would that be in the middle of the year or in the beginning?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, we're not going to be that specific. Like we've said in the past, we – for purposes of when
competition come in, we're not going to say exactly when it's included in the number. It doesn't – if we get into the
discussion about what month, it gets to be challenging to maintain guidance.
<Q>: Got it, got it. And then just one more follow up for you guys. In terms of business development, Paul, you
indicated you plan to do a larger branded acquisition?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Don't believe everything you read. No, the comments that I made with the reporter were wide
ranging. We had a long conversation. I think it was probably fair to say that we were talking generally about
acquisitions and I was speaking to him about our ability to do a large transaction. I told him that we were focused on
the Brand business and that it would be something that we would also – we would consider would be a large Brand
transaction. However, I've also made it very clear that if the right Generic focused large transaction presented itself,
that would help us expand our footprint globally and drive additional growth through our Brand, or through our
Generics business, we would do that one as well.
So it's really a question of opportunity as opposed to specific ideas. Unfortunately, we can't predict when people are
willing and when companies are willing to discuss transactions. So we do have to be a bit opportunistic when it comes
to that sort of thing. But again, I just want to be clear, we wouldn't not do a Brand transaction and we wouldn't not do a
Generic transaction. We're prepared to do one or both if we can.
<Q>: Got it. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Paul, you forgot to say you would do one or both or none, right?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Absolutely, Gregg. Absolutely.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay. A very specific timing question. Have you learned anything new since the Analyst Day
on your Lidoderm and – or the FDA's view of the approach of the PROCHIEVE NDA?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I'll take the Lidoderm and let Fred handle the PROCHIEVE. On the Lidoderm, I think there
was some confusion and probably we should clear it up if it still exists, about some comments made by the lawyers
during the trial and this is kind of what people get for listening too closely to lawyers. I can say that, okay.
The situation involved a bio-study on Lidoderm performed at [ph] Citero (38:50). The study was performed – when the
[ph] Citero (38:53) issue first happened, there was a date range provided by the agency. That date range was
subsequently narrowed, okay. The biostudy at question now falls outside of the range of concerns that the FDA has
about [ph] Citero (39:06). So there is no issue regarding the biostudy that was performed at [ph] Citero (39:11).

So it was a red herring and we tried to deal with that with a press release. But hopefully we've now clarified it
specifically for everyone. Regarding the application, it's still moving forward and we do expect to get our tentative
approval on and we expect to be ready to go at the earliest possible time to launch the product. Fred?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Regarding PROCHIEVE, we've had multiple discussions with multiple people at
multiple different levels within the agency. So we've been extremely active in the process since the advisory panel and
since our investor meeting. I think the only thing that we've learned with certainty is that the 26th is on a Sunday,
which is our PDUFA date and that we anticipate that we'll get an Action Letter on Friday, which is the 24. So other
than that, I think there's just been a whole lot of conversations on how to approach things and what might be contained
in that letter.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay. And then one more on the Xopenex issue, Paul. Is there a mechanism to adjust the value
you paid versus the value received? It seems like it could be potentially a material difference although you wouldn't tell
that from your 2012 guidance change. But can you walk us through what comes next in that regard?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, to clear up the point out of the 2012 guidance change, that was – Xopenex was already
removed from guidance when we gave the preliminary guidance.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Got you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: So that was not included in the first round and taken out in the second.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: I guess the question relates more to the model you used to justify the price you paid.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Exactly. I – that part right now I'm going to leave that. We're in the midst of an investigation.
We've got a number of issues to resolve. And we're hoping we can resolve them. But at the moment I can't really
comment any further on that.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Frank Pinkerton with SunTrust.
<Q - Frank Henry Pinkerton>: Hey, thank you for taking the questions. First one is you guys are kind of in a unique
position. You've got an authorized generic on Concerta. You're challenging on ADDERALL. If I believe my IMS data,
you're also manufacturing some smaller stimulant products. So you probably get it from all sides from DEA. Can you
please just give us an update on what you think the DEA's role is in that market, what they've kind of done from a
standpoint of supply and how they view abuse of those products versus price and do they have any type of control over
that market that maybe outside the control of the FDA?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, let me first start and – I'll then I'll turn it over to Bob Stewart, who focuses on this effort
pretty dramatically. I think we have to be very clear that Watson supports the effort and has – continues to support the
effort to make sure that there is no diversion of these drugs outside of the appropriate channels. I think the challenge
has been and continuous to be how best to accomplish that objective. And there has been a lot of activity around both
our Watson business and our Anda Distribution business. But before I steal all of Bob's thunder, I'll let him take it over.
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: As Paul just mentioned, we continue to work with the DEA to make sure that we're tracking
and doing suspicious monitoring, that we're doing the right reporting of any kind of potential diversion issues and
things along those lines. We're also working with the DEA around the drug shortages side of things to make sure that
we're securing the right amount of quota, because as you mentioned, we do have a number of products in which – that
are in this space and so therefore, working with the agency to make sure that we have the appropriate quota allocation
as well.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Right. I think, Frank, I guess the last point I would make and just sort of a general point for at
least from our perspective and perhaps the industry's perspective is more visibility to what the DEA and the FDA
would like us to do and clarity around objectives and clarity around the kinds of programs they would like us to be
moving toward would help move this needle forward.
At the moment, I would say it's probably fair to say that the agencies are not well aligned internally and they need to
get that sort of piece resolved and we stand ready to help them. But we need to get the right clarity from the DEA at the
very highest levels, so there's no misunderstanding about what they would like us to do. I mean, there is always –
obviously there's only certain things we can do, but I think it really requires an open and clear dialogue and we stand
ready and I know others in the industry stand ready, we've had conversations with others in the industry and we look
forward to achieving that objective.
<Q - Frank Henry Pinkerton>: All right, great. And then if I can have a follow up please and this is not as large a
concern for Watson and some of the other, I guess more global players, even in yourself out there but, can you give any
color or speak to collections on Europe, specifically by country? And any language in your contracts with your
different groups over there you're collecting from on what currency they have to pay in? Thank you.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, it's Siggi here. If I start, I think collection in Europe for us is not an issue. We
basically – the two biggest market for us in Europe are France and UK. We have a very, very small business in other
markets, so we haven't had any problems. If we focus on Greece, we are basically – we are not selling to the Greek
government at the moment. We don't participate in tenders for sale into the hospital, but we sell to the wholesaler there
and we have a – we are in good collection with the Greek wholesalers at this point in time.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Randy Stanicky with Canaccord Genuity.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks, guys, for the questions. Paul or maybe Siggi, can you just – have you guys
reviewed where Ranbaxy could lose some of their exclusivities and how that may or may not benefit you? And I'm
thinking about Actos but there may be some others. And I have a follow-up.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, we have reviewed it. We obviously, we don't know exactly where it's going to
land for Ranbaxy but we have and we are reviewing it internally to see if there's an opportunity for us, going forward,
both for Ranbaxy but also with the issue that impacts [ph] house (45:33) at the moment.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: But currently, you've not identified any potential upside at this point?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: We have not included in our guidance any upside due to that.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Okay, great. And then a lot of discussion around Xopenex. Maybe, Siggi, how are you
thinking about the opportunity post 180 days competitively?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: We estimate that after the 180 days, there will be at least a four player market, as a
minimum. There could be even one more. So I think the opportunity will be much lesser on day 181.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great, and then just one last question. As you look at the international business, can you
identify the markets where you're seeing the most pricing pressure and where some of that further pressure could come
from? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. The biggest pricing pressure we estimate in our market is in France, for sure. At
the moment, there's both pressure from the France – from the government in France where they are saving money on
the healthcare purchase. But also there's a pressure due to the competition in the market. There's a fierce competition
among generic player for top-line growth. So there has been a very significant pricing pressure in France. In our other

Thank you. Your next question comes from David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Hey, thanks. [indiscernible] (46:55). On Concerta, can you remind us what happens to
your margins on the [indiscernible] (47:00) if there's one other generic entrant? And then what would happen to your
margins contractually if there is a second entrants?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, I think what we've said around the margins is when another entrant comes in, our
margins go up. And we said it was not an insignificant amount. We have not identified what that number is. And that
margin stays – I believe it stays at that number until the agreement expires in late 2014.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: So there is no additional adjustment in the margins if there is a second entrant?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: No.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay. And then second question on REVLIMID, any update there on the litigation? And
then secondly any color on how you feel you're able to circumvent the polymorph patents and any light you could shed
there?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Again, I've promised I wouldn't get into specific discussions about legal matters, so I'm going
to turn this over to David and let him answer that one.
<A - David A. Buchen>: No. On REVLIMID I think the question's been about the Markman hearing, and the situation
there is that there is some new patents that are going to be – that are listed and we're evaluating and pending a decision
on what's going to happen with those new patents and how they're going to be litigated. There's been a delay of getting
a Markman hearing scheduled so that we can consolidate everything and only do [ph] it once. (48:32) Other than that, I
think the litigation is progressing, and given where things are at this stage, I don't think we're going to say anything
further.

be that the judge could rule as early as today. But it is not unusual that a judge would write an opinion about this, they

might – he might actually verbally rule and then write an opinion. So there could be several ways in which this goes.
David, did you want to add anything?
<A - David A. Buchen>: I think that's correct. There's a possibility that the judge would rule from the bench or shortly
thereafter. There are two major issues that the court is going to rule on: one is infringement; and the other is invalidity
or obviousness. We don't know whether – if there is a quick ruling whether they will both happen today or whether he'll
issue a decision. He'll have to at point issue a decision so that appropriate appeals can be taken from whatever the result
is. So we're waiting like the rest of you.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Okay. And just one other question to follow-up on Lipitor and your comments about IMS not
accurately capturing things. I think the latest weekly showed about 23% for Watson and about 40% for Ranbaxy. What
in your view is a more accurate depiction of that market share?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: What we have said before is we were going in the retail end of the business, we were
going to get more than 50% share of the retail part. I think there is a fair bit in the mail order business which was
captured by Pfizer and then later on by Ranbaxy. But we don't comment exactly on how we see the business itself. But
we think we have a bigger share in the retail than is being shown in IMS.

<Q - John T. Boris>: Hey, good morning, and congratulations on the results.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Thank you.
<Q - John T. Boris>: First question, Paul. I know you consistently said you don't believe that clinical trials are needed
on Lidoderm, but it would seem from the hearing that Endo potentially has acquired some additional information that
would lead them to file a Citizen's Petition and that your lawyers who maybe misspoke seemed to imply that clinical
trials would be needed for a generic. Can you maybe just discuss that issue a little bit?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Then I have two follow ups.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay.
<A - David A. Buchen>: John, it's David. I'll take this one. What happened at trial was that our witness said that you
don't know whether a product works or not just by manufacturing it. You have to do a clinical trial. He did not mean a
clinical endpoint study, he meant a general clinical trial like a PK study which we have done. So there is no
inconsistency in our position. We've done PK studies, I think the people who were reporting on this I think
misconstrued what he said when he said a clinical study, to mean a clinical endpoint study or a clinical trial rather as
opposed to just a PK study.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Great. Thanks for clearing that up, David. And Paul, if you do win, which it seems as though
there is a pretty high probability you prevail in this trial, would you launch at risk or wait until after an appeal had
occurred?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, John, I think you probably know me well enough to know that if we remove all barriers,
we would probably consider that a very high probability getting out with this product.

<Q - John T. Boris>: Okay, great. And then on LOVENOX, you indicated there'd be four parties, your assumption
about when that fourth party might enter the market?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: That fourth party I'm talking about is the authorized generic from Sanofi, I was not
talking about Teva per se.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Okay, great. And then lastly, for you Siggi, it would seem as though in ex U.S. markets there is a
trend to going more towards a U.S. model. In Italy for example, pharmacists are now mandated to not continue to give
people their branded generic but to substitute the cheapest generic product going forward. Do you see that trend
potentially spreading more broadly throughout Europe and what are the implications for your business and your
acquisition strategy going forward if that takes hold?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. It's a good question, John. The point there is this has been in Europe for many,
many years. This has been the model in all the Scandinavian countries for many years that the pharmacist has to put out
the cheapest generic within usually 5% to 10%. So if you are within the band of 5% to 10% of the cheapest generic,
you can be utilized for that period of time.
The period of time is different between different markets. In Denmark, this period of time is two weeks. In other
markets, it can be three months. It could be six months in other markets. This will happen. We know that they – even
the Greek government is looking to this. But this is beneficial to the generic industry. Yes, this puts a pricing pressure
for sure but in these markets where the generic penetration is maybe 13% to 17% like it is in Greece, legislation like
this which pushes the pharmacist to change to generics in the pharmacy will increase the generic penetration. I think the
Greek government in the latest negotiations have a goal of getting this generic penetration to 50% because they
acknowledge and understand that by saving on the healthcare budget, they need to increase the penetration of generics.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Great. Thanks for the questions.
<A - Patricia Eisenhaur>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Tong with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Paul, a couple of years ago, you talked about ramping up your transdermal capabilities. How
did you characterize that ramp up? Is it progressing on schedule, ahead? And when might we see additional filings or
product launches from your transdermal franchise?
And then secondly, maybe just remind me with Concerta as you talk about the margin change upon the entry of
additional competitors. Is that because you think you have the ability to launch your own product or is it contractually
stipulated that your margin goes up even if J&J continues to supply you with product?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Let me answer the Concerta question first. It is contractually maintained. We wouldn't – we
would be launching our product at the end of the contractual period is the idea.
On the transdermal, I'm going to hand this over to Bob in a second, but I think our ramp up has been going very well.
We've got a lot of activity going on in the transdermals, both patches and gels. But we'll let Bob...
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Yeah. To Paul's point, we have a number of products in development as well as a number of
products in which that we have already filed, and that is one of the reasons for the expansion in Salt Lake City. A lot of
people think the Salt Lake City expansion is specific for lidocaine. It's actually to support not only Lidocaine but other
products in which that we have in the pipeline as well, both on the gel side as well as on the patch.

<Q - Michael K. Tong>: And so should we expect if everything goes well, launches in 2013, that's part of your 10%
growth objective?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes.
<A - David A. Buchen>: Yes.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes. Some in 2012 and some in 2013.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Great, thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And beyond.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Thanks.
<A - Patricia Eisenhaur>: Therese, we'll take our last question.
Operator
Thank you. Your final question comes from Jason Gerberry with Leerink Swann.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Most of my questions have been answered I'll try my luck with David on a Paragraph IV
question. You mentioned with REVLIMID that, I guess the delay of the Markman has to do with some I guess, late
listed patents to the Orange Book. Could you just confirm that those are the method of use patents which were not part
of the original 10 patents in dispute? And then I guess just one follow up for Paul.
<A - David A. Buchen>: Yeah. I think that's correct on the method of use patents.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Okay. And then, Paul, just understanding the whole Bussinessweek article, the M&A
thing. But could you just maybe give us a range of size of what would be a transformational Brand acquisition if one
became available?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: That's a good question. I think we've talked about pretty clearly our objective is to remain
within a band around 3.5 times debt to EBITDA should we do a significant transaction. Of course, some of that
EBITDA would come from the acquired company. So that gives you a sense for how big of a number we would try to
reach for. We would be willing to use equity if it made sense in a transformational deal if we needed to close the gap, if
you will.
So we've got a lot of flexibility, Jason. Again, I think the challenge for us really is finding the right opportunity and I'm
sure that remains the case for everybody who's in a situation like we are. Where we've got a strong balance sheet and
we're out looking for opportunities.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Great. Thanks.

Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Patty.
