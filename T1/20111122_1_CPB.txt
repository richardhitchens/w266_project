MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Campbell Soup's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please
begin.
Jennifer K. Driscoll
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Campbell Soup Company's first quarter earnings call and webcast.
With me here today in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig
Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; and Anthony DiSilvestro,
Senior Vice President of Finance.
Denise will kick us off by giving an update on our progress with our three growth strategies and commenting on our
performance during the quarter. Then Craig will offer a detailed discussion of the quarter as well as our expectations
for fiscal 2012. Following our formal remarks, all of us will take questions from the audience. And then at the end of
the Q&A, Denise will come back to wrap it up.
As usual, we've created slides to accompany our presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning
at investor.CampbellSoupCompany.com. Starting this quarter, we'll be advancing the slides for you in order to enhance

your experience.
Please keep in mind that our call is open to members of the media who are participating in listen-only mode.
As a reminder, our presentation today includes certain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current
expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions
and estimates which could be inaccurate and which inherently are subject to risks. Please refer to slide two in our
presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could
cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement.
Since our presentation includes non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules, we've provided a reconciliation of the
measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying the presentation.
These slides as well as our earnings release and selected quarterly financial data can be found on our website.
As a reminder, we've revised our reporting segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We separated the U.S. Soup,
Sauces and Beverages segment into two segments, U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages. We provided historical
quarterly information on our segments earlier this month on a Form 8-K.
And with that, let me turn the call over Denise.
Denise M. Morrison
Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for Campbell's first quarter earnings
conference call.
As Jennifer indicated, I'll touch on our three growth strategies followed by my perspective on our first quarter financial
results and segment performance. Simply stated, our goal is to create value by providing sustainable, profitable net
sales growth. To achieve that goal, we're pursuing three growth strategies. First, we'll stabilize, then profitably grow
North America Soup and Simple Meals. Second, we'll expand our international presence. And third, we'll continue to
drive growth in healthy beverages and baked snacks.
Across Campbell, the pace of activity has picked up, and we're putting all of our energy into improving our
performance. Overall, we're confident in our growth strategies and are keenly focused on execution. We have the right
people in the right positions. And we've set up a streamlined score card with clear metrics so everyone knows what's
expected of them and we can keep track of our progress.
To be successful with our strategies, we must connect with consumers and keep their needs front and center. This past
quarter, as we began to implement our strategies, consumers continued to be impacted by the challenges in the global
economy. In the United States and other markets where we compete, higher prices drove an increase in consumer
spending on food, but the number of items purchased declined.
Consumers continued to shift channels in their search for value. As a result, club, dollar, and drug stores outperformed
traditional grocery. There's little doubt that the pronounced cautionary restraints that have characterized consumer
behavior since the onset of the financial crisis are now the new norm for the food and beverage sector, and we are
proactively addressing it.
I'll now offer a brief perspective on our first quarter results, which we reported this morning. Sales declined 1% and
EBIT declined 6%. Earnings per share were steady with last year's first quarter. While our overall first quarter
performance was in line with our expectations, the composition of our results was mixed. In particular, U.S. Simple
Meals, Pepperidge Farm, and North America Foodservice met or exceeded expectations, while U.S. Beverages and
international did not.
Despite a different mix than we had expected, we are reiterating our full-year guidance. We recognize that we have
more hard work ahead, and we won't rest until we change the company's growth trajectory.

As we've said before, fiscal 2012 will be a transition year for Campbell. We're making significant investments in
innovation and marketing to restore momentum to our top line in the years ahead.
Now let me speak briefly about our segment results, starting with U.S. Simple Meals. I'll also highlight some of the
challenges we're facing in Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Beverages.
We had solid profit growth in U.S. Simple Meals despite the sales decline. While it's early, we're making progress with
stabilizing the profitability of this business, after which we can focus on driving sales growth. As you may recall, in the
first half of last year we engaged in heavy promotional activity that did not produce sufficient volume lifts. In the
second half of last year, we changed our marketing strategy for U.S. Soup and pulled back on heavy promotions.
Subsequently, we took a list price increase due to inflationary pressures.
In the first quarter of this year, U.S. Soup sales declines were not as pronounced as we had expected, even as we cycled
last year's heavy discounting. This had a positive impact on the profitability of U.S. Soup. A portion of the profit
increase came from reduced spending on advertising and consumer promotions.
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, you may have expected increased spending. In the quarter, we started our
U.S. Soup advertising later in September to coincide with the actual start of the soup season, when we get the best
returns, and to extend our media dollars across the full season, which runs well into our third quarter. Our first quarter
TV GRPs [Gross Rating Points] on soup were up due to better efficiencies. We also started our consumer promotions
later this quarter based on insights from last year when an earlier start did not deliver the desired returns. This year we
chose not to repeat non-TV and consumer programs from last year's first quarter that proved inefficient, including
certain couponing and sampling events for condensed soup.
At this point, advertising for U.S. Soup is in full swing. We sure hope you've seen our TV campaign and are inspired to
buy a few Campbell products this holiday season.
Going forward, you can expect both advertising and consumer programs to increase. In fact, we expect both will be up
when we review our full-year performance with you next September. We're committed to emphasizing brand building
activities for the long-term health of this business.
Innovation will also play a key role in stabilizing and profitably growing Simple Meals. This quarter we launched 35
new products in Simple Meals versus five a year ago. While it's too early to read consumer reaction, we're on track to
achieve our distribution and shelf space targets, and we're executing our merchandising plans.
As you know, last quarter we shifted our retail store coverage to a broker sales model through Acosta and added 5,000
stores. We were able to get our new products on shelf more quickly and also expect our holiday program to be strong
this year.
Because innovation is so critical to our plans, we have ramped up our investment. Our new breakthrough innovation
teams have been moving quickly to develop more disruptive innovation for fiscal 2013 and beyond. We're targeting
both new users and new occasions. As we've stated, it will take some time to build a consumer driven pipeline. We'll
discuss the progress we're making on our innovation strategies and share some of the new products with you at the
same time we present them to customers.
Our efforts to stabilize U.S. Soup profitability are on track. However, we have more work to do and will not be
satisfied until we get the top line growing again.
Global Baking and Snacking, which performed solidly through 2011, softened this quarter due to Arnott's. A more
cautious Australian consumer and the volume impact of higher prices at retail drove a profit decline for total Global
Baking and Snacking.
On our fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we had a strong quarter in Australia. However, the adverse trends that some
of our peers have been highlighting have clearly impacted us in the first quarter. Arnott's growth stalled this quarter as
the consumer environment weakened, consumers faced increased prices on shelf, and the retail environment became
more intensely competitive. We are adjusting our plans and programs as Australian consumers increasingly reflect a

recessionary mindset, which is impacting a broad range of categories and brands in Australian supermarkets.
Even in a difficult environment, we continue to have several advantages in our corner, including a leading market
share, exposure to expandable consumption categories, a history of on-trend innovation that continues to delight
consumers, and strong brands.
On a lighter note, I have to mention the fact that Tim Tam Biscuits were one of the official gifts the Australian
government gave to President Obama for his daughters for his recent trip to Australia.
Pepperidge Farm continues to perform well with solid sales increases, which lifted the overall segment results.
Consumers responded well to our new products, including Cracker Chips and Milano Melts. To keep our new product
pipeline strong, this past quarter, we broke ground on our new Pepperidge Farm Innovation Center, which will open its
doors in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
Turning to U.S. Beverages, sales declined 3% and operating earnings were down 45%. Needless to say, that's a
considerable decline and warrants explanation. Three important factors were at play. We had significant inflation in
juice concentrates and packaging costs. The shelf-stable juice category declined, and competition intensified with new
entrants in vegetable juice and fruit-vegetable blends.
Short term, we believe we must maintain our competitiveness despite the inflation in this high potential space. Over
time, we can increase our reliance on innovation and marketing. On that front, we launched V8 V-Fusion Smoothies
during the first quarter and have other innovations planned for later in the year. And we just debuted our new
advertising on October 15 featuring action star Jackie Chan. Craig will fully comment on all of our segments, including
beverages, in a few moments.
In September, we provided updated earnings guidance for the fiscal year. As I stated earlier, we're reiterating the same
guidance today. We view fiscal 2012 as a year of transition and investment. There's a lot of energy and a renewed sense
of purpose at Campbell to improve our performance. Changing our growth trajectory will take time as we fully
implement our growth strategies to create a meaningfully different company.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Craig for his analysis of our financial results and an elaboration of our expectations
for fiscal 2012.
B. Craig Owens
Thanks, Denise. Good morning. I'll spend a few minutes to discuss our first quarter results and segment highlights and
follow with some comments on our full-year earnings guidance.
While our profit results for the quarter are consistent with our expectations, the profile of the first quarter results is not
indicative of our full-year plan. We expect improved sales and gross margin trends as well as increased marketing
spending in the balance of the year.
For the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $2.16 billion, down 1% versus the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the
favorable impact of currency, organic net sales declined by 2%.
EBIT of $416 million for the quarter was down 6% versus a year ago, primarily due to significant cost inflation and
lower volumes, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements. On a segment basis, improved
profitability in U.S. Simple Meals was more than offset by declines in U.S. Beverages and Global Baking and
Snacking. Earnings per share were $0.82 for the quarter, comparable to a year ago.
In the first quarter, our recorded net sales declined by 1% as a two point decline in organic sales was partly offset by a
one point gain from currency translation. As you can see on the slide, the decline in organic sales reflects a decrease in
volume and mix of five points and the negative impact of increased promotional spending of one point, partly offset by
an increase in pricing of four points. The impact of lower volumes was primarily in our U.S. Simple Meals business.
The promotional spending variance is primarily due to increased spending across the U.S. Beverage portfolio. And the

price increase is primarily in our U.S. Soup and Pepperidge Farm businesses, where it is helping to offset significant
cost inflation. As expected, our volumes have been negatively impacted by our efforts to improve price realization.
Our gross margin declined from 41.2% in the first quarter of 2011 to 39.5% in the current quarter, a decrease of 170
basis points. This decline was primarily due to cost inflation and unfavorable mix, partly offset by higher selling prices
and productivity improvements. Overall, our inflation rate in cost of goods was approximately 7% to 8% in the quarter,
which is consistent with our full-year expectation. The weaker sales performance in our higher margin U.S. Soup and
U.S. Beverage business is contributing to the negative mix impact.
Marketing and selling expenses decreased by 6% to $261 million compared to $277 million in the prior year, primarily
due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, principally in the U.S. Soup business, partly offset by the
impact of currency. The increased effectiveness in U.S. Soup advertising commenced later in the quarter to coincide
with the start of the soup season.
There were several key businesses in which we stepped up our marketing support. Most notably, we significantly
increased the advertising support in our U.S. Beverage and U.S. Sauce businesses.
Administrative expenses increased by $5 million to $145 million this quarter, primarily due to higher incentive
compensation and benefit cost and the unfavorable impact of currency, partially offset by the benefit of cost savings
from previously announced restructuring initiatives.
As I noted earlier, EBIT declined by 6% in the first quarter. On this slide, we show the items below the EBIT line. Net
interest expense fell 7%, a decrease of $2 million, driven by lower rates on our long-term debt portfolio, as we had
refinanced a $700 million maturity that was due in February 2011. The tax rate declined 40 basis points to 32.2%.
Benefiting from the lower tax rate and the lower interest cost, net earnings declined by 5% this quarter. However,
diluted shares outstanding also declined 5% in the quarter, the result of our share repurchase activity since the first
quarter a year ago. And thus, earnings per share were comparable to prior year.
Segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on this slide. U.S. Simple Meals sales
declined by 3%, reflecting lower results for U.S. Soup partially offset by growth in U.S. Sauces. U.S. Soup sales fell
4% in the first quarter as lower volumes were only partly compensated by higher selling prices. We have improved
price realization through our reduction in promotional discounting and a list price action. Our promotional spending in
the first quarter includes the funding to support our 35 new Simple Meal items compared to just five items a year ago.
Within the U.S. Simple Meals segment, sales trends in U.S. Sauces have improved, achieving modest gains in the
quarter. Sales of Prego Pasta Sauce achieved volume driven sales gains while sales of Pace Mexican Sauce declined
slightly. As I mentioned, we have stepped up our support both in advertising and promotional spending, which is
beginning to have a positive impact on performance.
Sales of the Global Baking and Snacking segment increased 1% as growth in Pepperidge Farm was partially offset
declines at Arnott's. Pepperidge Farm sales increased primarily due to gains in Goldfish Snack Crackers and the
continued success of Milano Melts Cookies. The decline in Arnott's was driven primarily by lower volumes, which
have been negatively impacted by higher price points at retail and a weakening consumer environment in Australia.
Within the international Simple Meals and Beverages segment, organic sales declined by 7%, primarily due to a
volume driven decline of soup sales in Canada, where we significantly reduced promotional spending. Lower European
sales also contributed to the decline. Volume reductions in France and Germany were only partly offset by sales gains
in Belgium.
U.S. Beverage sales decreased 3% versus prior year, primarily driven by a decline in sales of V8 Vegetable Juice,
partly offset by sales growth in V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash. We continue to focus on accelerating innovation in this
category, and the launch of V8 V-Fusion Smoothies significantly contributed to sales growth in the quarter tracking
ahead of our expectations. We increased both advertising and promotional spending in response to intensified
competition and new entrants into the category. The shelf-stable juice category in total declined in the period.

Sales of North American Foodservice increased by 6%, primarily due to volume gains in fresh chilled soup sold at
retail.
Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased 8% to $260 million this quarter. The increase in operating earnings
was primarily due to improved performance in U.S. Soup. U.S. Soup operating earnings increased primarily due to
higher selling prices and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by volume declines. Within marketing, the
reduction associated with the timing of our U.S. Soup campaign was partly offset by the increased brand building
support behind our Sauce business.
Earnings within Global Baking and Snacking declined by 12% on lower earnings at Arnott's. The decline there was
primarily due to the impact of cost inflation and lower sales volumes, partially offset by the favorable impact of
currency. Pepperidge Farm earnings were comparable to a year ago, as the impact of cost inflation was offset by higher
selling prices and productivity gains.
Within international Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings declined by 16%, primarily due to lower earnings in
Canada and the Asia-Pacific regions.
Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages declined by 45%. This was primarily due to double-digit inflation from juice
concentrates and packaging material, the negative impact of increased promotional spending, and increased advertising.
Given the competitive environment, we increased marketing spending both in trade promotions and advertising to step
up our support for this business.
Operating earnings within North America Foodservice increased by $4 million, primarily driven by higher selling
prices and productivity improvements, partly offset by cost inflation.
U.S. Soup sales are detailed here. In the quarter, lower volumes were partly offset by higher selling prices. As we have
discussed, we shifted our promotional strategy in the middle of last year. As anticipated, the shift is having a negative
impact on volume and sales, which will continue through the first half of this fiscal year.
Within soup, condensed sales decreased by 4%, with declines in both eating and cooking varieties. Ready-to-serve was
down by 9%, reflecting declines in both canned and microwaveable soups. The RTS segment has been the most
impacted by price realization through reduced promotional spending. Broth sales rose 6%, primarily driven by higher
selling prices and volume gains, mostly in aseptic cartons.
The U.S. wet soup category performance from the latest 52 weeks based on IRI panel data and Campbell internal
estimates are shown here. The overall category rose in dollars by 0.4% in the past 52 weeks. Our soup sales declined by
2.6%, underperforming the category due to volume declines associated with our reductions in trade spending, which
began February 1, and our list price increase beginning in mid-June. Other branded players increased U.S. soup sales
by 4.7% during the period, while private label soup sales rose by 7%.
While it's not shown on the chart, total volume in the soup category declined slightly versus the prior 52 weeks.
Campbell's market share decreased 1.9 points as we focused on stabilizing soup profits. The share decline was driven
by ready-to-serve soup as our market share from condensed soup and broth were essentially unchanged.
Moving now to cash flow from operations, it was a source of $73 million compared to a use of $29 million in the prior
period. Cash flow benefited from a $72 million reduction in pension contributions and a $49 million decrease in
working capital requirements. Capital expenditures of $35 million were up from $27 million a year ago. During the
quarter, we broke ground on our new R&D facility at Pepperidge Farm, which will contribute to our innovation efforts
going forward. For the year, we continue to forecast capital spending of approximately $325 million.
During the first quarter we repurchased 2.6 million shares at a cost of $85 million under our strategic share repurchase
program announced in June 2011. Net debt was $2.7 billion, a decrease of $85 million.
Last July, we discussed our new strategies to stabilize and then profitably grow North America Soup and Simple Meals,
expand our international presence, and continue to drive growth in healthy beverages and baked snacks. Fiscal 2012
represents a transition year as we make the investments necessary to return to our long-term growth target rates.

Our expectations for 2012 remain unchanged, with net sales growth to be between zero and 2%. And we expect a
decline in EBIT of between 9% and 7%, and a decline in adjusted EPS of between 7% and 5%. We expect increased
marketing spending for the balance of the year as well as improved sales and gross margin trends.
Now we'll move to Q&A, thank you.

At this time we'll conduct a Q&A session. We'd like to request that callers limit themselves to one question and stay on
the line in case clarifications are needed. That way, we hope to respond to more callers. And if you have further
questions, you can just get back into the queue.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: On the past call, you guided to flattish gross margins for the full year. And I realize with
margins in the first quarter being perhaps a little weaker than at least we had modeled, I guess I'm wondering if that's
still a reasonable assumption for the full year. And the reason I ask is that if not, with the top line and EBIT guidance
unchanged, I'm trying to get a sense of what this implies for SG&A and if Campbell is still committed to the $100
million in incremental spend around marketing and innovation for the year.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Let me start with the last piece of that and say that we are committed to the incremental spend
against innovation and marketing. In the first quarter, we were cycling the worst inflation comparison that we'll have
across the full year. And we probably had a little bit of a negative – a more negative mix composition in the first
quarter than we would expect to have for the balance of the year, Andrew. I think that for the balance of the year, for
the remaining three quarters we would still be expecting gross margin to be essentially flat. Whether we'll get back all
of the reduction we had in the first quarter or not, I'm not sure. But I think we'll be essentially flat for the balance of the
year.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Is there anything else that changes that allows to keep your EBIT guidance for the year the
same, or is it more – that's the reason for the range, I guess?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Partially that's the reason for the range. But again, if you think about the profile of the P&L
this quarter, the things that would be different as we look forward would be an expectation for a stronger top line, a
somewhat better mix composition, stronger gross margin. And those things would give us the ability to show the higher
marketing spend as we go forward in the balance of the three quarters and still hit within the range of our bottom line.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Regarding the $100 million investment, we are absolutely committed to it. We've ramped
up staff and funded our Innovation Breakthrough teams in R&D. And we are building a consumer validated pipeline
for fiscal 2013 and beyond. And then you will continue to see increases in advertising and consumer promotion as the
year unfolds versus year ago.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks very much.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: And our next question, please.

Our next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi, good morning, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess the first question I have has to do with the – is there anything short term or
intermediate term, Denise, that you think can be done to change the dynamics in beverages at Arnott's? It just seems
that's to a certain extent more macro driven in the case of Australia. And for beverages, it just seems like unless the
competition goes away or the category for whatever reason turns around, it's a little bit out of your control.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It's true that the shelf-stable juice category has weakened. And despite our declines, we
actually did outperform the category. However, we believe that given the new entrants into the fruit and vegetable
segments of the category as well as vegetable-based segments that we really needed to increase our promotion and
protect our business. Now we have our new products shipping, starting with V8 V-Fusion Smoothies, which early days
look really positive, and our new advertising has started too. So, what we really would like to do as the year unfolds is
rely more on the innovation and the brand building and much less on the price promotion going forward. But we'll have
to watch the dynamics of the category because this is a very important business for us.
In regards to Arnott's, it's needless to say that we are revising our plans to respond to this new reality. And we believe
that we have very strong brands in that marketplace, and we'll continue to work that. And the other thing we are doing
is introducing new products into the market.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Do I get a follow-up, Jennifer?
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Sure.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. I guess just having observed the company for a long time now, it seems that when it
comes to the soup advertising or promotion, the company over the years just has tried like advertising in the fiscal
fourth quarter and tried to boost the business in a non-seasonally important part. And then, obviously, you've changed
what happened a year ago. But I guess is it – maybe it's a tough question to answer. But is it really about the timing of
the advertising or promotion? Isn't it at the end of the day just about the quality of the soup during the height of the
soup season, and that's really what's going to make a difference and not what seems like a never-ending shift as to what
the company thinks is the right time or not the right time to advertise or promote the product?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think that quality in a product is always important, and we at Campbell's take that very
seriously. I do think, though, that based on what we did last year in the first quarter with the heavy discounting and the
front-loading of our advertising, the fact that we are cycling with a whole different program this year is definitely going
to show up in the comps, and so we felt that we had to explain that.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you.

<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So, as you look into analyzing the first quarter, and I think you were pretty clear I guess
going into – I think going back to the fourth quarter call that in soup, you were expecting a pretty tough quarter just
because you were raising prices, you had less promotional activity and your advertising wasn't going to hit until late in
the quarter. And it looks like the volume elasticities were not worse than you thought they were going to be or I think
maybe even a little bit better. As the advertising has hit and as we start to model, I guess, the second and third quarters,
have you begun to see at all a positive of being effect of being on air more? Has it had some effect on the elasticities?
I'm just trying to get a sense for whether now you're getting some traction from having more support behind the price
increase.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We're not going to comment on the current month or partial quarter in any way.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Right.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right, but I think that what I can comment on is that we were encouraged by the fact that
the volume declines weren't as severe as we modeled them and that the elasticities were, in fact, better. That said, we
know that to grow this category, we need to shift from stocking up to brand usage, and so the increase in marketing and
advertising in quarter two and quarter three will be against that particular goal. So, our expectation is that we'll continue
to cycle a tough quarter in quarter two and we'll be cycling comparable conditions starting February 1. But we will be
in full swing for both quarters.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: And just maybe, as you looked at the first quarter, just any idea or any insight into why the
elasticities ended up being better than you thought? Is it because the product proposition is better? Is it because the
competition did something different? I'm just trying to understand that in terms of trying to extrapolate into the second
quarter what we should be modeling.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I believe that last year when we did the heavy promotion discounting, we didn't get the
volume lift that we had anticipated because given the recessionary environment, the consumer stock-up behavior had
fundamentally changed. Thus when we had better price realization, the lifts were actually a little better than what we
thought. So, I think that what we learned here is that the consumer is willing to pay a higher price for the product. That
said, we have to make sure we maintain a good balance of promotional activity with regular pricing in the marketplace.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: You're welcome, Bryan; next question, please.

<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Chris.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I just had a couple questions for you on U.S. Soup. I know you had the launch of
Slow Kettle in the quarter. You also had some new products a year ago. I'm just curious maybe if you have any color
on Slow Kettle initially. And then maybe in relation to that, year over year was there a benefit or detriment from new
product activity in U.S. Soup?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: First of all, just the sheer number of new product entries in U.S. Soup was about 27 new
SKUs this year versus three last year, so we hit the market with some force. And just to highlight really two new
products that show early signs of encouragement: one, as you mentioned, Slow Kettle; and the second is Swanson
Flavor Boost. It's too early really to gauge consumer reaction at this point. But we have achieved our distribution
targets and we've got our merchandising plans in place. So, far, our Slow Kettle distribution and velocity is on plan.

And our Swanson Flavor Boost velocities are above target, and we believe that's due to the fact that we have now
started our advertising and FSI [Free Standing Insert] support against that.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: We're very happy with the sales execution, but I don't think you would have seen much impact
in the actual numbers in the first quarter.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right, not yet.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: So, far, it has been pretty limited.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, and then I just wanted to follow up on a previous – I think it was Bryan's
question. But the marketing and the R&D and the increased investment of $100 million for the year, was that skewed at
all to other divisions, so is U.S. Beverages getting more of that money than maybe you thought? I'm really more
interested in how soup spending – as you see it today, does that have to increase more or less than you thought, or is it
just on plan?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: First of all, I think there are two things that are important here. One is that when think about
the $100 million, you can think about it in lots of different parts of our P&L. We're supporting new product
introduction with money that would show up in trade spend. We're increasing marketing spend. In this past quarter, for
example, we made considerable investment in beverages and our sauce business. As the year progresses, you'll see
some increased advertising in soup. We're also supporting SG&A kinds of expenses in the P&L as we've put the
innovation platforms that we've talked about together in CNA [Campbell North America].
The other thing, and I think Denise made this point particularly back in July, it's not just a matter of tossing an extra
$100 million in on top of what we were doing. There has been a tremendous amount of redirection of activity and effort
in the base spending so that we feel that we are being more effective in our spending within the R&D line; that we're
being more effective with our spending inside the marketing programs against some of these products. So, even in the
event that say advertising against a particular product line may not be up significantly, we think we're spending a little
more wisely, and we're definitely more focused on new product and innovation. So, I guess my point is it's a little hard
to score-keep across all those different dimensions against the $100 million without also thinking about redirected
activity within the base.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, that's helpful.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We set up an operating committee to work with this with a large amount of discipline to
make sure that we're tracking where the money is spent and how we're getting the best returns for that investment, but
this is going to take us some time.

Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thank you. I guess I'm still a little confused on where the money is being spent. I think that
your advertising campaign for look what soup can do is expected to be only mildly higher than it was a year ago, a little
above $100 million. And then I look at the R&D line and it's flat versus year ago. Denise, you said that you're staffing
up and you're probably testing a bunch of ideas, but I guess I'm just not clear. I would have expected R&D certainly to
be up higher. I would have expected market research to be higher. Where are you right now in testing a pipeline of
ideas that can come out in fiscal 2013?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We have a full-court press against developing this consumer validated pipeline. And we
have – remember, we had a number of R&D and consumer insights resources on sodium reduction in the past. We've

been able to repurpose a large number of those resources towards developing new disruptive innovation, particularly in
the area of Simple Meals, because we already had a pretty robust group against beverage and baked snacks. But it is in
absolute full swing, and we're pretty pleased with the progress that they're making. That's not necessarily showing up in
the P&L as you look at the numbers versus year ago because there has been some reallocation. But as the year
advances, you will start to see the advertising in consumer line jump.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: I get it. And then, Craig, can you remind us if there's anything in that $100 million, any
assumption on higher incentive comp hitting your numbers this year?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: No, we have said that we have a headwind of about $20 million on incentive comp, but that is
not in any way counted in the $100 million.

Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Investment. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Alexis Borden>: Hi, good morning. This is actually Alexis Borden in for David this morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, how are you?
<Q - Alexis Borden>: Good, just a question. We saw some volume weakness across international baking snacking;
baking and snacking, of course, on the Australia side. Did you expect these volume declines, and what do you see
going forward? Do you think volumes are going to rebound, or is this a trend here?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Did you mean throughout global, just to clarify, Global Baking and Snacking, or just
Australia Baking and Snacking in particular were you asking about volume?
<Q - Alexis Borden>: Both the international segment and the one also, Global Baking and Snacking.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We anticipate that the Pepperidge Farm part of our business, which performed well in the
first quarter, will continue on that trajectory. We are dealing with a slower consumer environment in Australia. We did
have more price realization in quarter one, and we believe the pricing that the consumer experienced negatively
impacted our volumes, so we are revising our plans to respond to this new reality. And we will continue to support our
brands with strong levels of marketing support and introduce new products. And so we expect that there will be a
positive response to this.
<Q - Alexis Borden>: But what about the international Simple Meals and Beverages? Volumes were down 7%. Do
you see further volume losses there?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: We got off to a pretty tough start in both pieces of our Australia business, so Denise talked
about Global Baking and Snacking. The soup side of that business was weakish also for some of the same reasons with
respect to consumer weakness in Australia. And the European business, frankly, was soft, particularly in Germany and
France.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: And the other point to make there is we employed the same strategy in Canada that we
did in the U.S., so volumes are down significantly in Canada as we pulled back significantly on our trade promotion
levels.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: And so as with U.S. Simple Meals, we would expect to see some strengthening as we move
through the year there.

Our next question comes from David Palmer of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning, David.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Just a question on the advertising. How do you anticipate your trends, the consumer response
to advertising, which has ramped up lately? Is it typical that the response is gradual? Do you expect a gradual ramp up
in consumer spending, particularly that non-promoted volume, or is this something where you typically see more of an
immediate response as you remind them of soup on that occasion?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Advertising typically takes a little bit longer than the immediate gratification of a
promotion. However, there have been some changes in our advertising that are really, really important. We did repeat
an anthem spot because that really showed some good diagnostics last year. What we did was we revised our
condensed soup spots to highlight more of the emotional aspects of the brands given consumer feedback, so that's
fundamentally different. We were also featuring our icons, Chicken Noodle Soup, Tomato, in those spots, which we did
not do last year when we featured the other varieties. We continued with Chunky in the campaign as is because that
was a very strong response. So, we believe overall that we've learned from what worked last year and what didn't, and
we strengthened the campaign. But we do expect that that campaign will take time to seed and grow the business.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: If I can just squeeze one more in, how would you characterize the pricing right now in the
soup aisle? It looks like there are some broader price increases by competition out there in just the last month or so of
the data, but maybe that's just a blip.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: No, we moved prices up in June, but your observations are correct. In quarter one, we're
starting to see other branded and private label competitors improve their price realization.

juice concentrates. And the other thing is that we've seen a lot of competitive entrants into the category, so we have
been intentionally being very competitive with respect to price and with respect to promotional activity to defend the
territory that we've carved out there.
Historically, I would say that the V8 red juice tends to be very responsive to the overall consumer environment and
tends to weaken somewhat in difficult economies, strengthen somewhat in stronger economies. We've continued to see
good growth from our innovative product entries, but we haven't gotten as much margin as we would normally like in
those areas because of circumstances that I just described. So, I think as you look forward, clearly we would expect to
restore some margin to the category over time. But in the short term, it's going to be a rough piece of the business for us
because of those circumstances.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: And just as a quick follow-up, can you tell us if there's historically much margin seasonality
within that business? We obviously know last year's numbers. But over a longer period of time, are certain quarters
higher versus lower margins in that business typically?

Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, thank you. I ask this call on almost every call every quarter now. I just want to focus on
the balance sheet and buybacks. I know consistently over the past 10 years, you buy back shares every year. In the past
three years on average, every year you've been buying back about $600 million. It sounds like some of your options are
starting to roll off more, so I'm just curious. This year I saw you bought back some shares in Q1. But should we be
modeling in a $500 million cash outflow, or just some color on expectation for incremental buybacks this year
especially because you're so under-levered?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: We don't give a forecast on share buyback by the year. As you know, we've got a $1 billion
buyback program that was approved last June.
I think the best thing I can do is just relate back to what we say about cash flow. First priority is reinvestment in our
business for good return. Our second priority is to the extent that we can identify good candidates for acquisition and
are partnership kinds of activities, invest in the expansion in our international business or in our domestic business. In
those ways, we try to be very consistent with respect to the way that we handle the dividend. And the share repurchase
is the last and most flexible piece of the cash flow picture for us. And in order to keep it that way, we don't lock
ourselves into a specific forecast for the year.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, and then just a quick follow-up on the comment you just made too on cash flow. If I look
on average over the past five years, you've actually spent more on the dividend than you have on CapEx and purchasing
new assets combined. So, I'm just – if I'm thinking forward three or five or ten years for a stable business as yours on
the cash flow side, do you think that would ever reverse? Do you think – would you ever potentially hold the dividend
flat, not grow the dividend but grow more in acquisitions and value creating investments?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: We tend to look at the dividend versus the peer group that we're in. And while we don't have a
written policy from the Board, we hang around the middle of the payout ratio of the peer set. And I think that would be
the reasonable expectation looking forward.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, thanks. I'll pass it on.

<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Jason.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason English>: So, innovation this quarter, you guys had a lot of it coming to market. I think, Denise, you
highlighted soup going from three to 27. Was there any pipeline benefit just as you stock up warehouses, get that on
shelf that we should be aware of this quarter?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Not one that would be very material to the numbers, Jason, no.
<Q - Jason English>: Okay. Thank you, that's helpful. Looking at soup in aggregate, you guys had a lot of comments
about – you're upbeat on elasticity. It's coming in better. You're feeling good about innovation. You're feeling good
about the efficacy of your marketing even if the magnitude is down year on year. How do we put that with some of the
performance, though? Because I look at soup, particularly RTS; it's down 9% this quarter. It was down 13% the same
quarter last year. Is that really better than what you guys were expecting this quarter?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Actually, the overall soup performance was better than what we were expecting this
quarter in that we said that we were going to stabilize the category from a profitability standpoint for us and then grow
net sales. And believe me, when we went away from the price discounting that we did last year and the volumes came
in better than expected and therefore the profitability was better than expected, we believe we're on our way to
stabilizing our business and then profitably growing from that base.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Just to give some more context on that, our volume performance in soup in the first quarter,
despite the list price increase in the fourth quarter and the reduction in trade, is better than the back half of last year.
<Q - Jason English>: Where was the increase in trade then? Because I see your promotions were negative 1% this
quarter as a contributor to sales. Was that more sauces and salsa?

Our next question comes from Eric Serotta with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your next question.
<Q - Eric Adam Serotta>: I think you just answered it, but I just wanted to go through a little bit more color on the
trade spending in U.S. Simple Meals. It's surprising to me that overall trade spending in Simple Meals could be up
when it's down for the U.S. Soup business. Just given the relative size of soup versus sauces, how is that the case?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Part of it is the nuance to how we calculate these variances. Certainly on a dollar basis,
year-on-year trade promotion spending is down in U.S. Soup. When we do the sales variances, you can think of it as if
we're doing it on a rate per case idea. So, promotional spending is down and volume is down, and that's why you don't
see it on the sales variance as much.

<Q - Diane Geissler>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: You're welcome.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: I just wanted to talk about the shipment versus scanner. I think this might be a function of what
you talked about earlier in the call when you said you saw some channel shift with traditional retail bearing the brunt of
the changing shopping patterns. But I'm particularly concerned about the ready-to-serve segment, which seemed to
show for the 12-week basis a bigger decline than your shipments. So, is that just a function of consumers are shopping
in channels that aren't part of the scanner data, or is there a little bit of buildup because we know that advertising is
going to get turned on? What do you attribute that to?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We found that for the quarter, shipments track consumption more closely than what we
experienced last year. In quarter one, typically we ship ahead of consumption because we're building for the season, but
we did see a lower level of customer inventory than last year. And we believe that in the prior year because of the
heavy discounting we did, we were definitely shipping more cases ahead of consumption in the quarter last year. And
we do track customer inventories for the majority of our customers. And actually, our inventories are down versus year
ago. But we believe that the shipments are pretty much in line with consumption.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay, and then can you just clarify for me? When did you turn advertising on last year? When
did you turn it on this year? And then when did you turn it off, speaking about soup last year, so I can get some idea
about, you turned it on in August and this year you turned it on in September, or just give me a timeline?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, we turned it on August 1 last year against our Reignite Condensed launch, and we
were pretty much done by the halftime. And this year, we turned it on the week after Labor Day. This is in soup, the
week after Labor Day, and we intend to go through the end of the third quarter. In beverages, we turned on the

Denise M. Morrison
So, before we conclude our first quarter call, let me leave you with a few thoughts. The important point I want to make
is while it's early, we are clear where we're headed and we're beginning to execute our strategies. We'll continue to do
what we said we would do. And we'll continue to tell you what's working, what's not, and what we're doing about it.
And while our first quarter financial performance was largely in line with our expectations, we recognize that we've got
more work to do in our categories.
Stepping back, the quarter serves to reinforce our conviction that more brand building and innovation are needed to
deliver the profitable sales growth that we want. And as we focus forward, we're determined to build a different
company at Campbell, one that creates value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth. Thank you.
