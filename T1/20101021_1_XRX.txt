MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the Xerox Corporation Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by
Ursula Burns, the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. She's joined by Larry Zimmerman, Vice
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the
web at www.xerox.com/investor.
At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and or rebroadcasting
of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by
their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially
different than those expressed herein.
At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.
Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on slide three. Building on our solid first half results,
we delivered steady revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter keeping us on track to close the year strong and
giving us confidence to increase our earnings expectations for this year and 2011.
Remember that we're reporting not only GAAP earnings, but also adjusted EPS to take into account the ACS
acquisition. We're also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results. Our third
quarter pro forma revenue was up 2%, or 4% in constant currency. We delivered Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.22, above our
guidance of 0.19 to $0.21. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.17 per share. This includes restructuring and
intangibles. Cash from operations was 366 million. We generated 1.4 billion through quarter three, and we are still on

track to deliver 2.6 billion in operating cash and 2 billion in free cash flow for the full year.
Cost and expense management continues to be a top priority contributing to a nearly one point improvement in
operating margin, and we're well on target with our revenue and cost synergies. We also plan to implement additional
cost reduction activities this year and into 2011. This gives us more flexibility in our business, so we can continue
improving operating margins while maintaining investments to drive growth. As a result, we'll take a Q4 restructuring
charge that is $120 million higher than previously disclosed. Larry will talk more about this in a moment.
First, I'll review our revenue results, Larry will cover our financial performance, and then we'll both take your
questions. Let's turn to slide four. Our revenue is now almost equally split between technology and services. This gives
us a steady mix of annuity that comes from both segments. In technology, we generate recurring revenue from service
and supplies that support our document products. Multiyear outsourcing contracts are the source of strong annuity from
our services business.
Total revenue of 5.4 billion was up 48%. On a pro forma basis it was up 2% or 4% in constant currency and it has been
sequentially higher each quarter this year with 2% growth in Q1, 3% in Q2, and now 4% in Q3. Good trends that reflect
our strengthening leadership in the marketplace and track with the modest economic improvements we began seeing in
Q4 of last year.
Annuity revenue on a pro forma basis was flat in the quarter, up 2% in constant currency. Equipment sales continue to
grow, the result of strong demand for new products, expanded coverage, and more focused investments in marketing to
support our channel partners.
In Q3 we grew equipment sales 13%, or 15% in constant currency. Through the third quarter, we have launched 17
products, and we introduced more color printers this week that broaden our competitive offerings for businesses small
to large. So while there is a lot of attention on our growing services business, it's really important to note that we are
investing and benefiting from a rich product portfolio that delivers healthy recurring revenue. Slides 5 show some of
the key metrics in this area.
In our technology business, we monitor page growth and machines in field, or MIF. It's worth repeating the formula for
success here. More MIF leads to more pages. More pages generate more revenue from supplies and technical service,
both of which flow through to our annuity stream. For Q3, we saw growth in MIF supporting a 20% increase in installs.
This install activity reflects solid demand across all product segments and speaks to the strength of our new products
and our focus on expanding distribution. Our leadership in color printing continues to drive an increase in share of MIF
and pages.
Total color revenue grew 10% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our ColorQube 9000 series and the
strong launch earlier this year of the Xerox Color 800 and 1000 series. Color pages were up 9% year-over-year. We
continue to see this as a good sign that color usage trends are improving, which helps to offset declines in black and
white pages. These declines are most notable in production black and white and they align with industry trends as pages
move to color and more transactional pages, like bill statements, move online.
That's why our growth strategy is focused on advancing digital printing to create more color pages. During Graph Expo
earlier this month, we showed this firsthand. At the very busy Xerox booth, we put the spotlight not on the product, but
on the customizable color applications that can produce only – that can be produced only on Xerox digital technology.
The services side of our business, signings were $3 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, we grew signings 26%. That's
up from 12% growth in Q2 and it represents some very large wins including the customer care service we're now
providing for Italian mobile media company 3 Italia, as well as multimillion dollar government contracts for services
like processing child support payments for the state of Wisconsin.
The joint sales activities between Xerox and the ACS have resulted in more than 30 revenue synergy deals that deliver
significant total contract value for the company. This includes a couple of deals in Europe where we're very early in our
penetration, but quickly following the leads from our customers and from our global cross-selling teams. And we've
developed a synergy pipeline of more than $3.5 billion year to date, up $1 billion from last quarter, reflecting the

incremental opportunity of our two companies coming together.
So to sum up the quarter, demand continues to improve for our technology, especially in color, and across the board in
businesses of all size. Since the economy started slowly to improve around last year at this time, we have seen
consistent trends each quarter, particularly stronger growth in our developing markets and from small and mid-size
businesses, as well as a modest uptick from large enterprises. The benefit of our broad product line and expanded
services certainly gives us a competitive advantage as companies begin to invest back into their businesses. Along with
double-digit equipment sales growth, multi-year service contracts continue to fuel our annuity, which is now 83% of
our total revenue. So all in all, we continue to track positively this year, positioning us well to close the year strong.
And that's a good place for me to turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Ursula, and good morning. Third quarter results showed positive performance as our business model
continues to deliver, revenue growth for both technology and services, good cost and expense management, growth in
earnings and operating margin, and positive balance sheet results. Let's start with our technology slide.
Technology revenue grew 3% and 5% at constant currency and represents 2.5 billion, or 45% of our business, with a
segment margin of 10%. All three product categories, entry, mid-range, and high-end, performed well and had
double-digit growth in both installs and equipment sale revenue. This is a positive sign for future post-sale annuity
revenue growth.
In entries, installs continued strong with positive contributions across geographies and channels. Mid-range
performance accelerated, reflecting continued strength in the ColorQube 9000 series and in our color laser portfolio, as
well as good improvement in A3 black and white. ColorQube, with its high image quality, ease of use, and unique
pricing options, has yielded a high competitive knockout rate of around 50% and reflects Xerox's differentiated
innovation.
And we're not standing still in our laser products. We just announced this month the WorkCentre 7545 and 7556 Color
MFP, which brings leadership quality, productivity, and price value to the marketplace. And the results in high-end
were very encouraging, with positive install growth in color and black and white and a very successful showing at
Graph Expo in early October. The recently launched Xerox Color 800/1000 continues to be the largest contributor to
growth, but in addition, our Color Continuous Feed had a good quarter and iGen continues to do well in a challenging
commercial print environment.
At Graph Expo, we announced the iGen EXP that increases the iGen sheet size to 26 inches, increasing productivity
and further opens up more applications to digital. The black and white market certainly remains pressured, but we were
pleased with the positive install growth we saw in third quarter. With revenue growth of 5% at constant currency and
segment margins of 10%, it was a very strong quarter for technology.
Slide seven. The services segment is comprised of three lines of business, business process outsourcing, document
outsourcing, and information technology outsourcing. Revenue mix for the quarter was about 56% business process
outsourcing, 31% document outsourcing, and 13% IT outsourcing. On a pro forma basis, total revenue grew 3% at
constant currency driven by BPO, which was up 8%. BPO growth areas include customer care, government and
commercial healthcare, financial services, and human resource outsourcing.
Revenue growth was driven by prior quarter signings as well as volume increasing – increases in existing contracts.
Document outsourcing and ITO growth remained impacted by the relatively weak economic environment, although
pipeline is strong for both. Document outsourcing had strong year-over-year new business and total contract signings,
although account volumes remained pressured. Operating margin of 11.2% is up almost a point, and reflects higher
revenues, effective portfolio management, as well as savings from restructuring and synergies.

Indicators for future revenues were very positive, as signings and pipeline growth were strong. On a trailing 12-month
basis, new business signings, including a growing amount of synergy signings, grew 17% and total signings at 3 billion
grew 26%. Additionally, signings growth rates improved quarter-over-quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total services pipeline by 34%, including synergies which are now over 3.5
billion. We expect to see the benefits of this pipeline in the coming quarters. So positive results in both the technology
and services segments.
Slide eight. Pro forma revenue grew 2% and 4% at constant currency and has improved each quarter this year.
Operating margin also continues to show good results, up nearly a point year-over-year. Gross profit margin at 33.6 is
within our business model range of 33 to 35%, and on a pro forma basis is down slightly year-over-year. We have done
a lot of cost work to offset the year-to-year pressure of changes in foreign exchange rates.
This cost work, coupled with hedging and currency sharing with our partner Fuji Xerox, supports our continued
guidance of gross profit margin between 33 to 35%. RD&E continues to reflect restructuring efficiencies, SAG
decreased 18 million on a pro forma basis and improved as a percent of revenue by .8 year-over-year. Improvements in
G&A and bad debts expense were partially offset by investments in selling.
In year-to-date, we've recognized about 75 million in cost synergies and are on track to overachieve our base case of
100 million for the year. In total, revenue leverage and cost and expense savings improved operating margin by almost
a point to 9.2%. We are pleased with the year-to-date progress on operating margin and will continue to drive for
improvements. Our plan is to incur an additional 120 million of restructuring charges over the 280 million previously
announced. This will allow us to capture synergies earlier and take additional cost actions to address a still weak
economy and unfavorable currency.
Our adjusted tax rate was 32% and we delivered $0.22 of EPS on an adjusted basis. We continue to differentiate
between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give you transparency
into the fundamentals of our business. As a reminder, 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis exclude amortization of
intangibles, restructuring, and asset impairment costs, acquisition related costs, including direct transaction costs, and
specifically defined integration costs and any discrete unusual items. So overall, a very good quarter driven by revenue
growth and cost and expense management.
Slide nine. In Q3, we've delivered 366 million of cash flow from operations, driven by earnings. Working capital used
174 million of cash in the quarter as we built up inventory related to new product launches and for fourth quarter
activity. We expect working capital to be a significant source of cash in Q4 as it has been historically. Year-to-date,
cash flow from operations is 1.4 billion and has absorbed acquisition integration related outflows of 144 million and
restructuring payments of 148 million. Third quarter cash flow was 220 million, with CapEx and cost of incremental
software of 145 million. Our full-year estimate of CapEx is approximately 600 million.
Cash from financing was the use of 231 million and we ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash. We expect a
strong fourth quarter consistent with our cash flow model and our year – and our full-year outlook is for 2.6 billion of
cash from operations and 2 billion of free cash flow.
Next slide. Continuing on our cash, we are making excellent progress on paying down our debt to get to our desired
leverage. On February 5, 2010, we had 10.5 billion of debt. Since then, we have paid down 1 billion of debt and we
expect in fourth quarter to pay down an additional 900 million to bring us to an ending year-end debt balance of 8.6
billion, 100 million ahead of our projection.
As announced during second quarter, we have called our 2003 ten-year bond, so 550 million. In our fourth quarter we
expect to report a $15 million charge as a discrete item, which represents 8 million of a non-cash item of unamortized
debt cost and 7 million of premium. The early call of this bond not only saves us interest expense, but gives us an
increased flexibility in debt reduction. The top box – the top right box shows the math that gets us to 8.6 billion
year-end debt. We are well positioned to have at least 1 billion of cash available in 2011.

Now let's look at the debt in the financing dynamics box. I continue to show this debt breakdown to ensure there is
perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment grade rating. We
have 9.5 billion of debt of which 6.2 billion is in support of our financing business. The finance receivables of 7.1
billion is a committed revenue stream from our customers. In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our
annual free cash flow and total liquidity so we can access capital markets opportunistically. And just to touch on
receivables, we continue to see significant improvement in both write-off experience and requirements for bad debt
provisions.
So we are making significant progress paying down debt. Remaining debt primarily supports the financing of our
customer equipment. Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong. We are focusing on significant debt reduction in
2010, which will enable a return to other cash uses as share repurchase during 2011.
In summary, we continue to be very encouraged by our results and we are optimistic going forward. And now I'll give
it back to Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Larry. This is the year we transformed our company into the world leading enterprise for business process and
document management. With nine months under our belt, we have been successful in leveraging our brand, our global
scale and innovation to win multimillion dollar deals for business process, IT, and document outsourcing. During the
third quarter alone, signings for service contracts grew 26%, and revenue from our BPO offerings was up 8%. Along
with 13% growth in equipment sales, this progress fuels our healthy annuity stream for the long-term.
With ACS now with Xerox Company, we're capturing synergies from the acquisition to deliver more – to deliver above
our $100 million target for year one. And as I noted earlier, through our cross selling, we've signed more than 30
synergy deals so far this year and generated a synergy pipeline of $3.5 billion. There is no doubt that Xerox today is
more differentiated in the marketplace. We're more competitively advantaged and we're growing our top line.
At the same time, we're disciplined in controlling cost. We're generating strong cash flow, and we're delivering solid
bottom line results. I am confident this progress will continue. As a result, we are raising our full-year guidance for this
year and for 2011 to reflect a positive momentum we're building in the marketplace and the efficiencies that we're
driving across the business. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of 0.28 to $0.29 per share.
This will bring us to a full-year adjusted EPS of 0.92 to $0.93, up from 0.88 to $0.92 per share. And we now expect
2011 full-year adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10, up from $0.95 to $1.05 per share.
With that, I thank you again for joining us today, and I'd like to open it up for your questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And congrats on a solid quarter. I was hoping to ask a question
about supplies. It did look like supplies were perhaps a little bit below normal seasonal in the quarter and was just
wondering if there was any particular story there? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you, Richard. Hello.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Hi.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We've – what we saw in supply, if you remember
for the first three quarters of – first two quarters of this year and the last quarter of last year, we saw a pull-down, a bit
of a pull-down in supplies, particularly through 2009. And we started to see a little bit of a bounce back in the trail – in

the beginning of 2010. So what we're seeing now is a leveling off of that supply to inventory in the channel. And so I
wouldn't actually interpret that or read a lot into it except for to say that I think that our partners are at a good supply
level. So nothing unusual. I think that they're at a level that they can actually operate their business effectively.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. Great. And then for Larry, Larry, could you just give us a little bit more detail on
what the additional restructuring actions for Q4 and 2011 entail and exactly what you're planning on doing there?
Thanks.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay. Thanks. Good morning.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Good morning.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Restructuring is focused on actually
all areas across the business to keep us cost competitive. And it's really focused on getting ahead of the curve here. We
have obviously had a lot of pressure on costs associated with unfavorable exchange rates, particularly the yen. And we
wanted to get restructuring all behind us as we go into 2011 so that we have sort of a clean playing field going forward.
So it's across the board. There's a lot of focus on product cost, supply chain, cost of service in particular, infrastructure,
generally spread across those areas.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Larry, if I could just follow up one more time. What exactly can you do in terms of
restructuring to help you with the yen problem? It seems like – I know you have a currency sharing agreement with
Fuji Xerox, and I think you go back and renegotiate pricing with them based on yen moves, but what would fall into the
restructuring bucket that would help you there, please?
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I think the first thing is the
way we approach currency changes is that it's cost. So you have to get in your mind that it's cost, and you have to
compare where cost was, where it is, and where it needs to go. And it just means that you have to find ways to get your
cost lower. So some of that happens through changing your sourcing to some degree, which we've tried to optimize.
Some of it is restructuring around the whole supply chain of how you move product around the world, where you store
it, those kinds of things have to be focused on, and there's restructuring around that. And then you have to look at other
areas where you can't do any additional in that specific. You have to look at other areas that offset it.
So even though infrastructure has nothing to do with currency, in order to make sure that we have a balanced operating
margin, which is really the important measurement here, you know, we go after other areas. So I might take
infrastructure out of corporate to offset some of exchange rate effects because you can't get it all in the short term. And
so I think that's how we look at it.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Richard, if I may just add on to Larry's
point, it's important to actually broaden the spectrum when we look at what's happened from a currency perspective in
2010 and what we suspect will continue on a go-forward basis. So Larry's point, I just want to reiterate it, is not that we
actually look at the source of the problem, which in this case is currency. We look at all of the areas and levers that we
can pull as a solution to that problem. And that's not only where the source is. It's everywhere in the corporation. And
we don't expect there to be a huge positive turn in currency in next year, so we have to prepare ourselves for this today
being the reality on a go-forward basis.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. Great. All right. Well, thank you.

<Q - Shannon Cross>: I'm good. I'm good especially after this quarter. So could you talk a bit about printing trends
and what we're just trying to understand is sort of where the pages are coming in. Clearly color continues to grow, but
what you're hearing from your customers in terms of their willingness to print and any thoughts you have on sort of the
impact from tablets and some of the other pressures out there?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's a great question. What we're seeing is a
continuation of one set of trends and a little bit of a pickup in another. So let me talk about the continuation of trends.
Black and white pages at the high-end are still declining, and they're declining for a couple of reasons. One is driven by
Xerox, and that's a big push towards color. And we continue to invest R&D, selling, marketing, everything that we can
towards pushing more and more color pages, and that clearly is helping customers decide to move to color. The second
is that there are certain technologies, Internet technologies, e-technologies that drive pages away, particularly
transactional, like bill pages, away towards viewing, towards other mechanisms to see them and to operate on them.
Those trends are continuing, and they're moving pages away from black and white, particularly at the high-end.
What we see on the flip side is a move more toward color. We show that with color page growth, color revenue growth,
color as a percentage of our revenue growing, and that's positive. And our position in the marketplace in color is
stronger than our competitors' by far across every industry, across every line of business, every product type, across
every industry. So color is increasing as it has been, and black and white, particularly at the high-end, is decreasing.
We're also seeing a move as we push more in BPO towards operating an infrastructure a little bit less on a paper base
and moving it more towards a services base.
So while these things are moving around, we are preparing and prepared to cover a document process that is paper
based in any means that the customer wants to be able to operate on it. So we see smaller, medium businesses,
obviously developing markets doing better than U.S. large businesses, but we're also seeing a little trend up in
enterprise printing, particularly in color. Net-net – I gave you a long answer. Net-net, good movement. Black and white
down at the high end. We're covering that with color, increasing color up everywhere, and we have color offerings
everywhere. BPO picking up across the board.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Okay. Great. And then just sort of a follow-up on that. In terms of the competitive landscape,
can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from the competitors? I mean, it appears with 54% growth in units for
the high-end on color and substantial growth for other color devices, that you're gaining share, but can you talk a little
bit about where you think the shares are moving and how you think Xerox is doing vis-à-vis the competition?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. As you know, Shannon, we see share in a
quarter lag, so I can talk about quarter two share and then my thoughts on what we did in quarter three. Quarter two
you saw share increase in just about every segment, particularly in color, even in black and white, interestingly our
share increased, but that's on a declining base. So share increasing across the board in color. What we're seeing from
specific competitors, it's hard to say it this way, but we're seeing nothing too exciting. So everyone is competing in the
marketplace with their specialties. So Lexmark focuses on the low-end printing area, mid to low-end printing area, and
they have not expanded out of that. They have not operated in an unusual way at all, and we're competing well against
them. All the way up to HP that operates in a little bit broader base. They're not doing anything unusual and we're
definitely competing well against them.
So at the low-end, we continue to launch products. We continue to expand distribution. At the high end, we continue to
launch products and continue to expand distribution and we don't really see a big change at all. I was waiting for a little
bit more in our competitive reactions.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Mr. Reitzes, your line is open. Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital
Markets.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: I had a couple as well. Could you talk a little bit about why your gross margins were down so
much sequentially in sales?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, I can. We look at operating margin first as the
most important metric, especially as our business moves more towards a service – with more services mixed in. The
margins on services, as you know, are lower than on equipment, so we actually – and we're mixing more and more to a
services business, so we look at operating margins. I'm very pleased with the growth in operating margins. Almost a
point, quarter-to-quarter basis, and more than a point on a year-over-year basis. So first there.
And then if you look at third quarter, third quarter is traditionally our weakest margin quarter. Fourth quarter will
bounce back with more revenue on the cost base that we have. So seasonality and mix of revenues, more services, and
clearly we had to outrun a pretty strong headwind from the yen. And we did a pretty good job with that. We covered a
lot of it, but on a year-over-year basis, still down slightly, but did a lot of work to cover that headwind. So I would not
interpret the margin on a quarter-to-quarter basis as a big signal. You have to look at that, but also look at the operating
margin quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year to get a read of our business.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: If I could just push a little bit. As a way to think about the larger influences there, was the yen
the biggest determinant in either the sales or the service outsourcing and rentals? Both of them declined 50, 60 basis
points. Is there a way to prioritize what the impact was relative to all those forces that you just mentioned?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think that you have two factors that you
have to consider. Clearly, the yen is a big one. And -- Larry was supposed to answer the question, but the yen is a big
one. But also seasonality is a big one as well. We have less revenue in this quarter and more cost. And supplies last
year and last quarter were stronger, and supplies have stronger margins as well. So supplies down a little bit. But in line
what we expect them to be. Services mixing up in our business, and the yen clearly a headwind, but we were able to
offset a lot of the yen impact in the quarter.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay. And then Ursula, I guess what you said is you expected to bounce back. So last year
you had over 35% sales gross margin in the December quarter. It sounds like we should be thinking that it will be back
over 35 for the December quarter.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, we have – one of the things that we've done
pretty carefully to communicate to the marketplace is the range of margin that we operate in, 33 to 35. It's important to
understand that we have a growing services business that has a gross margin that's lower, but an operating margin that's
higher [inaudible]
<Q - Keith Bachman>: No, I understand that, Ursula. Sorry. It was sales specifically to sales gross margin.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Oh, just want a narrow piece. But it will definitely
tend towards the higher end of our range. Whether we'll be able to beat it, I mean we'll try like heck, Keith. We're
tending towards the higher end of the range from a sales – from a traditional business sales perspective.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay. Fair enough. And then I'll just ask one more if I could. In terms of DO and ITO, the
revenues on a constant currency basis, call it about flattish. When does the services revenues – the pipeline obviously
seems strong. When does that benefit the growth rates, do you think?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We talked about this the last call, and it works a
little bit – so you – we get probably a 60th, a 60th of the signings in a quarter, starting after you sign it, if you know
what I mean?

<Q - Keith Bachman>: Right.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So a 60th of it. So as we accumulate, as we sign
3.5 billion – as you continue to sign more and more and more of annual recurring revenue or total contract value
revenue more importantly, you'll see that start to feather in. So it'll take – 12 months from now, we'll see a big positive
from what we just signed, and then it'll continue to roll.
So I think it's starting now, Keith, but you won't see the full effect. And it does vary by line of business depending on
where we sign. Most of our signings are on this total contract value basis, and across the business lines, they kind of
come into the same way. We do have some business that we call walk-in and take over where when we sign the
business the revenue grows immediately. But it's not that much – this business is not that much like that. We prefer to
have total contract value growth. So you'll see it coming. It just is not – I don't know if we even modeled out when
you'll be able to see it all.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: I think part of the problem, too,
Keith, is that you do have – those two businesses are a little more affected by the economy and they're a little more
affected by the current account usage volume that goes on in those accounts. And that, along with new account revenue
that you're adding, you're getting a minus here from some of the volume that's going on, a little bit like usage on
multifunction devices. So that is having a moderating effect. And as that starts to improve, hopefully as the economy
gets better next year, I think the combination of both of them will show growth in those two areas.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So three lines of business if I can just – one is
BPO, the other one is ITO, and the last is document outsourcing. BPO strong everywhere, signings, pipeline, revenue
growth, et cetera. Very, very good and following a very strong trend, grew revenue of 8%. ITO a little bit more muted,
and document outsourcing more muted. Not on signings. That was good. But usage on current accounts is where we are
seeing – if there's any dampening, it's on that and particularly in document outsourcing and ITO. BPO is – the wind is
at the back in BPO.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Yeah, thank you very much.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hello, Ben.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Hi. Wanted to just follow up on that. That was actually the thing I wanted to talk about as well.
Just with regard to the signings, I mean, up 26% trailing 12 months, which means it was up much more than 26% in the
actual quarter. Even if you're recognizing 1/60 right after it's signed, it obviously seems like that would be a running
start to your – what's your forecast next year for services? Isn't it like 7%? And does that – does that really increase the
visibility? And then I have a follow up.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And so total trailing 12-month signings up 26%.
On a year-over-year basis it's up 40%. So if you look – so no matter how you look at this business, our signings are
growing. And the answer is we do expect – that's one – we do expect to see revenue acceleration in 2010 from the fact
that we have a robust services business, robust BPO business. You have to mix in a little bit of the fact that we – you
have to go over accounts that you win and you lose. Net-net, we'll have a positive contribution from services, and you'll
see that in our growth rates in 2011. I don't see any -

<Q - Ben Reitzes>: The order of magnitude though, I think you even outlined it at your analyst day. Isn't it like from
the 3ish percentish now like towards the, maybe it's 6 to 8ish, or isn't that what you laid out?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, that is what we laid out.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Yeah. Okay. And then -
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And it does work out this way, Ben. We can
actually spend more time off line. You have -
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Yes.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: – total growth and then you have obviously
takeaways, grow over accounts, you have lots of different mix issues in the business. But the growth in services we
expect to be in the 7 to 9% range, which is what we said in the analyst days. BPO growing the highest, ITO growing
the lowest.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Great. Yeah. And obviously off to the a good start with visibility. Then just the – I just wanted to
clarify the other thing Larry said, is that when you see the signings like this, some of this is consolidation of fleets,
right, and document outsourcing especially. And that would lower usage also as part of the plan. Does that have a
cannibalizing effect, too? So people – maybe not take this – extrapolate this too positively, could you just go a little
more detail about – you mentioned it with Keith a little bit, but I think there's an offset there in terms of usage that you
guys are driving and as well as the economy, and I was wondering if you could delineate between those two which is
an offset as well?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: There's two different hydraulics that happen here,
Ben. First is when we engage a document outsourcing customer, the vast majority of the time that we do that, we have
consolidating printer fleet that is not Xerox fleet. So that is a – because we're not the biggest player in printers, it's
Lexmark, HP, as you know, single function, particularly monochrome printers. That is a – that is an add to us. As we
run those accounts, so first year, second year, third year, as you run those accounts, volumes either go up or down
depending on how the economy is working, how that industry is going.
What Larry is referring to is not the upfront engagement which is growing for us. There's no doubt about it. You see
that in our signings – in our document outsourcing signings. What he's talking about is once you're in the account,
volumes go up, volumes go down. Sometimes they go up because the business is growing or because we've introduced
another service. They can also go down because the business that we've done this takeover in is not growing or we're
losing a service. And that's what he's talking about, not the initial signing. He's talking about the volume in the account
once we've signed it.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Okay. And then just finally, I think I know the answer, but just wanted to make sure. With all the
cash flow that you see coming in in the fourth quarter where you normally have a very strong performance, how is it
going on your pace to returning cash to shareholders by mid next year, and what is your – what is your priority of share
repurchase versus dividends? Has anything changed?
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. So, Ben, I think we're on a
very aggressive pay down of debt. We're actually ahead of that aggressive plan, albeit $100 million, so that's very good.
We've given ourselves the flexibility to pay down more debt, so that will help us. We're confident of the cash flow; the
fourth quarter is our biggest. If you look back in history here, we blow the doors off in the fourth quarter. And that's
what we're working on to make sure that happens here. And we're confident that what we said for the last year is that
we will look at share repurchase by mid 2011 and start to return to shareholders and also look at the dividend as well in
the mid 2011 timeframe. So all of that we're confident of, and as we get closer, obviously there's more confidence.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Thanks so much.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Hey, thanks, guys, for taking the question. And congrats on a real solid quarter. Ursula, I
guess just a quick question about sort of your thinking relative to your expectations as we move through the summer
regarding the underlying installment trends. I mean, it feels like this is the first quarter where – so it was a real solid
quarter. I think everybody is probably pretty pleased and maybe a little bit surprised kind of across the board. It's the
first quarter to me, anyway, where we could kind of say, wow, like every segment you guys report on, sort of either
sustained positive trends or even subsequently improved. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on how much better are
things on an install basis actually going than maybe you guys thought going through the summer?
And then to the extent that they are a little bit better, what could that mean to Xerox as sort of being – with print being
more of a late cycle play when we think about what the tailwinds to any sort of revenue might be into '11? And if I
could just tie that in with you guys maybe updating your 2011 guidance today. You guys typically don't – you're a
pretty prudent management team and don't do anything unless you feel pretty good about stuff. So I could read through
potentially that that means you feel on the margin a little bit better about sort of trends heading into next year.
And then just, Larry, if you could tie in, typically like in 3Q typically working capital is actually a use source of cash. I
mean even as you ramp up for December Q seasonality, if we kind of just look back. And it was a pretty significant use
of cash, presumably because you guys are sort of ramping up for some of what you're seeing on an install basis. So I
guess the point is, are we looking at a little bit better growth here than we thought that just hasn't – that just hasn't really
manifested itself in revenue yet heading into 2011? Thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. So let me start with that very long question
there – I think I'll catch it all, and then if I don't, you can point out where I've missed. On the question of what are we
seeing, so how are we feeling, how's the economy going, I think what we've seen, we saw an uptick, even though slight,
in small, mid-size businesses and in our developing market territories, and that's continuing. So we haven't seen a
change in trend there, which is good news. We did see a little uptick in large enterprises this quarter. That's positive.
That's positive for us. It helps us in activity.
You look at our activity, every segment from the largest thing that we sell, continuous feed machines to the smallest
thing that we sell, grew, including black and white. So I think that it would be hard for me to say that things aren't
looking a little bit better. I am not confident yet – I am not confident enough yet to say that things – this better will stay
forever. And we're not counting on this better staying forever. We have a great product line, we have expanded
distribution. But I'm still cautious on the economy, particularly in the large enterprise portion of the economy.
Employment rates haven't grown, et cetera, et cetera. So we are approaching the business this quarter and quarters
going forward like we have all quarters in the past, which is we approach it cautiously, but optimistically. So I do
believe that we have seen some uptick, and until I see the uptick change, I'm not going to predict the changing even
more. I hope that that helps. We do have tailwinds, as I said, but I don't know if they'll continue.
2011 change, it got to be a math problem pretty simply. We're now in quarter three, and quarter three when you add it
up and add up quarter 4, we're going to be past what we said we would do in 2011. So it was kind of hard to continue to
have a conversation about a set of numbers that we were actually running up against in quarter three. So there was no
magic around our updating the guidance for 2011. We could have waited, I guess. There was no magic. There's no
exciting thing about it except for when you look at it, we're going to be at 92 cents this year and it's kind of – 92, 93,
this year, full year this year. It's kind of hard to stay at 95 next year. So we just decided to do it because the math
worked out the way that it worked out.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: And I think we do feel optimistic
about next year as well. We'll give numbers at the end of the fourth quarter in January when we report. We'll revisit it.
But I think given where we are in the year, the quarter is behind us, we're confident going forward here.

On the cash side, I think you have to look back at 2009 here. We had an enormous constraint on anything associated
with cash. We obviously didn't have volume on supplies or machines in 2009, and so we pulled back significantly on
inventory. And so for the – and by the way, there were suppliers that went away. I mean there's a lot of stuff that is not
announced or talked about. So the whole three quarters of 2010 has really been building back demand and also the
inventory levels to support that demand. And so that's what we've done for three quarters.
We're confident that in the fourth quarter, we're going to have very good demand. We're going to have good revenue
growth, and we're going to shift that supply and the inventory is going to go down and it's going to be a source of cash.
We also have a quarter where we concentrate – these are my words – but we concentrate more on accounts receivable
of getting things collected by the end of the year than maybe we should do in earlier parts of the year. So I'm confident
that'll be better. And then we're going to have a good profit quarter. So all of those lead to confidence in the cash flow.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks a lot. And onto the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I wanted to follow up on some of the earlier questions around signings. I
know last quarter benefited from a lot of renewal activity of existing contracts. Can you give a little color on new
business contracts versus renewals in terms of the booking strength you saw in Q3?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, so I think that you'll see across the board we
saw growth quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. So new business signings were for this quarter up 17%. Last quarter
they were up 16%. So renewal – new business is good. Renewals are very good. We had a high renewal quarter last
quarter. We have another good one. We always give – we give a range of 85 to 90%, and we are trending at the high
end of that range. We did last quarter, and we're seeing that this quarter as well. So all aspects, so signings, pipelines,
signings, and how that signings come from synergy, from renewals, are all trending very well. We did sign a couple of
deals in Europe as well, so this is kind of working out the way that we had laid out for it to work out.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: On the 2.5 billion of pipeline you reported last quarter, now that's up to 3.5 of synergy
pipeline. Can you give some color on the close rate that you've seen on the pipeline of synergy activities?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We've closed – we've already signed and closed 30
– over 30 deals. It's kind of hard to do close rate because we haven't really lost any yet. So we're engaging clients, and
the ones that are up for business, we win, and so we've signed 30 so far. And I expect that we'll continue to sign more
and continue to close.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: So 30 out of 30, that would be 100%?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, but I mean obviously not 30 out of 30,
Chris. I mean some don't go to contract at all. Some well before we go down to stage two get moved to someone else.
We are – yeah, it's really, really early to actually start to quantify the close rate. I think once we get into this a little bit
more, we the actually figure it out, yeah. So 30 clients so far, 30 customers, 30 signings, international as well as U.S.,
strong synergy mix, baseline business is going well as well. Baseline business and BPO baseline and ITO baseline and
document outsourcing. So I think a pretty good mix.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Okay. Thanks for that. Last one for me is around revenue expectations. Previously you talked
about 22 billion for this year, 24 billion for next year. Can you update us on the revenue expectations? You did update
us on earnings, but any color on revenue expectations? That would be great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: I don't think we've changed our
thought process on revenue. I mean, that's a pretty good growth rate that we have in there, and when we get into
January, we see where the fourth quarter closes, we'll be able to talk about growth rates a little more specifically on
revenue.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Ireland with JMP Securities.
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: I wanted to ask a little bit about the growth in hardware and in installs. Can you help me
understand what the lag might be between this growth in machines in the field and when that might hit on the supplies
line?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So, yeah, we saw install growth across all lines of
business. And we saw mix growth as well. So as you – which is more of the indicator than even the install growth. And
it depends on the size of machine and the type of account. But I would – so – and since we're dealing with a very large
post-sale number, which is – a very, very large post-sale number, the definitive – you start to see the growth slower.
You will not see percentage points growth quickly. So next month you won't see the impact of this 20% increase in
activity. But you will see and what you have already seen is a flattening out – did I say that correctly? – a flattening out
of the post-sale starting to grow through quarters.
So it will start today, Doug. It's just that the numbers are small on a very, very large base. The way that I think about
this is there is nothing bad about putting in a machine. There's not a thing bad about putting one in. The more you put
in, the better it goes. The bigger they are, the better it goes. And what you can look here is that we had growth in
high-end color. We had growth in black and white. We had growth in mid range, et cetera. So we'll start to feather in
this revenue growth. And they are comprehended into the outlook that we gave for the quarter and for 2011.
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: Sure. I guess I was just thinking what is it, three months or six months before people start to
order those supplies? I'm just trying to -
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Oh no, they -
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: – make some connection in my mind.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Remember, Doug, you're talking
about four-year contracts here, so if you look at the service content of it, you're adding about 1/48 of the service content
every month. And so you multiply that by the growth rate. I think you would see – what I would say here, too, is that
you would see growth immediately if we weren't facing the same problem we talked about before, which is that there's
a lower usage level that you see with customers on the bulk of the MIF that Ursula talked about. And so it's very hard
to see. But this is the kind of thing that slowly adds to the growth rate. And you look at past history, we were down and
flat and within a two-year period we got to 3%. So I think you will see the positive signs of this coming through as we
get into 2011.
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: Yeah, I know it's a great leading indicator. The other thing I was just wondering if the ASPs
on supplies are stable or is there a natural attrition to the ASPs on the supplies?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, ASPs on supplies are more stable than ASPs
on equipment obviously, because we sign a contract, as Larry said, and we sign that contract generally for price
throughout the contract. So ASPs on supplies are more stable – are stable.
I think we have time for one more question.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Yes, thank you. Good morning. Two quick questions, if I could. Ursula, can you talk a little
more about the ACS deal synergies in terms of the deal size? It seems like the incremental in terms of 30 deals new
leased versus 10 previously in terms of signings going from 2.5 to 3.5, it seems like the deal sizes are getting smaller.
Should we contemplate that as kind of being the trend line going forward?
And then, Larry, if you could weigh in briefly here. I know you answered Richard's question earlier about the
additional cost cutting. I'm just trying to get a sense of what is the driver there, the impetus just given that you're still
kind of early here in the ACS piece. And your business tone seems pretty constructive here, so why the restructuring

<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm going to do the first part on deal size, and then
Larry can go on to the second part of the question. Deals are 5 to $10 million, average deal size, and we haven't seen a
fundamental change there in that deal size. We are seeing – which is good, which is what we want to see happen –
deals where we seed accounts, so places that we are new, we start small and we grow over time. But the average deal
size is – annual recovery revenue is about 5 to $10 million. And I said the seating is good, so nothing – no indicators of
anything changing in that mode even though it's early days.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, I think the first point here is
that we want to go into 2011 as cost competitive as we can. We don't want to do restructuring going forward. We want
to have that all behind us. In order to get our synergies airborne early as fast as we can and in order to make sure that
we're cost competitive because of the exchange rate changes, we wanted to get that all behind us. And that's really
what's the motivation between the restructuring. It's pretty straightforward. There's nothing additional to that. And it
just seemed to make sense to move it ahead.
Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
