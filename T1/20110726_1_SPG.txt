Please refer to our reports filed at the SEC for a detailed discussion.
Acknowledging the fact that this call maybe webcast for some time to come, we believe it's important to note that our
call is time-sensitive information that maybe accurate only as of today's date, July 26, 2011.
During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Regulation G.
Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures included within the earnings
release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This
package is also available on the Simon website in the Investor Section.
Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and
Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.
David E. Simon
Okay. Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us. We reported FFO of $1.65 per share for the quarter which
represents an increase of 19.6% over the prior year period. These results exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.07
and we now have met or exceed expectations for 28 of the past 30 quarters, which we believe is one of the best records
in the REIT industry.
Of course, I would like to talk about two of the quarters. The two quarters that we did not do that, one was an
impairment charge which we took on Liberty, which has now fully recovered and the other was just a timing issue
which we made up in the subsequent quarter. And in fact, in that year, we exceeded our – both consensus and our initial
guidance. So, 28 of the past 30 quarters, we have met or exceeded First Call consensus estimates.
Let's talk about the portfolio. Total sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $513 per square foot, up 9.4% from $469 as
of June 30, 2010. Occupancy was 93.5%, an increase of 40 basis points higher than the year earlier period and 60 basis
points higher than the first quarter. The releasing spread for 12 months was positive $4.60 per square foot. Our
releasing spread continues to include all in-line space including spaces larger than 10,000 square feet.
Comparable property NOI growth for the quarter was 3.5%. And I want to put that in context that in 2010, our second
quarter comp NOI growth was a positive 1.9%. So, it was not off a low base given the fact that 2010 was still in
recovery mode.
Let me turn to development activity. We have two new developments under construction; both are premium outlets:
Johor Malaysia, which will open in November of this year and Merrimack, New Hampshire which will open next
summer. Leasing activity is strong for both projects. We have 18 renovation and expansion projects under construction
with completion dates in 2011 and 2012 and the restoration of Opry Mills continues with the completion expected in
the spring of 2012.
We currently plan to invest approximately 650 million in domestic and international development and redevelopment
activities in 2011. And our number, though still in process, is approximately 800 million in 2012. As always, details on
cost, returns and timing of these projects are provided in our supplemental reporting package.
In June of this year, we sold the Jefferson Premium Outlet – or Prime Outlet, I should say, for 300 – I'm sorry, 134
million. We used 86 million of those proceeds in a 1031 Exchange last week to acquire to ABQ Uptown, a 222,000
square foot lifestyle center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The center, which generates sales of approximately $650 per
square foot, adds to our presence in a growing Albuquerque market where we also own Cottonwood Mall.
Let me switch to capital markets. During the first six months of 2011, we closed or locked rate on 50 new mortgages
totaling approximately 1.6 billion of which our share was 1 billion. The weighted average interest rate on the loans is
5.1% and the weighted average term is nine years. As of June 30, 2011, we had $1.1 billion of cash on hand including
our share of JV cash and our availability in our corporate credit facility of $3 billion for a total liquidity position of 4.1
billion. And as we said before, we still expect to generate $1 billion – more than $1 billion of cash from operation after
dividends.

Japan; let me just tell you that we've reopened Sendai Premium Outlet, which was damaged by the earthquake and
closed. On June 17, the center reopened and the response from the shoppers has been very positive. Costs to repair the
center other than the deductible is covered by insurance. For our other 7 centers in Japan things are returning to normal,
and we continue to like the prospects in our Japanese business and admire the will of the people in Japan as they
rebuild and grow their country after some of their tragedies.
Now, let me turn to guidance. Based upon our results for the quarter and expectations for the balance of the year, we
increased the low end of our 2011 FFO guidance by $0.10 per share and raised the top end by $0.08. The midpoint of
the range of our current guidance is $0.165 above the midpoint of our original 2011 guidance provided in February. Let
me just mention the Main Street, Fairness Act, you've seen some editorials in fact in the Journal today or an article in
the Journal. You saw the Indianapolis Star wrote an editorial on it. Let me just say that we've been very vocal about the
unfair advantage that Internet retailers have in not being required to collect sales tax. We are urging Congress to
introduce and pass the Main Street Fairness Act which will allow states to end the subsidy being provided to retailers
such as Amazon.com.
Let me be clear this is not a new tax. It would merely require Internet retailers to collect sales tax on behalf of the states
where they do business, something that brick-and-mortar retailers and even those who sell on the Internet have done for
years and this is required by law. The economy is helped by having a level playing field allowing an open market to
determine consumer behavior without government subsidies, which we believe is occurring for the online retailers.
Now, just a few concluding remarks before Q&A; we are certainly proud of the size and scale of portfolio we have at
SPG. As we have said many times, our business is where scale can be truly an advantage and I believe there are
industry-leading operating results, growth, and profit margins are absolute testament to that. I do think, however, that
sometimes the quality of our portfolio is not fully appreciated.
Our portfolio is second to none in our industry. We own more of the country's iconic shopping destinations and centers
by far and to help illustrate this fact, I will point out a few facts. First of all, in the mall sector, the 20 malls from which
we get the most EBITDA provide approximately $800 million of EBITDA annually, and this is our share. As of June
30, these 20 properties generated sales of $777 per square foot.
Now, let me turn to our top 20 value centers from which we get the most EBITDA provide over $600 million of annual
EBITDA. Again, this is our share. And as of June 30, these 20 properties generate sales of $721 per square foot. And
just as a reminder, given the focus on the value and outlet sector that seems to be occurring in the marketplace, our
share projected this year from that platform will generate approximately $1.5 billion. That's $1.5 billion of EBITDA
from our value-oriented centers, both Mills and the outlets.
So with that, operator, we're prepared to answer any questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly
with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: Good morning, guys. David, since you left off with the outlet center – I guess we'll start
there. First year at home, there's been a growing push to recast busted malls or retail projects as outlet properties. Are
you concerned that supply of new product could exceed demand in some markets and segments? And how do you think
about differentiation in that sector to assure success? Is it location, size, price point, what do you think?
<A - David E. Simon>: You broke up the first part. Could you – I didn't hear at all. Could you...
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: Yes, that's fine. I was saying that there's been a push here at home in the U.S. to recast
retail properties as outlet-focused properties. Do you think there's some risks that the supply of assets could surpass the

demand in the next few years?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, my own view is that I think it's going to be a challenge to build many of the new outlet
centers that are being bandied about. There's been a list of 50 outlet centers out there that are in predevelopment stage
for several years. We think obviously demand is good, but the retailers and manufacturers are very sensitive to where
outlets can be put. And so, we think the market should be circumspect to the amount of new outlet development that's
being talked about. There will be some. I think it'll be more challenging than what people believe. I do think there'll be
some mistakes made, but I don't see a redux of the lifestyle center development.
Never put it past real estate developers to overbuild. But I'm hopeful that year-after-year experience will lead to better
judgment. In this case, I do think the retailers and the manufacturers are very sensitive to their full price operations and
I think that's governor here that probably will not be a redux of what saw in the lifestyle center area. I think the
re-development of existing enclosed malls to do this again will be in that same category and more challenging than
people lead on.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: And sticking with outlets, where do you see the development yields on Johor compared to
say the projects in Japan and Korea? And I'm just curious, thinking down the road, ultimately, how big of an
opportunity do you think there is across Asia for outlet properties in your portfolio?
<A - David E. Simon>: The yields there are actually – we think they're going to be fantastic. The yields in Japan have
been very high, I mean higher than in the U.S. Malaysia, we're projecting to be higher and then the new development
yields here and we think all of the – everything that's lined up to build there is – the consumer is there, the growth in
income is there. They love the American, European brands. So, it's all lined up to continue to grow that. We've been
successful in everything that we've built from Korea to Japan. We see the same thing in Malaysia. As you know, we're
back to really seriously thinking about China for outlets. So, we think there's an opportunity to continue to grow that
business in Asia for us. Hard to put firm numbers on it yet. But the good news is we've got 10 centers, soon to be 11,
and we've got a good, good solid business already up and running. And we've been at it for several years.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: Just one last question on asset sales here at home. You guys have been in the market with
some malls recently, and there's been some transactions on A-malls. I'm curious, where do you see pricing for the A, B
and I guess I'll say C assets right now? Because we've heard some A-malls actually touching five caps or lower, and I'd
just love your perspective.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well we have seen some, again – we've seen some price talk on some, let's call them A-assets.
I'm not sure whether they're a mall or an outdoor center. However you want to describe it. A couple of these we think
are more salty than they should be because we don't see the growth that other people that are buying them see. We
could be wrong, they could be right. But we think pricing on some of these individual assets that are out there are still
what we see as very aggressive given the lack of growth characteristics in some of these assets.
Now, on the B and C, Jeff, I would tell you we're still all in a discovery mode, in terms of where the market is.
Obviously we've told you – we have nothing to announce in that area, though we do have a very small amount of malls
for sale as part of our strategy that we've had for years to sell assets here and there. The B and C assets are more
dependent on financing, the financing market in that area continuous to be somewhat volatile and I still think we're in
price discovery on those kind of assets.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: Okay, thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line Quentin Velleley with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Hi, good morning, it's Michael Bilerman here with Quentin. David, let's just start
with you. Obviously during the quarter you had your employment contract set up under a long-term basis and I want to

just focus just on – in terms of the length of time that it got to take to that place and obviously, when the proxy came
out in April, it was disclosed that you were working with the board towards something and then in the disclosure, it
talked about you taking – that you've had negotiations for 18 months. And I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit
about what transpired over a year and a half and in terms of setting the goals that you want to achieve and that the
board want to achieve and I guess how you ultimately got it resolved last – I guess a couple weeks ago?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it – look, I think, Michael, it took longer than it should have and I think part of the
length of it is just the care that the comp committee took in deciding what was appropriate. We – obviously, these kind
of things are very sensitive, very focused given the – rightfully, I have no problem with the scrutiny that something like
this comes with. And I think, again, I wasn't privy to the comp committee's deliberations, but my guess is given what
was going on that they took a lot of time to feel comfortable with it. Now – and also, there's been a lot of volatility in
the world during this period of time. And obviously, my primary focus over the last 20 months has been running this
company and this has not been the number one agenda on my plate.
I do think – again, I was not part of the comp committee deliberations, but my guess is they studied past performance.
I'm sure they looked at some of the recent comp deals that there were out there for new and existing Chief Executives.
I'm sure they considered if, for whatever reason, they had to replace me, what it would cost for a new CEO, and just
generally what are the requirements that the company needs to lead the company from a CEO in the future.
With all that said, I think they concluded that the deal they struck with me was in the best interest of the company and
the share amount was generally the same for that long period of time and so the size of the apparent transaction – so it's
an eight-year deal which I think the market sometimes loses sight of – got bigger because obviously the stock
performed – has performed well over that period of time. So I don't know if any answers your question but they were –
sure they were very deliberate in their efforts.
I was very focused on running the company and we've been living in a very volatile world; you put all that together and
it takes a pretty, pretty long time. From my standpoint look, I've been doing this for – I've been running this company
for 16 years and I – it was appropriate for me to kind of assess where I was, what I wanted to do in future, and I wanted
to work out a deal that recognized what I brought to the table and over that 16 years I want you to realize that I've never
had an employment agreement. I've never had – I've never had a deal and both from my standpoint and I believe the
comp committee's standpoint though I can't speak for them, we both felt it was appropriate to negotiate something for a
longer period of time that delivered a certainty and that we all felt, myself included, because I'm shareholder, that was
in the best interest of the company.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: And you get to do 32 more earnings calls?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, I can't guarantee the performance we've had in the past 30, but hopefully, we'll have some
level of success along those lines.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: That's helpful color. Just diving into the portfolio stats you gave at the end of the
comments, the top 20, the top 20 malls and top 20 value. The value you're saying are what, Mills and outlet centers
that's – you're combining that?
<A - David E. Simon>: We are. It included a couple of Mills, but generally we included both.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: So you're looking at – so those top 40 assets or about $1.4 billion of EBITDA on a
base of call it $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion. So, 40 assets, 20% of the asset base is generating 40% of EBITDA. Is that the
way we should think about it?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Right. Correct, Michael.
<A - David E. Simon>: And that's our share as well.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Right. And then so, Dave, when you step – the rest of portfolio probably is mid-400s
in terms of productivity?

<A - David E. Simon>: We gave you some facts today, may be we'll give you more facts later. We thought that would
be helpful for people to understand, at least – again, people lose sight of the kind of the quality that we have embedded
because of the size. We understand that. We don't like to tier assets even though Rick does and it bothers me, but I let
him do it. But we want people to know that our top 20 assets in these categories generate a lot of cash flow and I think
over time we'll be more descriptive to everyone how we look at it. But, that's what we want you to start thinking about
at least today.

Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jay B. Habermann>: Good morning everyone. Maybe following up where Michael just left off on the top 20 on
both the malls and the value centers. Are you willing to share David perhaps some of your near-term outlook? What
you think NOI growth could be perhaps for some of these top assets relative to the rest of the portfolio?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well I don't have a specific number but it's safe to say that these are under-rented and they are
going to grow faster than our average. And they possess a lot of upside but I don't have that – Rick or Steve, do you
want to add anything? But I don't have anything more to say other than that. They certainly historically have generated
significant EBITDA growth, better than our average.
<Q - Jay B. Habermann>: And maybe even just stepping back broadly for the entire portfolio. If you think about this
recovery today combined with sort of where the economy is today and somewhat mixed, what's your general
perspective in terms of where we are for rent growth going forward in the cycle?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well I would say we are still pretty good other than – there are couple of tenants out there that
– again I'm not going to name names because we certainly shouldn't be in that business publicly. But there are a couple
of tenants there that are sizeable mall operators. When I say mall, that could be both outlet and full price malls that still
haven't had the benefit of the recovery that are going to put pressure on the industry and us included, in terms of
renewals and potential store closures and the like and that's the biggest headwind. Now we've had that headwind – it
hasn't gone away. So we've been managing our way through that headwind. But that, to me, is the biggest headwind
that's out there for us in terms of what we have to deal with on a day-in and day-out basis.
Our leasing people obviously understand that, they know that, and they're out humping to find those replacements
either through voluntary or lease expirations or to the extent that even one or two of these guys could end up in a
Chapter 11. So that's the governor right now that we see. The consumer actually – I feel a little bit better about – look,
we all know we live in an extreme volatile world. We could witness last night and understand that – what happened on
TV last night. So, but I would say that's the biggest headwind that we've got to deal with.
<Q - Jay B. Habermann>: Okay. And...
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And the only thing I would add – it's Rick – is that our portfolio is not static. So as you
look at the potential for NOI growth, we're renovating 20 properties. We're adding a considerable number of additional
anchors. We just announced in today's press release three additional department stores as we continue to lease up our
properties with more productive and impactful tenants and restaurants. We're enhancing the market share and the better
we make our properties to faster our growth is going to come.
<A - David E. Simon>: And now we've got some major redo's that are in works that we may take some space out of
service, that we're redoing the food court. All sorts of that stuff that – again it's not overly material, but it might have
somewhat of a governor on our EBITDA growth. But we're performing – the point is, we are performing better today
than we thought we were, and we're beating our budgets and that's the good news.

<Q - Jay B. Habermann>: And I guess, Rick sort of took my last question. But as you think about the 650 million of
development, re-development for this year and 800 million I guess you're planning re-dev for next year. It sounds like
that 1.5 billion target you guys had outlined for three years, you perhaps are going to well exceed that. Is that a sign of
you just want to reinvest more in the existing portfolio rather than look for acquisitions at this point of cycle?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think those possess at this point greater opportunities for us. We've always felt taking
what we've got and making it better is a huge priority. One of the reasons why we brought David on board was to help
us do all that it is there to do with the existing portfolio. And we're, I'd say from that standpoint, we're very pleased
with the amount of activity that our teams are generating. And that's not just the malls, that's the outlets, I mean, we've
got expansions in the outlets side that we feel good about like in Seattle, in Chicago potentially, in Woodbury
Commons, Allen, just to name a few. So, they – the best thing we can always do is take a good property and make it
better. And now that we feel good about capital and feel good about what our teams are doing, that's the number one
priority.

The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Hi, good morning. Just on International, I just wanted to get a feel for how you're thinking
about the investment landscape outside the U.S. I mean you have your Asian developments but have you thought more
recently about acquisitions? I mean a lot more U.S.-based mall retailers are looking to grow outside the U.S. I don't
know if that's having any input into the way you think about international investment but both from an acquisition
perspective and then maybe anything that would lead you to accelerate your development pipeline beyond the sort of
couple at a time you've got going in Asia.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the development side internationally, you're talking?
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Yes.
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, I think the big frontier there is whether or not we do something in China on the outlet
side and we're spending a lot of time on that front. And we've got at least a couple more Japanese outlets to do and
we're looking at another one in Korea and so the answer in the Asia new development is – I mean we still want to dot
the Is cross the Ts, but there is more to do there and that could be accelerated to the extent that we do something in
China.
International, generally when you talk about acquisitions, we mostly talk about Europe and potentially what's going on
in South America. And I will tell you that we're thinking a lot about it. It's very interesting when we initially went into
Europe in '98, we had this premise that the U.S. retailers were going to come. The fact of the matter, they didn't come,
but we were still successful.
Now, they're coming so there is some industry logic to do it. We have felt comfortable we could add value but the deals
there – to do a sizable deal or – we don't want to just buy one-off here and there. We think we would really want to try
and create or invest in the platform. Those deals are not easy, but it's on the radar screen. We spend a lot of time
thinking about it, but it's very hard to predict or in fact whether or not anything will ever transpire there, and the math is
always a challenge which we don't feel compelled to plant a big flag there because we've got lots of stuff to do here and
lots of growth opportunities with our existing platforms including Asia.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: But the focus would be, right now it's kind of equally between, like develop Europe and South
America, say?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. I mean, I think we've studied a lot in both markets. We actually have a trip scheduled –
[David] Contis knows Brazil pretty well. He served on the Board of BR Malls for a long time. That's a market we're not
in; who knows? I have my own view it looks a little toppy but, I mean in the long run, long term you've got to look at

<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Do you think we'll have news about, kind of what you're thinking about doing in China this
year some time or?
<A - David E. Simon>: Potentially, potentially.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay. Thanks. And my last question just maybe for Rick. Could you walk through maybe
some of the – we're not hearing much about that many new concepts in the malls compared to maybe other points in the
cycle. Can you talk about who you've been doing deals with and particularly anything that might be a growing concept?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, we've got a lot going on with a number of our traditional retailers but in terms of the
new ones, Love Culture, Pandora, LEGO, Sperry, Franchesca's, Teavana, Cotton On, Madewell, Lululemon, Michael
Kors, Tilley's; those are all relatively newer concepts and they are all growing very aggressively in our properties. So
from that regard it's very encouraging and when you also take into a fact that recently we had the Fresh Market,
Franchesca, Pandora went public. Teavana I think is going this week. So, the equity markets are being very receptive to
providing growth capital to our retailers, and that's certainly benefiting us.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Yes. Some of the existing concepts have been trying to downsize lately. I mean, are you
seeing it kind of work both ways? I mean there's many concepts looking to grow, or is it kind of a general theme of
trying to get your space to be more efficient?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think that for the more mature concepts that are saying our store count perhaps is too
large or not as productive, we've got people that are very focused on growing and the fact that our occupancy keeps
going up is a testimony to that.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Thanks. Looking at the activity on the big box side, obviously, you've added a lot of big
boxes or you will be adding a lot of big boxes near term, David, do you think it prevents some mall development when
you have the likes of Macy's adding a lot of space in existing malls?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. I think so. Rick, do you want to...
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think that one of our main strategies is trying to maintain the viability or market share of
our properties. So, to the extent that there is demand in a given market, to the extent that we can capture that demand by
expanding our existing properties, it's a win-win for us. As David pointed out earlier, that's the surest way to get
appropriate risk-adjusted returns. And in addition, we're making our properties stronger.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. And I think the demand from the boxes to go in to proven retail centers including the
malls is just greater. So, we're taking advantage of that trend. And the pressure out there – certainly there's pressure on
certain malls, but there's a lot of pressure on a lot of strip centers just because if you lose an anchor or two in a strip
center, that thing comes under immediate pressure. So, the boxes seem to want to relocate where the action is and in
many cases that's the enclosed shopping center.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay. And as far as preventing development in future centers, do you hear from some of the
big box retailers, and particularly department stores, that by committing to so many existing malls, it's probably
delaying their interest in committing to future development?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's interesting. I just – we still – a little bit, but I would tell you that the biggest issue on
new full price retailer demand is probably not from the boxes, but more just to make the numbers work and what the
real small shop demand is to make the numbers work. That would be my – Rick, you can add to that. But that would be
more of the governor than some of the boxes. Don't you think...
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I agree with that and just to give you an editorial comment, one of the things that we have
heard from our department store and big box clients that are the retailers is that 2008, 2009 taught that who their
landlord is matters. And what we're finding is that there is a higher degree of interest in coming into properties where
they know the landlord has the commitment, has the capital, and has the ability to renovate as needed, bring in new
retailers and maintain the market share of those properties. And as David said, there's very little new development out
there because there is not enough demand to generate a 300,000- or 400,000-square foot new project and so, the
retailers are looking at coming to the established properties.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay. That's helpful. Switching tracks, just talking about outlets for a little bit. You struck a
JV with Tanger in Houston last month. Is it some – is it a partnership you'd like to expand to other markets or was it a
one-off event?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, right now, we're focused on Houston. It's been a very positive discussion with Tanger.
We made a handshake and it got documented quickly thereafter. We're excited about Houston. We're going to start
construction probably in less than a month in August and we would never rule out doing more business with Tanger,
but that's the number one focus right now.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Hi, good morning. Just staying on the outlet centers for a minute, two quick questions. As you
look at some of the centers that have been announced or have been in the press and the relation – the position relative to
some of your existing centers, specifically to some of the Mills assets. Can you talk about what you've been able to do
with the Mills leases since you acquired that in terms of building in radius restrictions with close to what you have at
the Chelsea centers or the Premium centers, sorry about that.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: From the – this is Rick, from the Mills perspective, what we have been able to do is really
demonstrate the synergy between our platforms because the Mills, their model, and their advertising campaign is Mills
Means More. We've been able to take the outlet tenants that we have relationships with, in the Premium platform and
bring them into the Mills. And we've also taken a number of the full price tenants that we have relationships in the mall
business and bring them into the Mills.
As a result, you've seen very good growth in the Mills and you have seen substantial increases in the anchors and the
market share in those properties. And this month the announcement of Macy's building a full line store Gurnee on a pad
that used to be occupied by Circuit City is the best demonstration of how we're able to really bring all of those varying
tenants under the Mills outlet. In terms of the radiuses, they are less relevant in that property type.
<A - David E. Simon>: And I would say this. We're not overly worried that any of these new – if I caught your
question right, we're not overly worried about any of the new outlets being developed that's going to have a material
impact on any of our existing Mills. So, I don't – I'm not worried about that at all.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay, just given the success that the outlets have had, there's also been a bit of a move to move
the outlets closer into major metro areas and closer to full price retail. Do you see the retailers pushing back on that
given the success that they've had at the outlet centers?

<A - David E. Simon>: I think that's harder to do than some of the new entrants in the outlet market are talking about.
I think that's a major issue for retailers and manufacturers. And I don't think that they're going to jeopardize their full
price operations. I do think that when you have a tourist market like a Las Vegas or an Orlando as an example, you are
able to – because you have new customers that come in every week essentially, you're able to avoid the traditional
rules. I think that it's – if a lot of the outlet developers think – or these new entrants so to speak, think that they're going
to get retailers and manufacturers to ignore kind of the old rules, we don't see it. Because frankly, when we've looked at
a number of deals, we get push back on sensitivity all the time. And I would say we know the business reasonably well.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay and then just moving to the full price. We've heard anecdotes over the last few months
coming out out of ICSC that there's been a willingness from the part of retailers to move to stores to mall levels that
they wouldn't have thought about six to nine months ago. Can you talk about what you've seen in the Simon portfolio?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We certainly have been able to take advantage of the better macro environment to expose
our retailers to other markets and other properties where they currently don't have stores. So, to that degree, yes we are
finding that we are able to bring those retailers that maybe in the past would not have looked at a market or a mall that
did not have the type of sales potential they thought and try it and happily what has happened is that as they have
opened these stores, they continue to perform and that makes them more optimistic and confident about doing
additional locations in that type of property.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay, thanks. And then just one last question. The mobile web-based marketing system you've
been talking about. Can you just update on – update us on what progress you've made in there and what direction things
might go?
<A - David E. Simon>: I'll be happy to without divulging anything overly material. I mean, we are working with
Boston Consulting Group and our retailers as we speak in the design of the product. And we're making very good
progress. The retailers that we're in discussions with have been very supportive of what we're trying to accomplish.
Those discussions are ongoing and we're hopeful that by 2012, we will have a product that we will be testing in a few
malls and we'll take it from there. So, the goal is to have something of a test nature in '12.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: So you're more likely to develop something on your own versus purchasing?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think you'll see a combination thereof. I mean there's a lot of – there's a lot out there
that we don't necessarily have to build completely by ourselves. We can partner. So, it's too early to say. If I had to
guess today, it will be a combination of build and produce ourselves and partner some of the aspects with others.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: So what type of capital are we talking about in terms of investment?
<A - David E. Simon>: Too early to tell, but we can handle it.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Got you. All right. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thanks.

<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Hi.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: David, just wanted to follow up on a comment that you made earlier regarding the
volatility in the financing markets. And maybe this is more of a question for Steve if he's on, but can you comment on
what you've seen in terms of financing costs and availability for A assets versus B and C assets in the last month or
two, especially in light of some of the recent weakness in the CMBS markets? And how is demand for some of these
lower quality assets in the market being impacted as a result?

<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, Christy, thanks for asking me a question. I was feeling lonely.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: I figured.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Listen, I think you have a couple of things going on. Number one, there is still a move
overall to more and more financial institutions restarting CMBS platforms. And so, I think overall, the trend line is still
good. As what happened the last couple of weeks with spreads gapping out and maybe a couple of deals not getting
done quite as well as people had hoped. It's probably just an indication that it is still an evolving, maturing market in its
reconstituted phase.
With demand for the different quality of properties, I would echo I think the comment that Rick or David made earlier
– I mean the fact is your better properties grow faster. They're higher productivity. There's clearly more demand to lend
against that type of asset holding all other variables like loan-to-value constant. But the fact is, we're seeing pretty good
demand for product across all the different quality spectrums. And if you've got a good asset and you're reasonable on
your loan-to-value, you can get it financed.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Okay. And then a question on outlets, can you provide some additional color on your
Toronto project? I know you have zoning approvals, but are there any other hurdles from a construction standpoint that
could potentially delay construction? And I'm sure you've had discussions with the potential tenants about the project,
but what's been the retailer feedback so far as it relates to your project versus Tanger's?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think the good news is we've picked the market where an outlet center wants to
be built and we're competing hard against the alternative. We've got the site. I think it's going to – it's just going to be a
competition. We're hopeful that we'll get the job done. There's no guarantees that we will.
Tenant demand is interested for sure in building an outlet center there. It's a great market, so there's no real roadblocks
from an ability other than we've got to get the leasing and I'm sure Tanger needs to get the leasing. We feel like we're
doing pretty good, but we've still got a ways to go. We are hopeful that '12 we start construction. That's our goal and
we're moving fast to accomplish that. But there are no guarantees on that.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: What percentage pre-leased is Texas City given that you're breaking ground next month?
<A - David E. Simon>: 50-ish. But, we're very confident in that deal.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: OK. Ross [Nussbaum] is on the line with me as well.
<A - David E. Simon>: I'm sorry?
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: I was going to say Ross is on the line with me as well. I think he has a question.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hey guys, just a quick question on Mills. It looks like you've got about 2 billion gross value
of debt maturing over the next 18 months. How does that number relate to where Farallon in terms of their potential
monetization, and with that 2 billion of debt, do you guys in the partnership need to pay down any of that to get the
refinancing done?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the vast majority of that is the senior loan and our mezz loan. And the fact of the matter
is there is no issue on refinancing the senior loan. Its coverages are very strong and the same thing with our mezz loan.
So it's really not – the refinancing of that is really not much of an issue in terms of how we look at it.
The exit of Farallon is a different issue and it's really – I'm not at a point where we can really discuss that. They've been
a good partner. They're happy with the investment they've made. And we'll see where it goes. But I wouldn't be overly
concerned about the ability to refinance the existing debt coming up.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Is it fair to say we should expect a monetization of your partners' interest at some point
sooner, rather than later here in the next year or so?

<A - David E. Simon>: It certainly in around of possibilities. So it wouldn't surprise us if that happens. But there's
obviously a chance that they stay in the partnership and we continue to do what we do, which is grow the NOIs and
invest in the properties for the future.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: And can you just remind us how does the partnership work in terms of that monetization?
<A - David E. Simon>: They have a certain ability subject to right of first offer on certain assets. And they have an
ability to sell their interest subject to a first of right of – right of first refusal. So they have some ability to sell certain
assets subject to a right of first offer and then if they want to sell their interest it's subject to right of first refusal.

Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Craig R. Schmidt>: Thank you. I wanted to look at the acquisition of the lifestyle center. I'm just wondering if –
are you seeing select opportunities in this high-productive lifestyles centers relative to maybe what is aggressive pricing
on A malls. Just for example, thinking of Plaza Frontenac when I back out the anchors, I'm talking about roughly
220,000 square foot of in-line space. I'm guessing the productivity is comparable as is the occupancy, yet you're only
paying $86 million and I'm assuming Plaza Frontenac will go for far greater.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, let me just say, we like the deal we did in Albuquerque. It's very well-positioned and
consumers love it, retailers love it and we think there's outside. We saw one – I don't what it's called, a lifestyle center
in Carlsbad that went for – based on how we looked at it and underwrote it very little growth for a much more
aggressive price than anywhere near what we did Albuquerque for. And the other asset you mentioned, we just didn't
have any interest in it. So, I let others, whatever happened to that, no idea. But we just didn't have an interest for it.
<Q - Craig R. Schmidt>: And is there an opportunity to let's say on the cost of occupancy at ABQ?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Craig R. Schmidt>: Or is there expansion?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, there is potential expansion and there is – we re-tenanting as well.
<Q - Craig R. Schmidt>: And I guess one last thing. Are you thinking of breaking up the Borders or releasing it as the
box that it is?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We're working on both alternatives. We've already identified three or four potential users
that would take the whole box, but it's very well-positioned in the asset and so there's also the potential to break it up
and bring in a couple of more restaurants and a couple other small shops.
<Q - Craig R. Schmidt>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Just quickly on the AAA, the deficit talks down in Washington. If the rating agencies
follow through and actually downgrade the U.S., do you think there's any impact to either Simon or any of the retailers
as far as financing apart from just, a general shift in the market? Are there any contracts that use treasuries as an
underlying reference or any of the factoring that goes on that may be disrupted? Just trying to get a sense of what the
impact would be in your world if that actually happens.
<A - David E. Simon>: I don't think so. I mean we do lease space to the government and I will tell you that they – I am
known for checking our accounts receivable every month when I get the report. And they are always 30 days
delinquent. So I'm hopeful that they can rectify that. But it is very interesting to note they are always 30 days
delinquent.
I mean I guess in theory we'd have some risks that would not be paid currently. But beyond that, I mean the numbers
are immaterial frankly. But beyond that we don't see any real risk. I mean spreads invariably widen for all of corporate
America, and for all asset classes, so we'll be participant in that but beyond that, we can't see anything as we've studied
it that's going to be anything material.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then just the second question is on the discussion of the taxing the internet
sales and folks like Amazon. Is this – I mean it seems like it's almost something that's Amazon-specific, because a lot
of the retailers have bricks and mortar presence and they also sell their goods online. And I'm thinking about like a
store like Apple where they've had tremendous success rolling out physical locations. So it almost seems like Amazon
is unique as far as – more retailers would seem to want to have a physical presence in which case they have to collect
sales tax. So just curious if the tenants are indicating that it's more than just Amazon, that there's a huge amount of sales
that they're losing or if this is just something more Amazon and perhaps books/electronics related?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, there's a number of pure online retailers beyond Amazon, Gilt.com, I'm just naming,
Blue Nile just to name a couple. So clearly, Amazon is the 800 pound gorilla in this area but there are other pure line –
pure online retailers that are taking great advantage of the government subsidy that's occurring.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: But do the retailers have a sense of how much business they lose?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, they're all very focused on it, so they're feeling the lost – I mean what we're hearing is
the number of customers go to their store, learn all about it and buy it online because it's 10% savings. So, it's a real
issue and we need a level playing field. There's no reason whatsoever that there should not be and it's not a new tax and
it levels the playing field. And the fact of the matter is, if a customer wants to buy online over bricks and mortar and it's
a level playing field, then that's the breaks of the game. But if they're doing it merely to avoid an 8 or 10% sales or use
tax that they're required to pay but the Internet retailer ignores it, that's not fair. That's not what this government should
be all about.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - David E. Simon>: On the small shop side, there is a relatively small amount of space allocated to the specialty
stores in the strips centers. That business is primarily driven by the big-box leasing, and if you look in our supplemental
filings, we are seeing momentum and adding boxes to that platform.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: So it's more on the box space not on the in-line – on the small shop space then?
<A - David E. Simon>: The small shop space is a relatively smaller percentage in that platform than in our other
platforms.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. And turning to your 2012 lease expirations, could you give us some color on what is the
vintage, on average of what's expiring in 2012, and if you can, what was, on the apples-to-apples basis, the sales
productivity based on that vintage historically?
<A - David E. Simon>: When you look in our supplemental filing, if you look in 2012, we have 9,700,000 square feet
expiring. So, you can expect that that is going to be a very fair cross section of our entire portfolio.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: And just as an aside, the rent for that is $32.22. So, that gives about substantial room to roll
those over at higher rents, give our current average rent.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Right. I mean, that's what I was leading towards – so could we expect reasonably in the
mid-double digit range?
<A - David E. Simon>: It is hard to project. It's really a function of the specific spaces that roll, but we've been
showing good momentum in our spread over the last few quarters.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay and last question. How do you guys calculate when you add new anchors to existing malls?
How do you calculate you're expected yield from that? Is that purely from if they do pay rent, the rent you're expecting
or is there some kind of formula for the increased level of traffic that would generate and overall impact to the mall?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, it's old fashion. It's called a cash-on-cash return and we do not take into account the hope
and prayer that it will mean something to this tenant and that tenant.

normal $4 million to $5 million figure.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: You know, Steve, the answer might be somewhere in between the two. David mentioned
there are a couple of tenants and actually larger tenants that we have on our watch list and are paying attention to. But
the overall receivable environment right now is pretty good. Receivables are down really, half of what they were a year
ago at this time. And so, with the exception of those couple of tenants that we're paying attention to, I think there'll be a
relatively modest second half.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. And then, David, I know you said you don't like to characterize the malls. Rick does that.
So maybe I'll throw the question to Rick. But could you guys just talk maybe about regional performance and kind of
what you're seeing across the country. And I realize you don't give the breakdown of sales and rent growth between the
malls in the Premium Outlets, but is there anything that you're seeing, any noticeable trends between A, B, and C in
terms of rank growth and sales growth and I guess anything by geography would be helpful.

<A - David E. Simon>: I'll comment on geography. All of our regions were stronger with good sales growth, but the
strongest regions where the Mountain which is Vegas. Southwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Florida weaker but still growth
were the Plains and the Great Lakes. Across all the platforms, those properties that are located in tourist markets have
been substantially outperforming even the overall portfolio performance that we have talked about.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. And then lastly, David, could you just talk about the dividend? I mean your payout is
exceedingly low and I'm just wondering what your thoughts are maybe bump it in the second half, or is that something
you just kind of wait until the first quarter of next year?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, we're going to – Steve, we're going to – as you recall last year we bumped it up materially
in the fourth quarter. So, we're going to follow the same procedure in the fourth quarter. It's going to be based upon our
taxable income. And based upon – taxable income is certainly – there is a certain amount of volatility with taxable
income. But based on what I know today we're going to have an increase, obviously subject to board approval but we're
– I'm sure our board wants to stay a REIT, okay? We're going to have a meaningful, again subject to board approval
and subject to what our taxable income is. But we're going to have a meaningful fourth quarter dividend increase like
we did last year.
And then going forward in '12, our annual payout now is 3.20 but my guess is as part of that fourth quarter we'll also
set the expectations that what are our annual – our quarterly dividend will be in '12. And again I would anticipate that
there will be a true-up in the fourth quarter of '12 and that will kind of be the normal routine that we'll get in. Obviously
the true up will never, hopefully ever be down. But we'll set a number and then as taxable income gets more clarity
we'll bump it up to the extent that we don't – we're not meeting that.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Co. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Hi, yes. Good afternoon everyone. Just a couple of questions in regards to price discovery;
the Albuquerque, New Mexico asset. Could you give us a sense of what cap rate that was done at? And then also any
update on King of Prussia and what could happen on that end?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well we're not going to disclose it but – with Albuquerque but I think you'd be pleased and we
are not going to disclose what's going on with King of Prussia other than we are having discussions with our partners.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay. And then next question; recent article on SNL just talking about you potentially
selling some of your shopping centers. I'm just curious if you had seen that and if you could make any comments?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well we've got a couple of centers on the market and we are in that process right now. But we
don't – we won't announce anything until we have a deal that's essentially done and at this point we are still in
discussions and we are still going through that process.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Is there anything thematic about the assets though? Are they being sold -
<A - David E. Simon>: No, I think the only important thing to point out is we do this – we've been doing this for
several years. We did not do it in '09 and '10 because obviously the market was in major restructure recovery mode.
And so this is part of our ongoing process that we tend to look at some assets. We try to sell a couple here and there
every year. It is consistent with what we've done in '08, '07 and '06. You have all that data out there historically. And
it's not a dramatic shift like say – and it's not an overly material deal like say what Westfield is trying to do. It's just an
ongoing process that we do essentially every year, assuming the market conditions are acceptable to sell assets.

<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Great. And just two quick ones with Steve. Steve, could you just – what occupancy costs
were as of 2Q?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yes, they were 12.1%
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: And this is the combined number for the malls and the ...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: It is, yes.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Thank you, I understand this. And then, in the quarter other income, there was an other
within other income of about $30.5 million?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Correct.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Could you just give us a further breakdown of what's in that number?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: It is a lot of the miscellaneous stuff at the mall, Tayo. It's everything from stroller rentals,
to sales of lottery tickets and all that. The variance over the last year was interestingly enough, going back to an
acquisition that we did many years ago. We held a key man life insurance for a former director who passed away, and
that was a couple of million bucks.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay, that's explains the delta. I appreciate it. Thank you very, have a great quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of James Sullivan with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Thanks. Just a quick follow-up Steve on that other other income line item. As you compute
same-store NOIs, I understand that that other income is in there. Is that right?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: If it's related to the property, Jim, it is. But like for example this proceeds from this life
insurance policy that I mentioned would not be in there.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Okay, very good. And then second question on same-store NOI, pretty significant increase
quarter-over-quarter, up from the low 2s to 3.5 and I guess keying off of what David had to say about feeling better
about the outlook for the balance of the year. I guess that's reflected in your guidance. But the 3.5 number this quarter;
should we be assuming that that number or better is achievable in the second half?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, I'll say this, Jim. As David mentioned, that was off a base that was positive last year
as well and if you look at the second half of last year our comp NOI growth as I recall was in the low-to-mid 2's. So
we're coming off of higher basis. I think the good news, if you just look at the composition of the 3.5%, 265 basis
points of it is percentage – or, excuse me, is minimum rent. I think Rick and David have both mentioned about deal
quality continuing to get better, and 50 basis points of it is overage rent. We'll see where sales head, but if sales
continued to stay the percentage increased that we're seeing, it's reasonable to assume that there'd be some pop from the
overage rent as well.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Yang with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Yes, hi. Thanks. David, in past years you've talked about only buying and owning franchise
assets which I thought included a minimum size requirement as well as anchors. But given that you just brought an
unanchored center that was only 220,000 square feet, is this possibly a signal that you're maybe more open-minded
about what you want to buy and own? And maybe in light of the aggressive pricing for high-quality assets that you
were talking about earlier.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look we – it's a very good question. The answer is a couple. One is we really like this
asset. We've looked at a lot of assets like this. This was an off-market deal. So, it wasn't – they didn't hire Eastfield to
create projections that the people bid on and believe in and put in a crazy cap rate. So, we think we bought it right. We
still would prefer the bigger, better deals. But some of those are – there's not a lot on the market. And two, the numbers
are very, very aggressive. And I think the other important thing on this, it's a good – it's a very good market. We're in
this market so we know it, we cover it and as I mentioned to you, this was part of a 1031. Again, we love the real
estate. We think it's got a lot of potential, but it was kind of an off-market deal; very good real estate, fair price for the
buyer and the seller, upside, good market, 1031. We're very happy to buy it, and we have looked at those kind of
centers. But even some of those are just being bid up to what we think are very aggressive levels.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: I mean, why would the seller necessarily not market the deal and potentially leave some
money on the table by selling it off-market to you guys? I mean, it's no secret that pricing is pretty frothy overall. So
I'm just curious how you guys step in and how you present yourself and how you end up winning these type of
opportunities?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, believe or not, we have had a history of it. We like those deals the best. That's how we
got into the Outlet business. We bought Chelsea. It was a negotiated deal. I bought DeBartolo. It wasn't an auction.
We've done most of our work in that way, and that's the way we prefer it. It doesn't always work out that way but in
this case, our guys did a good job and people know that we're going to close. So they know when we have a deal, they
know we're going to close. And we're fair on that side of the equation so they have faith that – they just know we're
going to get the job done.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay, great. And just one last question, it looks like you meaningfully reduced the small shop
tenants that we're on month-to-month leases. Over the past quarter, it looks like it's down about 1.4 million square feet.
Is this seasonality or were you able to convert the bulk of this to permanent tenants?
<A - David E. Simon>: Permanent tenants.

<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Can you give a breakdown just to give a rough idea of how much demand it might be for those
temp to perm?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, in this case, we had a couple larger national retailers that we've been going back and
forth. And I think that bulk of it has been the fact that we just finalized those leases and extended them, or redid them
or whatever.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: And what was the average spread for those temp-to-perm conversions?
<A - David E. Simon>: We don't have that in front of us.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yes, hi. A real quick, David. Just on the dividend again just want to make sure if I heard
this correctly. Fourth quarter dividend increase likely assuming the board approves it. So, something similar to a special
and then you would give a sense as to what 2012 could be more on a run rate basis. That was the right way, correct?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. Let me – yes, let me just restate it because it's obviously important. We pay $0.80 a
quarter times four of that is $3.20. It's very likely that we'll in the fourth quarter dividend declaration, which will be
part of our third quarter earnings announcement...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Correct.
<A - David E. Simon>: ...in November – payable in November will include a dividend higher than $0.80 that will be
driven by what our taxable income is. Remember, if you don't pay your taxable income, you can't be a REIT. That
would not be good. We're going to pay our taxable income out, right? That would – by then will have a good sense of
'12's taxable income, and our quarterly run rate for '12 will probably be outlined in that context as well. So, obviously it
will be probably higher than $0.80 cents per quarter. But at that point, we're still – we'll have a better sense of that by
the end of the year.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. Okay, and then last question, on Opry, looking in the supplemental share cost for
the restoration is about 60 million. Is all that out of pocket? Was there insurance proceeds that come into play as well? I
mean, how do we think about that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we've actually worked very diligently and very hard with our lender. They're providing
those funds. And we're suing AON, who's been our broker for a number of years. Unfortunately, has withheld the
additional coverage that we think – we know we're entitled to, and that litigation continues.

Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Yes. Hello, guys. I got to say I like the acquisition of the best asset in Albuquerque, which
is my hometown as it turns out. And I'm curious beyond the obvious plans for the center itself, across the street there's
kind of a defunct old regional mall asset, and then across the other street there's a third tier General Growth asset, that's
a regional mall as well. And I'm wondering if you're thinking beyond the center itself, maybe crossing one of the two
streets in the future?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think the – it's not, – look, we've had no discussion with General Growth. So we're not
going to speak on that asset. But I think you do point out that there's potential on the other one and, we're cognizant of
that asset and what the potential there is. But certainly not the General Growth asset, I mean, I have no comment on
that essentially.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, so you haven't talked David to the private guy that owns the old Winrock Center?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we're aware of what – that could be an interesting situation but it's too early at this point.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, because that's a great area obviously for a broader retail play, it seems like. Okay,
second thing is I'm curious why did you say you don't like to tier assets, that seems, from your guys standpoint
obviously you understand all the assets. From the analyst's, investor's standpoint, it's usually helpful to see the kinds of
stats that you threw out at the beginning of the call on a more defined and formal sort of basis. I'm curious why not put
that tiering together.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I just believe that, to me, a dollar of cash flow is a dollar of cash flow. So, and I
just don't like essentially sometimes what it means internally, but it's not a big issue. I mean, we do it. We look at it.
We'll give you data that we think is important to understand if we think the market is not appreciating what we've got,
and we'll continue to do that. We can cut it a thousand different ways. Our averages obviously mean something because
of the side of the company. So it's not – our averages are not insignificant because it's over a big broad base and math,
you know how math works, right? So it's not just 20 assets that three, four, or five could skew the results one way or
another.
So – but the important thing is look, tell us how you'd like it. We'll factor it in. But we've got a business to run
internally and I don't like to characterize assets by tiers because the fact of the matter is I want every asset we've got to
be better and the best it can be, or we should let somebody else try and achieve that.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. I got you. Thank you. And then, did you guys look at that Niagara Falls outlet center

<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. We are more focused on Toronto than Buffalo frankly. We do, and again, I don't really
know what the deal is, but there are reports that it is in – we don't see it necessarily as a top 25 outlet center. We have
pretty good familiarity with the outlet – the outlets that are out there, but I'm sure they'll do fine with it. But our focus
right now is Toronto not Buffalo.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, right. Great, thanks. And then last thing I have. Steve, I wasn't quite sure if you kind
of hit on this. You might have. But percentage rents this quarter were up sharply and certainly well above what we had
anticipated. And what was the reason for that do you think?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, it could have been your anticipation.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: That could have been the problem, yes, indeed.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: But no, Rich I think we're just seeing the benefit. I mean, obviously, percentage rents are
tough to predict because you have tenants coming in and out of overage rent all the time. But the fact is if you have the
sales growth that we have now seen for the last four or five quarters in a row, it has begun to manifest itself in higher
percentage rates. It's as simple as that.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. So, what we saw in the second quarter could continue to some extent for the
foreseeable future.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Depending on what your assumption is about sales growth going forward. Sure.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Yes, I got you. Okay, great. Thank you, guys.

the recent weakness in UK retailers, you guys feel you dodged a bullet there?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, we know what we're doing. Whether we dodged a bullet or not, I don't know. We
offered what we offered on Capital Shopping Centers a price that we thought we could make work based upon our
industry knowledge and history of past performance. They didn't consider it. I noticed the stock [audio gap] (1:30:55)
Operator
We can now hear you again. You're now live.
<A - David E. Simon>: Perfect, thank you. Sorry about that. I don't know if you heard the last part of my response, but
let me just repeat it. In terms of dodging the bullet on CSC...
<Q>: Right.
<A - David E. Simon>: ...let me just say this, we offered a price that they weren't interested in. The stock obviously
has not gotten that price since we offered it. Our offer was subject to due diligence. But we felt comfortable in offering
that because we had the history of making acquisitions work and – but they were not interested. So that's really all I can
say on it. I don't necessarily think we dodged a bullet. We're very comfortable in underwriting.
We understood the U.K. market; that's why we thought they should've seriously considered our offer subject to due
diligence. They chose not to. But had we done the due diligence and felt comfortable with it, we would've made the
deal work like we have every other deal.
