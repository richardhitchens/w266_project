Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results show we're off to a good start in 2011. In addition,
as you can see from the materials released this morning, the economy, as shown by sales to industrial customers,
continues to gain strength and momentum. The year-over-year increase in industrial sales in 2010 compared with 2009
was 7.7%. In the first quarter of 2011, we've already seen a 6.7% increase in industrial sales compared with the first
quarter of 2010.
This momentum is reflected in the results of a recent Southern Company survey of our top industrial customers in
Georgia. In that survey, 60% of those customers said they expect production increases over the next six months. In
addition, one-third of those industrial customers told us that they anticipate employment increases, and 28% expect
increases in exports. The results of this survey serve to reinforce our own confidence about the near term and long-term
future of our region. So our businesses are performing well and we are on plan.
Turning now to an event which has focused the world's attention on nuclear energy, I'd like to offer some comments on
how we believe that event at the Fukushima plant in Japan might impact the nation's existing and future fleet of nuclear
power plant plants. First, the support and commitment for nuclear energy remains strong at the grass roots level, here in
the Southeast, among key members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and within the Obama Administration.
No doubt there will be lessons learned from the tragic events at Fukushima that will almost certainly apply to the
current fleet of nuclear generation in America. Certainly, we expect there will be a thorough, thoughtful review of those
facilities located in seismically sensitive areas, plants along coastal zones and perhaps other design modifications
particularly with older plants. We believe any mandated changes will not significantly impact the operations of our
existing fleet or be cost prohibitive.
Finally, we believe that any potential impact to our Vogtle 3 and 4 units should be minimal. Recall that the Vogtle site
is not in a seismically sensitive area. We are not on a coastline. We are some 130 miles inland and are 220 feet above
sea level. Finally, the AP1000 design is robust and it's passive safety systems should preclude many of the problems
that occurred in Japan. Our current fleet is safe. Our proposed new units are even safer. With respect to units 3 and 4 at
Plant Vogtle, we are still on track to receive the combined construction and operating license, or COL, by the end of
this year, and we have no indication that the issuance of the COL will be delayed as a result of the NRC's review of the
events in Japan.
My final business update concerns the potential for adding a risk sharing or incentive regulation mechanism into our
current rate mechanism for Vogtle 3 and 4. Our position is that we are always open to constructive agreements that
benefit customers. We believe that current Georgia law, with respect to new nuclear construction, is very clear from a
cost recovery standpoint. Therefore, any agreement must be an improvement on the existing law and must include a
formal recognition of the work that has already been done to reduce the cost to customers of the new units by
specifically including the benefits of conditional, federal loan guarantees, production tax credits, changes made in the
EPC contract, and CWIP in rate base.
We believe in the aggregate that since the certification approval, Georgia Power has brought to the table additional
benefits to our customers of more than $1 billion. Georgia will file its testimony today. A decision on whether to adopt
an incentive plan is expected on August 2nd. Let me say again, we are satisfied with the current rate regime for Vogtle
3 and 4. Any changes would have to improve on that structure.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Art Beattie, our Chief Financial Officer, for a discussion of our financial
highlights for the first quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2011.

Thanks, Tom. As Tom has already pointed out, 2011 is off to a good start. In the first quarter of 2011, we earned $0.50
a share compared with $0.60 a share in the first quarter of 2010, or a reduction of $0.10 a share. Let's now turn to the
major factors that drove our first quarter numbers compared with the first quarter of 2010.
First, the negative factors, the impact of more normal weather in the first quarter of 2011 reduced our earnings by $0.07
a share compared with the first quarter of 2010. As you may recall, unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2010
added $0.09 a share to our earnings in that period when compared to normal weather. Increased depreciation and
amortization reduced our earnings by $0.06 a share in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter of 2010.
This increase primarily due to the expiration of the Georgia Power cost of removal accounting order at the conclusion
of 2010 and to increased environmental transmission and distribution investments.
A decrease in wholesale revenue in our traditional business reduced our earnings by $0.05 a share in the first quarter of
2011 compared with the same period in 2010. This reduction is primarily a result of a portion of the capacity at Plant
Miller in Alabama returning to retail service in May of 2010 after the expiration of a long-term wholesale contract.
Non-fuel O&M reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter of
2010. This reduction is due primarily to increased scheduled outages and increased maintenance cost for our
fossil/hydro fleet as well as increased maintenance on our transmission and distribution system.
The recognition of certain State of Georgia tax credits in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of
2011 reduced our earnings by $0.02 per share. Other income and deduction and taxes other than income taxes reduced
our earnings by $0.02 per share in the first quarter of '11 compared with the first quarter of 2010. Finally, an increase in
the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2011 compared with
the first quarter of 2010.
Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings in the first quarter of 2011. Other revenue affects in our
traditional business added a total of $0.12 per share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the first
quarter of 2010. This was primarily the result of regulatory actions at Georgia Power. Other operating revenues,
primarily related to increased transmission revenues, added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2011
compared with the first quarter of 2010. Finally, improved results at Southern Power, due primarily to new contracts,
added $0.03 per share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter of 2010.
In conclusion, we had $0.26 of negative items compared with $0.16 of positive items, or a negative change of $0.10 per
share over the first quarter of 2010. So overall, our core came in at $0.50 per share.
Before I discuss our earnings estimate for the second quarter, I'd like to update you on the economy and two other
important matters. First, total weather normalized sales for the first quarter of 2011 increased by 1.4% over the first
quarter of 2010 driven primarily by stronger sales to our industrial customers. The improving economy saw industrial
sales increase by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter of 2010. Quarter over quarter, the
most significant increases were in primary metals, up 18%, pipelines, up 17%, transportation, up 11%, and chemicals,
up 10% compared with the first quarter of 2010.
In the primary metals group, Thyssen Krupp is reporting increased demand for its high quality flat rolled steel from its
new facility in Alabama. The increase demand by pipeline customers is largely attributable to increased demand for
home heating oil and natural gas in the Northeast due to colder temperatures in the first quarter of 2011 compared to
the first quarter of 2010. Auto production at manufacturers within our territory remains strong, and low natural gas
prices continue to stimulate chemical production in the U.S.
Adjusting for weather, residential sales declined by 0.9% in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of
2010. Total personal income continued to strengthen, but higher food and energy prices, primarily gasoline, eroded
income gains in the first quarter. However, both regional and national initial claims for unemployment are falling to
levels that would suggest the beginnings of job growth.
As expected, commercial sales remained weak declining 0.8% on a weather normal basis in the first quarter of 2011
compared with the first quarter of 2010. In spite of limited growth in sales in the first quarter there are positive signs.

The Institute of Supply Management's Non-Manufacturing Index has been above 50 for 16 months in a row. In this
particular index, any score above 50 indicates economic expansion in the commercial sector. Additionally, office
vacancy rates have remained flat at around 23%. Also, during 2011, sales tax collections in Alabama and Georgia grew
by 6.8% in the first quarter suggesting an improvement in consumer spending which should bode well for a pickup in
commercial usage.
We continue to see new announcements of industrial and commercial expansions in our service territory. In addition to
those we have mentioned in previous calls, the following have been announced recently. Chevron is planning a $1.4
billion expansion of its refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, which is expected to be completed in mid-2013. Kia Motors
which will begin producing its popular mid-sized sedan, the Kia Optima, at its West Point, Georgia plant in 2012. The
new production line is expected to add 1,000 new jobs, bringing total employment at the plant to nearly 3,000. Thyssen
Krupp is accelerating work on stainless steel remelt facility with production expected to begin in 2012 that is expected
to add approximately 700 jobs, bringing total employment at that facility to 2,700. Finally, two major military base
realignments should have positive net impacts on Georgia Power and Gulf Power of approximately 2,500 new jobs.
In summary, the economy in the Southeast continues to be driven by steady worldwide demand for exports as
evidenced by the port of Savannah which reported an 8% increase in container volumes in the first quarter of 2011. As
we move forward in 2011, barring any unforeseen shocks to the economy, we still believe that the steady expansion in
the industrial sector as well as military base realignments will help drive growth in our residential and commercial
segments.
Before I discuss our dividend, I'd like to briefly review our current thinking on capital expenditures and equity
requirements. As we outlined at our Analyst Meeting last month, our base estimate of capital expenditures for our
traditional business for the three-year period 2011 through 2013 totals $13.3 billion. In addition, we have provided a
range of $700 million to $2.9 billion of potential compliance capital over the same three-year period to address
evolving environmental regulations.
If the EPA's proposed Utility MACT rule is final finalized as proposed, we expect that our capital budget would be
closer to the upper end of that range for the three-year period that we've described. The primary driver that leads to the
upper end of the capital expenditure range is the assumption that compliance with the proposed rule is only achievable
through the installation of baghouses at coal units that we continue to operate or other capital intensive options such as
new gas generation capacity and/or transmission upgrades.
We have not changed our outlook on our equity requirements that will be needed to support our capital budget.
Consistent with our assumptions on capital expenditures, we have provided a range of equity issuances of $900 million
to $1.8 billion over the three-year period. We expect to raise approximately $500 million of new equity through our
internal programs, the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, the Employee Savings Plan, Southern Investment Plan, and the
Employee Stock Option Plan in 2011. We have already raised approximately $200 million of new equity in the first
quarter of this year through these plans. We expect these same plans to provide sufficient equity for the remaining two
years, even near the top end of the equity issuance range. Once the final EPA rules are in place, we should be able to
provide more detail on both our capital expenditure forecast and our financing requirements.
Now, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our dividend increase. As you may have seen last week, we announced a
$0.07 annual dividend increase effective with our second quarter dividend payment in June of this year. The dividend is
now $0.4725 per share on a quarterly basis and $1.89 per share annually. This marks the 254th consecutive quarter that
Southern Company has paid a dividend to its common stockholders and the 10th year in a row that we increased the
dividend. In fact, every year for the past 63 years, Southern Company has paid a quarterly dividend equal to or higher
than the previous quarter's dividend. Our dividend and long-term earnings per share growth assumption, coupled with
strong financial integrity on key components of our overall value proposition.
Turning to our earnings guidance for 2011, we are certainly off to a good beginning in 2011. Our first quarter results
exceeded our estimate by $0.03 per share as we experience a colder than normal January which benefited both our
tradition business and Southern Power. However, as you know, the majority of our earnings are derived in the summer
months of the second and third quarters. Therefore, our guidance will remain at $2.48 to $2.56 per share. Finally, our

estimate for the second quarter is $0.62 per share. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thank you, Art. In closing, I'd like to offer a few words about the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal for new
Maximum Achievable Control Standard, or MACT, for the utility industry. Earlier this month, I had an opportunity to
discuss this issue in a speech before the United States Chamber of Commerce and later that week to appear before the
House Subcommittee on Energy and Power and testify on the proposed regulation. Both of these presentations are on
our Investor Relations website and provide a detailed explanation of our concerns.
In summarizing our position on the EPA MACT, we have four key concerns. First, no matter how you look at it, the
timeline for this rule is unreasonable both for providing comments and for complying. Second, this accelerated
three-year timeline for compliance could put the reliability of the nation's electric generating system at risk. My third
point is that the rushed timeline will also impact electricity affordability. My fourth and final point is that the industry
needs a realistic compliance schedule, a schedule that is based on historical experience, a schedule that allow to us
retrofit existing units and begin work on additional capacity at the same time. As I've said before, we are already
transitioning our generating fleet. We don't need an overly complex and unworkable set of new regulations to hurt our
customers by decreasing reliability, increasing costs, reducing job growth and burdening an already-challenged
economy.
Finally, I'd like to reiterate that we're off to a good start in 2011. Our businesses are performing well and the industrial
side of our economy is nearing pre-recession levels of production. We continue to believe that a resurging industrial
sector will drive an improvement in our residential and commercial classes as we move forward this year. Our primary
focus remains, as it has been for the past 63 years, to provide a reliability and affordable supply of energy to meet the
needs of our customers and the energy requirements of this growing region.
At this point, Howard and I are ready to take your questions. So, operator, we'll now take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andy Levi of Caris and Company.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Wow. I'm never first. How are you guys doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey Andy, how are you? [ph] Sorry, you're late. (22:35)
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Just a quick question. On the COL, I guess I remember – I mean, obviously, you stated that the
schedule is for the end of the year, but at your conference in March, you talked about possibly getting it earlier. Is that
still a possibility?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, I suppose. I think the more realistic expectation we like to keep out there is just by
the end of the year.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay. That's all I had.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Very good.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of Key Bank.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Just looking at your guidance, it looks like for the second quarter, it looks like you are planning
on being flat with last year. But, we still have one more quarter of the accounting order as a headwind, right?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Which accounting order are you referring to, Paul?
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: The depreciation.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That basically ended at the end of last year. There's still about $7 million a quarter that will
be amortized against depreciation, but as you compare to last year, it will be a lot less this year. So depreciation
expense will go up in comparison on the second quarter as compared to last year.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So the headwind comment is true.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, that's true.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And we still expect to be equal.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And you indicated that the first quarter of '11, Southern Power had some new contracts that
added $0.03. When were the contracts signed and how long do we have the tailwind?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, last year we had Plant Wansley that went off contract at the end of 2009 and was off
contract for the first six months of 2010. They are on contract in 2011, so you have about 0% coverage to 65%
coverage in the first six months of the year. And then, I think you had Plant Dahlberg which was not covered last year
and it's more than 100% covered this year. I'm not sure about the length of those contracts, but we can get back to you
if you need it.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Super, thank you.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Bank of America.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah, hi.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: A couple things. First, on your kind of take on complying with the EPA [ph] HAVMACT
(25:18) rule, can you give some flavor on the – one of the things in that proposal was the reliance on dry sorbent
injection. I'm wondering if you can give your point of view on, from your experience on anything you have done, how
reasonable that is? And did you incorporate that at all in your plan, or are you assuming you can't do it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Actually, thanks for that question. As all of you may know, I think Southern Company is
the leader in compliance with these types of equipment modifications. In fact, we've led our industry by adding, I think,
so far about $8 billion of environmental control equipment, and by the 2013 timeframe, we will have added somewhere
between $10 billion and $12 billion in total. So, I think we've got a great deal of experience.
Further, we've been able to put this CapEx into place at a timeframe that makes sense for reliability in the Southeast.
We've done everything on schedule, under budget, and has performed at above industry standards. So I believe we
know what we're talking about here. Further, you may know that Southern Company also is the only company that
remains significantly engaged in proprietary research and development, and we've had a lot of people working on these
issues, frankly, for decades.

With respect to the dry sorbent injection issue, dry sorbent injection is typically used and has had some success in
dealing with things like SO2 and SO3. But, when you consider the consequential effects on the PM standard that's
being proposed, which is, frankly, a new standard, when you take into account not only filterable PMs but condensable
PMs, there's a consequential problem that is introduced by dry sorbent injection and popularly trona.
So, our view is that there may be very selected instances where that might work, but in fact, we believe it will not be a
widespread solution. It's one of the reasons why we really disagree with the proposal put forward in the EPA
regulation. I think their estimate was you would only need to add around 26,000 megawatts of scrubbers. We think the
number's going to be way more around 80,000 megawatts of scrubbers.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Just I guess, separate topic on the issue of the COL. Just from the simple issue of
NRC personnel resources, is that something you're concerned at all about in terms of the NRC being able to come out
on the timeline that you had hoped for?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, you know, listen, as a healthy matter, we're always concerned. But we've received
assurances from the NRC that they have staff dedicated to our process. I think it's easy to complain about Washington
from time to time, but when you consider the support that we've gotten from the Obama administration, from Congress,
from our regulators, with the priority that's been placed on moving forward with this next renaissance of nuclear, we've
been pretty gratified with the response and feel like we're getting the attention we deserve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Thanks, Tom.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure, thank you.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, Tom. Just following up a little bit on Steve's question regarding the [ph] HAVMACT
(28:52) rule. Does the law give you or give the industry leeway in terms of the timeline for implementation of that rule?
I understand that it does for 316B. I understand that I think it does for the Clean Air Transport rule. But do the Clean
Air Act amendments actually give the EPA any flexibility, or if they granted it, would they likely wind up in court
being sued by some of the NGOs?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The consent decree that the EPA voluntarily entered into with Justice provided that.
Justice recognized that this was an enormous, complex and potentially costly issue. And then if the EPA needed more
time in which to evaluate the potential effects that they would be willing – they would be inclined to grant it. It was
interesting, after I gave that speech at the U.S. Chamber, I had a very constructive conversation with Lisa Jackson,
Administrator of the EPA, and we certainly offered our help to her.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: But it sounds like, and I may have misinterpreted this and my apologies if I did. It sounds
like there's leeway in terms of the review and the comment period. Once there's a final rule, do the Clean Air Act
amendments give leeway for the timeline for implementation?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Three years plus a possible one-year extension from the final rule. So there's two
timeframes there, right?
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. I'm not sure I follow you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: One timeframe to comment and analyze the bill and everything else and another
timeframe to comply.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Your testimony mentioned trying to get another 60 to 90, 60 to 120 days of incremental
comment period. It doesn't strike me that's enough to really solve the issue, meaning the issue is really you need five
years to implement.

something. Be very careful. I'm giving you Southern Company's reality.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Our reality is if we could get a 2018 timeframe, we would feel a lot more comfortable
about being able to run our portfolio. Other people have put forward timeframes that are really incomplete in their
scope. They don't take into account the fact that we've got to deal with a portfolio of generation across a wide part of
the United States. All these things must be taken into account, including vendor supplies and including craft labor.
That's going to need to be brought to bear in an orderly way that is economically sensible. All of this is for the benefit
of our customers.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Has anybody that you're aware of done work around what the pricing impact or the cost
impact on pollution control equipment would be if it's all being done in kind of a three to five-year timeframe?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Listen, there's a lot of people running around with estimates, but one can only speculate.
The obvious answer is that it will go up.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Understood. Thanks, Tom. Much appreciated, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Ali.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hey, Ali.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Tom, in your last round of visits out to Washington, have you gotten any sense on any activity going
on there in the Congressional level with regard to these rules? It looks like, obviously, the Senate has tried a few things,
House has been trying, votes are not there. Are you seeing anything there to give you more optimism that things could
move or is that one-year flexibility really the maximum that's out there?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well remember, there's a one-year flexibility that the EPA could grant and we would want
them to grant that immediately, frankly. Secondly, there are provisions where the executive branch could grant an
additional two years. So, there is some flexibility out there.
In respect to the first part of your question, there are lots of, shall we say, initiatives and constructive thinking about
legislative ways to attack this problem. One of the issues that I made a point of raising in my U.S. Chamber speech is
that energy policy is the purview of Congress, which is accountable to the electorate. Some of the outcomes of this
regulation could eliminate, for example, in a practical way, coal being used in the future and on any new sources of
generation. That, to me, strikes at the heart of national policy and that is the purview of Congress.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And also remind us, Tom, let's say the time line does not change and the number of companies,
perhaps you included, don't meet that time line, what is the penalty? Do you need to shut down or are there fines? Can
you remind us what is the penalty for not reaching the time line?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I think what you would do is enter into a set of individual consent decrees with Justice,
company by company.

<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And so that would lead to what? Some kind of fines on your part?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Who knows?
<Q - Ali Agha>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Certainly, certainly and in my constructive conversations with Lisa Jackson, she, I think,
recognizes that the EPA, the last thing they want is to create a reliability crisis. And so, I think this whole issue goes to
developing a constructive outcome on this very complex issue. My sense is that I remain reasonably confident, or
optimistic perhaps, that we've been able to work through some tough, complex issues in the past. And in order to
preserve a sensible economic outcome for our customers, in order to provide a reliable source of electricity for the
United States, people will have to come to grips with reality on this issue.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And last question, you guys have been talking about on Southern Power relatively flat earnings
profile for the next couple of years. When you look at the trend that you saw in the first quarter and the contracts you
alluded to, had you factored that into your thinking or is that incremental? How should we be thinking about Southern
Power over the course of, say, this year and next?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Ali, I think we're still talking flat over the next year or two for Southern Power. There were
some additional contract coverages in the first quarter and probably be some in the second quarter. But as we look out
in time, there are other contracts moving in and out, and that's all factored into our numbers.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: One of the attractive features of Southern Power's portfolio is that they have several sites
that are expandable. When you consider that their strike zone is gas in the Southeast, we feel that they're going to be
able to play a central role in relieving some of the problems that may arise as a result of this proposed regulation.
<Q - Ali Agha>: All right, thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett of Morningstar.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Thanks for all the interesting commentary on the situation with EPA there. I had a couple of
other questions here. First, you mentioned that you're still looking for a relatively minor positive in commercial and
residential usage this year, is that correct?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: So, I'm just wondering overall, what were your sort of usage, total usage forecast that's in your
estimates for this year? Do you have an overall number?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: For the whole year, we're looking at 2.2% growth in the retail side, 2.9% growth in
industrial,1.5% on commercial, and 2.3% in our residential sector.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay, that's helpful. And the second unrelated question, I just saw either today or yesterday that
there was a biomass facility in Georgia that was looking for buyers. And just sort of in that vein, have you been looking
at projects like that? And then sort of renewables elsewhere, how does the landscape look for maybe acquisitions or
new build?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, we're always in the hunt. Renewables are attractive to us. Renewables have certainly
their limitation, specifically with solar and wind. You know we've invested in, I think, it's the nation's second largest
currently operating solar facility. We invested with our partner Ted Turner in New Mexico. And I think we're building
the nation's largest biomass facility in Texas for the benefit of the customers of the city of Austin.
So we continue to look. We're looking at other solar facilities in Alabama and in Georgia and in the coastline of
Florida. As well, we're on record as being not very bullish on wind, but even there, we continue to look at some
applications off the Georgia and Florida coasts. With respect of new biomass, the Industrial Boiler Standard has really
put a hole in those economics and has really chilled any further development there.

And your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie Capital.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Angie.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Hi. How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Super. Hope you're doing well.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Thank you. Two questions. I want to go back to the issue of the timeliness of the COL
issuance. I understand that so far you haven't heard of any potential delays, but don't you think at least there should be
some safety review following the Fukushima accident and there could be some modifications to the reactor design
requirements? I mean, how is this possible that we shouldn't anticipate any delays? I mean, it seems logical or likely.
Isn't it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. Let me kind of explain why I feel that way. I think a lot of the questions that are being
asked have already been answered. Remember there are two processes in place here. One is what we call the DCD.
That's the design control document which was essentially an independent review of whether the technical design
features of the Westinghouse AP1000, in fact, was in the public interest. Was it, in fact, safe? It is the safest design of
any generation of nuclear technology that's ever been introduced. And we think its design features are substantially
better than anything in place right now. And so, that process goes forward. This independent committee and the staff
has recommended to the NRC to begin its rulemaking on the DCD.
The COL is a process which essentially completes the complete application with the NRC. That is, it takes the
Westinghouse AP1000 design and puts it on our site and takes into account any adjustments that are site specific
including balance of plan issues. All of those are what's anticipated to be complete by the end of this year. Now your
point about is there more interest? Are there go to be more comments? We think absolutely. But in substance, we think
a lot of the comments and questions that are being raised have been asked and already answered.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. Now about Southern Power and what's happening in the Southeast given the current
Central Appalachian coal prices and natural gas prices. I am a little bit surprised that you do not expect much more
upside or some upside you your earnings power at Southern Power given its gas blends and given that power from
gas-fired facilities does seem to be cheaper than from coal plants using Central Appalachian coal at this point.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, remember our business model is kind of the anti-merchant, right? We pride
ourselves on securing the vast majority of capacity with long-term contracts, typically divided into two segments. One
segment is associated with the capacity side of the equation. So, it's brick and mortar with a fixed profit stream
associated with those plants, whether they run or not. The second segment of those contracts deals with energy which is
largely fuel and some variable O&M. And there some small profit potential associated with that, largely availability
profits and some other kind of small thing. We did see some of that in the first quarter.

wasn't an enormous number. Where you will see us make substantially more net income is as we either cover the rest of
our uncovered capacity or agree to build new capacity that is currently available to be done on certain expandable sites.

And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan G. Reeder>: Hey, how it is going, Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Jonathan G. Reeder>: Quick question. It looks like you guys tweaked around the usage projections for the full
year. And I kind of understand where you're going with industrial and commercial, but I was a little surprised to see
residential move up. Can you, I guess, articulate if that's due to more customer growth, or it is, I guess, household usage
just based on the economic forecast?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: A little bit of both. We forecasted an increase maybe 18,000 customers in 2011. We picked
up 15,000 last year so we'll have some increase in usage on a per customer basis as well. In the economy, we keep
looking at these other indicators and our one slide, I think it was slide 10, we pointed to a number of new industrial
announcements with job increases and jobs.
One of the – one particular are these BRAC realignments which will start moving some people into some of our
residential markets. One in particular will be at Ft. Benning which will happen by September of this year. There will be
about 10,000 families moving into that particular area and a lot of that cannot be handled on on-base housing so there
will be some pickup on the residential side there. So our forecast pickup some of those trends and that's what we're
looking at.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And our housing data, continues to show steady improvement.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think our unsold vacancies are 2.8%. Normally it's 2.3%.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And we had been as high as around 4%, 4.4%. We continue to get down and as we
consume that inventory, I think, you know, what you're seeing with some of that usage data is unoccupied houses.
<Q - Jonathan G. Reeder>: Okay. So one is growing it out a little bit, the trend of--

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Chin of Citi.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: How are you, Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: In your conversations with Lisa Jackson and other folks at the EPA, did you ever get the
sense that they might be a little bit less willing to extend the commentary period for the toxins rule as we get closer and
closer to sort of the election cycle in 2012? I mean, you're not the first – you guys certainly aren't alone in suggesting
that the commentary period is a little bit too brief. I'm just wondering if you have gotten any sense, are they feeling a
little bit more pressure to try and get this thing wrapped up quickly?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Our conversation was, I'll just say it was very engaging and very constructive and it didn't
go to politics. But, I think the statements that we're able to make here are really pretty clear and compelling. It's a
thousand, roughly, a thousand-page proposed rule. A thousand-page reporting documentation, some of which we
haven't seen, and typically on these MACTs, there's been like nine of them done in the past. We've gotten a minimum
of 120 days and a maximum of 180 days in order to respond. This is arguably the most complex, costly and biggest
scale MACT that has ever been put in place. And so, I think those facts stand on their own. Listen, I think
Administrator Jackson's heart's in the right place. We'll see what happens.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: Great. And then one completely unrelated question. I remember at the end of last year, you
guys got a very interesting reserve mechanism for operating and maintenance in Alabama. Is there a sense of at what
level that reserve amount is at right now? Or can you comment on whether that reserve amount that has grown over the
last quarter?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Brian, at the end of the year, it was $48 million and no, it did not grow at the end of the first
quarter. So, we're still standing at $48 million.

coming through an environmental rider, but in Georgia, could you just remind me of do you have to actually ask

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: All of the operating companies have environmental clauses. At Georgia, Georgia has an
environmental clause as well. And my understanding that is that it does go through the three-year rate-making process
in order for it to be recovered under rates. If it's put into place before the rate hearing takes place, it is simply deferred
until the next case.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Or in excess with what is allowed currently in the current three-year plan. It would be just
be deferred until the next rate case. I think our experience is been in Georgia, we've never had a dollar of environmental
spend not allowed.
<Q - Nathan A. Judge>: In the interim, would you book some sort of AFUDC or how would that actually – or do we
need to – would we actually not see anything until the next rate case?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: AFUDC is booked for any of the construction of the environmental, if that was your
question.
<Q - Nathan A. Judge>: You don't get any cash until after the rate case is approved?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That is correct. [indiscernible] (49:10)
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And you know that's not true for Vogtle.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Nathan A. Judge>: Right, right. But back on the environmental, it's my understanding as you look at your CapEx
and your rate base and things of that nature, that your 5% to 7% growth is not taking into consideration potential
additional spend on additional CapEx things such as the environmental area. Could you give us an idea of how to
reconcile what you're looking for as additional spend on environmental and your long-term growth aspirations?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, as we outlined in our prepared remarks, the CapEx range over the next three years is
$700 million to $2.9 billion and those scenarios are all captured by our 5% to 7% growth estimates that we have
outlined on earnings per share. So, they're in there.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: [ph] It's just taking it higher in the range, (50:15) rather than lower in the range.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The range kind of adequately describes what we believe the future to be.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Nathan A. Judge>: So at the $2.9 billion, we wouldn't see necessarily an increase in that growth rate?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right now, we're at 5% to 7%. That is our guidance. Long-term estimate.
<Q - Nathan A. Judge>: Very good. Thank you so much.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Marc de Croisset MBA>: That actually struck me as a large proportion of unscrubbed capacity in the U.S. and
I'm wondering what it implies, if anything, about your views on national level or Southeast level coal generation
retirements?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. In fact, let me – it would represent about half of the total U.S. coal because half of it
is going to get closed down as a result of this rule. Rough numbers. I think 70,000 megawatts nationally and there's
estimates around that. But 70,000 megawatts will be retired as a result of this rule. And therefore, the remaining
scrubbers would be added to those that remain.
<Q - Marc de Croisset MBA>: Got you. And when you look, as a follow-up, as you look at your CapEx forecast, and
I understand it's hard to be very specific at this point, but you mentioned some pieces of equipment. I heard baghouses,
and I may have missed this, but was scrubbers in there, replacement gas generation? Did you have any sense for what
the basket of CapEx might be composed of?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That is a wonderful question, but I got to describe it this way. It's going to one or two
things, right? We are either going to control and therefore add a lot of environmental equipment. Now remember, we've
got, let's just say round numbers, we have 20,000 megawatts of coal. 12,000 is what we consider our flagship units. All
of our flagship units will have scrubbers, SCRs in place by 2013. And some of those have baghouses.
Now, with respect of the other 8,000, we have to make a decision on a unit-by-unit basis because of the complexity of
the rule. And we will only know that until we have a final rule, then we must make an assessment on a unit-by-unit
basis. We must take into account transmission alternatives. We must design it. We must procure it, and then we must
build it. That's why you need to build a scrubber, our experience and we're more experienced at this than anybody in
the industry, about 54 months from beginning to end to make those assessments. That's why the three-year doesn't
work.
For those units that we do not control, we must replace. And therefore, we've got to make some assessment as to where
that generating capacity will be. One of the problems that people are tending to wash away here is the fact that there is
this belief that there's lots of molecules of gas in the ground and it's at a reasonable cost. Well, we agree with that fact.
The problem is that gas needs to get to where we need it, in terms of generating capacity and the pipe infrastructure
does not exist to do that in this timeframe. Therefore, there has to be a build out of gas infrastructure in order to support
this evolution of our generating fleets across America. We think that is another critical issue that has not been taken
into account in addressing these timeframes.
So the final point I want to make here, too, this is not some theoretical national issue we are dealing with. These issues
get brought to home in the localities that we serve, and there are potential, enormous social consequences. When you
shut down a coal plant for a similarly sized gas plant, you lose jobs on about a 6-to-1 ratio, and these typically are
higher paying jobs. Remember, too, that these units are located in rural areas of the United States, largely, and that they
may represent significant portions of the tax base of the communities that they're located in.
And in fact, I introduced some testimony in Congress a couple weeks ago now where for, I think it was Putnam County
in Georgia, the branch units represented about 19% of the tax base for that community. There are other examples in our
territory where it's numbers are bigger than that. When you shut down those plants, what do you say to those
communities and how they're going to run their business just to serve the public at-large? These are enormous
consequences and really reach to the heights of policy level issues, not just environment issues.
<Q - Marc de Croisset MBA>: Thanks for all that color, Tom. Appreciate it.

And your next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan of Visium Asset Management.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Ashar.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Hi, Tom, how are you doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Tom, if I heard correct, you expect 70 gigawatts to be retired as part of this law, higher than what
the EPA's came out with, is that correct?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. Absolutely.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. And then just I guess, as I kind of look at it and I discuss it a little bit at the Analyst
Meeting, the easy way is to go to the President and get a two-year extension and you don't have to go through this
whole legislative process and everything. So why haven't you or I guess because it might be divided views among the
sector. Why haven't you guys just focused on that aspect of it, which seems to be the easiest way in terms of
implementation? Is that really hard to achieve?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. Listen, we got a long track record of dealing with these kinds of issues. I know
people are kind of amped up about all of this. But, here's our view. For any major kind of body of legislation,
regulation, what have you, we always consider how to engage constructively to get the best solution for reliability and a
sensible economic impact for the benefit of our customers. We will certainly engage in the regulatory process. We will
certainly engage in a regulatory process. And if need be, we will undertake litigation if that helps clarify the issues at
hand. So we're going to doing all three in a parallel path.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. But isn't getting the two-year extension from the President the easiest way to achieve your
objective?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It certainly is one way. The issue here, though, is we need to have-- remember what I said.
You are going to have to go unit by unit. You're going to have to design. You're going to have to procure equipment
and you're going to have to secure a source of craft labor, okay? So you need to know in order to schedule that work,
you need to know that you have sensible timeframes involved rather than trying to pancake control efforts and new
capacity requirements, new pipe line requirements, everything on top of each other. There has to be a sensible way to
do this. Even NRC, there's a national effort underway to get arms around this issue. If we were to get and extension
from the EPA and two years from the administration, that would be plus three, gets to us 2018. That starts to make
sense for us, but we would need to have that knowledge at the outset.

debt issuance and so forth, but I was wondering if you could update us on what you have done so far in 1Q, first
quarter?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: First quarter, we've issued about $1 billion in new debt and the equity side, we've issued
$193 million. And CapEx, we have spent right just over $1 billion on CapEx. I think our budget for the year is $4.9
billion.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: So then based on that, what was the total debt balance at the end of the quarter?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think we're around $20 billion. Yeah. That's right.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay, and then I had a couple questions just related to the comparisons of the earnings. You
mentioned that $0.01 of the other revenues was related to transmission, increased transmission revenues. Is that
something that will continue throughout the year?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes. We expect that to continue. The UPS contracts, which expired in association with the
Miller Plant that I described, all of the transmission cost or revenues were recorded in one line item there as wholesale
revenues. As those contracts were replaced with other plants, the revenue will be recorded as transmission revenue. So
it will be picked up in that particular line item going forward.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: And then the $0.05 on the wholesale revenues you that mentioned, is that also showing up
then in the results for Alabama Power on last page of the release?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, that's correct.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Would there be any sort of -- since that returned to the retail jurisdiction, would you see
some sort of a gain then on that side as that goes into the retail rate base?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, the allowed retail rate base, allowed range of returns in Alabama are 13% to 14.5%.
So, depends on the operations of that particular rate and how that particular plan impacts the operation of that rate.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay, and then the last thing I was wondering, you mentioned on the $0.12 was primarily on
the retail revenue impacts, was primarily Georgia. How much of that was Georgia? And will that be continuing as the
quarters goes on?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I believe all of that was Georgia Power. There were no operations at Alabama Power of RSE
this year. There are there's a little bit of Alabama Power from their environmental clause, but it's very small. Maybe a
$0.01 of the $0.12, but no other operations at Mississippi or Gulf.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: So will that that Georgia impact continue on a quarter, year-over-year comparison basis?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thanks, Dan.

Your next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti of CDP.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Vedula.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Good afternoon. I want to make sure, following up on Jonathan Reeder was asking you about in
terms of particularly, residential sales growth. I want to make sure if I thought about – if I heard the numbers properly.
If you are down 0.9% in the first quarter on a weather adjusted basis and for the full year, you are expecting a positive
2.3% on a weather adjusted basis, I know you indicated that we're going to see significant acceleration in the second
half of the year and you cited some examples. Given the other aspects that you cited, such as gas prices and other things

like that, am I thinking that we really need to see 3%, 3.5% the rest of the way in order to get to 3% or am I comparing
apples and oranges here?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, when we prepared that forecast, it was probably mid to somewhere around mid-2010
when we prepared that forecast, and we obviously didn't pick up any of the $100 price of oil in our forecast at that time.
There is also other noise and weather data that we experienced that, it's just very difficult to extract all of that particular
noise. So – but we still feel like the growth in the sales will come in the second half in both sectors, both residential and
commercial.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And even if it doesn't, I mean, where we have been off in our forecast has been industrial
has been way outstripping what we thought. What was our original industrial estimate?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: 2.9%.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And it's been 6.7%.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: 6.7%, right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So that's happened all last year. It looks as if that will happen also this year. And then
remember, if you want to weight-average the sales, substantial part of our sales occurred June through the first two
weeks in September. So we'll see what happens there.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: So just to put it in context, a 1% differential on weather adjusted residential growth, what type of
gross margin differential for a full year would that kind of roughly amount to?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's about – if you spread it across all classes, a 1% increase is about $0.075.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's against all classes.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: So then residential would be maybe a third of that or so?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, that's correct.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, sir.

And you have a follow-up from Andy Levi of Caris and Company.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Andy, now you're first and last, right?
<Q - Andrew Levi>: First and last, there you go. Vedula kind of brings up a good point. And I guess is there any
flexibility if the sales don't come around to cut costs as far as O&M or other areas of the company?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure, absolutely.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: We have that flexibility and that's all buried into our range as well. That's why we give you a
range in earnings per share growth.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay and then one other question. On an earlier call, I guess they're not your competitors, but
another large utility who is talking about EPA rules and they were discussing power prices looking forward. I just
wondering what you guys view as, again, I know you are mainly regulated. But I guess their view was that power
prices in the '14, '15 and I think as far as '16, but power prices weren't reflecting the new EPA rules. And so I was
wondering what your views are on that?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, listen, I'm going to speak to our markets. Interestingly, just letting all this happen in
a disorganized way, actually serves to accelerate our net income, but we think that is bad for our customers. Our
interest is in providing a long-term view and providing the best reliability at the lowest prices with the best customer
satisfaction possible. That is what we are for.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: But, again, you have no view on long-term wholesale prices?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No view on their markets.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
At this time there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?
Thomas A. Fanning
Well, listen, I just want to say thank you all for joining the call. It's an exciting time at Southern. We've got a lot going
on and a lot to be positive on in the future.
This industrial growth, we think, will sustain and we think eventually residential, commercial are will follow with it.
And we'll continue to follow through on our disciplined approach to our businesses and our conservative outlook and
our focus on customers. Thank you very much.
