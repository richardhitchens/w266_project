John G. Stumpf
Thanks, Jim. Good morning and thanks for joining us today.
We produced record results in the third quarter despite a choppy economic environment as we continued to execute
Wells Fargo's diversified business model, which has guided us for decades. Our diversified businesses generated record
net income of $4.1 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 21% from a year ago; and a record EPS of $0.72, an
increase of 20% from a year ago. Our focus on meeting our customers' financial needs led to robust deposit growth and
our strongest quarterly loan growth since our merger with Wachovia almost three years ago. We also benefited this
quarter from lower expenses and continued improvement in credit quality.
As the economic environment in the quarter remains uneven, Wells Fargo has not wavered from our commitment to do
all we can to help our customers and the overall economy. For example, we remain committed to helping homeowners
stay in their homes. Since 2009, we have hosted 40 Preservation Workshops, opened 27 Home Preservation Centers,
initiated over 716,000 active trial or completed mortgage modifications. Within our Pick-a-Pay portfolio loan, we have
forgiven over $4 billion of principal since we acquired this portfolio from Wachovia and modified approximately
one-third of our total Pick-a-Pay loans as we strive to give customers an affordable, sustainable payment.
We're also lending, providing companies with funds to invest for growth and job creation. As the number one small
business lender for nine consecutive years, we are committed to helping small businesses succeed by actively lending.
During the first three quarters of this year, we made over $10 billion in new loan commitments to our small business
customers, an 8% increase from a year ago.
We are also the number one lender to middle sized companies, and we've grown loans to middle-market commercial
customers for 14 straight months. And we continue to lend throughout our businesses, both commercial and consumer,
with our core loan portfolio growing by $13.5 billion in the third quarter alone.
In addition to serving the financial needs of our business and individual customers every day, we also strengthen our
communities in many other ways. Wells Fargo employs one in every 500 Americans. And last year we contributed
$219 million to 19,000 non-profits across the U.S., making us America's third most generous cash donor according to
the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Our team members throughout the country are active volunteers in the communities
where they live and work, volunteering a total of over 900,000 hours during the first nine months of this year alone. We
know that with each community's success comes our success.
I also want to highlight a very important milestone that occurred this past weekend. We completed our last retail
banking state conversion, North Carolina. With all our banking stores in the U.S. operating under the Wells Fargo
brand, I believe we now have the best leadership team, the best products and services, and the best distribution system
we've ever had at Wells Fargo.
Our successful integration reflects an incredible effort made by our entire team. Since we first started working to
integrate Wachovia almost three years ago, we have converted over 3,000 Wachovia retail banking stores and more
than 38 million customer accounts, including mortgage, deposits, trust, brokerage, and credit cards onto one common
platform. While the effort required to convert Wachovia stores and millions of accounts was tremendous, the real
measure of success will be our ability to retain and grow customer relationships in the East and throughout our
franchise going forward as One Wells Fargo.
A cornerstone of those relationships and one of the most valuable parts of our franchise is our ability to attract and
retain core deposits. Since the merger with Wachovia, we have grown checking and savings accounts deposits by $185
billion. That's just in three years. We achieved this growth through building relationships with customers, not pricing.
In fact, our average deposit costs were only 25 basis points in the third quarter.

So with the Wachovia integration nearing successful completion, we remain focused on Wells Fargo's time tested
formula for success, an unwavering focus on helping our customers succeed financially. By focusing on our
opportunities to better serve our customers and grow our businesses, Wells Fargo has never been better positioned for
future growth.
Let me now turn this over to Tim for more detail on our financial results. Tim?
Timothy J. Sloan
Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. My remarks, which will take approximately 20 minutes, will follow the
presentation included in the first half of the quarterly supplement, starting on page two. John and I will then take your
questions.
As John highlighted, we had record earnings of $4.1 billion in the third quarter, up 3% from the second quarter and
21% from a year ago. And we achieved record EPS of $0.72, also up 3% from last quarter and 20% from a year ago.
During a continued period of economic volatility, our diversified model has performed for our shareholders, with four
consecutive quarters of earning asset growth and seven consecutive quarters of EPS growth.
It is important to note that while our total revenue was down $758 million compared with the second quarter, half of
this decline was from items that are relatively neutral to the bottom line, lower deferred compensation plan investment
results, and seasonally lower insurance, which have offsets in expenses. And the rest of the decline is due to lower
equity gains.
Our pre-tax pre-provision profit increased slightly in the quarter to $8 billion. The ROA remained strong at 1.26%. And
our ROE was 11.86%, up almost 100 basis points from a year ago. These results generated strong internal capital
growth, producing an estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under current Basel III capital proposals of 7.4%. We
remain focused on meeting the required capital levels once Basel III is finalized while returning capital to our
shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
On page three, we highlight our diversified business model. Our results this quarter and the business momentum we see
ahead derive from our basic banking strategy and the diversity of our businesses. This is a major differentiator for
Wells Fargo. In the third quarter, we remained balanced between consumer and commercial loans and fee and spread
income, and our sources of fee income are broadly diversified. Each quarter is different in terms of which customer
segments or businesses drive results. But as we've demonstrated through many different economic environments, our
business model provides us with a tested ability to perform over time and through cycles. It is also important to note
that our performance has not come at the expense of risk discipline, as we believe we maintain one of the lowest risk
profiles in our industry.
Let me take a minute up front to highlight some of the key business drivers this quarter, and then I'll follow up with
more detail later in my remarks. Starting with the balance sheet, we generated strong loan growth this quarter, with our
core loan portfolio up $13.5 billion or 2% from the second quarter, which excludes the expected $5.3 billion runoff
from the liquidating portfolio. By staying consistent and serving customers when the market was soft, we're now
benefiting from the relationships that we've developed over the last few years.
We also actively deployed some of our liquidity this quarter, with our securities portfolio increasing $20.9 billion as we
increased purchase activity. We also generated exceptionally strong deposit growth, with balances up $41.8 billion,
driven by a flight to quality and new account growth. This strong deposit growth was the primary driver behind the
decline in the NIM this quarter, accounting for about 70% of the change from the second quarter, but was slightly
positive to net interest income.
We also lowered our other funding costs by reducing long-term debt by $9.7 billion and recalled $5.8 billion of
high-cost Trust Preferred Securities [TruPS] in the third quarter, which were redeemed earlier this month. This
redemption will benefit net interest income and NIM starting in the fourth quarter.

Let me now turn to the income statement. Net interest income was down $136 million as balance sheet repricing and
lower variable income was partially offset by growth in loans, securities, and the mortgage warehouse as well as one
extra day in the quarter.
Turning to the fee side, we had revenue growth in many of our businesses, including an increase of over $200 million
in mortgage banking. If you isolate our revenue items that are market sensitive, trading, debt, and equity gains, these
three items again generated positive results, $202 million of revenue this quarter.
The linked-quarter decline in market sensitive revenue of $808 million was due to four factors. First, as I've mentioned,
equity gains declined $380 million from very strong second quarter equity investment business results. Second, trading
losses included a $234 million linked-quarter decline in deferred compensation plan investment results, which reduced
employee benefits expense by approximately the same amount, so no overall impact to the bottom line. Third, a loss
and a gain on resolving two legacy Wachovia positions partially offset one another, but reduced market sensitive
revenue by $106 million. And finally, customer driven trading results were down $108 million from the second quarter
on weaker market conditions.
Non-interest expense declined $798 million from the second quarter, which included a $235 million reduction from
deferred compensation. The linked-quarter decline was also driven by $108 million in lower merger integration
expenses and $230 million in lower operating losses, reflecting lower litigation accruals.
Let me now cover our results in more detail. As shown on page six, period end loans were up $8.2 billion from the
second quarter, reflecting our commitment to our commercial and retail customers through this period of economic
uncertainty. Most of this growth came near the end of the quarter; and therefore, our average loans were up just $3.3
billion. Loan growth was once again driven by our commercial portfolio, which grew $9.1 billion or 3% from the
second quarter, and was diverse across our commercial businesses. This growth also reflects our ability to capitalize on
the opportunities generated in the business environment, including the purchase of $1.1 billion in loans from the Bank
of Ireland, which were all U.S. based and largely all commercial real estate.
Excluding the runoff of $4.5 billion of liquidated consumer loans, core consumer loans grew $3.5 billion. Loans grew
in a number of consumer portfolios, including mortgage, core auto, credit card, and private student lending. The runoff
of the liquidating portfolio continued as expected, down $5.3 billion from the second quarter and down $74 billion or
39% since the Wachovia merger.
As I mentioned earlier, deposit growth was exceptionally strong this quarter, driven by both the flight to quality and
new account growth. Average core deposits were up $29.4 billion from the second quarter and up $64.9 billion or 8%
from a year ago and were 111% of average loans. Average core checking and savings deposits were $769 billion, up
12% from a year ago, and were 92% of average core deposits.
Consumer checking accounts were up 5.6% from a year ago. And we experienced strong growth throughout our
markets, including 7% growth in California and 9.8% growth in North Carolina.
We continued to be effective in lowering funding costs, with average deposit costs declining to 25 basis points, down 3
basis points from the second quarter and 10 basis points from a year ago, evidence that we still have the ability to
reprice deposits even in this low rate environment. This strong deposit growth will benefit Wells Fargo over time as we
grow our relationships with new customers and use these deposits to fund future loan and securities growth.
But as I mentioned earlier, this growth was dilutive to NIM this quarter, which is why we've always said we don't
manage to the NIM. Our goal is to generate more business from our existing customers and grow our customer base,
and that may increase or decrease NIM in any given quarter. Instead, we manage our business with a focus on net
interest income, and this is how we return value to our shareholders.
Our net interest income declined $137 million from the second quarter. Let me highlight the drivers on page eight.
First, lower income from balance sheet repricing was partially offset by growth in loans, securities, and the mortgage
warehouse. And while the expected runoff of our liquidating loans, which had a weighted average yield of 5.61%, puts
downward pressure on net interest income, these loans generally have higher charge-offs and cost more to service.

Second, we had lower income from variable sources, including loan prepayments and resolutions. These factors were
partially offset by the benefit of an extra day in the quarter.
Let me continue the discussion of net interest income on page nine. NIM and net interest income do not necessarily
move in sync, and this quarter was a great example of that. The deposit growth we had this quarter actually had a small
positive impact to net interest income of $13 million, but diluted our NIM by 12 basis points. Growing net interest
income remains our focus, and the size and mix of earning assets are keys to achieving that goal. The available-for-sale
portfolio has grown by over $39 billion in the last two quarters, and loans outstanding have grown nearly $9 billion
despite the continued runoff of the liquidating portfolio. The mortgage warehouse grew by $11.5 billion in the third
quarter, benefiting from current refi wave.
While earning asset growth is the primary driver of net interest income growth, our liability mix also influences our net
interest income trends. The benefit from the redemption of $5.8 billion of TruPS will begin in the fourth quarter, and
the long-term debt outstanding was down $9.7 billion in the third quarter, with an additional $9 billion maturing in the
fourth quarter. Obviously, three of the biggest drivers of net interest income over time are the size and mix of our
securities and loan portfolios and our funding cost. Over the course of 2011, these have all moved in the right direction,
and we feel confident that that trend will continue.
Non-interest income was down $622 million from the second quarter, driven by the $808 million linked-quarter decline
in market sensitive revenue that I highlighted earlier. Trust and investment fees declined $158 million from the second
quarter on lower brokerage transaction activity and weaker investment banking. We have generated linked-quarter
growth in deposit service charges, card fees, other fees including charges and fees on loans, mortgage banking, and
operating leases.
Mortgage banking revenue was up $214 million or 13% from the second quarter. Originations increased $25 billion or
39% from the second quarter. And application volume rose $60 billion or 55% during the quarter. The unclosed
mortgage pipeline increased $33 billion to $84 billion at the end of the quarter. This is one of the largest pipelines
we've had since the merger.
As it relates to revenue, it is important to note that the fair value of our interest rate locks at time of commitment, but
we recognize the majority of our gain at the time of funding. Therefore, the increase in applications in the third quarter
should benefit fourth quarter revenue.
As a reminder, last quarter we provided an update on the impact of Federal Reserve rules regarding debit interchange
fees. Our estimate is unchanged. And starting in the fourth quarter, we estimate these lower fees will reduce earnings
by approximately $250 million quarterly after tax before any offsets. We expect to recapture at least half of this over
time through volume and product changes.
Non-interest expense declined $798 million or 6% from the second quarter. The large linked-quarter decline was driven
by a few significant items. A $384 million decline in employee benefit expense; this is where the $235 million decline
in deferred compensation is reflected, which was an offset in trading revenue. Merger integration costs were $376
million, down $108 million from the second quarter. We had $198 million of operating losses, down $230 million,
driven by lower litigation accruals. We had a $107 million decline in insurance expenses due to seasonally lower crop
insurance, which also reduced insurance revenues.
While we had strong reductions in expenses this quarter, as we have said previously, non-interest expense trends will
vary from quarter to quarter. But we are still targeting non-interest expense of $11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012.
For example, in the fourth quarter of this year we expect expenses to be higher than the third quarter, driven by higher
mortgage expenses as we add team members to capture the increased revenue opportunities driven by refinance
activity. We also expect higher merger integration costs, and we typically have seasonally higher fourth quarter
expenses in a number of areas.
Also, as we said last quarter when we provided our expense target, we will continue to invest in our businesses and add
team members where appropriate. We expect to continue to have positive operating leverage and recognize savings as
Project Compass is executed over the next five quarters.

Turning briefly to our segment results, starting on page 13, Community Banking earned $2.3 billion, up 11% from the
second quarter, driven by stronger mortgage banking revenue. Sales trends remain strong. Core product sales in the
West were $8.8 million, up 15% from the prior year. And core product sales in the East continue to grow by double
digits.
Retail banking cross-sell continued to grow to record of 5.91 products per household, up from 5.68 a year ago.
Cross-sell in the East was 5.39, up from 5.10 a year ago. The majority of our retail banking markets in the East were
already converted by the third quarter, which helped to accelerate cross-sell growth in these markets. The East is also
benefiting from more than 1,000 incremental platform banker FTEs added over the past year, a 10% increase.
Wholesale Banking earned $1.8 billion, down 6% from the second quarter, driven by a 9% decline in revenue. The
decline in revenue was driven by lower capital markets, trading and resolution income, and seasonally lower insurance.
However, most other businesses grew revenue, such as commercial banking, government banking, capital finance,
asset-backed finance, and international. Wholesale Banking continued to generate strong broad-based loan growth from
both new and existing customers, with average loans up 4% from the second quarter. This growth occurred in almost
all portfolios, including commercial banking, international, commercial real estate, capital finance, asset-backed
finance, government banking, and corporate banking.
Average core deposits increased $19 billion from the second quarter, up 10%, our largest quarterly increase since the
merger with Wachovia. This growth reflects the combination of the flight to quality and the fact that our commercial
customers are holding more liquidity.
Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $291 million, down 13% from the second quarter, driven by lower securities
gains and reduced brokerage transaction revenue, reflecting lower market activity; while credit quality continued to
improve, driving loan losses lower. Average loans were stable from the second quarter, with growth in brokerage
originated loans. Average core deposits increased $7.4 billion, up 6% from the second quarter, reflecting both the flight
to quality and our continued success in attracting client assets, including deposits.
Managed account asset net flows remained strong despite market volatility. Asset levels were down 9% from the
second quarter, reflecting the impact of the market decline. Our continued focus on meeting our customers' financial
needs is reflected in achieving an average cross-sell ratio of ten products per WB&R household.
Credit quality continued to improve, as shown on page 17. We are very pleased with how our loan portfolios are
performing. Charge-offs declined for the seventh consecutive quarter, down $227 million from the second quarter, 52%
below the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009. While we continued to see positive trends in credit performance, the rate
of improvement moderated with some portfolios in the quarter, as expected at this point in the credit cycle. Provision
expense was $1.8 billion, down $27 million from the second quarter, including an $800 million reserve release. Absent
significant deterioration in the economy, we expect future reserve releases.
Other credit metrics showed continued improvement also. Non-performing assets were down $1.1 billion from the
second quarter, reflecting lower inflows of commercial non-accrual loans. Early-stage delinquency balances were down
modestly while delinquency rates were stable.
The past few quarters I discussed the quality of our mortgage servicing portfolio and why we believe it is among the
best in the industry, so I won't go into a lot of detail here. But since the risks associated with mortgage servicing are
still important to investors, let me highlight just a few key items, starting on page 19. The majority of our $1.8 trillion
residential servicing portfolio, or 69%, is serviced for the agencies, and only 6% are private securitizations where we
originated the loans.
Reflecting the quality of our portfolio, our delinquency and foreclosure rate is over 400 basis points lower than the
industry average excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recent publicly available data. Wells Fargo's total
delinquency and foreclosure rate was 7.63% in the third quarter, down from a peak of 8.96% in the fourth quarter, but
up modestly from the second quarter due to seasonality. Losses on repurchases were up $123 million in the quarter, but
total demands outstanding were down in both number and balances for the fifth consecutive quarter and down

approximately 50% from the third quarter of last year.
We added $390 million to the repurchase reserve this quarter, up $148 million from the second quarter, primarily due
to an increase in demands from Fannie Mae on 2006 through 2008 vintage loans. Demands from Freddie Mac
continued to be consistent with our expectations.
As shown on page 21, our strong internal capital generation continued and capital ratios grew. Tier 1 common equity
ratio increased to 9.35%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter and up 134 basis points from a year ago. Our
estimated Tier 1 common equity under current Basel III proposals grew to 7.4% this quarter. $5.8 billion of Trust
Preferreds were redeemed earlier this month, with a weighted average coupon of 8.45%. This redemption reduced our
Tier 1 capital ratio in the third quarter, but the benefit to net interest income and NIM will begin in the fourth quarter.
We repurchased 22 million shares in the third quarter and an additional estimated 6 million shares through a forward
repurchase transaction that will settle in the fourth quarter of 2011. We plan to continue to repurchase shares in the
fourth quarter pursuant to our capital plan.
In summary, our diversified business model continued to produce record results this quarter, with earnings up 21%
from a year ago. In the quarter, we saw continued growth in earning assets, loans, securities, deposits, and capital.
Many individual businesses, both consumer and commercial, generated revenue and loan growth. By focusing on
meeting our customers' financial needs, we continued to generate very strong deposit growth and had the largest
linked-quarter increase in loans in 11 quarters. And based on current business trends, we expect loan growth to
continue.
We remain focused on our efforts, targeting $11 billion in quarterly non-interest expense by the fourth quarter of 2012.
However, next quarter we expect higher expenses, driven by strong mortgage origination volumes, which will also
benefit revenue; higher merger expenses; and typical fourth quarter seasonality.
During the first nine months of this year, we've grown our securities portfolio by $35 billion. And loans, excluding the
expected runoff, were up by $20 billion. Deposits have increased $47 billion. Long-term debt is down $24 billion, and
we've redeemed $9 billion of TruPS. Clearly, we have positioned our balance sheet very well for growth. With the
completion of the conversion of Wachovia banking stores this weekend, we are very optimistic about the growth
opportunities we have throughout our company operating as One Wells Fargo.
I will now open the call up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford C. Bernstein.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Hi, good morning, a question on the net interest income and the margin. So first, I guess of
the 17 basis point drop, you mentioned 12 of it due to deposits. What were the other five basis points, what would you
say that was driven by?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: You know what, John, it was a mix across a number of factors. None of them really stood
out. It was a five basis point decline, which really wasn't that significant.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay. Can you give us any feel for how much benefit you expect to get from the TruPS
retirement?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Just at the margin, John, you can take the 845 basis points and subtract it from our marginal
cost of funds, which this quarter was 25 basis points, and then you can annualize that, so it's pretty significant. It's over
$200 million, I think, after tax a year.

terms of calling the TruPS. But in terms of specifically which TruPS we'll call and when we're going to call, I'd prefer
not to be specific about that right now. But as we did this quarter, we're going to continue to be as aggressive as we can
be in redeeming TruPS pursuant to their terms as quickly as we can given the cost of those TruPS and the fact that
they're not additive to capital any longer.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay. And then just back on the margin and the $42 billion of deposit inflow and that
getting invested into low yielding securities, what kind of stuff are you investing this deposit flow into, and where can
we look on the balance sheet to see these growing low yielding asset accounts?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: John, I didn't say they were going into low yielding. I think they're going into securities.
First, we want them to go into loans. Again, we were very pleased with the loan growth that we had in the second
quarter, and we feel poised for continued loan growth in the fourth quarter.
As it relates to the types of securities, we go through our standard quarterly process. We look at what we think provides
good risk/return. But it was a mix from shorter term high quality securities all the way to medium term as well as
longer term securities, so it's a mix. There wasn't anything in particular. It's just across all the categories in the
statement.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: John, maybe I can just give you my sense. The way I think about the NIM is, as Tim
mentioned, we don't run the company around the NIM. We never have. We really run it around trying to add long-term
shareholder value, and we think we can do that best by serving individuals and companies completely and deeply. And
the things that we can manage, like loan growth and deposit growth and more customers and deeper relationships, we're
doing those sorts of things. Because it is an unusual rate environment today, some of that you don't get paid for right
away. And we are making investments. We had the best loan growth we've had, frankly, since the merger. And when
we look at securities, we look at safety, quality. We look at the duration and all those things. And because of our strong
deposit growth, we still are a very liquid company, but we continue to make investments as we see opportunistic
opportunities.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay. Thanks, John, and one quick follow-up just on capital return. John, maybe you could
comment on this. What is your hope in terms of next year's capital return in terms of buybacks and dividends? Do you
hope to do more than you did this year in buybacks and dividends? And do you know the rules yet that the Fed will
hold you to in terms of 2012 capital distributions?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: The answer is, I think, yes and no, so let me take the last question first. We don't know what
the SIFI reserve or the buffer is going to be. We hope to hear sometime in the fourth quarter. And you're right; we have
the annual plan coming up soon, our capital plan that we will discuss with our regulators. And we have stated publicly
that – I've stated publicly and I think we've also – you've seen it in Tim's comments and other things that we have
written that we want to return more capital to our shareholders.
And I don't want to get into specifics because the plan is just being developed now. But I'm confident that given where
we are today in the absolute number; we're at 7.4% Tier 1 common Basel to the third degree. And we're not that – when
you look at the risk profile of the company, it's not on – we're not global. We don't have a lot of the risk that others do.
And on top of that, we're generating just lots of internal capital. So you put all that together and that's why I just don't
worry about that, and I want to get as much back to shareholders as fast as we can. And dividends are an important part
of that, let me just say that.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Joe.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: You mentioned, Tim, much of the loan growth came late in the quarter. I was wondering if
you can talk about how customer sentiment evolved over the quarter and if you're seeing more confidence there
recently? And also maybe comment on the risk-adjusted return opportunities you're seeing in the CRE area right now
and the competitive environment as well.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, it seems like a long time ago, but there was a lot of volatility in the third quarter. If you
remember, some of the things we watched on television in late July; and then, obviously, there was a lot of concern and
there still is a lot of concern about what is going on in Europe.
I think generally when you look at our customer base, customer sentiment is good. The economy continues to bump
along a little bit, but the customer sentiment is good. As I said and will reiterate, we feel good about loan growth in the
quarter. And I think one of the reasons why we feel good about it is that it's really broad based. As I mentioned, I gave
some examples in terms of loan growth both in our commercial or our wholesale and our consumer portfolios. It's
seven, eight, nine, ten businesses that are growing loans across the board. It's not concentrated anywhere. It's not one
industry. It's not one geography, so we're feeling good about that.
And as it relates to CRE, I think the fact that we stayed consistent in that business over this cycle, which was very
difficult at times for the commercial real estate business, is really paying dividends right now. We're the largest
commercial real estate lender in the country. There is lots of opportunities to help our existing customers to refinance
their existing loans. As they buy new properties, we can provide capital to them. And then also as the CMBS market
continues to mature and refinance, there are opportunities there. So overall, the commercial real estate business and the
risk-adjusted returns there are pretty attractive.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And also, Joe, as you noticed or you probably read that we were able to buy some loans on an
opportunistic basis from some international competitors that are getting out of the U.S. market.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: No, that's very helpful; I guess just one follow-up to John's question. The buyback was a bit
less this quarter despite the recent drop in the stock over the period; I guess any comments on that as part of your
overall capital deployment plan?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Joe, that's a real fair question. When you think about our capital plan, you've got to think
about it as being a very balanced plan. And it's true that we bought back fewer shares of stock in the third quarter than
we did in the second. But on the other hand, we also retired some pretty high cost TruPS. And to reiterate, we continue
or we plan to continue to buy back shares this quarter. Again, we have a very measured and balanced plan that we want
to execute to. And we think by doing that, it will create some dividends as we go into the next capital planning cycle.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Okay, sounds good. Thanks so much.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thanks, Joe.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Thanks, Joe.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Betsy.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Just a couple of follow-up questions on the NIM. I'm just looking for the average balance
that you have on your supplement, looking at things like commercial and industrial loans, which had the yield come
down pretty significantly. And I just wanted to understand how much of that was driven by just the repricing that you
have within the C&I loan growth because LIBOR came down. Or is that more net new borrowers coming on the
balance sheet and you being competitive on pricing?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, I think, Betsy, it wasn't any one specific category, but it's a combination of some
one-timers that we had in the second quarter versus the third quarter. It also included some repricing of the existing
book and then new loans, but it wasn't really any one specific item.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: When you think about the loan yield going forward, a lot of that book is priced off of floating
LIBOR, either one month, three month, or what have you. Is it pretty much repriced at this stage, or is there more to
do?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: There's generally a little bit of a lag. We've seen LIBOR start to pick up a little bit this
month, which should have a bit of a benefit. But there's about a one-month to two-month lag on average.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And when you think about the TruPS that you called in the quarter, in the third quarter, how
much of an impact is that going to have on NIM in fourth quarter?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Off the top of my head, I don't know. Let us get back to you on that, Betsy. I'd be guessing
right now, but we'll get back to you.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then lastly on incremental loans that you're interested in buying from folks that
are exiting portfolios, how much risk are you looking to take onto the balance sheet? Are you either going to be playing
in the higher investment grade type of securities or in loans, or are you willing to go into securities or loans that might
be a little bit more costly from a capital perspective?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think it's really going to be a function of one, what's available. And then two, even though
there's a lot of opportunity to buy securities and loans today, we've got to continue to be really measured and follow the
risk discipline that we've had for years. And so a long answer to your question, but the point is we're going to buy
across the spectrum as long as we're comfortable with the risk-adjusted returns. Sometimes, the pricing is attractive at
the high end and sometimes at the low end. There are a lot of securities and loans that are available today. And I think
this is really reflective of what is strong about Wells Fargo, and that is this is a time and a cycle that because we had a
risk discipline over the years in place, we've got the opportunity to be a buyer today.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Betsy, let me add to that. I appreciate the question because I think you know us well enough.
We don't feel any sense of urgency to have to do something that does not make sense here. We're looking for value.
And the ones we bought in this last group happen to be the higher end and the more investment grade, names that we
knew, many customers we already had something out here. But even though revenue was challenged this quarter, I feel
and our team feels no sense of improper urgency to do something that does not make sense for this company. We just
will not do that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Would you prioritize growing the Tier 1 ratio under Basel III or prioritizing earnings?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I don't know that. First of all, I would say that the number one priority is to develop more
long-term profitable customer relationships. That's what we get up in the morning to do. The result of that is we make
money. And when you make money, you grow your capital. Again, when John asked the question about the Tier 1
common Basel III, we're already at 7.4%. I don't know what the buffer will be. As I said before, the bid and ask is
between 1% and 2.5%. We are clearly on the low end if that makes it less risky. 7.4% is already 40 basis points over

the minimum. And then our capital generation, we're putting tons of capital on the balance sheet every quarter now. So
I think it starts with relationships. From that, over time you make money and then you build capital.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: And just to add to that, Betsy, I don't think it's an either/or for us right now. We can do both.
We can go out and we can buy assets that are for sale with good quality customers that we've appropriately
underwritten, and we can make money doing that and we can also grow capital. It's really not an either/or.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Hi. I guess as we think about mortgages in the fourth quarter, it would seem like gain on sale is
going to be very high, if not actually at record levels, the percentage gain on sale for each loan. Is there any way to
break apart how much is the expansion and gain on sale we've seen this cycle cell is cyclical because of low rates,
capacity constraints in the industry, et cetera, and how much of it you think is secular given a more consolidated
industry mainly of banks and hopefully more rational pricing?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Brian, I wish I was smart enough to know the answer to that question. I just don't. I think
what we're seeing is a very attractive mortgage market. We've worked long and hard to be the largest mortgage
originator in the country, and we're well positioned. We've got a great team. We're seeing a lot of good volume, as we
mentioned, going into the fourth quarter. But in terms of what percent of the margin is related to the industry and what
percent is related to capacity, I really don't know.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Brian, I would make this comment. Part of the reason that we're able to capture more share
today is related to the fact that we don't have a lot of problems in our existing portfolio. I mean 400 basis points less in
terms of delinquencies and foreclosures, that's a lot, especially when you service 9 million mortgages or so. That
becomes a big, big number. So we've continued to invest in systems, in people, in training, in compliance, and
outreach. And even during the big refi booms, we never lost our interest or hunger in serving the purchase money
markets. So what you're saying is right. They're good margins. We've got a great pipeline, and we're busy.
<Q - Brian Foran>: If I can ask a follow-up on the bad side of the mortgage business right now; on page 28, you show
$16.5 billion of FHA-insured guaranteed by the VA delinquent but still accruing loans. I guess just in the spirit of
things having put back some litigation risk, having expanded further than most of us thought this cycle, is there any
way contractually that those loans, any part of those loans could become the responsibility of Wells Fargo?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Brian, we have not seen any change in our relationship with the FHA/VA. When a loan goes
90 days delinquent, it's put back on the balance sheet. We work through it. That's what happened this quarter. It
happens every quarter. And then once we work through it, they honor their guarantee. We haven't seen any change in
that relationship at all.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Thank you.

<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Hi. I understand that you don't manage to the margin. But given how the interest rate
environment will be seemingly suboptimal for longer, and I understand that you have taken steps to redeploy some of
your liquidity already in the third quarter, what would you have to see to be a little bit more aggressive in moving down
your cash balances?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Erika, the first thing, the first call on liquidity, and I think Tim mentioned this, is to fund
loans. When you think about it, this quarter we had $13.5 billion of core loan growth. That's a great quarter of loan
growth. And that's because we're out serving customers. I'm not going to predict what's going to happen in the fourth
quarter, but our people are busy and we're serving retail households and the business households. And we're always
looking at the market and if we can get spreads that we think are appropriate, recognizing that we're at record low
levels. We're not any better at market timing, so we're careful and cautious as we do that. If you look at our cash
balances, they're pretty much on top of where they were a quarter ago even though we've made fair amount of what we
think are high quality shorter term investments along the way. Recognize one thing that we still don't know yet is the
LCR, the liquidity coverage ratio, that's important also. So we are in a very balanced way moving forward here.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Do you have a sense from your conversations with Washington that there is a chance that the
LCR in its final interpretation will likely get softened?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I'm not in the prediction business, especially when it comes to Washington, but I can tell you
this. Our team has been very active and responsive to the requests from Washington and other places to help them
understand our view and the calibration and what happened during previous times with previous companies and so
forth and what happened with deposit runoff and loan line takedowns during times of stress. So we think we have
something to offer there.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Okay, and just one last follow-up question. I just wanted to ask one of Betsy's questions
another way. I think a lot of investors were concerned about the C&I decline in terms of the yield, and I understand
there are a lot of puts and takes in this line item. But if you look at your pipeline of new originations, and you've told us
that loan growth prospects are quite strong, and you look at what's set to renew, I guess should we see or should we
expect a similar quarterly decline next quarter aside from the movements in LIBOR?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, I think we're too early in the quarter to be able to have any specific or give you a real
specific answer to that question because we're going to have loans that aren't even in the pipeline right now that are
going to close toward the end of the year. So I don't know the answer to your question. The point is I think from our
perspective is that loan growth is real strong right now.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And think of it this way, Erika. A lot of loan growth we had in the third quarter didn't come
until later in the quarter. We have some purchases that we've made that will close in the fourth quarter that have been
announced. And a lot of what's happened in mortgage has not yet come through, so think of it in those terms.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thanks, Erika.

Your next question from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne, Agee.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Todd.
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: Good morning, everybody. Tim and John, just going back to the capital question, I
understand that – Tim, you mentioned you have a very balanced, very measured approach in terms of your capital plan.
But the thing about the 2012 CCAR [Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review] program and the Fed process, it
appears that number one, the Fed is taking a more active role in terms of determining the various scenarios for the
program. And then two, it appears that the Fed is also taking a more conservative view as it relates to their concern
surrounding its systemic capital risk.

And as I look at your buyback, for example, and I listen to some of your competitors, how do you think about that 2012
program in terms of – you mentioned the uncertainty in terms of the operating environment. You talk about the TruPS
potential. But how do we think about Wells Fargo being more or less aggressive with the plan going into 2012 given
your capital generation and what appears to be a heightened concern on the part of the Fed with capital and buybacks?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Todd, let me just give you a sense before Tim talks about the numbers. The best thing we can
do, the most aggressive thing we can do is serve our customers really, really well and produce great results and have a
low risk profile for our company, and then have lots of capital generation internally. We do all those things well. We
can achieve the kinds of things our shareholders will want; i.e., returning capital to them as quickly as we can. And you
know one of my biases is dividends. I don't know; can you add something to that, Tim?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think, Todd, we haven't seen any major change in terms of our relationship with the Fed in
terms of how they're looking at this next CCAR process versus a year ago. And again, I would step back and put this
into perspective. Think about what our balance sheet, what our earnings, what our capital level was a year ago at this
time, and then compare them to where we are today. Losses are down. Non-performing is down. Credit has improved.
We're generating a lot more earnings, and we have more liquidity and we have more capital to start with. So we don't
go into this next CCAR process being pessimistic at all. We've got a great story to tell. We've got a great relationship.
We're going to make a proposal, and we're looking forward to working with the Fed.
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: That's actually very helpful. I appreciate that. If I could, John, just a follow-up or a
question just in terms of an update on the AG settlement with California in particular opting out, opting in; just your
latest thoughts in terms of the settlement process, how that may evolve as you currently see it.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Thank you. How you guys doing? Just to follow up on Brian's questions a little bit on the
mortgage banking side, the big announcement this quarter we all know is Bank of America getting out of the
correspondent business. And it sure looks like some of these bigger guys are pulling back capacity, especially in the
wholesale and correspondent business. Does that give an opportunity for Wells Fargo to expand capacity in that
business?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, I think it's fair to say that we have a lot of opportunity to grow capacity today across the
board, not just because of the correspondent business alone. But I think the key is to make sure you do it in a real
measured way because there are lots of correspondents who we'd like to do more business with and some we wouldn't.
But that's not the primary driver for why our refis are up. Our refis are up because we already have a great servicing
and customer base.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: In fact, Paul, that's one of the things that I think is missed a lot. We have a 25% or 26% share
of overall originations, but it's much higher on the refinance. Because of the fact that our people do a great job in
servicing, we get a disproportionate higher number of people refinancing with us because of our servicing.

<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay, and the other issue is what I hear back a lot from my contacts in the industry is that, and
you've seen some of the notes I've written where the government is being tougher and tougher accepting mortgages
now. Does that give an opportunity for you to start to find some niches on your balance sheet and put some decent
loans on your balance sheet that aren't necessarily Jumbos but just don't fit the Fannie and Freddie and FHA boxes?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We wouldn't put loans on our balance sheet just because the government didn't like them. We
put loans on our balance sheet that provide a good risk/return. But there's no question in this environment that there's
some good risk/return relative to other ways that we can deploy our liquidity, and mortgage is one of them.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: That's an opportunity, Paul, clearly.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay, and one last question. On the Jumbo market, you saw that the FHA – they're lowering the
Jumbo spreads a little bit. Are you seeing a pickup in any of that Jumbo product, or is it just...

<A - Jim Rowe>: Hey, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Hello?
<A - Jim Rowe>: Marty?
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Yes.
<A - Jim Rowe>: You're up, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay, yes. I have a question, actually two questions. One is the deployment of liquidity
into loans and securities. You put about $39 billion in securities and about – almost $10 billion into loans. What types
of assets are you looking, and what kind of yield characteristics and duration are you trying to peg as you're going
through that process?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: On the securities side, Marty, it's really across the board. We really look at the risk-adjusted
return based upon what's out there today. And so a portion went into short term, shorter term very high quality
investments, and then a portion went into medium term and some longer term durations. Obviously, there are more
assets out there to buy than there were a few months ago.
On the loan side, again, it's across the board. We feel really pleased that we're seeing loan growth in a number of our
businesses and not just one or two. And then as John mentioned, and we gave a couple examples, we're also able to buy
loans in the market today. So it's not one specific area, it's across the board, and I think that just reinforces the value of
the diversified model.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then when you're looking at revenue compression from last quarter to this quarter,
you really have it looks like almost three components. The market sensitive is really going down over $800 million.
You can take some of those pluses and minuses, and it looks like that probably netted out to about a $0.02 impact
negative from second to third quarter, and then you've got mortgage offsetting the decline in what you would see in net
interest income. The market sensitive revenues, how do you look at that? And do you think that some of the uncertainty
that we hit in this quarter you will begin to see some improvement, or did you see any improvement in that line as we
move through the quarter into the fourth quarter?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Marty, I think you're right. As we pointed out, there are some puts and takes in the market
sensitive revenue. So the $808 million is not what I would think about as a run rate basis, particularly compared to
second quarter. You also had an outsized gain in the second quarter that we called out, and we didn't have the third
quarter.
I don't know what is going to happen in the capital markets in the next few months. They feel like they have settled
down today. But you know what, you could have made that same statement in July and you could have made that same
statement in the middle of August. I think the important thing as it relates to the capital markets is make sure that you're
focused on serving your customers; make sure that you've got good risk discipline in place so that you're sitting on a
bunch of loans that you have to sell or other securities that you have to mark in a significant way. And again, we think
that we're pretty good at that. We've got a good team in place. We're being thoughtful about being focused on
customers. So we're not overly concerned about our capital markets activity at all.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And lastly, would you say that your guidance on expenses, saying that it's going to go up
in the fourth quarter, is primarily tied to the improvement that you see in your mortgage banking fee income?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: There is no question that we're going to have increases in expenses related to bringing on
team members to support underwriting and close the mortgage pipeline that we're seeing. That will be part of it. But
also, we're still in the midst of integration, as John mentioned. We hit a milestone this weekend. And so the timing of
those expenses happen when they happen, and our guess is there's going to be more of them in the fourth quarter than
there were in the third quarter. And then also there's generally some seasonality in all of our expense line items, so we'll
probably get a little bit of a pickup there as we saw in the fourth quarter last year. But again, just we want to be really
clear that we've made a lot of progress in terms of reducing our expenses this quarter. We continue to believe that we're
going to make a lot of progress and reiterate our goal of getting to an $11 billion run rate by the fourth quarter of next
year.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<A - Jim Rowe>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Good morning. I'm looking at your business optimization expenses down $363 million linked
quarter. So what is that since that fueled a lot of the expense improvement?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, so that would have included a number of different items. None of them were, candidly,
very significant, Mike. It's a bit here, a bit there, and it all totaled up to be the differential that's in the numbers.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So those are permanent savings?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: There's always some timing in expenses, but I guess the important thing is that we wanted to
call out the fact that we didn't believe that that $758 million reduction in expenses that we saw from the second quarter
to the third quarter was all permanent. We called out the $234 million of deferred comp differential. And we've
mentioned that integration costs were a little bit low. So I think that the permanent reduction is less than that. But again,
we think fourth quarter is going to be a little bit higher, but we'll get to the $11 billion number.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I guess we're dancing around the question. So do you think revenues will outpace expenses?
Linked quarter, it looks like it was a tie, revenues and expenses both down $800 million. So as we look out, which will
win, revenues or expenses?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think over the long term, revenues are going to beat expenses, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And by the end of next year, which is the end of your Compass initiative?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Revenues are going to beat expenses.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: In fact, Mike, that is how you run a successful company. And there is short term, we can't tell
from quarter to quarter and we wouldn't try to predict that. But when you do the right thing over a long period of time,
invest in your people, your distribution, your customers, serve them well, serve them broadly and deeply, revenue wins
in that race.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And so yes, the key milestone then for us looking at the company would be the end of
next year we should see revenues surpass expenses if you achieve your target, if I heard that correctly.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Correct.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then completely separate, you mentioned the foreclosure rate. You're doing
everything you can to keep homeowners in their houses, houses that are owned as second properties or speculators or
are empty. So my question is what percent of homes that you foreclose on are not the primary residence of an
individual that's living in the home?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I don't know that number. But I can tell you that when we get to a foreclosure, customers on
average are about 16 months past due. And of the primary residence, about 25% have already abandoned the property.
But I don't have the second home off the top of my head.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thanks, Mike.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.
<A - Jim Rowe>: Hey, Ed.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Hey, good morning, guys. I have a question on page 27 of the handout. It's the page where you
go through the PCI accretable yield.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: And you outlined that the expected cash flows went up this quarter by about $2.5 billion,
which drove the total accretable yield number up from $14.9 billion to $16.9 billion. And then if you boil it down, I
guess most of that came from the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. So I guess I'm looking for some insight on what drove your
expected cash flow on the Pick-a-Pay portfolio up that much during the quarter, and then if any meaningful amount of
the total accretable yield difference came from somewhere other than the Pick-a-Pay portfolio.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, it's a fair question. I think as you know, we look at this estimate every quarter. And
there are lots of different factors that drive their assumptions. There are interest rate assumptions. There are liquidation,
timing assumptions. There are modification assumptions and there are performance. And the performance in the
Pick-a-Pay portfolio continues to be very strong, so it wasn't any one of those in particular. It was the combination of
all of them. But again, we've had really good experience to date in terms of the performance of that Pick-a-Pay
portfolio. But that was the primary driver for the $2.5 billion increase.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Do you expect that number to keep going higher? And could you remind us when we look at
that $16.9 billion bounce how you think about the weighted average, or what is the weighted average duration of the
$16.9 billion?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: On page 28 and page 29, we show the weighted average life for commercial as well as
Pick-a-Pay. And I would say that the average is approximately 11 years or 10 to 11 years because the lion's share of

that yield is on the Pick-a-Pay side. So it's going to be around for a long period of time.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay. And no outlook in terms of where that $16.9 billion...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: In terms of the number, no, I'd be guessing if there was a more specific outlook. As I said, we
look at the assumptions and the flows each quarter and come up with what we think is a reasonable estimate, and that's
what we have here.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay, thanks, Tim. And then as a quick follow-up, just looking at your average balance sheet
and your mortgage backed securities yield, that was one of the asset yields that came down a lot during the quarter,
down I think by 62 basis points linked quarter. I think I understand that some of that decline was because of an increase
in the size of the MBS portfolio and the investment of some of the deposit inflows. But obviously, probably a good
chunk of it was from refinancing activity as well. So I guess any insight as to how much more pressure you expect on
that yield over the next quarter or two from refinancing pressure?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: There is no question that we had some is impact on refinancing, but I wouldn't say that's a
big driver. And we don't expect that to be a big driver going forward or at least more than what we saw this quarter.
The other reason that the yield went down is just in terms of some of the securities that we invested in this quarter.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: But generally, it seems likely that that number will continue to come down, but any sense of
how we should think about that from a pace standpoint in terms of that MBS average yield coming down?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, I really don't have one for you.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay, all right. Thanks, Tim.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yes, good morning. Bank of America recently announced a $5 fee. And by my
calculations, that would recoup most of the loss from Durbin. And if that's the industry standard or if that's what's up
with some of the major competitors out there, I guess why are you still more guarded and guiding that you can only
recover half, and any idea how long it would take to recover what was lost on the Durbin side?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Chris, the way we think about that is our focus is on building lifelong relationships with our
consumers. And we have, as you know, grown checking and savings account dollars by $185 billion in three years.
And they're responding to the value, the convenience, and the choice that we're giving our consumers. And there is real
value here. We have the most stores of any bank. We have 12,000 ATMs. We give free online and free bill pay and all
these sort of things. So when you talk about how we're going to get paid for that, we're testing things and we're going to
learn. Our customers help us understand how they want to pay for that value, that choice, and that convenience, and we
will learn from those tests. And then we'll do what we think will be appropriate so we continue to grow households.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then second question I have is more of a numbers question, referring to page 37
of the press release. And it's just that on a Basel I basis, your risk-weighted assets grew by about $8 billion. But on a
Basel III basis, they grew by about $60 billion, and I was wondering. Is that a new interpretation of the rules, or are
there different assets that you put on the balance sheet?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, it's an interpretation of the rules. In fairness, the rules aren't finalized yet. We're making
our best guess as to what they are, but that's the primary differential.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Can you flesh that out a little bit? Is it beginning to stabilize in your models, and can you
talk at all about what caused the difference there, that $60 billion?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I don't know if we'd say it's going to stabilize because it's going to be a function of how we're
going to grow the company. The easiest way to stabilize would be to shrink, and we don't want to do that.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: I meant under the rules, or what caused the delta here?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Chris, one thing is the OCI effects. Are you talking about – Basel I and Basel III, that's an
influence.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: I guess what I was...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Is that your question?
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: No, I guess my question was under Basel I, your risk-weighted assets went up by $8
billion. And under Basel III, I'm looking at the prior press release and this press release side by side, and your Basel III
risk-weighted assets went from $1.1213 billion to $1.272 billion, and that just seemed like a big increase.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Again, we had growth in the balance sheet this quarter. And then as we continue to refine our
interpretation of Basel III, we're going to make adjustments. But again, there wasn't anything significant, and we don't
break that out on asset class by asset class base.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay, all right. Thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: You bet.

Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush CFA>: Good morning, guys. How are you?
<A - Jim Rowe>: Hey, Nancy. Good morning.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush CFA>: A couple questions; there is a shorthand in the market right now with regard to bank
stocks, with the larger your securities portfolio, the more you're going to get hurt in the present rate environment. You
guys have always been very astute securities portfolio managers. Could you just address that?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I appreciate the compliment first, thank you. What we want to do, Nancy, is look at where we
see a good risk/return. As we've said for the last year as soon as rates started to really drop, it would be really easy for
us to grow revenue and to grow the net interest margin by just investing in long-dated securities, and then we'd be more
at risk for a backup when it comes, and someday it will come.
I think from our perspective, we want to look at good risk/return in terms of what's out there today. There's a lot out
there today in terms of securities that we can buy. But we also want to make sure that we're pretty balanced in terms of
short, medium, and long duration assets. We think we're fairly well positioned today because we have an unrecognized
gain on the balance sheet that's still pretty significant. I think it's still a little over $6 billion. So we think we're in pretty
good shape even if we saw a rate backup. But again, a rate backup, even if it might affect the unrecognized or
unrealized gain, it would be very beneficial for the rest of the company. And again, I think that is a testament to the
balanced model we have.
Nancy, I almost look at it – I agree with everything Tim said. And one of the things that is happening today, we're not
getting recognized or paid for the wonderful deposit franchise we have, and there is real value there. Rates won't stay
this low forever. They will back up, and you're going to see the real quality of the liability side. And in the interim,
things look different in the market today than they looked nine months ago. Some good and some of it's not good as far
as we've got QE2s and twists and this and that, and those things could have an influence on rates. But over time, rates
will rise, and I think we are uniquely well positioned for that time.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush CFA>: Okay, the second question is this. I think the CFPB [Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau] announced last week that one of their first forays would be an examination of the mortgage servicers to
basically make sure you are not doing bad things. And it just seems to me that it's getting a little crowded in the
mortgage servicing space right now. Could you guys just summarize for us the various regulatory issues or activities
that are swirling around your mortgage servicing portfolio right now, and any idea of how much this is costing you?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, you are correct, Nancy, that there's a lot of regulatory oversight in the mortgage
servicing business today, whether you are talking about the CFPB's upcoming activities or any of the other regulators.
We feel like we're implementing – we began to implement changes last year. We've continued to implement more
changes pursuant to the consent order, though the cost of those changes are included in all of our numbers right now.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Nancy, think of it this way. A lot has changed in the mortgage business really starting in 2008.
There is no – this low-doc and liar loans and stated income is all history. So if you look at the originations starting – it's
really the 2006 to 2008 vintages that we're working through. 2008 from then on, it's really a different ball game, first of
all.
Secondly, on the foreclosure side, as Tim mentioned, we have made changes. You're right. There are a lot of people
and regulators and so forth that are swirling around. But in our case, most of our production is done by our people on
the direct side. And we've been around this thing for a long time, and I'm confident that we've got the right people
leading that organization. And you never know where all these things turn out. But it's a very different environment
today vis-à-vis five or six years ago when even we didn't participate in some of the most egregious things. We held our
discipline really well during that time; not perfect but pretty darn well. I can't predict what's going to happen next, but
it's a very different business.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush CFA>: Just one final issue for you, John. As I'm sure you're very well aware, every day of
Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Montgomery Street and all the other Occupies that seem to be going on, you did a
good summary at the beginning of the call of the stuff that Wells Fargo does, I think, that perhaps is not recognized: the
charitable contributions, the level of employment, et cetera, et cetera. What do you and/or your banking industry peers
need to do to make it known that the banking industry is not some big evil behemoth out to crush the middle class?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: That is a good question. First of all, I understand some of the angst and the anger. This
downturn has been too long. Unemployment is too high, and people are hurting. We get that. We have 265,000 people,
of which most of them are in the U.S. We live and work in these communities. We're committed to lead more, hire
more, lend more, be part of the solution. And I don't think you do that through an advertising program. You do that
knee to knee, street corner by street corner, community by community, and that's what we're committed to do.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush CFA>: But no – you don't see anything coming out of the industry that's an answer to some
of the stuff being put out there by the administration and others at this point?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I think we're all in this thing together. And I think we're all trying to respond in the most
appropriate way of serving our communities, serving each other, helping to get the economy going. And again, I think
this is very much about getting it done as opposed to some program of some type.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush CFA>: Okay, thank you.

<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: Tim, I've got two reconciliation questions. Forget about the margin for a second. I'd
just like to look at net interest income dollars. Your average earning assets were $26 billion in the quarter. Your deposit
growth was slightly accretive to net interest income. And the accretable yield contribution wasn't materially different
than what it was in the second quarter. And yet, your net interest dollars were down about $140 million sequentially.
What drove the dollars being down?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: It was a function of one-timers that we had in the second quarter. It was a function of some
security and loan runoff, and it was a function of repricing. But it was all those together in terms of the decline.
<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: It seems like if 12 of the 17 basis points of margin compression was deposit related
but the deposit was actually accretive to net interest income dollars, it seems like a difference of five basis points of
compression would have been more than offset by almost $30 billion of average earning asset growth in the quarter? It
doesn't seem that like dollars – the dollars came down more than I would have anticipated given the growth on the
balance sheet.
The second thing on the reconciliation, when I look at the one line item on the income statement, the net gains from
trading activity, and you went through some of the numbers, that was a loss of $442 million. If I back out I think the
three items you mentioned, $234 million from deferred compensation investment income, the $106 million in the net
loss between the two legacy Wachovia positions, and $108 million in the weak market, if I net those out, that line item
would have been zero. In the past four or five quarters, it has been running at $500 million or so. What's the difference
– netting out those three items, what's the difference in that category this quarter versus what you've seen in the past
three or four quarters?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Are you talking about the debt or equity?
<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: This is net gains and losses from trading activities, which was a negative $442
million in the quarter. In the last four quarters, it has been roughly about $500 million positive.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, within that number would have been the outsized equity gains that we had in the second
quarter. That's primary driver in terms of the differential because remember, the equity gains that we had in second
quarter were about $725 million.
<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: That's a different line item. On your income statement, the net gain, equity
investment..
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I thought you were talking about the trading asset line.
<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: This is just page 19 of your release this morning. There are two different line items.
There are net gains on trading activity. There are also net gains on equity investments. I think the net gain on equity
investments includes that one-time gain last quarter. But if you look at the net gains on trading activities and I back out
those one-time items, if you will, that would have been zero versus, again, about a $500 million run rate the past four
quarters, and I don't think that includes the equity investment gains.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I thought you were talking about a different line item, sorry.
<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: Okay.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So if you look, you're talking about the $854 million, right, that differential, the $413 million
to the $441 million?
<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: Yes.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So you would have had the gross effect of one of the legacy Wachovia positions that we are
close to reaching a resolution on, so that was about $370 million – $380 million. And you would have had the $234
million in terms of the deferred comp, and the rest of it was just a function of what was going in the market, nothing
specific.
