This morning, we released strong third quarter results and are very pleased with the exceptional performance of our
fleet. As a result of our year-to-date earnings, we are increasing our 2011 adjusted diluted per share earnings guidance
range from between $1.35 and $1.40 to $1.40 and $1.45.
We committed to you after announcing our proposed merger with Progress Energy that we would continue to stay
focused on running the business, delivering results and executing on our long-term strategic initiatives. The ability to
increase our earnings outlook in a year that includes a pending merger transaction, a busy docket of regulatory
proceedings, continuing economic uncertainty and significant storm damage to our system is due primarily to our
employees who are single-mindedly focused on safety and excellence and execution. I thank them for their efforts.
Today, after Lynn reports on our quarterly earnings, I will provide updates on the key initiatives that are positioning the
company for the long term. These initiatives include: one, the status of our fleet modernization program; two, our Ohio
ESP stipulated settlement; three, the latest developments in our pending merger with Progress Energy; and finally, our
rate cases in the Carolinas.
But first, let me give a brief overview of our earnings and performance for the quarter. Turning to Slide 5, today we
reported third-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50 as compared to $0.51 in the prior year. Our
year-to-date results through the third quarter were flat to the prior year. However, when we take into account the
significant weather that favorably impacted our results last year, this performance is outstanding. At U.S. Franchised
Electric and Gas, our largest business segment, this strong operational performance in our generation investments
helped offset less favorable weather and higher planned O&M cost.
At International, we saw strong results from our Latin American operations, as well as increased earnings from our
stake in National Methanol Company. For the quarter, our nuclear fleet had a capacity factor of 99.27%. The fleet
dispatched more than 15 million megawatt hours, setting an all-time company record for best quarterly nuclear
generation performance. Additionally, our non-regulated Midwest gas fleet continues to generate at record levels.
Results at both Commercial Power and Duke Energy International, based upon their performance to date, are on track
to exceed the earnings contributions we originally projected for the year.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Lynn, who will provide more details on our quarterly results.
Lynn J. Good
Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 6, let me begin with a review of the adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business
segments for the quarter.
For U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, quarterly adjusted segment EBIT was relatively flat to the prior year. Weather,
while favorable to normal, was not as favorable as the prior year. To put this in context, last year the Carolinas recorded
the hottest third quarter since the company began keeping records in 1961.
Additionally, our operation and maintenance expense was higher than the prior year, reflecting our planned increase in
outage and maintenance spending. For 2011, we were targeting an O&M cost increase of 3% to 4% net of deferrals and
cost recovery riders. This target has been pressured by year-to-date storm restoration costs of approximately $75
million, most of which was incurred in the first half of the year. Excluding these significant storm costs, we are within
our expected O&M increase range for the year. We will continue to aggressively manage our costs.
Quarterly results were favorably impacted by the continued earnings contributions from our new generation
investments as well as the lack of the prior-year $44 million impairment charge related to Edwardsport which was
included in adjusted earnings.
In Commercial Power, the quarter's adjusted segment EBIT was lower than the prior year, primarily due to the
expected financial impacts of customer switching in Ohio. This was partially offset by increased coal and emission
allowance sales, higher base generation rates charged to existing ESP customers and favorable O&M. Through the third
quarter, gross customer switching is at approximately 68%, consistent with the first half of 2011. Switching for the year

is forecasted to negatively impact 2011 earnings by approximately $0.07 per share.
It is important to remember that under the terms of our stipulated ESP settlement, which is subject to PUCO approval,
beginning next year Duke Energy Ohio will no longer be subject to significant customer switching risk.
Consistent with the first half of 2011, our Midwest gas fleet continued its exceptional performance with generation
volumes at around 40% above last year's quarter. The fleet is on track to set an annual generation record for the third
straight year.
In total, Commercial Power is well above plan through the third quarter and is expected to significantly exceed its
annual segment EBIT target for 2011.
Before leaving Commercial Power, I want to highlight that during the quarter we recognized an impairment of excess
emission allowances. Due to the EPA's finalization of the Cross State Air Pollution Rule, in 2012, the company will no
longer need the SO2 emission allowances held for CAIR compliance. As a result, we recognized an approximately $79
million pre-tax charge for the quarter, which has been excluded from our adjusted results.
Turning now to Duke Energy International. This segment continued the strong performance it has shown all year.
Results were impacted by higher average volumes and prices at National Methanol, favorable hydrology in Central
America and favorable pricing and foreign exchange rates in Brazil. Additional financial drivers for the quarter
included increased interest expense due to higher average debt balances and a higher adjusted effective tax rate of 33%
compared to 31% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to expect a full-year effective tax rate of around 32% on an
adjusted basis.
Now let me briefly discuss the pre-tax impairment charge we recognized during the quarter on the Edwardsport IGCC
project. As you may recall, a few weeks ago, we updated our cost estimate to complete the project including start-up
testing. Total estimated costs, excluding financing charges, increased from $2.72 billion to $2.98 billion. We estimate
that total financing costs will now be approximately $300 million. This cost increased was primarily driven by
incremental material quantity and scope changes and unfavorable labor productivity. We currently have a proposal
pending with the Indiana Commission to cap our recoverable construction costs at $2.72 billion, excluding financing
costs. This cap, if approved, limits the construction costs that will be passed on to Indiana customers.
Because the new incremental project costs are estimated to exceed the proposed cost cap, recovery above $2.72 billion
is not considered probable. Therefore, we recognized an approximate $220 million impairment charge for the third
quarter. This charge has no impact on the company's current liquidity and is not expected to change the credit ratings or
outlook of either Duke Energy Corporation or Duke Energy Indiana. Please note that a discussion of our GAAP
reported results for the quarter is included in today's press release.
Turning to Slide 7, I'll spend a few minutes on economic conditions in our service territories and customer volume
trends in the regulated businesses. As we entered late summer, the overall U.S. economy faced a new set of challenges.
The European debt crisis and the S&P's downgrade of U.S. government credit ratings resulted in an increased
skepticism regarding the sustainability of the economic recovery.
Although we're seeing some expansion, the economy is growing at a slower pace than was originally expected earlier
this year. GDP estimates have been revised downward. Consumer confidence continues to remain low, and
manufacturing, while still growing, has slowed. Additionally, we continue to experience the effects of depressed
housing markets and high levels of unemployment, even though both have stabilized. As a result, we expect an
extended period of low growth and we remain cautious in our economic outlook.
For the quarter, our overall customer volumes were essentially flat to the prior year on a weather-normalized basis.
Volumes in our residential class have been volatile in 2010 and 2011. On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized
volumes are flat to slightly negative to the prior year.
We continue to add customers in both the Carolinas and the Midwest, but at a slower rate than before the recession. For
example, over the last 12 months, we have added an average of around 10,000 customers, as compared to the
approximate 60,000 customers we added in 2007.

In the commercial class, we saw a modest increase in quarterly usage for the first time in a year. Even though this
development is promising, it is too early to assume this is a continuing trend. Volatile retail sales and historically high
office vacancy rates continue to affect the commercial customer class.
Finally, turning to our industrial customer class, volumes have rebounded slightly from the flat growth we saw last
quarter. Industrial activity in both the Carolinas and Midwest has been supported by strength in the automotive and
primary metals sectors and continued improvement in the chemicals sector. However, in the Carolinas, we have begun
to see a slowing in the textile industry as capacity levels have decreased slightly. In general, industrial growth is
somewhat stronger in the Carolinas than in the Midwest, but both regions continue to be adversely impacted by soft
market conditions in industries that support the housing and construction markets. Overall, our industrial volumes are
currently at about 90% of pre-recession levels.
The outlook for manufacturing activity across our service territories remains steady. Our customers, however, are
generally less optimistic about the remainder of this year and early 2012 than they were several months ago. Based on
where we are after the first three quarters of the year, we expect weather-normalized volumes for the full year to be
relatively flat, falling short of our original target of a 1% increase.
In summary, we had another strong quarter. With excellent operational performance, beneficial weather and the
strength of our commercial and international businesses, we have increased our adjusted diluted earnings per share
guidance for the year. Additionally, we are well positioned to achieve our targeted 4% to 6% long-term growth in
adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Now, I'll turn it back over to Jim.
James E. Rogers
Thank you, Lynn. We often discuss the challenges our industry is facing and how we are positioning our company for
the long term. Cost to replace and modernize our aging infrastructure and to comply with more stringent environmental
regulations mean our customers will face increasingly higher energy prices now and in the future.
In response to these industry-wide challenges, we are focused on several strategic initiatives, our fleet modernization
program, our Ohio ESP, rate cases in the Carolinas and our pending merger with Progress Energy. Taken together,
these initiatives will help us continue to deliver affordable, reliable and cleaner energy to our customers, while helping
us earn reasonable and fair financial returns.
We'll begin with a discussion of our fleet modernization program. Slide 9 outlines the status of our major construction
projects. When completed, they will introduce approximately 2,700 megawatts of new generation into our system at a
total investment of roughly $7 billion. These new modern facilities will allow us to retire older, less efficient coal
plants which cannot be cost effectively retrofitted with emissions controls.
First of all, let me bring you up to date on the Edwardsport IGCC project, which is nearly complete at about 96%.
Extensive start-up testing is underway. All of the mechanical and electrical systems will be turned over to the start-up
crews later this year. We continue to remain on track for an in-service date in the fall of next year. The plant, which
will use Indiana coal, will provide cleaner, more efficient energy to our customers in the state. Due to its efficiency and
low cost of energy, Edwardsport will be the first plant to be dispatched on our Indiana system and remains the best
solution for our customers' needs, helping to ensure the energy future of this region.
As a reminder, the Indiana Commission separated the Edwardsport cost increase proceedings into two phases. In the
first phase, we are seeking approval to recover the estimated cost of the project up to $2.72 billion. This is the cost cap
on our project. At the hearing, which is still underway, our case is supported by independent auditor testimony
demonstrating the cost of the Edwardsport plant were both reasonable and necessary and that we prudently managed
the project.

Phase two hearings will begin subsequent to the completion of the phase one hearings. That phase of the proceeding
involves allegation by interveners who have the burden of proof to show fraud, gross mismanagement or concealment
related to the project. Most interveners contend that Duke should recover only the project's original cost estimate of
approximately $2 billion including financing cost. Our testimony in phase two presented in early September
demonstrates that the interveners' allegations are unfounded. We expect a Commission decision on both phases by early
2012.
Looking now at our other three projects. The new 620-megawatt combined cycle Buck plant is about 96% complete
and expected to be in-service later this year. Cliffside and Dan River are both on track to be in service in 2012. These
projects allow us to begin retiring existing generation. For example, Buck's old coal units 3 and 4 were retired earlier
this year and units 5 and 6 are expected to be retired by 2015 for a total of 369 megawatts. Also, units 1 through 4 at
Cliffside, comprising 198 megawatts, were officially retired on October 1. When our modernization program is
complete, nearly 100% of our coal generation capacity will have scrubbers in operation. This positions us well as the
EPA continues to finalize more stringent environmental regulations.
Just a few months ago, CSAPR was finalized. Recently, the EPA has proposed to amend the CSAPR penalty
provisions, increasing the transition time and decreasing the excess emission penalties into January of 2014 instead of
2012. We are well along with our strategy to achieve the new compliance limits by January 1.
Also, the EPA is expected to sign the Utility MACT rule in mid-December. At this time, our current plans for
compliance assume we have already retired or will retire almost 3,800 megawatts of coal generation or about 20% of
our existing coal fleets system-wide by 2015.
Finally, I'd like to highlight over the past few months Duke Energy Renewables has announced nearly 800 megawatts
of new wind projects. Consistent with our strategy, each of these projects is backed by long-term power purchase
agreements. Our total wind capacity, once these wind farms are operational in 2012, will be nearly 1,800 megawatts,
enough to power more than a 0.5 million homes.
Turning your attention to Slide 10, let me update you on our pending ESP filing in Ohio. Our current ESP expires at the
end of this year and, over the past 12 months, we have explored various options to replace it. We have sought a solution
that balances the needs of our customers, our investors and the company, while at the same time recognizing the state's
preference for competitive electric markets, market base rates and customer choice. Throughout the negotiations to
seek agreement on a new ESP, our objectives have remained constant: we have sought to obtain longer-term clarity and
predictability of price-setting mechanisms; secondly, to support the evolving competitive market in Ohio; thirdly, to
gain financial stability and strategic flexibility to help mitigate the margin losses for Duke Energy Ohio; and finally,
earn fair returns on our investments over the long term.
Early last week, we entered into a stipulated settlement with nearly all intervening parties, including the Commission
staff, various industrial groups, wholesale and retail suppliers and the Consumers' Counsel. This slide summarizes the
key provisions of the stipulation, which is still subject to approval by the Ohio Commission. The term of the ESP is a
little more than three years, beginning in January of 2012 and extending until May of 2015. Upon implementation of
the ESP, Duke Energy Ohio would immediately move to pricing based on competitive markets.
Additionally, the stipulation provides for a total non-bypassable stability charge of $330 million, which would be
collected from all customers over the three-year period from 2012 to 2014. Under the terms of the agreement, Duke
Energy Ohio would transfer its coal-based generation to a separate generation company outside of the utility on or
before December 31, 2014. This will provide future strategic flexibility for these assets.
The parties to the stipulation have recommended that the Commission approve the settlement by November 15. So
auctions can be conducted to serve our customers effective January the 1. I am sure many of you are wondering how
this stipulation will impact our earnings for Commercial Power in 2012 and forward. The stipulation, if approved,
provides financial results within the range of our planning assumptions through 2014. After consideration of a number
of earnings drivers, including merger benefits, constructive rate case outcomes and effective cost control, among
others, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth target.

Next, let's take a look at Slide 11, which contains an updated scorecard on our pending merger with Progress Energy.
As the Progress Energy management team provided an update on the merger status during their earnings call earlier
today, I will not repeat all the details. However, let me spend a few minutes on the mitigation plan we filed with FERC
in response to their horizontal market power concerns.
That plan, which was filed on October the 17, includes a virtual divestiture. This involves offering a certain amount of
energy into the wholesale markets during the summer and winter months for eight years. We have asked FERC to rule
on our mitigation proposal by December 15. In my judgment, these mitigation measures address FERC's concerns
about market power in the Carolinas, allowing us to maintain the important customer benefits of this transaction.
Also earlier this week, we filed a request for rehearing with FERC related to their conditional order. This filing was
made in order to preserve our rights. If FERC accepts our proposed mitigation plan by December 15, we agree to
withdraw this request.
We continue to move forward with merger integration planning as we work toward a potential closing by year-end.
However, the ultimate closing date of the merger will be dependent upon the timing of various regulatory approvals
including FERC, the North Carolina Utilities Commission and the South Carolina Public Service Commission.
The merger transaction with Progress Energy gives us the ability to more effectively manage the transformation
occurring in our industry, resulting in benefits for all our stakeholders, our customers, our investors and the
communities that we serve. Later, regulatory and earnings diversity will also reduce our risk profile, supporting the
strength of our balance sheet and the dividend.
Let me quickly update you on a couple topics that we haven't yet covered in today's call. First, the rate cases in the
Carolinas. As you all will recall, in July, we filed a base rate increase with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.
We requested approval of a $646 million or a 15% increase in customer rates effective in February 2012, based upon
11.5% ROE and a 53% equity component of the cap structure.
Earlier this week, the public staff in North Carolina filed testimony on our proposed rate increase. This testimony
recommended an overall rate increase of approximately $211 million, reflecting a number of adjustments to cost of
service, an ROE of 9.25% and a 50% equity component of the cap structure.
In August, we filed a similar base rate case in South Carolina. We requested we increased electric rates by
approximately $216 million or 15%, with the revised rates in effect in February. This request was also based upon
11.5% ROE and 53% equity component of the cap structure.
We recognize that rate increases are challenging in these tough economic times. However, it is very important to
remember that these increases are principally the result of investments we have made to modernize our infrastructure
and implement federal environmental mandates.
Hearings are scheduled to begin November 28 in North Carolina and December 7 in South Carolina. We will continue
to explore opportunities for settlements in the weeks ahead.
In closing, I am very pleased with our performance year-to-date. Despite numerous challenges, we have delivered on
our operational and financial objectives. Also, I am proud to report that we were recently recognized for our
commitment to sustainable business practices. For a second year in a row, Duke was included in the prestigious Dow
Jones Sustainability World Index. We were one of only two utilities in the U.S. and among 13 utilities worldwide to
receive this honor.
As we look to the fourth quarter and into 2012, we will remain focused on operational excellence, constructive
regulatory outcomes, successfully closing the merger with Progress and aggressive cost control.
Before we take your questions, let me highlight one important consideration. With regard to the ongoing hearings on
the Edwardsport IGCC project, the Indiana Commission has ordered that witnesses in the case, including myself, may
not be debriefed of what has occurred in the hearing. Therefore, we ask that any questions related to Edwardsport
IGCC project be limited to the status of the project.

And now, let me take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll now take our first question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Morning, guys.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Morning, Dan.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, Jim, the demand recovery situation is kind of been disappointing across the country, but
you guys have been struggling maybe a little more than others it seems on a weather-adjusted basis. As you look out on
the next year or two years, three years, are you guys seeing signs that this could start to come back? And when you
look at the regions between the Carolinas and the Midwest, are you seeing different trends that might give you more
confidence or pessimism from here?
<A - James E. Rogers>: I think our current view is that the recovery is very anemic and that with unemployment
9.2%, the rebound in the demand for electricity is going to be slow. Historically, the rebound in electricity from a deep
recession like we have is an early indicator that the economy is recovering and in my judgment, we don't see the
rebound yet and that is not good news with respect to the economy, at least through this year and through 2012.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And, Jim, when I take that to the next step, as you think about trying to earn your allowed
returns and, obviously, you've got a lot of rate cases going on, but what kind of cost management do you guys see
forward that can help offset the lack of top-line growth to kind of support your long-term EPS growth strategy?
<A - James E. Rogers>: Dan, that's a really good point and, obviously, we went through a number of years where we
were able to keep our O&M flat in the early days, the early years of the recession. But as we move forward and we
close the deal with Duke, that's really going to allow us to really reduce further our cost and allow us to maintain strong
ROEs on our business.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And, Jim, when you think about the rate base growth that you guys have and the rate increases
you're asking for, without the volume growth, the customer impact appears to be more significant. Are there mitigation
opportunities you guys see out there? And what sort of conversations are you having with the Commission during these
rate cases and kind of talking about the net bill impact to customers?
<A - James E. Rogers>: Sure. That also is an important point. As you know, over the last several years, we've worked
hard in every state that we operate in to put in place the right incentives for us to invest in energy efficiency and to put
control of the use of electricity in the hands of our customers. We have foreseen for some time as we modernize our
fleet and our grid that the price of our product is going to go up. And that's why we acted early to be able to help
consumers control the bill. And as our price goes up, if they can control the volume, that will help mitigate these
increased prices. And clearly, everyone today understands, probably more than they did when we first introduced our
energy efficiency measures, the importance of having those in place in giving control to our consumers during this
rising price environment.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Turning to the Carolinas just real quick, with the last two plants kind of coming into service
next year, how much more of a rate increase do you guys anticipate requesting after this rate case gets done?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Dan, we do need an additional case to pick up in-service of these plants. We have not estimated
an increase at this point. I think it'll be dependent upon the success of this case as well as what we see in terms of our
cost structure for next year, so more to come on that.

<A - James E. Rogers>: Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from Jim von Riesemann with UBS.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Hi, Jim. Hi, Lynn.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Question for you, just following up on Dan's. Would you – you mentioned on your
prepared remarks, Jim, that you saw 4% to 6% earnings growth and that now seems to add an upper end to that range.
Would you mind taking a moment to bucket the major categories of that growth? So saying that differently, how much
is from merger savings, how much of it's from new plant reducing regulatory lag? And then the follow-up to that is can
you refresh my memory as to how much of your O&M is clause versus discretionary?
<A - James E. Rogers>: Sure. That's a great set of questions and let me, with that, turn it over to Lynn.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jim, I think those are good questions and we'll, of course, give you better feel for what '12 looks
like as we come to the Street after the merger closes with expectations for '12. But what I would think about in terms of
the 4% to 6% is, as you think about the new company being largely a regulated company, it's going to be dependent on
rate base growth, it's going to be dependent on outcomes, regulatory outcomes, the ones that we are in the process of, as
well as ones in the future, merger benefits, ongoing cost control. We do expect that we will have some load growth,
although as we've been talking about perhaps not as strong as we might have thought even a year ago. So I think it's
going to be a collection of all of those things. And we can talk further about that as we give more specific guidance for
2012.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Super. Just then a separate question on the merger. Why do you think the FERC took a
different tack this time in terms of the market power issues?
<A - James E. Rogers>: It's my understanding that the FERC has been in the process of reviewing its whole criteria
for approving mergers. And it appears to me that, in this case, because you're combining and creating the largest
company in the industry, that they made the decision to go on and apply some of their new criteria to this case. So I
think that's what it is. I think it's part of a – we're in the middle of a period where they're reviewing their historic
criteria, and I don't think it's any more than that.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Okay. And then the final question is is on dividend policy. With this seemingly higher
EPS outlook, how are you thinking about the dividend going forward?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jim, that's something that we continue to evaluate and we'll do so. We're committed to the
dividend, committed to growing the dividend. We moved the growth rate to roughly 2% at the time we saw a sluggish
economy. I think that's a good planning assumption. But we will continue to evaluate growth as we move into the new
company.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Great. Thanks. Look forward to seeing you in the EEI.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks so much, Jim.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Thank you.

And we'll now go to Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Hello.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Greg.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Good morning. So when looking at your generation assets in Ohio, is it fair to say that based on
the current level of revenues they're generating, that they basically make no money?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Greg, that's a good question. I think the coal assets are challenged in this environment with low
power prices. I think our team in Ohio has done an extraordinary job of optimizing around those assets and delivering
returns that are consistent with what you would expect elsewhere. They've also been very aggressive on O&M and will
continue to be. One of the things we like about the settlement agreement is with the stability charge, it does provide a
bit of strength to the earnings of the next three years.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Would you characterize the capacity or would you characterize the revenue stream that
you're asking for being at a level that would allow you to earn a return sort of commensurate with what you would
expect from a regulated asset? Or is the math different?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jim, do you want to take that?
<A - James E. Rogers>: Yeah, I think the – I mean the math's different. I think the actual ROE is lower than what
you'd expect from a regulated business. I mean that's the reality of the settlement. But the good news with the
settlement is that we have all the key parties on board and that increases the probability that it will be approved by the
Commission.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. And then in '15, obviously, we transition to a fully deregulated model where your revenue
streams will be driven by capacity and power market pricing?
<A - James E. Rogers>: That's right. And I think that's a good thing because if you look at the forward curve, you start
to see the prices rise more in the '16, '17 timeframe, but as you can imagine in PJM, and I'm sure you heard from others
who have a much larger position in PJM, with the retirement of a lot of the old coal plants that will happen by 2015,
and with the new regulations on emissions, I believe there'll be upward pressure on the prices and the forward curve
will, in all likelihood, move up even more.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. So if I were to summarize in non-financial terms, assuming this settlement's approved, it
makes the assets financially viable in the transition.
<A - James E. Rogers>: I think that's true, but I think...
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Because now the returns are unsustainably low, right?
<A - James E. Rogers>: Oh, absolutely. And here's the most important point about this settlement. It gives us
flexibility with what we want to do with these assets. And remember, after the close of the merger, that they represent
less than 5% of our total earnings and so that kind of puts it in perspective.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Got you. Thank you.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks, Greg.

<A - Lynn J. Good>: Morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Just not to belabor that topic but, Jim, I think in your prepared remarks, you said that
sort of the earnings implications of the ESP settlement as filed, when coupled with everything else including the merger
benefits, et cetera, would be consistent with your growth rate forecast. But should we think of the net of all of that
within the Commercial Power segment as a up EBIT year in '12 or a down EBIT year in '12? Can you at least give us
some directional view on how this all translates into top-line numbers?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jonathan, we're not going to give specific guidance today on Commercial Power as a segment. I
think you have some elements to it that you can consider generation margins: the stability charge, O&M, depreciation,
the results of the Midwest gas assets. All of those are drivers for Commercial Power. We'll give you some more
specifics on that as we come to the Street in '12, but we thought it would be helpful that within the context of those
results, as well as the other things that we see, that hopefully we are positioned within our growth rate.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And then on a separate topic, the benefit at National Methanol surprised us. It
seemed to kind of come in higher than your sensitivities to WTI would suggest just in the quarter. Is there a sort of
Brent spread factor there, that that's more the relevant oil price?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: It is a good point, Jonathan. We're seeing a bit more correlation to that. We also saw higher
methanol prices, so a couple of sensitivities there.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Thank you.

And we'll now take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Just to clarify some of the questions previously. The 4% to 6% growth rate, if I recall, that
was not off of 2011. Was it off of 2010?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Off of '11.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: When you kind of based that growth rate?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Steve, we set it off of 2011 to be the basis for the post-merger, the combined new company. So
you can think about 2011 and I would think about it in a weather-adjusted way, as we typically do to start the
foundation for driving earnings [ph] across (0:45:02).
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. In that context, what is the weather benefit this year so far, versus normal?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: It's on Slide 18. It's easy to see, weather normal. So we've had $0.06 to $0.07 in 2011.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. So you're still kind of on the same base roughly that you were. And my
recollection...
<A - Lynn J. Good>: [indiscernible] (0:45:24)
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah. My recollection, when you've talked about the 4% to 6%, I think you typically
mention there's some lumpiness to that, the 4% to 6% growth, by year. Is that – and I remember if you go back to your
S-4 documents, things like that on the merger, there certainly was some lumpiness?

<A - Lynn J. Good>: I think there will always be lumpiness on a long-term basis because of regulatory outcomes, et
cetera. And so I think we'll be able to give you a better sense of how it will look when we give guidance on '12. But I
think some lumpiness is just consistent with the nature of this industry.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - James E. Rogers>: But, Steve, on a historic basis, our 4% to 6% on a standalone basis it's really off of '09, just
the level [ph] sum (0:46:19) of it.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Right. Right. Okay. And then just the last question, again, on International. All the drivers
of upside this year versus your expectation, how many of those are things like weather or things that might be more
temporary versus ongoing benefits that are exceeding plan? Can you give us some sense of that?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Sure. Steve, I think the International business has a nice diverse mix of geographies. We have
seen some benefit of hydrology in Central America, but you can expect hydrology to benefit some region almost every
year. We have core fundamental improvement in Brazil with prices rising. We'll also see a modest amount of new
resources coming in in future years, as we're building a small hydro in Brazil and other assets. And then, of course, you
can expect to see some volatility around oil and FX, which should be somewhat visible to you based on what you see in
the market.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.

And for our next question, we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. A real quick question on Indiana. Looking at I think it was Slide 15, the dockets
not necessarily for IGCC 4 but for the other three ones, 5, 6 and 7, they all imply that this all gets wound down, and
you get all of your rate increases for multiple IGCC Edwardsport dockets early next year. Just curious, what are your
level of concern of that being pushed out somewhat into later in 2012? And then can you walk us through when you
would kind of go in for follow-on increases, IGCC 8 and beyond?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Michael, I'll take the cost riders. We have been filing those biannually from the beginning of the
project and we'll continue to do that, so they get filed every six months. What you see on Slide 15 is the schedule for
hearing. So we'll have an opportunity to present those hearings or those cases, and the Commission will rule in
accordance with their own timeframe. I think our expectation would be 2012, but I think we'll await the actual timing
as we see how this progresses. And I think IGCC 8, for example, would be filed in November or December of this year.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. When would you go in for your final rate increase related to Edwardsport?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We would typically go through a conversion of this plant at in-service in Indiana through a rider
mechanism. The mechanism we have in place would have an ability to convert at that time. And then we would
evaluate the need for a general rate increase based upon other costs in the business, other maintenance spending, et
cetera. So that's something that's still under evaluation.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And how should we think about the math? I'm just kind of thinking about the math
in Ohio as part of the settlement. I think your current residential rate was around $90 or so a megawatt hour, kind of
directional. If I just look at forward power prices for 2012 and known capacity prices, plus the $5 or so stability charge,
that's a pretty decent drop off in Ohio. How do you make up for that?

<A - Lynn J. Good>: Michael, I think you've got some of the pieces: margin, stability. You need to consider O&M,
how we're managing the plants. You need to consider any optimization activity we may have around all our emission
allowances. You also need to evaluate the Midwest gas assets, which have been a strong contributor. So I think it's all
of those pieces together.

And we'll now take our last question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Morning, Paul.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: With respect to the FERC filing, I know that lawyers often are protective in that, if somewhat
defensive. But I'm just wondering, since this new market power criteria conditions were put on the merger, how do you
feel about the outlook for the merger being completed I guess? I mean do you feel any less confident about it? Or how
would you describe it? How would you characterize it?
<A - James E. Rogers>: Paul, I still am highly confident that we will successfully complete this merger. The
Commission gave us three alternatives when they conditioned the approval. And we picked the virtual divestiture and
we submitted it to them. And we think, in all likelihood, they will approve that. Now we filed and – because I want to
clear up what has been a misunderstanding with a number of people. We filed on October the 31 a request for a
rehearing of the conditional merger order. And that was a very aggressive filing, but it was something that we had to do
because to preserve our rights under the 30-day rule that required filing at that time.
So I think the important point is think about that filing as protecting our rights, but the outcome of this case is really
going to be driven by our proposed mitigation proposal. And I believe that the Commission will review it and we've
asked them to rule on this by December the 15 and that's important because both North Carolina and South Carolina
Commissions will only give us final approval once they've got a final order from the FERC. And that's with respect to
the merger as well as the joint dispatch agreement.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great. And then just finally on Edwardsport, you're not expecting to see – I mean this
latest revision is probably the last revision we're going to see? Is that a good way to think about it? In terms of cost?
<A - James E. Rogers>: Yes. That's a very good way to think about it.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.
