MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Williams Companies First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference
Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John D. Porter
Thank you, Karina. Good morning and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams. As you know,
yesterday afternoon we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com.
These items include the press release of our results, with related schedules and our analyst package, the presentation on
our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong and
an update to our quarterly data book, which contains detailed information regarding various aspects of the business.
This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments, and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is
here from our Midstream business, and Randy Barnard is here from our Gas Pipeline business. Additionally, our CFO,
Don Chappel is also available to respond to any questions.
In the yesterday's presentation, and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to
forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it.
Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to
generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation
materials.

So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thank you, John. And good morning to everybody, thanks for joining us. I know it's a busy day for earnings
releases. Certainly, you've all seen the strong financial results for the quarter. So this morning, I hope to provide you
some color around the business fundamentals and continue to provide great transparency around the projects and the
business growth that supports our confidence in a sustainable high-growth dividend for WMB.
First of all, our quarter came out to about 8% above consensus, due to, I believe, a combination of mild weather and
continued growth in revenues from our recent capital investments that continue to ramp up. And then, as well, the high
ethylene margins in the first quarter, as well, I think were higher than most people expected.
So, let me hit on just a few of these things, real quickly. First of all, the mild weather, how that impacted us, drove
lower natural gas prices, which, of course, improved our NGL margins, despite some lower NGL prices. The very low
natural gas prices actually helped prop-up our keep-whole margins.
Secondly, and probably less obvious, is the fact that we had great operating performance during the quarter, because
normally in the first quarter, we have a lot of freeze-offs of production from our producers and so forth. So in this
period, we did not experience very much of that at all, so we enjoyed the mild weather in those two ways.
Secondly, as I mentioned, the projects that we continue to bring online, continue to grow our fee-based revenues and
actually in midstream, the fee-based revenues were up 19%. And really, this was due to a combination of issues. First
of all, as I mentioned, projects that we've been investing in over the last couple of years continuing to ramp-up, namely
the Perdido Norte volumes continue to come up. The Echo Springs, fourth train at Echo Springs continue to enjoy more
and more volumes from the Piceance. And the Northeast Pennsylvania assets were up, and certainly the volume there
grew actually by a little over 160%.
As well, at our Markham – our new expansion at Markham that also experienced new fee-based volumes from the
Eagle Ford as well. So really, across the board, a lot of the investments we've been making for the last several years
really starting to pan out, in terms of driving our fee-based revenues, particularly within midstream.
These two factors also drove strong operating statistics, the mild weather and the new projects online. Our NGL
production was actually up 18%. Our gathering volumes were up 19%. Of course, most of our capital expansion in our
processing business has been fee-based, so our equity gallons were only up 7%, and I think probably the main driver
for that is the fact that our – again, as I mentioned, our plants were up and running more during the first quarter than we
saw in the first quarter of 2011.
Certainly, the higher ethylene prices were driven by the lower ethane prices during the quarter. And we continue to see
strong demand for ethylene in that area. Particularly there was a lot of outages, and it drove the ethylene demand even
higher in the area, so pretty excited about the way that business is helping support our overall combined MD revenue.
And then certainly, our gas pipe growth continues on a steady pace as well, and we actually saw 6% growth in our
fee-based revenues in our gas pipes areas, as well. And so, while we're certainly excited to see this continued strong
growth in our fee-based revenues, we are not surprised, because our project development and project execution
continues to be the underpinning for our confidence in dividend growth of 20% in 2013, and 2014, on the back of the
WPZ distribution growth of 10% and, of course, continued growth in our MC&O area, as well, even though we are
putting a very high coverage ratio, as we explained to you on that. Certainly, the risk reducing investment we intend to
make in our ethylene cracking capacity continues to support that dividend growth as well.
Looking ahead, and even beyond the guidance period, you can see many of our larger projects don't even start up until
2014. And many of these investments are just reaching stride in 2015, like the recent Caiman acquisition, our Canada
expansion that's continuing, and certainly Northeast Pennsylvania, with acquisitions like Laser really continuing to
grow very steadily beyond the guidance period.

And as we mentioned several times before, we continue to be very encouraged by the amount of demand for services
on Transco, as the market continues to look to take advantage of low-priced natural gas. So the opportunities really do
just keep coming at us, and we're fortunate to have a great operating and project management talent onboard. And we
certainly are mobilizing a lot of that talent from all over our system right now, to help deliver these great opportunities
safely, on time and on budget. And we're proud of the track record, we continue to build in that regard.
So taking full advantage of North America's abundant natural gas and gas liquids resources is certainly going to take a
tremendous amount of infrastructure, as demand for these great resources grows, and continue to drive volumes on our
infrastructure. And we certainly think Williams is best – is the best-positioned company to deliver the critical
infrastructure required to take advantage of these great resources.
And I'll also remind you, our Analyst Day webcast is May 22, and we look forward to being able to describe in some
more detail, all of the great projects that continue to drive our confidence and our growth.
And with that, I'll turn it over for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Nice quarter. Alan, I think when we last spoke in March, I
guess, with the Caiman acquisition, there was hopes maybe that by this time, we might have a little bit more color on
the follow-on Utica joint venture? Is there anything additional you can share at this point?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, we still are under a confidentiality agreement there, and so, not ready to be able to
disclose that in full detail. We're certainly expecting, for our May 22 Analyst Day, to lay that out in some more detail.
So that would be our hope at this point. Really don't see any reason that won't occur at this point. It's just a matter of
finalizing some things, and dotting the i's, and crossing the t's on that.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay. I appreciate that. And just a lot of different projects kind of moving on – moving around.
One of the latest is the Atlantic Access Project, of course, kind of getting reengineered, as I understand it, with respect
to kind of what your customers came back to you on. It looks like a lot more paths are being, I guess, viewed –
accessed, but I wasn't sure, with the Southern Pennsylvania sort of a new pipeline, it looked like it was being
downsized. And I guess at the end, I'm trying to kind of figure out, is this a proposal that, from a capital dollar
standpoint, from an investment standpoint, is this something that has – is it getting larger, is it getting smaller? And just
trying to better understand the moving parts.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. I'll take that and Frank Ferazzi is on the line, and if there's any detail required at the
end of that, Frank, you can do so. I would just say that probably one the biggest changes about the project is the fact
that, by doing some of it along the Leidy Line, it allows us to do it in a scalable fashion and so growing into the
increments that the market is requiring. And so that's probably one of the big changes. In terms of the southernmost
route, it is really a matter of delaying that, but certainly, what we're trying to do here is add flexibility.
Having said all that, right now the project, as laid out, is larger both in terms of capital dollars and volumes than we
originally expected. And primarily that is driven by demand along the Leidy route that came in as a result of the open
season. As you will recall, we opened that leg up to the northwest – that leg up to Butler, to the northwest, and saw
some very strong demand on that leg. So we had to decide how we could best serve that load in northwest PA, and
particularly volumes coming down from northern PA as well.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great, that's perfect color. And then just one final question, if I could. And this actually kind of
goes to the equity volumes, if you will, at midstream [ph] PC (11:31). Notwithstanding, sort of, first quarter being over
first quarter of last year, well freeze-offs and the like, we were down slightly from the fourth quarter. Between the

fourth quarter and the first quarter, is this sort of your kind of expected run rate for the equity volumes, as pretty much
everything else kind of comes in on a fee basis?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: This is Rory Miller. I'll take that question. I think the levels that we're at now are pretty
indicative of where we're going to be as we contract for new business, most of it's going to be fee-based, consistent
with our strategy, and frankly consistent with what most of the producers want. They need to see those margins back at
the well head in order to keep their drilling rigs moving in the richer areas. So I think we'll be able to maintain that for
the foreseeable future. At some point, it probably starts to fall off, but I think that 300 million gallon per quarter range
is a pretty good spot to be thinking about our equity volumes.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great, guys. Thank you.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Carl.
Operator
And next we'll go to Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Hey. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: You, in the Marcellus talked about gathering, getting up to gathering about 5 Bcf a day by
2015, how much are you gathering now? And can you talk about just any – what needs to happen to get to that 5 Bcf,
and sort of any concerns you have over the gas environment over the next couple of years, impeding that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Rory, do you want to take that?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. This is Rory again. I'll take that. Just doing some quick math there. We're probably,
current volumes, Bcf – 1.1 Bcf a day of current volumes gathered. And I am including the Caiman asset in those
numbers, which actually is set to close tomorrow. So I may be gun-jumping just a little bit there, but just so you have
some context for that question.
The path to go from there to the 5 Bcf a day number that we've shown in all of our materials, it's really around
construction. And that is not a straight line event, I think we've been pretty candid about some of the challenges, but I
think we've got the right team in place. We've got the broad resources across the organization to draw on, and we
continue to refine that construction effort up there.
But that's kind of the critical path. The producers have a lot of the same challenges, so a lot of it's just working through
the process, and refining the process of how we get wells drilled and connected up in the northeast. And it gets better
every month. So I'm very optimistic about the progress that we're making, but that's probably one of the bigger
challenges. And of course, we're actively working with the regulators, and the local governmental authorities that set
the rules out there. And I think there's a pretty good dialogue going now, and it's getting better. So it's moving in the
right direction.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Thank you. You guys are moving much more towards fee revenues now. Are you
seeing, at all, pushback from producers in a lower gas or ethane price environment to not be as fee-based and want you
guys to take on more risk, or is that just not the case right now?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: We have not seen that, okay? That's probably a short answer, but I don't know that it
requires much elaboration, either. Most of the producers, when they do get a chance to re-contract are interested in
getting that exposure to their – the NGLs and their gas.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Thank you. And my final question. You have a mandatory Transco rate case
coming in March of 2013. Is there – can you elaborate at all? Is there anything we should expect out of that materially?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Frank, you want to take that, please?
<A - Frank J. Ferazzi>: Yeah. We do have, as part of the settlement of our last rate case, we do have a filing
requirement. Filing will actually be made in September of this year, and we will file an increase, and so the commission
will suspend it for five months. And so the rates will become effective March of 2013, and we're expecting a rate
increase. It's difficult at this point to quantify exactly how much it's going to be.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Thanks so much, everybody.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Steve.
Operator
And next we'll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: A couple of questions. Alan, in your recorded remarks online, you mentioned that the
long-term growth was, of course, excluding any incremental M&A, and it kind of struck me, with Laser having just
closed in February, and Caiman closing tomorrow that for you to say that in your prepared remarks – well, it sounded
like there was more appetite despite all this activity, and I just thought maybe you might want to flesh that out a little
bit.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Thanks, Craig. Well, I certainly didn't intend to comment on anything, other than the
fact that our previous guidance hadn't included those acquisitions and certainly this had. And so, I would tell you know
– for right now, I'd say, we certainly feel like we have our plate full in terms of things that are backend-loaded, cash
flows, much like Caiman and Laser are. And so I wouldn't read too much into that other than me making it very clear
that all that is in there is identified projects or a few relatively small acquisitions that are just kind of bolt-on assets here
and there in there. But for the most part, it's all just organic growth, and that was really the purpose of my comment
there.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. And as a follow-up, and I don't know if Alan, you want to respond or Don, but
with the Caiman acquisition announcement and the increase in distribution guidance, it became clear that the growth in
fee-based businesses is so transparent for a number of years, and so great that for an interim period to have some of
your distributions based in part on commodity-sensitive operations that are doing well, isn't such a big deal since the
fee based stuff is going to catch up to it, and not too long anyhow.
Given the fact you're checking out such strong results, particularly on the olefins side, what's the appetite, because like
six months ago, you all would have been shy about making distributions contingent on fee-based businesses, but given
the backdrop of all the growth in the fee-based stuff, what's the appetite for reducing the distributions a little more if
commodities continue to be favorable like that?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Craig, this is Don, I think we put out what we think is still industry-leading distribution
growth at WPZ. We don't think there's a great incentive to do more than that. And so, again, to the extent we can put
out something that we think is a sustainable higher rate of growth, we'll do that, but we're not inclined just to call it,
jump the distributions on the back of high commodity prices, but we think we're building a portfolio of business that
will enable us to have industry-leading growth in WPZ distributions over a number of years. And as, as it's been
pointed out in the call, we think we have great visibility to it.
I think another way to kind of come at the M&A comment was really, we don't need any additional acquisitions in
order to drive this distribution growth or the dividend growth at Williams. So this is now all within our control. And I
think we're delighted by that and we're just taking the excess cash flow and plowing it right back into building this
fee-based business out.

Moving on to Brad Olsen with Tudor Pickering Holt.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Hi, good morning, everyone.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Hi, Brad.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: I just had a couple of questions about the MC&O business, the olefins or the MC&O business as a
whole posted a really strong, kind of margin expansion, quarter-over-quarter as you alluded to, a result of the ethylene
and ethane spread. I think, last quarter, you mentioned that there are some legacy contracts that might limit for the next
12 months or at least for the remainder of the year, your ability to capture the full ethane-ethylene spread and do you
have any comments on what that margin expansion or the quarter-over-quarter growth might have looked like, if you
didn't have those contracts in place?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: This is Rory. I don't have that assessment that you just asked for, but I can give you a little
color on the contracting situation just so you maybe have a flavor of what's coming. If you look at, say, where we're at
in February, about 30% of our off take portfolio had kind of unfettered exposure to the spot market. The majority of the
rest was under collared deals, meaning it had some exposure, but the exposure was limited.
If we page ahead to the end of the year in December, that exposure to the, just pure spot market is around 55%, and
then by February of 2013, that exposure goes up to 84%. So if we had a – let's just say, a steady state situation around
the crack spread, we'd expect to see that open up significantly over that period.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay. Great. And now moving to Midstream Canada, you guys are working on that, the ethane
extraction project to deliver up to 10,000 barrels a day to Nova in Alberta, and I was wondering if you could maybe
talk a little bit about how – I know there's not really a direct linkage between the Canadian ethane environment and the
U.S. ethane environment, but does the drop in ethane prices in the U.S. affect the economics of that project at all?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: No. I don't think so. That project made a lot of sense, but the Canadian government also
provided some subsidies that helped on that project significantly. The Boreal pipeline is, I think, set to start being filled
on May 28, and then the ethane project, I think, is set to be online second quarter 2013. And there is a floor in that
contract that we think gives us the kind of earnings and performance that we're looking for in spite of where the
commodities go.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great. And one last question. We've seen some, some kind of dry gas Marcellus rig count declines
recently. Do you guys have any comments on that? And also, as we've seen kind of weak propane demand up in the
Northeast this quarter, do you see any change, just kind of preliminary change in producer attitudes as propane is a
large share of kind of the liquid yield up in the Marcellus, on how they think about operating rigs in that area?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Let me take that first question first, about what we're seeing in the dry gas and maybe some
falling rig counts in the Marcellus. I just would say, our approach has been start with the geology first and we've tried
to target the places that we think are the sweet spots in the Marcellus. It's not all created equal, but if you're in the best
parts of the Marcellus, in the dry gas windows, you're probably in the best place to drill in the United States of America
for dry gas. So Susquehanna County probably being the number one dry gas location. We have seen a rig or two come
out of that area that we have access to with our system, but what the producers have been doing is been replacing less
efficient rigs with more efficient rigs, and so it hasn't had any impact at all on our volume forecast.
So the situation is very robust up there for us, and we're very confident that that system is going to perform. And in
fact, we've got the majority of that 3 Bcf a day of capacity, take-away capacity that we highlighted in the slides. We've
got the majority of that contracted for. There's a little bit of available capacity, hydraulically available, and we're in the
process of sorting through the demand for that right now. We have more demand for it than we have space. So the

situation is still very robust. It's very, very positive. There are places in the Marcellus where its [ph] fringier (26:14)
and those are not areas that we're in right now, but those will probably see less activity than the better areas.
In terms of the propane demand, propane is a tougher commodity to predict probably right now, just with the increases
in supply and maybe a changing demand profile and exports and probably going to be a big part of that story going
forward. We have not seen any changes in drilling in the rich gas areas, particularly in the Northeast. All we've seen is
more and more interest. So certainly, if propane is down, that is going to hurt a bit, but I still think it's a, it's not going
to fall to the point where it greatly diminishes the drilling economics in those rich gas areas. They're some of the best in
the nation right now.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: That's very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks.

And we'll now go to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi, good morning. You have, I guess, in one of the slides a budgeted amount, or percentage of
projects potentially for the Utica. In terms of those types of investments, are you looking at gathering projects,
processing projects? And maybe if you could give a sense in terms of the potential timing of those investments?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sharon, we can't really give you much in terms of timing on that. I would just tell you that
the assets that we acquired or will be acquiring, when we closed from Caiman, those are well-positioned to kind of be a
first mover to attract volumes in, from that. So initially, probably that infrastructure would likely be more gathering that
would be bringing some of those volumes over, but certainly we'd be looking to take advantage of that first mover
position we have and ultimately build the kind of infrastructure that would serve that area long term, because the
infrastructure that we're building for Caiman really is to a very large degree already spoken for from volumes just from
that area. So we would have to be building further processing capacity for the Utica in the long term, but initially, it
would just be a matter of being able to gather that in to those plants just as a temporary solution.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just following up on Carl's question about Atlantic Access. Do
you have updated number for the potential CapEx? I think last time we spoke, it might have been $1.5 billion?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, this is Don, at this – with this current proposal that's out there, it's quite a bit
bigger than that. We've not put a number out, I think we'll try to give you a better range at our May 22 Analyst Day, but
again it's quite a bit larger, if it went off exactly as it's currently supposed but obviously we have to get feedback from
customers as to their specific [ph] aims (29:41).
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And I guess for the Constitution Pipeline, is the CapEx around $725 million?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: We're just saying it's between $700 million and $800 million at this point, Sharon. It has
certainly expanded as a result of the Southwestern Energy volumes, but that is as close to the target as we're going to
draw on that at this point.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And I noticed for 2014, the guidance for the MC&O business actually increased a bit.
Maybe if you can just touch on the reason for the increase in guidance?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, this is Don, I'd just say that we have risked that, but I think upon further study, we
decided that some of the, call it, probability had improved somewhat in terms of timing, just timing of cash flows, and
that caused us to increase the 2014 guidance.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] We'll now go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks, we have heard a lot about the Marcellus, but I'm just wondering if you can go back into
your legacy areas in the Rockies. Are you seen with the low gas price, seeing rigs pull back particularly given that
there's a lots of keep-wholes, so that producers aren't really getting as much of a liquids uplift out there?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Hi, this is Rory. I'll take that call, or that question. Yeah, maybe just starting up in Southwest
Wyoming, we have seen a little bit of fall-off there, probably down about 100 million a day, from the first of the year,
and I will tell you that we've got a lot of wells tied into those gathering systems.
Most of it's coming out of tight sands production, and so it's a hyperbolic decline. The older wells are on a very flat part
of the decline and so in – up in Wyoming, we've seen both Shell and Ultra have gone down to two rigs each. So that's a
drop of about four rigs in total. The 100 million a day is probably indicative of the flush production that we were
seeing. And we think it will be pretty stable because we are on those flat parts of the decline.
Over on Wamsutter we've had four rigs drilling over there, and we've had one pull out and the other three are from
producers that aren't getting the benefit to those NGLs, and we don't anticipate those coming out of the equation. The
Piceance has been down to about five rigs and that had been running at about eight, so there's a little bit of slowdown
there. Again though, the producers are seeing the benefits of the NGLs there and we're not expecting any further
decline there in the Piceance. And down in Four Corners, lots of wells tied into that. It's pretty resilient to any kind of
drastic fall-off, but we are down about 40 wells per year there in the Four Corners. So it's pretty modest. I think the
fall-offs that we've seen – they have been minor, but I those are indicative of what we'll see going forward until we get
a little bit of increase in gas price.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a question for Don, in terms of the equity you
did at WMB, it looks like you did a little more equity than you kind of have indicated for the Caiman deal. I think you
said you were going to do about, 50/50 debt and equity for the $1 billion WPZ transaction. Can you just talk about that?
Is that – or is it more of sort of a defensive move, or maybe is it more offensive, you're thinking about acquisitions or
whatnot down the road?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Ted, I would say that on average, our debt and equity mix will be about 50/50, but in this
case, these assets were not really cash flowing, and therefore, didn't really support much debt. So as we look at our
credit metrics, to really do much in the way of debt would have really either caused ratings – a negative ratings
reaction, or really put us up against being really tight for additional growth. So we felt that was the right thing to do to
provide ability to continue to execute on some of the additional projects that we're currently contemplating.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it. And then just talking about the WMB equity again, would you use that similar to this for
a transaction, kind of related to that at, or would you consider even just using it as an investment in WPZ? Do you have
a lot growth capital you're wanting to do and a lot of financing at the PZ. And I'm just wondering, what's the best use of
the cash flow, is it WMB relative to the dividend increases?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I think to the extent that we have sustainable cash flows at Williams, and we kind of laid
that out in our dividend slide there in terms of the distributions from WPZ, plus very strong distribution growth at
MC&O after substantial coverage at both PZ and MC&O, that we think it's appropriate to pay a dividend with the bulk
of that. We see Williams currency as being kind of a backup for MC. I think WPZ will be the primary financing vehicle
for obviously for Williams partners, but certainly in situations like the Caiman, where trying to do more with WPZ may
have put some stress on WPZ, we felt that having Williams step up, because it was good for Williams as well as good
for WPZ. So we'll use I think Williams sparingly, that's the only equity issuance we've had in the last decade, but again,
if we see a situation that really is compelling, it's a tool in the tool kit, and I think a real advantage that we have relative
to a lot of competitors.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay great, I appreciate it. That's it for me.

Next, we'll go to Tim Schneider with Citi.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning. It's Faisel from Citi.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning, Faisel.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thank you. Could you – I just wanted to clarify on your Utica position, how much of dedicated
acreage do you guys have? I see your Marcellus acreage at 1.2 million, but what's the acreage I should look at in terms
of what's dedicated from the Utica?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: There is not – we have some, but I would say kind of historic acreage dedication that has
Utica right underneath it. But we don't have any acreage that we've specifically gone after for Utica drilling at this
point. So there is some locations back from the – particularly from the Atlas dedication that had Utica acreage
underlying it. But in terms of things that we've specifically gone after for the Utica, we do not have any Utica at this
point.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Got you. And then, just curious, in the Rockies, I guess it's been kind of a little bit of a
discovery in the Paradox Basin for liquids and oil. Can you just remind us how you guys are positioned in that basin?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. I'll take that, this is Rory. Paradox is something that I think was drawing some interest
several years ago and in fact we built some early production systems out there. The resource is definitely in place there,
producers were working hard, including or affiliate at the time to kind of crack the code on how to commercially
produce that. I think they're still working on that, so I would look at the Paradox as still a work-in-progress. We do
have some minor facilities there in case things do take off, but I don't see that as something that we're really excited
about right now.
I think if I was to point to some of the exciting things that are coming out west, I'd point to the Mancos shale play down
the in the San Juan Basin, it's like a lot of these shale plays, it's got three different windows, a dry gas, a condensate,
wet gas window and an oil window, and that's starting to attract a lot of attention. There's a very similar play in the
Mancos in the Piceance with the same three types of windows, and there's activity in that area as well. And although
this is probably something I can't say nearly as much about, there is up in the Wamsutter area a shale play that's being
tried up in that area as well. So as we're seeing these shale plays particularly wet gas shale plays that are developing
around the country, they tend to be in places where there's already production and what we're finding is that's the case
out west as well. And there's activity in three of our four basins today pursuing that type of play. So I think we'll have
some more exciting things to talk about in the next 6 to 12 months as those plays get a little better understood.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And Alan, in your prepared remarks on the podcast, I think that you talked about some
of, some opportunities in the Marcellus – in your Marcellus part of the pie to take advantage of power conversions, I
think. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit about that. Was that coal to gas switching? Was there
something that – something else, you talking about new build of gas plants? So what was it that was the opportunity out
on your, kind of under negotiation or potential part of the pie?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, I probably was talking so fast I mixed two things there. Certainly coming for Transco
really the two primary drivers for Transco right now is serving the producers' needs, getting out in the Marcellus, but as
well, we've seen a lot of interest from the market in wanting access to the Marcellus as well, for long-term things like
power plant conversions. And so I think there's a real concern on the part of the power generation industry about
making sure they've got plenty of reliable access to supplies long-term. And so I think Transco is perfectly positioned
to do that because it can provide access from supplies in the south and even areas obviously like the mid-continent
supplies and Barnett shale, Haynesville and so forth that come into Transco at Station 85, and as well as of course the
Gulf Coast supplies. But as well, now they would have access to supplies from the north and so with the power

generation, Transco is extremely well-positioned. If somebody is concerned about reliability, via its multiple loop lines
right through these populated areas and access multiple access to supply points, and so that is driving a lot of interest
and demand for Transco being kind of the pipe of choice out there for power generation conversions.
<A - Randall Lee Barnard>: Yeah, this is Randy Barnard, with just a blurb to add. In the quarterly data book, you'll
see a couple slides in there that attempt to quantify with a little more exactitude the opportunities for conversion
surrounding Transco. Slide 53 in particular. I think there's another one in there as well.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, great. And then last question for me. I also believe, in your prepared remarks, you talked
about in the under negotiation and potential category, two more FPSs. What's the – how do we look at converting that
potential into a firm sort of project? What are the things that could happen or could go against you in order to turn that
into a fixed – a firm project?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: I'll take that. This is Rory. I guess what I would say is that the main competition out there for
that kind of a product is the producer themselves. There aren't a lot of people out there right now with that kind of
product, and the big advantage is really time to first oil,. So it's really around the producers wanting to accelerate their
cash flows. We're standing ready with the product that can do that. The producers' option is to self-develop, but they're
starting from a standing stop and it has a fairly significant impact on the present value of the project.
So we think the financials on the product are very compelling. We've got probably five or six of those that are in
various states of discussion, and one of the nice things about these opportunities is that the producers will make a
decision when they find or make a discovery, they're probably in the 100 million barrels plus range, with the price of
oil where it is, and the prospects going forward being pretty bright for crude oil, these producers are going to make a
decision, and they are going to move forward. And so, we're really counting on a couple more of them, deciding that
they would like to accelerate that cash flow, and they'd like to outsource that business.
And there are a number of producers that are getting interest in that, even more so. They don't really get any credit on
their balance sheet for adding steel. They get credit for adding proven reserves. And so, it works well for both parties,
and I think the confidence that Hess and Chevron has shown us in our first sale of a Gulfstar augurs well for the
additional opportunities for us out there. So just in terms of timing, I think over the next 12 months, I think there's a
great chance that we could add another one. No guarantees on that, but the deal churn that we've got, I think that's a
possibility.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, great. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.

We'll now go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Well, Williams seems to have a very full plate of organic growth projects to drive growth
going forward. I was just wondering if you guys could comment on any appetite for expanding or acquiring assets
further down the NGL value chain?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I would say that we do see a lot of opportunity and as Rory mentioned earlier in the
Marcellus, we certainly are very aware of that. In fact, even though it wasn't embedded in our economics for the
Caiman acquisition. We think that puts us in a great position to be a solution provider for NGL infrastructure in that
area where it's so desperately needed.
But certainly, you know, the Mont Belvieu area is pretty crowded in terms of service providers in that area, but we are
getting a lot of interest from the pet-chem side in terms of providing more customized infrastructure, and helping to
move product around. You can't really go expanding the ethylene cracking capacity and the way the ethylene volumes

are growing without quite a bit of infrastructure in and around the pet-chem space there. And so we are very focused on
that area.
So I think we see a lot of opportunity at the far upstream end of the midstream infrastructure, and the far downstream
end of the midstream infrastructure and are looking at some very interesting projects there that take advantage of our
liquids and our production, but help pet-chems look out for the future where their supplies are going to be coming form.
So the answer to your question is yes, but I wouldn't translate that into thinking that we're going to be into the fray
where there's plenty of players right now, and particularly in the Belvieu area proper, as a [ph] merchant (46:30) in that
space. So I think – we think there's quite a crowd there already, and wouldn't want to try to butt into that space, just
because we don't think it would provide the kind of margin and returns that we expect from our other opportunities.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: That's very helpful. Thank you. I was just wondering also if there were any updated thoughts
on where the Confluence project stands?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Confluence is moving ahead. Of course we announced there that Southwestern Energy had
also – oh sorry, Confluence, sorry, I had that confused. We have too many projects starting with C. Confluence is a lot
of interest from producers in the area. That area is very underserved with infrastructure, Northwestern PA, both on the
gathering side and particularly on the NGL extraction and that area is very rich with gas. So we like that area. We think
it's going to need some infrastructure, and while we don't have anything new to announce there, we're having a lot of
discussions going on with a lot of different large players in the area that understand the need for the infrastructure and
see us as well-positioned to provide that.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. Thank you very much.

We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing
remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong
Okay, great. Well, thank you, appreciate all the great questions this morning. And we certainly are continuing to drive
forward and execute, very proud of the way our organization continues to execute in a very, in an area that we've got so
much growth going on. But very proud of the way we're executing on projects, and continuing to run the businesses
very well, as we demonstrated this quarter, and so we look forward to continuing to talk to you about some more detail
on these projects at our May 22 webcast. Thanks for joining us this morning.
