MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is April and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Sprint Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the call over
to Yijing Brentano, Head of IR. Ma'am, you may begin.
Yijing Brentano
Thank you, April. Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining
us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO,
Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are
both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint web site. Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point
out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of
risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We
provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings which I encourage you to review, including Part 1, Item
1A, risk factors of our annual report on Form 10-K; and when filed, Part 2, Item 1A, risk factors of our quarterly report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011.
In addition, we are in the process of finalizing our 2012 budget. As a result, we will not be providing formal guidance
beyond 2011. However, we will be covering some illustrative 2012 impacts to help discuss liquidity expectations and et
cetera. We will provide 2012 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.

Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP
performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter can be found in
attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our web site at
www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move on to earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the third quarter was $0.10
compared to the $0.28 in the second quarter and $0.30 in the year-ago period. The loss per share decreased as
compared to the second quarter partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in adjusted OIBDA,
which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call.
In addition, loss per share decreased sequentially due to lower equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other, as
well as lower net tax expense. The common period loss per share includes $0.09 in equity losses of unconsolidated
investments and other net of the effect of increased evaluation allowance. During the second and third quarter of 2011
and the third quarter of 2010, there were no adjustments made to OIBDA; as a result, we will refer to adjusted OIBDA
as OIBDA throughout the call this morning.
We recorded a net tax expense of $12 million in 3Q '11. As a reminder, 2Q '11 included a one-time $52 million
expense resulting from the cumulative effect of changes in Michigan's corporate income tax law enacted in the second
quarter. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million to $250
million. Also, please keep in mind that Clearwire's third quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been
finalized. Please refer to the press release in our Form 10-Q for additional detail.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse.
Daniel R. Hesse
Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I will organize my remarks as usual around our three key priorities;
the customer experience, the brand and cash.
Beginning with the customer experience, earlier this year, we mentioned we had reached at least a tie for first place in
the customer satisfaction ratings among major wireless carriers by well respected independent evaluators like
Consumer Reports, and the American Customer Satisfaction Index. We went from last to first in a short period of time.
If you turn to Slide 5, I am pleased that in this third quarter, we received three more awards from highly regarded J.D.
Power and Associates for the purchase experience for the Sprint brand and for both customer service performance and
for the purchase experience for Boost. Customer satisfaction is also reflected in churn. Prepaid churn achieved its best
level in six years and postpaid churn was the best ever for a third quarter. The best six quarters of postpaid churn in our
company's history have been the last six quarters.
Sequentially, churn did increase driven primarily by an increase in involuntary churn due in part to a tougher U.S.
economic climate. Voluntary churn, the part of churn driven by customer satisfaction and brand, improved significantly
year-over-year.
Moving on to the brand in Slide 6, we continue to make progress with our key brand health metrics. Most want to
investigate, purchase consideration, positive brand momentum and the first brand preference each achieved all-time
bests in the third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 7. As I discussed with you in the past, the most tangible evidence of brand improvement is
subscriber performance. And a strong brand is especially critical for generating gross adds or attracting new customers.
As this chart depicts, Sprint's gross adds had been declining steadily since late 2005. The brand had weakened enough
that gross adds dropped for 13 of 14 quarters, the downward momentum being strong enough to blow right through
seasonality, dropping by over 2 million postpaid gross adds per quarter. We hit bottom in the second quarter of 2009,
and we've been building momentum ever since.

Driven by brand health, we estimate our share of postpaid gross adds increased by 170 basis points versus the previous
quarter.
The number one reason customers leave Sprint or churn is no iPhone. And we believe the number one reason new
customers don't try Sprint has been no iPhone. Our early results of selling the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S have confirmed
the iPhone's ability to attract new customers.
What one hopes to see from a device is a high percentage of gross adds – new customers and new revenue to Sprint.
The time we have been selling this device is very short, but early results indicate the iPhone is breaking the previous
Sprint record held by the EVO in terms of the percentage of device buyers who are gross adds or new to Sprint in the
weeks following the launch.
We believe two weeks in the market is not enough time to confidently estimate expected gross add percentages, but we
plan to provide you with that estimate after the full fourth quarter results are in. But early indications are extremely
encouraging.
I'll discuss the iPhone's economic impact shortly, as will Joe. But a high gross add percentage translates to revenue
growth and provides an even more compelling reason for Sprint to carry the device.
Please turn to Slide 8. In terms of overall subscriber performance, we generated almost 1.3 million net adds – the
highest number in five-and-a-half years. It represents our fourth quarter in a row of over 1 million net adds and our
eleventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement.
Slide 9 shows year-over-year postpaid net add improvement or decline. As many of you know, Sprint's largest decline
was from 2005 to 2006, but we began improving sequentially beginning in 2009. For the third quarter of 2011, our
postpaid net adds improved sequentially and also improved year-over-year for the ninth consecutive quarter.
In terms of the year-over-year improvement needed to be net add positive for calendar year 2011, the 654,000 you see
on this chart shows that we're more than three-quarters of the way to the goal of 855,000, which we need through three
quarters.
If you would please turn to Slide 10, further proof of the strengthening of the Sprint brand has been the continuing
strong performance of Sprint branded services. As you can see from the chart, in terms of annual subscriber growth, the
Sprint brand is the fastest-growing major postpaid brand in America. Sprint brand net adds grew sequentially and were
positive for the eighth consecutive quarter.
The Sprint brand was net port positive for the sixth consecutive quarter, meaning more customers are switching from
competitors to the Sprint brand than vice versa, Sprint's longest such streak ever.
Being good stewards of the environment is an important element of our brand. Please turn to Slide 11. If you haven't
seen the current release of Newsweek, they have an article on America's 25 greenest companies. We're the only
telecommunications or wireless company on the list, moving up to the number three spot from number six last year.
We have also been recently been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America and to the World
Wildlife Fund's Climate Savers Program, only the 28th company named to this elite program since 1999.
Moving on to our cash priority, which Joe will cover in more details in his remarks. Perhaps the strongest element of
Q3 performance was financial. Please turn to Slide 12. This quarter, we had the largest year-over-year improvement in
postpaid ARPU this century and the highest sequential improvement in six years. Year-over-year improvement in
CDMA ARPU also set an all-time record.
Turning to Slide 13, as a result of postpaid ARPU growth and prepaid subscriber growth, total operating revenues were
up year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. Total service revenues and wireless service revenues saw the largest
year-over-year percentage increases since 2006, driving the best third quarter OIBDA improvement percentage since
the third quarter of 2005, which was the first time that Nextel's OIBDA was added in. Otherwise, third quarter's
sequential OIBDA percentage improvement would have been our best in 11 years.

We averaged $1.4 billion in OIBDA per quarter in the first half of 2011, the same number we achieved this quarter, and
without the iPhone, we would have expected a similar number in this year's fourth quarter. Our bottom-line
performance has benefited from a number of steps we have taken recently which also put us in a position to maximize
customer lifetime value with the iPhone.
You may have noticed by now that I mentioned independent customer satisfaction recognition but I have not mentioned
sequential improvement in customer care satisfaction. I have been able to report that improvement for 14 quarters in a
row, every quarter since I've been here. It was quite a streak.
I can't report a 15th consecutive quarter of improvement because of a number of financially prudent steps we have
taken recently, not all of which are popular with customers. Earlier this year, we increased the monthly rate for our
unlimited mobile-to-mobile text and data plans by $10 per month for new customers and for upgrades. This has been
the largest driver of our ARPU improvement.
In the third quarter, we increased a number of fees including upgrade fees and early termination fees. We have also
been increasing our efforts to enforce our network usage terms and conditions. We have also eliminated the Premier
Loyalty program and with it, the associated early upgrade provisions. You have seen this effect with fewer upgrades
last quarter. All of these changes have been put into the market in a short period of time, making a 15th consecutive
quarter of customer care satisfaction survey improvement too much of a challenge.
Part of the reason to make these changes in areas like upgrade policy and early termination fees was to prepare for the
potential launch of and maximize profitability of the iPhone. I recently attended the movie Moneyball with my
youngest son and I couldn't help but be reminded of Sprint's situation. The Oakland A's, think Sprint, were trying to
compete and win with a fraction of the financial resources of its deep pocketed adversaries, the Yankees and the Red
Sox, think AT&T and Verizon. No one bats an eye when one of these high payroll teams signs a superstar, but in
Sprint's version of the movie, Dan has to be played by Brad Pitt look-alike, and Joe Euteneuer, played by Jonah Hill – I
won't say anything – have done detailed statistical analyses that a particular player, Isaac Phone, better known as
iPhone, versus A-Rod, will not only deliver the runs on the field to win the game but also help draw the crowd and fill
the seats in their high fixed cost stadium. iPhone has an expensive contract but he's worth every penny.
Turning to Slide 14, this is a depiction of single customer profitability, what we call customer lifetime value. Dollars
are the Y-axis, time the X-axis. The green line represents total costs. On day one, the carrier invests in subscriber
acquisition costs, also known as CPGA, the largest component of which is the phone's subsidy. Then over time, a
number of customer support costs are incurred, the most significant being network usage.
Building to Slide Number 15, we've added the revenue line, the slope of which is ARPU. A higher ARPU means you
reach breakeven sooner. After the breakeven date, the carrier starts to make money. The vertical line on the right
depicts customer life or the inverse of churn. The further this line is to the right, the better. The shaded triangle is the
customer lifetime value, which is the area between your revenue and cost lines in between the breakeven date and
churn date. This is a real chart representing a top-selling Sprint postpaid smartphone today. If this were a typical
prepaid device chart, you'd hit breakeven sooner because of the lower CPGA, but customer lifetime value is generally
lower than postpaid primarily because churn is usually much higher, therefore, customer life is shorter.
Turning to Slide 16, we've superimposed our expected economics for the iPhone. For confidentiality reasons, we have
taken the legends off the axis but these graphs are true to scale. These are genuine internal Sprint charts plotted using
actual numbers and projections. We expect the customer lifetime value of an iPhone customer to be at least 50%, yes,
at least 50% greater than a typical smartphone user, driven primarily by more efficient use of our network and lower
churn.
In addition, not reflected in this chart, is the upside of more new revenue to Sprint, new fans to offset the fixed costs of
our stadium, if you will, because we expect the iPhone to generate a significantly higher number of new users to Sprint.
Joe has a chart, which depicts the net present value for Sprint of carrying the iPhone. We expect the improved customer
lifetime value I have just described to contribute $6 billion to $6.8 billion and new gross adds to contribute another $1
billion to $1.2 billion for a total net present value benefit of $7 billion to $8 billion over the life of the customers which

choose the iPhone during the four years of our agreement with Apple.
There is a misperception that our launch of the iPhone will increase the load on Sprint's 3G network and require us to
spend more 3G capital. The reverse is true. iPhone users are expected to use significantly less 3G than the typical user
of a dual-mode 3G/4G device. Even adjusting for more total new customers being added to the network, we believe
we'll put less load on our 3G network than we would have if we did not carry the iPhone.
We are pleased to announce that we have signed a non-binding cooperation agreement with Clearwire to work together
on the technical specifications of the Clearwire LTE network and to ensure a superb customer experience for Sprint
customers on the Clearwire LTE network. The cooperation extends to the design and operations of the network and
ensure seamless handoffs and service layer control that meet Sprint's customer experience requirements, cover the cell
site selection and timing of site builds and involves working with OEMs to design devices and to include certain
chipsets in devices.
As you should each understand, it was necessary to reach this agreement in order to clear the way to begin the
negotiations of commercial terms under which Sprint may utilize and pay for access to the Clearwire LTE network. A
definitive agreement would allow Sprint to meet its objective to further improve the customer experience and to
manage its fixed network costs by offloading some 4G usage from its own LTE network onto the Clearwire LTE
network and thereby benefit from Clearwire's large spectrum portfolio on a resale basis. Those discussions are ongoing
and the terms resulting from those discussions, if any, will be disclosed only at such time that a definitive and binding
agreement has been reached by the parties.
So, in conclusion, strong ARPU growth and wireless subscriber gains drove a strong year-over-year and sequential
improvement in adjusted OIBDA. This quarter we received more accolades for the improvements we've made in the
customer experience and our brand continues to strengthen as measured by brand metrics and by subscriber growth. We
believe the investments we're making in Network Vision and in the iPhone will be very beneficial for Sprint's
customers and for our shareholders over the long term.
Our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will now discuss our financial picture in more detail.
Joseph J. Euteneuer
Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
I want to start by apologizing to everyone on the call for not having provided enough information and clarity on
October 7. In hindsight, there were things we could have done to better address market concerns. We believe you will
find today's call to be a demonstration of our willingness to continue to provide fulsome, concise disclosures. On
today's call, I will discuss our third quarter results, update our forecast and provide additional detail on liquidity,
financing, Network Vision and the iPhone.
I'd like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the third quarter. Total consolidated net operating revenues
grew by $181 million or 2% year-over-year primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of net
prepaid subscribers, partially offset by lower wireline revenues and lower wireless equipment revenues. Sequentially,
total consolidated net operating revenues remained relatively flat at $8.3 billion as growth in wireless service revenues
was offset by lower equipment and wireline revenues.
Now let's discuss wireless service revenues on Slide 17. Third quarter wireless service revenues which include retail,
wholesale and affiliate revenues improved by $465 million or 7% year-over-year and by $138 million or 2%
sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU and
growth in net prepaid subscribers.
Postpaid ARPU improved by nearly $3 or 5% year-over-year and $1 or 2% sequentially to $58. This was the largest
quarterly sequential increase in six years. Our $10 premium data add on charge along with other fee increases including
$1 or 14% increase in our Handset Protection Plan drove the sequential postpaid ARPU growth in the third quarter. We

expect the $10 premium data add on charge to result in additional postpaid ARPU improvement in the fourth quarter of
this year.
Prepaid ARPU declined approximately 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Prepaid ARPU performance was stable
across the individual brands and the sequential decline was primarily due to a higher mix of Assurance customers.
Looking forward, as we stated previously, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cause
overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate.
Switching to wireless expense trends on Slide 18. Total net wireless subsidy expense increased $92 million or 9%
year-over-year and increased $12 million or 1% sequentially. The sequential increase, based on customer activations,
was driven by a lower postpaid subscriber upgrade volume of 8% offset by higher postpaid gross customer additions of
12% and an increase in the average subsidy rate for postpaid devices of 3%. The elimination of the Premier Loyalty
program contributed to the decline in the upgrade volume.
Wireless cost of service increased $195 million or 9% year-over-year, and $95 million or 4% sequentially. The
sequential change in wireless cost of service includes $55 million or 58% that relates to smartphone subscriber growth
and seasonal increases in roaming, service and repair and network site utilities. An additional $35 million or 37% is
driven by network-related expenses, including Network Vision. The higher service and repair costs were related to the
increased mix of smart phones and third quarter seasonality.
Wireless selling, general and administrative costs increased $29 million or 1% year-over-year and improved $81
million or 4% sequentially. The sequential improvement was the result of our planned marketing reduction in the third
quarter partially offset by higher bad debt primarily associated with an increase in our reserve for doubtful accounts as
a result of increases in our aging buckets combined with higher average write-off per account.
Now let's move to consolidated OIBDA on Slide 19. Consolidated OIBDA margin increased 10 basis points
year-over-year and approximately 100 basis points sequentially to 18.2%. Consolidated OIBDA increased $63 million
or 5% year-over-year and $88 million or 7% sequentially, slightly over $1.4 billion for the third quarter. Sequentially,
OIBDA improved primarily due to higher postpaid and prepaid wireless service revenues and reduced marketing
expenses partially offset by higher wireless cost of service. In the third quarter, our OIBDA results include $30 million
of operating expenses related to Network Vision. We now expect the full year operating expense impact of Network
Vision to be between $100 million and $150 million, which is down from our prior estimates of between $200 million
and $250 million.
Wire line OIBDA declined $87 million or 32% year-over-year and by $26 million or 12% sequentially, primarily due
to lower revenue resulting from the continued migration of wholesale cable voice-over-IP customers off of Sprint's
wire line platform. We continue to expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voice-over-IP customers
to cause wire line OIBDA to decline by approximately $150 million for the full year 2011.
Before we discuss our third quarter, liquidity I wanted to provide an update on our revolving credit facility. We are
pleased to announce the expansion of our credit facility by $150 million. In addition, we are announcing an amendment
modifying the debt to OIBDA covenant ratio to adjust for the subsidy impact of the iPhone. The amendment provides
an exclusion of net subsidy costs up to $2.7 billion during the next 6 quarters. We are very pleased with the vote of
confidence from our bank group in providing us this amendment and the increase in our revolver.
Let's move on to cash and liquidity on Slide 20. We ended the third quarter with a total liquidity position of
approximately $5 billion including about $4 billion in cash and $1 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our
revolver. Our next note and loan maturities totaling $2.25 billion are due in March of 2012. After maturities in the first
quarter of 2012, our next note maturity of $300 million occurs in May of 2013 followed by a $1.5 billion maturity in
the fourth quarter of 2013.
Accrued capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest of $103 million and including $115 million of Network
Vision capital were $760 million in the third quarter and compared to $640 million in the second quarter and $462
million in the third quarter of 2010. We continue to expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately
$3 billion excluding capitalized interest and spectrum spend related to re-banding driven by CDMA capacity.

We now expect re-banding spend for the calendar year of 2011 to be between $250 million and $300 million as public
safety licensees continue to need additional time to work through their rate configurations, which is down from our
previous estimate between $300 million and $350 million. As of September 30, 2011, we have approximately $500
million to $800 million of re-banding work still remaining.
Now let's discuss free cash flow on Slide 21. Free cash flow was a negative $273 million for the quarter compared to a
positive $384 million for the third quarter of 2010 and a positive $267 million for the second quarter of 2011. While
quarterly OIBDA was relatively stable year-over-year and sequentially, free cash flow was reduced by quarter,
year-over-year increases and capital expenditures of $328 million as well as year-over-year and sequential increases in
working capital of $483 million and $697 million, respectively, partially offset by LightSquared prepayments.
The quarterly year-over-year change in working capital is primarily associated with increased inventory balances
related to second quarter handset purchases in anticipation of a parts shortage later in the year and reductions in
accounts payable. The quarterly sequential change in working capital is primarily associated with the reduction in
accounts payable of $847 million, of which $700 million was related to payments associated with second quarter
inventory purchases partially offset by reduced inventory purchases during the quarter. In addition, third quarter also
included higher cash interest payments of $90 million as a result of timing and higher capital expenditures of $59
million.
Now let's move to a discussion of the iPhone on Slide 22. As Dan discussed, we believe the iPhone will be value
accretive for Sprint. In addition, we believe that the iPhone will strengthen our competitive position. We expect iPhone
customers to be among our most profitable as the higher up-front acquisition costs are expected to be offset by longer
customer tenure and lower support costs including data efficiency.
I want to share some additional specifics about the iPhone and our estimate for what it means to our business. Initially,
we expect the cost per gross addition for an iPhone customer to be nearly 40% higher than the average non-iPhone
customer, roughly $200, driven entirely by the cost of the device. As depicted in the top graph, it is anticipated that the
total net present value of iPhone customers we bring on during the four-year term of the agreement is expected to be $7
billion to $8 billion. Think of the total net present value in two large categories, the incremental new gross adds that the
iPhone will allow us to generate which represents 15% of the NPV and the remaining 85% of the NPV results from the
higher profitability of an iPhone subscriber as a result of expected lower churn, more efficient use of the network and
overall lower support costs.
As you can see in the bottom graph, iPhone OIBDA begins improving in 2013 and continues to build momentum
through 2015 when the benefits exceed the incremental acquisition cost of new customers. As a result of the popularity
of this device, we anticipate the iPhone could be 20% to 40% of our postpaid gross addition and upgrades. The upfront
costs are estimated to impact 2012 and 2013 OIBDA by $900 million to $1.2 billion each but are quickly recovered as
we expect iPhone customers to generate approximately 20% higher monthly margins than our other smartphone
customers.
We have a four-year agreement with Apple that is subject to a confidentiality agreement. Our ultimate spend with
Apple will depend on many variables, including anticipated rate of future subscriber growth, number of different
devices offered and the cost of devices offered. We anticipate outperforming the current contract minimum
commitment of $15.5 billion for the iPhone over the four-year period.
Now let's move on to Network Vision on Slide 23. We are excited about the opportunity created by the acceleration of
Network Vision deployment and the ability to begin recognizing the financial and operational benefits sooner rather
than later. I have provided a breakout of gross benefits and gross costs related to Network Vision. From 2011 to 2014,
the gross expected benefit is approximately $4 billion of which 40% is a result of cost savings from the iDEN network
and 50% comes from expected reduction of 3G and 4G roaming expenses and backhaul.
In calculating the full seven-year benefit that we presented on October 7, we estimated 3G and 4G roaming costs
assuming a compounded annual growth rate for subscribers of approximately 7% to 8% and increasing usage per
subscriber. In addition, we estimated a decommissioning of over 25,000 iDEN sites. In looking at the gross operating

cost as a result of Network Vision from 2011 to 2014, over 90% of these costs are from the following two items: 50%
comes from migration efforts and incremental churn related to the iDEN subscriber base and 40% from an increase in
expenses related to cell sites such as rent entitlements for additional equipment on the towers, access and backhaul as
we switch from T1s to Ethernet fiber.
As you can see, in 2014, cumulative gross benefits exceeded cumulative gross costs associated with Network Vision.
The operating expense reductions from Network Vision are expected to generate between 400 basis points and 600
basis points of OIBDA margin improvement by 2014. We expect Network Vision to generate a total net benefit of $10
billion to $11 billion over 7 years with a projected NPV of approximately $6 billion.
Let's move on to Slide 24. The purpose of this slide is to illustrate our estimated financing needs over the next couple of
years. Let me start by discussing exactly what is represented on the chart. Each of the bars represent the incremental
cash impact for Network Vision and iPhone including both capital and operating expenses net of benefits. The dotted
line illustrates an assumed targeting cash level. The black lines on the chart represent the estimated ending cash balance
as a result of the incremental cash impact from Network Vision and the iPhone. Additionally, the black lines include
scheduled debt maturities and assume a range of potential cash generation from our core business excluding Network
Vision and the iPhone.
The way to think about cash generation from our core business for purposes of this slide is that the bottom black line
assumes stable core OIBDA levels as we exit Q3 while the top line represents potential opportunities that exist in our
core business to expand our operating margins and grow cash flow.
If you assume that these margin opportunities for both revenue and expense generate an OIBDA that had a
compounded annual growth rate of 10% starting in 2012, you would achieve the top black line. Our externally reported
OIBDA will be the net result of core business performance, net of the iPhone and Network Vision, all of which will be
different than what is illustrated here today. As we get more operating results with the iPhone and start rolling out
Network Vision, we'll provide better information. As mentioned earlier, we are in the process of completing our 2012
budgeting process, which we will include evaluating those core business opportunities and the development of our
operational plan.
In looking at 2012, we expect the costs related to Network Vision and the iPhone to impact cash by roughly $5.5
billion, partially offset by the benefits generated from Network Vision and the iPhone of $1.1 billion where we expect
positive growth.
Taking into account these impacts and the potential cash generation from our core business along with our scheduled
debt maturity in March of $2.25 billion, the cash shortage in 2012 ranges between $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion.
For 2013, we expect the combined iPhone and Network Vision cost to be $5.7 billion and the benefits to be $4.3
billion. As depicted by the black line, this results in a cumulative cash shortage of $3.2 billion to $5 billion after growth
in cash generation from the core business and scheduled debt maturities of $1.8 billion.
As discussed earlier, in 2014, we expect Network Vision benefits to exceed costs by $3.4 billion while the net iPhone
cost will exceed benefits by less than $400 million. Combined, we expect cash accretion of approximately $3 billion in
2014 from Network Vision and the iPhone. In 2015, the benefits outweigh the costs for both Network Vision and the
iPhone resulting in greater cash accretion, which is approximately $4.7 billion. So, what I want you to take away from
this slide is that we estimate the peak of our cash shortfall to occur in 2013 and to be between $3.2 billion and $5
billion. As a result, if you assume a targeting cash balance of $2 billion, we would project financing needs to range
between $5 billion and $7 billion. To adjust our projected financing needs during the next couple of years, we expect to
refinance our $4 billion of upcoming debt maturities through October 2013 through the public debt markets and raise
incremental vendor financing of approximately $1 billion to $3 billion to cover a portion of Network Vision costs.
Now let me update our forecast. We expect net postpaid subscriber additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total
net wireless subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. The company expects full-year capital expenditures in
2011 excluding capitalized interest to be approximately $3 billion. In addition, the company expects free cash flow
between negative $200 million and a positive $100 million for 2011 subject to the performance on the iPhone.

Sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter, we expect growth in the volume of retail wireless gross adds and
upgrades driven by the availability of the iPhone, normal industry seasonality for the fourth quarter and continued
success of our already-compelling device lineup and industry-leading unlimited plan offerings. We expect the
combination of both increased volume and rate impacts associated with the iPhone to result in a reduction in fourth
quarter OIBDA of between $500 million and $700 million. The more often customers choose Sprint as their iPhone
carrier and the more inventory that is available, the greater the OIBDA impact.
In addition, we expect total Network Vision expense of $60 million in the fourth quarter. This results in OIBDA in the
range of $600 million to $800 million and a margin of less than 10% for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Remember, we are just beginning our operational experience with the deployment of the iPhone and our flexible
technical platform of Network Vision. These will allow us to achieve future growth over time. We plan to provide a
forecast for 2012 including OIBDA on our fourth quarter earnings call.
I want to take the time to thank all of you for your support and your constructive suggestions over the past few weeks.
We will continue to make progress to improve clarity of our disclosures. Thank you.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Phil Cusick [JPMorgan Securities].
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, I think I'm still sort of thinking about what the
guidance was and what those last couple of slides implied. But maybe we can start with the credit facility change. So,
the – if you could explain that for us a little bit. It seems like the EBITDA impact from iPhone is a little bigger, so
getting that out of the covenant change helps and then if you could also talk a little bit more about the Clearwire deal?
Those would help. Thanks a lot.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Sure. In regards to the covenant change, we didn't want to run getting too close to the
existing covenant. We knew – it's hard to predict what the ultimate volume of the iPhone will be, so we went to our
bank group who was very, very supportive in getting the amendment to give us total flexibility to get through 2012 and
the first quarter of 2013.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: This is Dan, with respect to Clearwire, it's a non-binding MOU but clearly very important. If
you remember when we discussed our 4G situation and Clearwire in particular, on October 7, we have an existing
agreement contract that takes us through the end of 2012 and we said we would continue to sell and market WiMAX
devices through the end of 2012 and that we mentioned that Clearwire had announced its intention to move to LTE
TDD and that we still needed to work out technical details and specifications.
It may sound simple to you and me but it's really fairly complex to make sure that the networks work well together,
particularly that there's an architecture so there is a seamless handoff because what we are intending to do with
Network Vision and also with thinking of Clearwire as part of that list of – group of assets that we have in terms of

different spectrum bands, we want our network to be able to seamlessly hand off very quickly based upon the most
efficient, low cost, best coverage, best capacity alternative we have for any particular call but if, let's say, a call's
moving from the 2.5 GHz to the 1.9 GHz or to the 800 MHz frequencies, we want that to be very seamless.
So, this was really the technical teams, the network teams of Clearwire and Sprint working through all of the technical
details to make sure we both really felt we had a good technical plan and that is now the foundation that we needed that
we can begin to discuss, if you will, the commercial agreement going forward.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Okay. Okay. Good. Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong [Goldman Sachs].
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess one question on Network Vision. You talked about
the cost being lower this year. Maybe just a little bit more granularity there? Is this reflective of sort of slower
deployment than expected, are you getting better equipment? Sort of vendor costs? Maybe just help us think through
that.
And then when you talked about sort of the iPhone from a gross add versus upgrade perspective, I think there were
comments that the early momentum suggested this was more weighted to gross adds than many of us would have
thought. Can you just help us maybe frame that? I think you said it exceeded the EVO. What was the EVO in terms of
gross adds versus upgrade? Just help us frame a percentage. Thanks.
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Good morning. This is Steve Elfman. I'll answer the first one. [ph] Think there that
there's no (45:04) slowdown. But basically we projected a spend for this year, and as we've been going through the [ph]
FIP (45:03) testing and putting together the arrangements with the tower companies, and putting the plans together with
the three major OEMs, Ericsson, Samsung and ALU, we've really just got more clarity on the timing of spends.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: And so, Steve, would you say, did this push you out a quarter or two? Or what's the
interpretation?
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: No, not at this point in time. We basically, as we said on October the 7th, we're
looking to largely complete by the end of 2013, with some of the smaller markets and rural markets being completed in
the first quarter of 2014.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: And, Jason, this is Dan. With respect to the iPhone, we have not disclosed or nor will we the
percentage of gross adds, if you will, that we had early on with respect to the EVO.
But what I will say is that the percentage of iPhone customers that are gross adds are significantly higher in the first
two weeks than they were for the EVO, and also significantly higher than our expectations or business plan as well.
So as I said in my comments, you don't declare victory after two weeks. It's too early to change our assumptions with
respect to gross add percentage, based upon just how good the early indications have been. So we have not – so for
example, in the numbers that Joe went over, we haven't, if you will, adjusted our business plan, our expectations, based
upon early results actually even being better on gross add percentage.
So we'll give you a feel for that after we get a longer period under our belt. But the gross add percentage has been very,
very strong early on.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Michael Rollins [Citigroup].
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and thanks for the additional details during the call. A
few things. One is can you just reference where your smartphone penetration is currently?
Secondly, as you look at your iPhone guidance for dilution, if you look at the $1.9 billion in upgrades and handset sales
with commissions, right now, you spend about $4.5 billion on subsidies. Is that $1.9 billion for 2012 – is that all
incremental to what the current subsidy and commission picture is? Or is some of that potentially cannibalistic, i.e.,
there is some share shift, so it's not purely incremental?
And then just one other thing, if I could, please. It looks like on the Vision operating expenses, if you total up the chart
over the multi-year period that you provided, the OpEx looks higher than what you originally guided when you
originally put together the Vision program. Can you just give a little bit more detail as to what's happening over time
with the totality of that OpEx? Thanks very much.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Hey, Mike, I think that was three questions. But I'll take the first one. With respect to
smartphones. I'll do this with respect to CDMA. Postpaid CDMA.
80% of the devices we sold in the third quarter were smartphones. And that brings our CDMA postpaid base to 58% –
oh, 62%. Okay, that's right. Second quarter was 58%. Yes, that's right. Brings our percentage of our CDMA base up
from 58% to 62% at the end of the third quarter. And the 80% being CDMA or being smartphones on CDMA compares
to 76% in the previous quarter.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yes, in your second question, it is cannibalistic. So you're right. The iPhone will
definitely take a portion of our – people who would normally buy just an EVO or some other devices we have will be
buying an iPhone.
Your last question I think, Mike, the original guidance when we launched Network Vision was about an incremental $5
billion, which had been estimated at about a 50% split between operating and capital. And I think the realities are that
the split is a little more operating-oriented than cap.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Hodulik [UBS Securities].
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks. Two quick ones. First, you guys recently changed pricing on non-handset 4G
devices to include effectively usage-based pricing on those devices. Can you give us a sense of maybe why you did
that? Or the savings you expect to incur sort of going forward? Or maybe if you can't go that far, what percentage of
the traffic generated on the WiMAX network that this would affect?
And then following up on the last question about the potential Clearwire agreement, is that to say that – does that
change your plans in terms of how you're going to use 4G capacity that you guys outlined on the 7th? In terms of
building out LTE, using that organic capacity. And then sort of beyond 2013, using the Clearwire LTE capacity, if it's
ready at that point. Is that sort of what we're talking about in terms of moving towards an agreement with Clearwire?
Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, let me take the Clearwire piece first, and then I'll let Yijing perhaps clarify the first
question.
Our first choice, most economic choice will always be to utilize our own capacity first. But what this does is it allows
us to begin to offload – we can also, by the way, save capital though, so as soon as the – and the plan is right now – it
hasn't been announced officially and we're still working through it. But you're right to think of 2013 as the period of
time that Clearwire LTE capacity would begin to come on. That we would use Clearwire's LTE capacity to augment

our own network capacity going forward.
<A - Yijing Brentano>: And, John, could you ask the question again on the pricing? Just want to make sure we
understand the question regarding the changes you're talking about.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Sure. There were some press releases that you guys had changed some of the pricing in your
4G devices to move away from unlimited, and that there were going to be some usage caps imposed on some of these
4G devices – not handset devices. And I was wondering how that could potentially affect payments to Clearwire, if it
affected the usage that you are seeing?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Basically, because of usage patterns and economics, you're exactly right. We have maintained
unlimited pricing plans on handsets. Other devices like data cards tend to be much more heavy users of tonnage both
3G and 4G. So we did, for economic and because of the competitive environment, felt we could put usage caps on
those devices, and it would reduce, if you will, tonnage or usage, both on our network and on the Clearwire network.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Basically, I was trying to get to can you give us a sense of what percentage of that traffic
would be affected? Is it relatively de minimis or is it a meaningful amount of traffic that would – or savings that you
guys would incur?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, we're not going to disclose that particular – disclose that. But we will see what the
impact is over time.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: All right. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from David Barden [Bank of America Merrill Lynch].
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could.
Just maybe, Dan, to return to the Clearwire question. I think that the message that we're getting now is that for most of
the call, we've heard nothing about LightSquared. We signed an initial agreement with Clearwire, which is on the
critical path to signing a wholesale agreement. And that I think the headlines that are coming across is that Sprint needs
Clearwire now. And you need an agreement to make the network capacity work.
If you could kind of elaborate a little bit about that and how that view has changed at all from the Analyst Day, it would
be helpful. And also, what kind of financing you budgeted for in the slides that we saw as a function of that?
The second question, if I could, maybe for Steve, would just be with respect to kind of getting the organization ready
for Network Vision. We've now seen all the PowerPoint slides. We've set up all the expenses and the targets and the
goals.
But in terms of getting ready on the ground to touch 40,000 cell sites in a two-year timeframe – recognizing that
Verizon has taken three years to try to get their LTE network done, T-Mobile spent three years trying to get their AWS
network built, it's a lot to try to get done. Can you convince people that you're ready to get it all done in a two-year
period? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: David, let me take part one. There really has not been a change since October 7. Perhaps there
is in terms of people's understanding of what we meant to say. So, let me kind of clarify it that way.
What we talked about on the 7th is that our own spectrum resources, if we just basically used our own, would take us
into 2014 – of course, and assumed the continuation of, if you will, the existing agreements with Clearwire.
What we said was that if LightSquared – and our numbers did not include or assume that LightSquared capacity would
be used. But if we were to – if they were to get FCC approval, and if they were to get financing, and if this was to move
forward, it would probably add another year's worth of capacity growth onto our network.

Clearwire, if we were to reach agreement with Clearwire – again, we have not yet, but the MOU that I've described
today lays that foundation to do that – would add additional years, plural, to that capacity, as well.
So really nothing has changed. We just make progress. And again, if LightSquared comes online, that gives us another
potential use of capacity. But we're making very good progress we believe on the technical front with Clearwire. And
I'll leave it at that.
There was a part two, I think, for Steve.
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Good question on how we ramp up to be able to largely be done by the end of 2013.
I'd like to remind you that actually we've been going at it this year and – pardon me, I didn't have my mic on so I'll
repeat that. Good question about can we be done by the end of 2013, largely.
And we've been at this really for about a year. I think you need to look at the fact that we're using three vendors here,
plus really a fourth, which is the Ericsson-managed services. Each one of those have been ramping up over the last year
and putting their plans together, and we basically pay them for an outcome.
And so, in getting the tower companies' agreements together, getting the plans put together by each one of the vendors
– remember we've divided the country into three. And each – and we measure every month how many more people and
feet on the street they've got to do it. So we're feeling fairly confident. So are the OEMs at this point in time. Because
we've really trifurcated the number of companies that are building out.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Thanks, Steve. If I could just quick follow up, Dan, on that Clearwire comment. Joe, what is
in the financing slide that you put out there for the potential for a new big financial relationship with Clearwire?
Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Well, actually we haven't announced the financial relationship. We announced an
engineering and cooperation relationship on LTE. So, their deployment of LTE will come off of their capital
expenditures and not ours.
So the numbers we presented in regards to the financing and stuff is for the business case that we presented to you. If
there's stuff to announce in the future, we will. But we're very, very excited what we announced today with Clearwire
in regards to helping our spectrum needs.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Got it. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin [Credit Suisse].
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks. So, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the iPhone impact?
Joe, your comment was that the incremental subsidy piece is $200 relative to a regular smartphone. When I look at that
$600 million drag to EBITDA in 4Q, it seems like either the volumes you're anticipating are extremely large – well
above the million that I think that most people had in their models – or there must be some other costs in addition to
just subsidy costs. Significant other costs that are going in there. And I'm wondering if you can give some more color
on that and let us know whether any of it is one time in nature? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: This is Dan. It's volume driven. Customers out there are choosing Sprint versus other carriers
at a higher percentage than we would have expected, or at least that we had originally planned and I think that some
other people thought. And the 4S is also a hotter device than a lot of people anticipated it would be.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: So that million subscriber estimate everybody has is way too low?
<A>: Yes.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Yes.

Your next question comes from David Dixon [FBR Capital Markets].
<Q - David M. Dixon>: Thanks very much, and good morning. Joe, you talked about financing flexibility with vendor
financing of between $1 billion to $3 billion. Wondered if you could talk about how those conversations are going?
And any insights on rates there? And whether there's any flexibility to move higher than $3 billion, if you so choose, as
we move forward?
And secondly, a question for Dan. Dan, you mentioned decisions that you've made in the marketplace impacting your
unlimited message. Verizon here at 4G World talked a bit about early signs of a material reduction in the rate of data
traffic growth, after moving away from unlimited plans, particularly on data cards. And I wondered if you could talk a
little more about how your shift in strategy – the message is resonating with your customer base?
And just lastly, if I may, the iPhone has only been out for a couple weeks. I appreciate that. What are seeing in terms of
network throughput performance? And how has it reshaped your device demand from a 4G versus 3G perspective?
Thanks very much.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: I'll take the question about the message. Actually, the message hasn't changed. In fact, if
anything it's become more focused around unlimited. We are now the only unlimited player in smartphones. And that is
the advertising and the message that you see. That, of course, dominates the volume in terms of numbers, so the
unlimited is very much a part of our core smartphone strategy. It is very much a part of our marketing strategy. It is our
main message, so the message really hasn't changed from that perspective.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Great. Let me take the vendor-financing question. If you recall, back when we launched
Network Vision and were bidding it out, we had five vendors give us up to $7 billion in vendor financing that we chose
not to take. Obviously, we eliminated two of the vendors but even though we had approved vendor financing, we
decided not to take it at that time. So, we're basically in the process of reapplying. We feel very good about the
conversations to date. Where the ultimate number comes out, yet to see, it's still too early on but we've had good talks
to date and we'll see where that goes.
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Hey, David, this is Steve. Your question on the iPhone and the usage on the
networks. For one thing, it is a 3G, so it will use our 3G network, unlike our dual-mode that we share between the 4G
network and 3G right now. The other thing is, as expected the iPhone is quite efficient in comparison to other devices
and if you recall on October 7, we talked about things like Wi-Fi offloading and optimization of applications and
content, Apple has had a lot of experience in that over the years and we are seeing the benefits of that in the data usage
in this short period of time but it's been living up to our expectations.
<Q - David M. Dixon>: Right. So, just to clarify, the reports that we've seen in the blogs regarding throughput are
perhaps more anecdotal than across-the-board in terms of throughput?
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Yes. We're very happy with the performance but like any other new device on the
network, we're working with Apple in this case because we want to optimize as we had to in previous devices, you
want to optimize, but we're getting the kind of throughput that we expected.
<Q - David M. Dixon>: And just on the – how it's reshaped device demand from the 4G versus 3G perspective, have
you seen more of a pull to the iPhone from 4G or has it been through the existing 3G base?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: This is Dan. The iPhone is attracting customers across the smartphone base, so whether it was
a 3G smartphone or a dual-mode, it's just an extremely attractive device and so it is, if you will, taking some share from
what would have been, we'll call it, 3G smartphones, sans iPhone and dual-mode devices, both.

Your next question comes from Mike McCormack [Nomura Securities].
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Joe, can you just give us a sense for sort of looking through those slides
on use of cash over the next several years, how flexible Network Vision spending is and how flexible the iPhone
contract is? Just can you sort of put it in the context of – one of your competitors that's had the iPhone now for several
years and looking at their margin profile from '08 through 2011, EBITDA service margin has not changed at all, it's
been flat at 40% and I think you're predicating your story here on obviously an improving margin story. So, inherent in
that, maybe talk about what your expectations are for iPhone refresh because that seems to be the biggest issue that
your competitor's been facing.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: This is Dan. When you say iPhone refresh, are you talking about the next iPhone device?
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Yes. Just sort of looking at it over the years, every time we have the next version that
comes out, margins tend to take a pretty big hit.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: We have, if you will, baked that into our multiyear analyses and of course one of the reasons
we changed our Loyalty program and Premier program was, if you will, to grant dual upgrades less often but if you
bake all of that in and the churn characteristics, that's where you get the net present value improvement over time.
So, if you also look back at the slides that Joe went through, if you will, in terms of the – there's, if you will, there's
costs and that has to do with new gross adds as well as upgrades. And then you have, if you will, the operating benefits
that you get from those customers both in using less of your network costs and staying with you longer as being the
benefit and it takes a few years because of the, if you will, combination of new customers and upgrades that you get for
a period of time before the benefits outweigh it.
So, that is all very much baked into the numbers and we have made assumptions with respect to how often customers
will upgrade with respect to the new iPhone devices that come out periodically. Steve, you want to take the other part?
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Yes. Hi, Mike. Steve...
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hi, Steve.
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: The question on flexibility, I think that right now, we're looking at the fairly
aggressive plan to complete Network Vision but as Joe carries the purse strings for the company if he needs me to
delay spending, we have that flexibility to do so.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Yijing Brentano>: April, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Your last question comes from Simon Flannery [Morgan Stanley].
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. You talked about the smartphone as a percentage of the base
being up to 62% now. Can you share with us what – given the strong ARPU performance – what percent of your
smartphones are now on with the $10 price increase? And then, Joe, you also talked about a rise in involuntary churn.
Perhaps you could just expand on that? Is that macro driven, is this something we might see again in Q4? Do you think
this was more of a one-time bad debt write-off to the aging of the receivables? Thanks.

<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Hey, Simon, this is Dan. We don't disclose the percentage of the smartphone customers who
are on the $10 plan which basically is any time you upgrade a device or a new customer, instead of paying $69.99 a
month for unlimited pays $79. But the good news is we still have a lot of potential upside in terms of we still have
pretty good sized percentage of our smartphone users who are not paying the extra $10 and so that will be a tailwind to
our ARPU going forward.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Simon, in regards to your last question – in regards to your last question, Simon, it really
is more an isolated thing not a macro issue. It will have a little tail over into the fourth quarter and that's really it.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah.
