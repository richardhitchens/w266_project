Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our second quarter results and then
take questions.
Net revenues in the second quarter were $7.3 billion and net earnings were $1.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share were
$1.85, and our annualized return on common equity was 6.1%. Year-to-date, excluding the impact of our $1.6 billion
preferred dividend associated with our repayment of the Berkshire Hathaway preferred stock in the first quarter, our
annualized return on common equity was 10.2%. Including the impact, our annualized return on common equity was
8%.
The second quarter was dominated by concerns surrounding the state of the global economy. These concerns emanated
from a variety of regions around the world, including Europe, the United States and China. While many of these
concerns have been around for quite some time, further deterioration in economic data coupled with the passage of time
without resolution of a significant number of political issues has led to heightened concerns among market participants.
Sovereign risk in a number of smaller European member states increased, with a particular focus on developments in
Greece. Concerns remain for other countries within Europe and the potential negative economic impact on financial
institutions with credit exposure to these sovereigns. Within the U.S., concerns have centered on the political debate on
raising the debt ceiling, the growing budget deficit, stubbornly high unemployment and potential further pressure on
U.S. housing prices. Finally, there's also been greater focus on China given the important role it plays in the broader
global economy.
The complexity surrounding the interplay of these various economic considerations has created tremendous uncertainty
about the state of the world's economy and among other things has resulted in limited conviction among market
participants. As a result of this uncertainty, many of our investing clients have significantly reduced their risk appetite
and thus activity levels generally declined. Despite these market uncertainties, we remain focused on serving the needs
of our leading global client base.
Within Investment Banking, we continue to focus on providing our clients with world-class strategic advice and
superior financing execution, which is reflected in our Investment Banking lead table standings. Year to date, we
ranked first in announced M&A globally. We're also ranked first in equity and equity-related common stock offerings
and IPOs globally year to date.
We understand that our clients value consistent high-quality service and excellent execution. Effectively meeting their
needs for advice, financing, risk capital and liquidity as well as asset management solutions is essential to our
long-term performance.
In the context of more difficult economic and financial conditions the firm launched an internal initiative to identify
areas where we can operate more efficiently. Thus far, we've targeted approximately $1.2 billion in run rate
compensation and in non-compensation reductions. We're in the process of implementing the cost reduction efforts and
expect to complete them before year-end.
I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, up
14% from first quarter results. Second quarter Advisory revenues were $637 million, up 78% from the first quarter,
reflecting a number of significant deal closings. We advised on a number of important transactions that were
announced during the quarter, including Johnson & Johnson's $21.3 billion acquisition of Synthes, Skype's $8.5 billion
sale to Microsoft and Diversey's $4.3 billion sale to Sealed Air Corporation.
We were also advisor on a number of significant closed transactions including Pride International's $8.7 billion merger
with Ensco, Beckman Coulter's $6.8 billion sale to Danaher and Equinox Minerals' $7.7 billion sale to Barrick Gold.
Second quarter underwriting net revenues were $811 million, down 11% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of
$378 million were down 11% from the first quarter, reflecting more challenging equity markets. Debt underwriting
revenues decreased 11% to $433 million, reflecting lower investment grade and CMBS issuance volumes partially

offset by strong leverage finance activity.
During the second quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including Prada's $2.5
billion IPO, Shanghai Pharmaceutical's $2.1 billion IPO and Wal-Mart's $5 billion long-term debt offering. Our
Investment Banking backlog was unchanged compared to the end of the first quarter.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and
fees and security services, net revenues of $3.5 billion were down 47% from the first quarter as continued macro
concerns created more challenging market and operating conditions. The effect of these macro concerns is more
pronounced within our Asian and European FICC franchises, which have historically been significant contributors to
the Global franchise. Further, during the quarter, we were not as effective at navigating intra-quarter swings in market
prices and liquidity as we have been historically. Consequently, we generated lower revenues from managing client
originated market-making inventory particularly in our largely U.S.-based Mortgages businesses and our Global
Commodities and Credit businesses.
In this environment, we were particularly prudent in the management of our market risk. This is highlighted by the fact
that VAR in the second quarter was at its lowest quarterly level since the third quarter of 2006.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter, down significantly from the first quarter as
every major business generated lower but positive revenues. Our Commodities business was negatively impacted by
asset price fluctuations. Credit experienced a more challenging environment for hedging and inventory management.
Our mortgages results reflected the negative impact of asset price declines, reduced market liquidity and created
divergence between our cash positions and corresponding hedges, particularly in non-agency products. Interest rates
and FX were also down but to a lesser extent. In equities, which includes equities client executions, commissions and
fees and securities services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down 17% sequentially.
Equities client execution revenues were down 36% to $623 million, reflecting lower net revenues within our Cash and
Derivatives businesses but declining volumes and lower volatility impacted results. Commissions and fees were $861
million, down 11% from the first quarter on lower market volumes. Security services net revenues of $432 million were
16% higher sequentially, due to the seasonally stronger client activity.
Turning to risk, average daily value at risk in the second quarter was $101 million, down 11% relative to the first
quarter. Our value at risk remains at levels we have not experienced in a number of years.
Now a review of Investing and Lending, which produced net revenues of $1 billion in the second quarter. The firm's
investing and lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loan equity
securities, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds as
well as lending activities.
Our investment in ICBC produced a $176 million loss in the quarter. Other equity investments generated net revenues
of $686 million across our portfolio of funds and direct investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were
$200 million principally from interest income. Other revenues of $334 million were primarily driven by operating
revenues from our consolidated investment equities.
In investment management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion consist with first quarter results.
Management and other fees were 3% higher sequentially at $1.1 billion. During the second quarter, assets under
management increased $4 billion to $844 billion due to market appreciation and fixed income assets.
Turning to expenses, compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year
equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenue ratio of
44% for the second quarter of 2011, a ratio consistent with the compensation accrual in the first quarter. Second quarter
non-compensation expenses were $2.5 billion, 6% lower than the first quarter, which included impairment charges of
approximately $220 million related to assets classified as held for sale, primarily related to Litton Loan Servicing.
Adjusting for the $220 million impairment charge and provisions for litigation, non-compensation expenses in the
second quarter of 2011 were essentially unchanged.

Total staff at the end of the second quarter was approximately 35,500, relatively unchanged from the end of the first
quarter. Our effective tax rate was 32.6% for the second quarter. As a management team, while we were disappointed
in the performance of certain businesses this quarter, we're committed to creating long-term shareholder value. We
believe that the core drivers of long-term value continue to be the strength of our global client franchise and our
employees' tireless commitment to serving that franchise. While the current environment presents a number of
challenges, we continue to invest in expanding our global platform. Our efforts to drive greater efficiencies within our
operations are an important component supporting this growth plan.
We remain focused on generating superior returns for our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.8
million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. Furthermore, our board of directors has authorized a 75
million share increase in our share repurchase program, bringing our total authorization to approximately 91 million
shares.
In this ongoing challenging environment, we'll continue to balance near-term uncertainties with longer-term strategic
goals. We will balance holding more capital liquidity to protect against the current macro uncertainties with our
commitment to providing strong relative returns to our shareholders. We'll invest for growth in attractive regions and
businesses and reduce our commitment to businesses experiencing lower client demand. This adaptability is at the heart
of our culture. While the outlook remains uncertain, we'll continue to respond accordingly with the goal of positioning
the firm to best serve our clients and shareholders.
With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today. And I'm now happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: So, if we can talk FICC for a little bit, I think that's where some of the focus is going to
obviously come. And if you can give us a little more color towards kind of breaking down what is just bad positioning,
bad trading quarter, weak environment versus – is there something bigger going on that's impacting the Goldman
franchise. Because you talked about lower VAR. So, it sounds like you purposely took down risk. But can we just talk
through FICC a little?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Okay. I'll try. So, I said a lot of this in what I started with, but let me just give you a little bit
more, Glenn. We don't believe there was really any impairment of our franchise at all during the quarter. But I don't
want to sugarcoat things. I think we under-performed during the quarter. So, just a little more on that. Every business as
I mentioned had positive revenue. So, it's not like there were big losses somewhere. Volumes were lower, but they
weren't a lot lower, which is why I tell you that we don't think that there's any impairment of our franchise. We have
certain – it's harder to figure out volumes in some of the FICC businesses than it is in Investment Banking where you
have lead tables, volume numbers. But we have several measures that we use. And I would tell you that they were
down but down modestly.
Given some of the macro uncertainties that we saw, many of which were driven by political rather than economic
issues, so they're much harder to analyze certainly for us, we didn't manage the market making inventory that we get as
well as we have in the past. That was true across the franchise. It was especially true in Europe and Asia where many of
these macro political concerns existed. As a result, we retained very, very little risk. You saw what our VAR numbers
were on average across the quarter. And I will tell you at the end of the quarter they were even lower than they were
throughout the quarter.

In hindsight, given the way things unfolded, that may have been a bad decision. It may not have been a bad decision.
We don't know and we may not know for a while. But it's a decision that we made. And again given that, we, without
sugarcoating, we did under-perform during the quarter. You know it's one of the very, very few quarters since our IPO
that we've under-performed in FICC, but we did. We're disappointed in the results. We're glad that it's really nothing to
do with our franchise and we're very focused on doing better in the future.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I'm going to take my head in my hands on this one and ask – with risk levels, macro uncertainty
still out there in risk, still low at the end of the quarter, are we expected that this is a current environment run rate or do
we get a little bit of a reprieve as we move forward from a tough second quarter?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I don't think there's such a thing as a run rate in FICC. I don't think there's anything normal.
Look, we're 11 days into this quarter. So, it's very hard to make assumptions on what's going to happen going forward.
Let me give you all the caveats. A, it's 11 days; B, it's the third quarter, which includes August every year. You can't
avoid it. It will this year. C, there are other things besides our trading business and we have obviously a position –
ICBC, other principal investments, you've seen what's going on in the equity markets. That's not so good. That comes
and goes. But as far as trading goes, while our risks remain quite low right now, it feels a little better so far in the
second quarter. Let me again caveat that it's only 11 days into the quarter. But so far it feels a little better.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: All right. The $1.2 billion that you identified earlier in the call, non-comp and comp, can you
give us any thought on how much it's weighted toward non-comp and comp? Because I feel like – and what is outside
the normal managing the ratio to the revenue environment? In other words, it seems like you're identifying that $1.2
billion as an above and beyond reaction to the environment, regulation, things like that.
<A - David A. Viniar>: So, a couple things. First, just to be clear, that's $1.2 billion of run rate. You're not going to see
a $1.2 billion reduction in this year's expenses. A lot of that we'll do this year but you won't see the expenses until next
year. Second of all, that does not include, when I say comp and non-comp, that does not include lowering people's
compensation. So, that comp would be a reduction of heads, which would therefore be a reduction in compensation.
Look, we think that given A, some of the regulatory uncertainties, but, B, some of the economic uncertainties, it looks
like the environment's going be somewhat slower for the foreseeable future. And so we decided it made sense at this
point to cut some level of expenses to be more efficient.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Appreciate it. And the last one is on Volcker timing. Do you expect the draft in the near future –
I'm not sure you can comment on your back and forth, but just thoughts on timing.
<A - David A. Viniar>: We don't know any more than you know about when things are going to come out. We think
that there will be drafts sometime this year, but exactly when we're not sure.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi, good morning, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Just revisiting the cost savings, could you just give a sense for how you arrived at that $1.2
billion target? Does that get you to a specific level of expenses or returns across the franchise that you want to – or that
you're comfortable with?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I would tell you, A, it's more of an art than a science. It was done business by business. We
looked at what we thought the opportunity set was going to be going forward where both – business by business, region

by region. So, it's not – while it is somewhat across the board it's not exactly the same everywhere. And we tried to say
what do we think the opportunity is going to be and how many people do we need and what do we need to cut back in
expenses to have appropriate returns for shareholders.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Thanks. And then on this quarter's investing and lending results, fairly positive in a
more challenging environment for asset prices. So, could you give us a flavor for maybe realizations versus write-ups
this quarter, David?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yes. I think that's one of the things that really drove the equity number. There were a fair
number of realizations within there. The markets were down so obviously the mark-to-market on public securities was
actually a negative in the quarter. But on the private securities were up a fair amount. And of what was up, probably
60% was realized.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Thanks. And then finally for me, your share repurchase activity accelerated to $1.5
billion this quarter. Is that more a function of stock price or the approval of the Fed's capital plan last quarter? I'm just
trying to gauge looking forward, clearly a strong confident sounding message with respect to the reload, but how
aggressive you all want to be in terms of the share repurchase. Thanks.
<A - David A. Viniar>: We want to do two things: A, as you know we want to keep our share count at least flat. No
higher than flat from our equity-based compensation. And we do try and adjust it a little bit based on where we think
the share price is. And we have very, very strong capital ratios. We continue to generate capital through earnings as
well as through compensation. And so we want to be prudent. We're probably going to keep high-end capital ratios for
a while. Higher than most others because we think it makes sense in this market. But we're going to also be prudent in
returning capital to shareholders as we think it's okay.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Just a clarification on that maybe, David. When you say high-end, I know you've
given your Basel III guidance without a lot of – very conservatively at near 8% last quarter. When you say high-end do
you mean kind of near 8% Basel III or are you thinking about a Basel I figure? Or neither?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yes and yes. Right now we're under Basel I and so we're going to have to obviously pay
attention to that and we will continue to keep as I said, high-end capital ratios, without being more specific. But we're
also looking out towards Basel III because we know that's coming.
Whereas we've told you, we'd be at around 8% if we were looking at it today. If you look out just a couple years before
many of the requirements kick in, and you make some assumptions on consensus earnings and just passive mitigation
with things just rolling off without us doing anything, you get to like 11%. Close to 11% numbers. And so, those are
pretty high-end. I wouldn't expect we'll run things much higher than that.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Thanks a lot, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: You talked a fair amount about the volatility, the results in FICC, particularly I guess in
commodities and mortgage. It does seem to be – and European credit – it does seem to be more than usual. You've
always had excellent risk management but I just wonder if after this bout of revenue volatility, you're looking at
making any specific changes in the risk management regime.

<A - David A. Viniar>: No, I wouldn't say so. I don't actually think it was a risk management issue. Like I said, it's not
like we had losses. Maybe we made a bad decision in taking too little risk. I don't know. I'm not sure we would do
anything differently with hindsight. One of the difficult things for us, if you look across the volatility in the markets, a
lot of it was driven by political rather than economic issues. That's an environment that's very hard to analyze, very
difficult for us, and so in that type of environment, we took risk down a fair amount and therefore again, not to pull
punches, we under-performed.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay. So, I hear you. Would you be able to update us a little bit on your exposure to
the five European countries everybody's worried about? And maybe a gross and a net number? And talk about how do
you hedge down to the net?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I can give you now kind of general as opposed to all the specifics you asked for. On a net
basis, Guy, our exposure is actually pretty modest. We have, I would say, total for the five that I think you're referring
to, between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of exposure. It's really pretty modest.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And in terms of how you get down from whatever the gross number is to the net, obviously
the question that people have in the wake of what happened with the mortgage problem here in the U.S. is that
sometimes your hedges, not yours in particular, but hedges don't work as well as people would have wanted and you
get wrong way risk, counterparties that get into trouble, et cetera. How do you get comfort with where you are on the
sovereign stuff?
<A - David A. Viniar>: How about if we follow up with you on that offline in a little bit?
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar>: We'll give you some more detail. But I wouldn't – don't take that to mean anything. Our gross
exposure is not all that big either. We've been pretty cautious in that region for a while, but the net is really modest.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Fair enough. And then just in terms of head count numbers, as you pointed out, you're
flat versus last quarter. You do have some cost reduction targets, but can you give a sense as to what we should expect
in terms of the kind of evolution of your head count over the remainder of the year and into next year?
<A - David A. Viniar>: As we sit here now, and, of course, as you know, things can change, the head count reductions
that would be associated with that $1.2 billion I talked about would be in the range of 1,000 people globally. And that
would come over the course of this year and then we'll see next year.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. But presumably we could then actually see a little bit of a boost still in the third
quarter because of normal recruiting and stuff?
<A - David A. Viniar>: No, I took that into account in the number I gave you.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay. Just a final question. I think last quarter you helped us understand what the
ROE impact was of maintaining the kind of global core excess that you have. Can you give us a sense for what the
liquidity drag is at this point?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I actually don't know that number offhand, Guy. I didn't calculate it, but we'll get it to you.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Good. So, just to come back to the capital piece here, in terms of net buyback, and I
think you partially answered this, but given that you've got leading capital ratios among your peers, and some of them
seem to have authorizations to do more meaningful net buybacks, my question is, is it fair to say that you just haven't
asked to do that as opposed to not having been given authorization to do it?
And also as you roll out to that 11, call it 11 percentage number under Basel III, if your minimum is 9%, would you
expect to run at a couple hundred basis point premium to that? Because I thought something like more like a hundred is
probably where you'd end up.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Let me answer the second question first, which is no. We would not expect to run at a 200
basis point excess over whatever our minimum is. That would be higher. We would expect to run lower than that. I
think you're right. Somewhere in the 100ish basis point range depending on what the minimum is might be where we
would be.
And on the first one, look, without giving too much detail on our conversation with the Fed, we're very comfortable
that we have the authorizations we would like to have for the remainder of this year. As you know, the Fed has
authorized the capital plan for this year. Next year is next year. We think we can buy back what makes sense for us to
buy back over the rest of the course of this year. We will calibrate that based on performance, share price, the
environment and a bunch of other things, but I think we'll be reasonable in our buybacks.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. But then this gets to the other part of the question which is how do you think
about running at capital levels, rolling forward to Basel III relevant to the implementation days? Because JPMorgan
just said that they'll do that when it's required years from now. It sounds like you're basically there probably at your
minimum today or close to it. Would you run at or above the eventual required level as opposed to say buying stock
back at one times book today?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Well, look, we will certainly buy some stock back at one times book today. That's going to
make sense for us to do in this environment. We will probably want – we think the market is going to look at capital
requirements and when the capital requirements are known then we're going to expect people to be there pretty quickly.
We'll probably get there pretty quickly but that doesn't mean we're going to have to run above it.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And then two more quick questions. On the hedging that you talked about in
terms some of the underperformance in FICC, on the mortgage piece, I thought that the derivatives under-performed –
went down more than cash kind of during that falloff.
<A - David A. Viniar>: No.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: I would have thought it would have been a better hedge outcome for you if you
assured that.
<A - David A. Viniar>: No, I think what you saw really across all credit products was that cash declined more than
derivatives.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. Okay. And then the last question, in terms of your expense review, does that
have any impact on how you're thinking about growing out your Emerging Markets business?
<A - David A. Viniar>: No.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: That's where a lot of the hiring has been.
<A - David A. Viniar>: No.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. That continues as...
<A - David A. Viniar>: No. That is a long-term investment and we know it and we continue to be very committed to
that.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Thanks, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Just on the – you announced the expense initiatives but with the challenging environment
kind of going on over a year, you've got fairly challenging capital market conditions, the macro issues, you mentioned
them, whether it's Europe, the U.S., economic growth pretty weak. And then the regulatory changes pressuring certain
businesses, even some that may otherwise not fall under some of the increased regulation.
I guess are there any businesses or how long do you wait until – instead of just expense initiatives, do you look at any
of the businesses that may be better off either being spun off or restructured to compete with some of the pure play,
whether it's asset managers, alternative managers, private equity firms, just any sense on that?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We've talked before. The two businesses we had that we knew we were not going be able to
operate under the Volcker rules, those being two prop businesses, GSPS and Global Macro Prop, we've shut those
down. There's no other business that we think we have that we won't be able to operate. Some will have to be smaller.
Some will have to be different. In our Merchant Banking business we know that we won't be able to have more than
3% equity in any of the private equity funds. We still think that's going be a really good business for Goldman Sachs.
We think it's going to be important for our clients to be able to invest alongside of us.
We think our franchise will still be able to find really good opportunities and we think earning fees in overrides on that
will be good for the firm. And so that's probably the next business that will be most affected. So, no, we don't think it
will be better in someone else's hands. We're still pretty optimistic about that now, subject to whatever the final rules
are. We will continue to evaluate things as the rules come out and if we think differently then we'll take action. But
right now we don't think that.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Okay. And then as you've had more time to analyze each business, can you give any update
on risk-weighted asset mitigation opportunities there? And then as well as any areas where you have seen or could
possibly see re-pricing in the industry to aid returns?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, I think that we continue to go through the risk mitigation. We still are several years
away from any of those things having to happen. And so we're not really going to take actions now because it wouldn't
make any sense. But we'll continue to analyze those and take actions that are appropriate and more importantly not do
things that are long dated that will have very high risk-weighted asset charges above and beyond what the returns could
warrant. I think the only places that you're really seeing re-pricing of things is in tranche credit. Anything that's
structured credit, which is the things that are most severely hit by the capital rules. You're seeing some adjustment for
pricing.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Okay. And last one just on the Investing and Lending business. You guys provide that
sensitivity in the Q. But do you have any color in terms of the portfolio percent that is public versus private? Just in
terms of trying to get a sense in the future. Obviously it's a challenge. But just the portion that's going to be more based
on either DCF models and kind of long-term views versus the public markets.
<A - David A. Viniar>: I do not have that with me now. Sorry.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

Next question come from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Yes. Hi, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Hi, Kian.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: A few questions. First of all, the staff number reductions, the net 1,000. Can you give us an
idea in what business segment we should think about potential staff reduction? As well as at what level? Is it more at
the junior level or more the senior level?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I'm actually glad you asked that question, Kian, because I should have mentioned it before.
The reason I mentioned the dollars first is because we're much more focused on the dollars that the savings will create
than the number of heads. And so businesses are actually looking to get to a dollar number. That's why gave you a
number like in the range of 1,000 heads because it could be somewhat more, could be somewhat less. We're still
working through exactly what it's going to be from a seniority level. But it's really more dollar focused than head
focused. And so it's going to be – the long way of saying it's going to be some more senior, some more junior people.
As far as businesses, as I said, I'm not going be very specific on which businesses. Not going to be a lot in the growth
markets because that continues to be a big strategic thrust for Goldman Sachs. And it is broad based but some
businesses more than others.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And switching to revenues. If I look at some of the competitors who have reported FICC
revenues, looking at a decline of 20%, 27%. Now in terms of run rate, would you argue that is a reasonable number if
you take out your trading related issues?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I do not believe there is such a thing as a run rate in FICC. I think it is – and we – you've heard
me say this before, I think it's a very dangerous thing when we had our highest quarter ever in the first quarter of 2009
and people said is this the new run rate? I said no, it's not a run rate.
When we had our lowest quarter before this quarter in the fourth quarter of last year and now this quarter, I would tell
you no, this is not a run rate. I think it is very sensitive to what the economic environment is, what the activity levels
are and what our clients are doing. And so I think that there is a run rate is a very dangerous thing.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: But if I take your second quarter numbers and I'm trying to find out what is kind of a clean
revenue number, and I look at some of your peers, which are down more around the 25% level relative to the first
quarter, and I assume that against your first quarter, wouldn't that be a good reasonable thing to do considering that's
reflective of the 16-some market to get an indication of what's kind of clean for you?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think you – if you're saying is that indication of what a definition of our underperformance in
the first quarter, and you can do that analysis and the numbers are right, to say that that's a good way to model going
forward, I just think you don't know.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay. And if I look at your return on equity, 8% in the first half, and it's fair to say that
normally the second half revenues are always more difficult than the first half, how should we think about your ROE
generation? And can you give us an indication of how we think about the ROE this year in particular considering also
the second quarter trading issue?
<A - David A. Viniar>: So, first just not to pick over this but in the first half you're correct. It was 8%. But obviously
the repayment of the Berkshire Hathaway Preferred was a really unusual thing. Without that, it would have been 10%. I
think our normal desire to get to 20%; I think it's going be very tough in this environment, very tough in this year. I'd
be surprised if we did that this year. It's very hard for me to target ROEs. Tell me what the economic environment's
going be and I can do a better job of telling you what it's going to be. But we just don't know what the economic
environment is going be the second half of this year.

<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: You adjust the comp? You go significantly low on the comp ratio?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Again, harder to have a lower comp ratio with lower revenues; it tends to go the other way.
But as you know and you've seen the last several years, we're very prudent with our compensation. We take the firm's
performance into account and if performance is lower, compensation's going to be lower.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisory Group.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Hi, Dave.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning, Meredith.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: I'm going to beat a dead horse a bit on the expenses and ask why the target of $1.2 billion is
so low. Is that the first swipe? Because that doesn't really move the needle so much.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Well, we hope it's not the first swipe because it's painful to do and we don't want to do this
more than once. It's based on our assessments of the opportunity set looking forward and how we need to size the firm
to take advantage of those. And as I said...
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar>: It's not a science but more of an art.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay. A lot of discussion has gone on this quarter about how total comp is less variable in
the industry than it's ever been. And a lot of that was driven by the salary adjustments post U.K. bonus tax when
salaries were re-rated up. Do you think it's possible for the industry then to re-rate those salaries back down? And then
on the non-comp side, how much of your non-comp is tied to head count?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Okay. So, I think we shouldn't overplay that first point. I think it is true that salaries have gone
up. I know they have at Goldman Sachs, probably other places, too. In the context of the percentage of our
compensation that is salaries, it's a minor difference versus what it used to be. So, I think our ability to manage our
compensation expense is still quite high.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar>: I'll leave it at that. What was the second question, Meredith?
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: The non-comp is...
<A - David A. Viniar>: Oh, I'm sorry.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Persistently high. How much of that is...
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, I think there is actually a fair amount of non-comp that is related to heads. But the
second biggest expense after compensation is really a step function expense because it's occupancy. And you have a
building or you don't have a building. Most of our buildings are big buildings and so if we cut some heads in New
York, that wouldn't cut our occupancy expense. There's lots of other non-comp expenses like travel and telecom and
market data and all kinds of things like that that go with head count, but one of the biggest expenses does not.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay. My final question is a strategic question around your Asset Management business.
It's been fine but it hasn't been a shining star. It would seem now that would be a business that you would gravitate
towards maximizing every potential profit opportunity, every potential growth option. What are you doing in that area?

Private Wealth business within Asset Management is a really, really important asset gathering business and a really,
really important business. So, we think, look, it's one of the few businesses we know. We're not the leader in that

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yes. I want to talk a bit about the share purchase reauthorization increase. And first of all,
did I hear you correct to say that the 90.8 million shares is for this fiscal year? Or for 2011? Or does it...
<A - David A. Viniar>: No, that's the total authorization that we have now from the Board. From our Board's
authorization; that's not the Fed's authorization; that's our Board's authorization. That's the total that we can buy back
over time.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. So, there's no specific time limit?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Correct.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. Then philosophically, do you view share repurchases as being limited by the amount
of earnings that you generate in a period, meaning the buybacks would be less than you generate? Or could you
imagine that in a world where your stock price is abnormally low compared to historical trading ranges at tangible book
that you would buy back more capital than you earn in a period?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yes, I could – we could do that. I could imagine we would do that. We're not terribly anxious
to decrease our capital and I don't think we would do it dramatically, but yes, in an environment exactly like you
described, I think we absolutely could and very well might buy back more than we earned in a quarter.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. If I can just pull the lens back, why did you take so much less risk this quarter? Why did you
bring bar in so much? I'm guessing it's due to the economic uncertainty, but was it also due to some of the regulatory
uncertainty?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Had nothing at all to do with regulatory uncertainty. It was the economic uncertainty and the
difficulty we had in managing the client-driven inventory that we had. And we just thought it was prudent given that
uncertainty and the fact that a lot of the uncertainty was caused by political factors that were really in our view beyond
analysis caused us to do it.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And can you compare or contrast the U.S. versus Europe versus Asia? When you had wider
spreads in the U.S. a couple years ago, you benefited. I'm assuming you had some wider spreads in Europe. I just
wonder if you benefited from there.

<A - David A. Viniar>: Part of the issue, for us at least, as I said, is that a lot of what was happening in the markets, at
least it felt to us were not driven by the underlying economic issues, but by political issues. Markets were moving based
on statements. That's very hard for us to analyze, and we found it hard to take advantage of.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Is that still the case? Because you say the first few days are going better in the third quarter.
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think there's still plenty of that out there. As I said before, our risk remains pretty low. But
the performance has been a little bit better. But please remember my caveats about it only being 10 days and things
could change.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then separately, how much capital would be freed up if you cleared through a
clearinghouse with your OTC derivative positions? Or at least how much capital is allocated to the OTC derivative
positions in Basel III terms?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Mike, I think the number is about $11 billion or $12 billion, but we'll come back to you to
confirm that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. So, that's how much you have allocated now?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yes.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Or in that range. And how much even as a percentage do you think you could free up if you go
through a clearinghouse? I mean is it a half? A quarter? A third?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It depends on what the rules are, what the capital charges are and how much we clear. So, I
don't know how to answer the question until we have more clarity on the rules.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: In the past, you implied it would be pretty significant, but you haven't put any numbers to that.

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Yes, good morning. I think this question's been sort of beaten to death a little bit, and I'm not
asking for a long answer, but in terms of the component of the FICC, the lower FICC revenue that you were seeing sort
of went above and beyond just the weak customer volume.
So, maybe beyond that 25% down from the first quarter. Could you give me a little more clarity? I think you were
saying on the one hand, we took off risk positions. We took VAR down on purpose. That had an additional negative
revenue impact. But were there actual – were there some actual inventory positioning losses that you absorbed above
and beyond that? Or could you just sort of give a little more color on that lower risk, lower VAR sort of portion of the
under-performance or potentially actually taking losses on the trading inventory? Thanks.
<A - David A. Viniar>: It's very hard to quantify. And again, I don't want to sugarcoat this and say, "Oh, you know, no
big deal. We just took risk down." We underperformed in the quarter. So, I don't want to sugarcoat it. Now, there were
reasons behind it, but we did, and I want to make sure you hear that. We did take risk down during the quarter. Hard to
quantify. If we had not taken risk down, what would our results have been? It's very, very hard to quantify because it
depends when and what and how. And it's impossible to go back and know that. I've mentioned every business had
positive revenues.

So, it's not – that doesn't mean that on any day we didn't have losses. We had loss days. You'll see that in the queue. It
doesn't mean that certain positions didn't go the wrong way. They did. But overall when you look over the quarter,
every business had positive revenues.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: So, David, is it fair to sort of say then that okay, the environment was tougher in that customer
volumes were less? That's number one. Number two, Goldman Sachs sort of went above and beyond what other peers
did in terms of reducing VAR and reducing their risk position. So, that's number two. But even in the midst of that, did
take at least some positioning losses, say in commodities or other areas on inventory because the hedging environment
was so difficult; that's number three. Are all those three things fair statements for the reason that the revenue is down
versus the first quarter on FICC?
<A - David A. Viniar>: The only thing I'll adjust a tiny bit to what you said, you compared our risk to others' risk. I
only know – I only really focused on ours. We took ours down. I couldn't say to you we took it down more than others
or less than others, but yes, we took ours down. You make that one adjustment; I think everything else you said is
correct.

Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hi. I just had a couple of questions. The first thing is I'm just trying to understand the
timing on how the shares move and the buyback or how you get obviously new shares for compensation. Is it – you're
saying you want to keep the shares flat. Does that mean that reduction is just a timing issue so we'll see new shares
coming in in the second half? And that was my first question.
My second question was on risk-weighted assets and your comment that you didn't feel the need to do mitigation now.
I'm just wondering what you're feeling about correlation because some of your peers are taking quite a lot of action on
their correlation trading books and seeing quite a lot of mitigation. I'm just wondering what your view is there.
And then lastly, I know we've really talked about FICC a lot, but is there a factor at all or is it relevant that the ABX
was so volatile towards the end of the quarter? Does it matter? Do you think there's a factor in terms of how people
may have interpreted the pricing towards the end of the quarter or not? Thanks.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Okay. Let me try and do that, but I may make you repeat your third question. Okay. On share
count, shares come in over the course of the year on compensation. I can't remember exactly how many, but over the
course of the second quarter, for example – we can get back to you, but some number of shares came into share count
during the second quarter. Those were part of our calculation of share repurchase during the second quarter.
The same thing will happen in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And it happens throughout the course of the
year. So, compensation shares, and we're happy to offline talk to you about how the accounting works on that, come in
over the course of the year, and we try and buy back at least that much so that we keep our share count each quarter
flat.
Second, on correlation, that's what I was talking about before with all kinds of structured credit and tranche credit are
probably the things that are affected most by the Basel rules. And what I would tell you there is there's just not as much
activity there as there has been in the past and we'll be probably less aggressive in doing new trades – in doing new
trades there. And can you repeat the third question on the ABX?
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Could I just come back to that correlation? But some banks seem to be saying they're
actually taking action to reduce their business significantly and take away legacy assets just to downsize it in advance.

<A - David A. Viniar>: I understand. I told you kind of what our thoughts were.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Okay. And then I'm just wondering about the volatility in the index and whether there's a
factor in terms of how one – because it moved so quickly, some of the pricing moved so quickly towards the end of the
quarter.
<A - David A. Viniar>: What I would say just a little differently, I think you saw a pretty precipitous decline in the
price of non-agency residential mortgages over the course of June. So, I think the ABX is just an indication of that, but
I think you did see prices decline in non-agency mortgages over the course of the latter part of the quarter.

European economies. In the first – at the end of the first quarter according to the regulatory data, you all had what
appears to be gross exposure to those five countries at about $10 billion, focused in two of those countries. At the end
of the second quarter was that "gross exposure" materially different?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I actually – not trying to not answer, I don't have that information with me. I know the net...
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar>: But I don't know the gross.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And a very small administrative question, what was the DVA amounts in the
trading numbers this quarter?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Oh. Sorry. It was less than $100 million. And it was probably 60%-ish, in fact, 40%-ish in
equity. Something in that range. It was less than $100 million. It was very small.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: And just pulling the plane up a little bit, do you have any comments related to what the
effect on your business might be from a downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit? And some of the comments that
Treasury Secretary Geithner made earlier this week seemed to suggest maybe a return to a more adversarial
relationship with the financial services sector. I'm just curious as to your thoughts about are we going back to a tougher
environment with DC?
<A - David A. Viniar>: First of all, I'm not going to make a lot of comments on what would happen if there was a
downgrade of the U.S. I just hope that it gets resolved and I suspect that at some point it will get resolved. And no, I
don't see a tougher environment between financial services and DC. I think the regulatory community is trying to do
the right things and get things right and do things that are going to protect the financial system going forward.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. Thank you very much, David. I appreciate the difficulty of those questions.
<A - David A. Viniar>: No problem.
