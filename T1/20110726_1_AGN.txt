We'll then open the call up for questions and answers.
Also on the call and available during Q&A session are Siggi Olafsson, Executive Vice President of our Global
Generics division; Fred Wilkinson, Executive Vice President of Global Brands; Al Paonessa, Executive Vice President
and Chief Operating Officer of our Anda Distribution division; Bob Stewart, Executive Vice President of Global

Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and cannot be rebroadcast without
the company's express written consent. I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call management will
make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the
company. It's important to note that such statements about estimated or anticipated Watson results, prospects, or other
non-historical facts are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of existing trends and
information as of today's date. Watson disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements
except as expressly required by law.
Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections, depending on a number of factors
affecting the Watson business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including, but not limited to the Watson Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2011, and Form
10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Watson reached a new milestone in the
second quarter, reporting a record $1.1 billion in net revenues, a 24% increase over last year. While all three of our
business segments, Global Generics, Global Brands and Anda Distribution, performed well in the quarter, Global
Generics was particularly strong with revenue increasing 39%. The launch of the generic version of Concerta was the
main driver for revenue and earnings in the second quarter and generic Concerta will become even more significant in
the second half of 2011 and into next year. Non-GAAP net income also increased 24%, resulting in record earnings of
$1.01 per share. And adjusted EBITDA came in at $243 million, increasing 17%.
We achieved these results while continuing to invest heavily in R&D and sales and marketing. Spending for research
and development increased 30% as we continue to invest globally to grow our Global Generics and Global Brand
businesses. Spending on sales and marketing was up 26% and reflects our investment to grow sales internationally and
our commitment to grow our U.S. brand presence to our target audiences.
Now I would like to highlight a few of our accomplishments for the quarter. We launched generic Concerta in May and
generic substitution was faster than expected in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with a market share of
roughly 73%. Since the end of the quarter, market share has continued to increase and is now slightly above 75%.
Remember that Concerta does have seasonality associated with it, and therefore, we expect overall prescription trends
for the product to decline in the third quarter with a return to second quarter levels in the fourth quarter. Overall, we're
extremely pleased with the launch and we believe that generic Concerta will be a significant long-term driver of
Watson's profitability.
Also, we are very pleased that we completed the acquisition of Specifar Pharmaceuticals during the quarter. Specifar is
a profitable, successful company with a third-party development business and significant R&D, manufacturing and
regulatory expertise. Specifar has a strong portfolio of approved products and dossiers on file in over 36 countries. This
will provide Watson with more internally-manufactured products for our global markets, resulting in more competitive

product offerings and higher profitability for our international businesses over the long term.
The integration of Specifar is already underway. Our teams are making excellent progress and we have already seen
benefits in R&D, portfolio management and regulatory affairs. Specifar has also signed numerous additional business
agreements with third parties since the close of the acquisition, demonstrating the ability of this business to continue to
thrive as part of Watson.
In the U.S., we launched six new generic products and announced seven new patent challenges during the quarter.
Internationally, we launched 14 new products this quarter in Europe, and five new products in Canada, including
NEXT CHOICE, our emergency contraceptive product. We have more than 130 ANDAs on file in the U.S. with
approximately 34% of them either first-to-file or shared exclusive opportunities, and an additional 600 applications
internationally.
In our Global Brands business, we announced that the FDA accepted Columbia's new drug application for
PROCHIEVE for the prevention of pre-term birth and women with a short cervix. The PDUFA date is February 26,
2012. We also launched a new low estrogen oral contraceptive, Generess Fe. And shortly after the close of the quarter,
we expanded our brand pipeline through an exclusive licensing agreement with Antares to commercialize their topical
oxybutynin gel product in the U.S. and Canada. This licensing agreement is a great example of the ways we will look to
supplement our growing brand business portfolio.
Lastly, we continue to experience strong growth in RAPAFLO with sales up 15% quarter-over-quarter.
Finally, Watson remains in excellent financial condition with $234 million of cash and marketable securities at the end
of the quarter and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remains low at 1.4 times.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd who'll provide some additional color on the financial results.
R. Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul. I will now review our results on a consolidated and divisional basis. Net revenues for the second quarter
were $1.1 billion, an increase of 24% over the prior-year period, reflecting strong growth in product sales in both our
Global Generics and Global Brands divisions. Net revenues for Global Generics were $792 million, up 39% on a
year-over-year basis primarily due to the launch of generic Concerta.
Sales of extended release products, which include generic Concerta, were $380.1 million, up 138% year-over-year.
Sales of oral contraceptives were in line with the prior-year quarter at $96.3 million as sales of new products were
offset by erosion in our base OC franchise.
Ex U.S. net revenues were $119.2 million, compared to $110.5 million in the second quarter of last year. This increase
was due to the acquisition of Specifar. Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was 45.2%, 3.4 percentage
points lower than last year primarily as a result of the launch of generic Concerta. Under the terms of our agreement
with J&J, Watson's share of gross profit on this product will increase each quarter through the rest of 2011 and into
early 2012.
Moving to the Global Brands division, net revenues were $112.9 million, up 9%. This reflects a 20% increase in
product sales in the quarter driven by the addition of new products, including CRINONE and Generess Fe and higher
sales of RAPAFLO. Global Brands other revenue decreased $5.7 million to $20.9 million, as the prior-year period was
favorably impacted by the out-licensing of two legacy brand products. Global Brands adjusted gross margin was
77.8%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. We expect brand margins to remain close to this level for the rest of the year.
Finally, net revenues from our Anda Distribution division were $176.4 million, down 12% from the prior-year period
as a result of lower sales from third party product launches. Distribution adjusted gross margin for the quarter was
15.4%, down slightly from last year.

Turning now to operating expenses, consolidated R&D for the second quarter was $80.5 million, up 30%
year-over-year as a result of increased development spending in both our Generic and Brand businesses. For the full
year, we expect R&D spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million. On a non-GAAP
basis, R&D spending in the second half of 2011 will be slightly below first half levels.
SG&A for the second quarter was $187.5 million, an increase of $30.9 million. This includes $6 million in costs
associated with the acquisition of Specifar, which has been excluded from our non-GAAP results. This increase also
reflects higher brand selling costs in support of the launch of Generess Fe, and higher international SG&A in our
Global Generics business, which includes the addition of Specifar.
For the full year, we expect SG&A expenses on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $700 million to $725 million. On a
non-GAAP basis, we expect SG&A expenses to be slightly higher than second quarter levels, due to increased
international SG&A spending, with the addition of Specifar and higher legal costs associated with our generic product
development program.
Amortization for the second quarter was $74.6 million, up from $56.6 million in the first quarter reflecting accelerated
amortization of our Nulecit product rights due to unfavorable market conditions, amortization of newly launched
products within our international generics business, and amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the
acquisition of Specifar. For the full-year 2011, we now expect amortization expense to be approximately $320 million.
On a non-GAAP basis, our income tax rate was 35.7% in the second quarter, down from 37.5% in the prior-year
period. Our income tax rate on a GAAP basis was 45.2%. Our GAAP tax rate was negatively impacted by amortization
of foreign intangibles as the tax rate lower than U.S. rate, and by certain foreign laws as for which no tax benefit has
been recognized.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization and impairment charges, and other charges as detailed in Table 4
of our earnings press release, earnings for the second quarter were $1.01 per share, up 22% from $0.83 per share last
year. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.42 per share.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $243 million, a 17% increase. Cash flow from operations was $60
million for the quarter, and cash and marketable securities were $234 million at June 30. Cash flow for the second
quarter was impacted by $128 million in tax payments, consisting primarily of U.S. federal and state estimated tax
payments for the first and second quarter. Accounts receivable increased $292 million on a sequential quarter basis, due
primarily to the May launch of generic Concerta.
Payment terms on sales of our U.S. Generic products are approximately 65 days. Accounts receivable also increased as
a result of the acquisition of Specifar. Our DSO at the end of the second quarter was 69 days. We expect our DSO to
return to normal levels in the range of 55 to 60 days during the third quarter.
We remain well-positioned financially following the acquisition of Specifar with a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of
1.4 times. Our financial position affords Watson the ability to continue to capitalize on investment opportunities to
further grow our businesses.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2011 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. Now, I'd like to provide you with an update of our 2011 forecast, which includes the results from our
acquisition of Specifar Pharmaceuticals as of the acquisition date of May 25th. Our estimate for full-year net revenue is
now approximately $4.5 billion, up from $4.2 billion. We now expect our Global Generics segment revenue to increase
to between $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion.
Turning to the assumptions for our U.S. Generics business, we continue to assume we will see some additional
competition on our generic Toprol in the fourth quarter and our generic oral contraceptive franchise throughout the
remainder of 2011. Just as a reminder, our forecast does not assume any competition on generic Concerta in 2011. Our

U.S. Generics forecast includes contribution from new launches, the most significant of which will be generic Lipitor in
the fourth quarter.
On the Brand side of the business, we continue to expect net revenue between $445 million and $465 million for the
year and we now have removed any contribution from PROCHIEVE until 2012. With the Anda Distribution business,
we continue to anticipate revenue to be between $770 million and $800 million. Recall that Anda has experienced
fewer-than-expected third-party launches this year, and as a reminder, Anda's reported results do not include the sale of
Watson products.
We now expect adjusted EBITDA of between $1.025 billion and $1.075 billion, and we also increased non-GAAP EPS
to reflect the acquisition of Specifar and better-than-expected results for the remainder of our businesses. So, now, we
expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.25 and $4.50 per share. Specifar accounts for
approximately half of the increase in the non-GAAP earnings per share forecast.
While we typically do not provide a quarterly forecast, I would like to provide some directional guidance on the second
half of 2011. We expect the results in the third quarter to look somewhat similar to the second quarter, and the fourth
quarter to be higher than the third quarter, and be our most profitable quarter for the year.
In summary, today we reported strong financial results in the second quarter, producing record revenue and earnings
generation. And I am extremely confident Watson's businesses will continue to grow and evolve to meet or exceed our
growth objectives for 2011 and beyond.
As always, I would like to thank our employees for their hard work, and the role they play every day in the future
growth of our global businesses. With that, we'll open it up for questions.
Patricia Eisenhaur
All right. Thanks, Brandy. Can you open it up for Q&A?

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Boris with Citi.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Thomas Boris>: Hey, Paul. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the results.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Thanks.
<Q - John Thomas Boris>: First question. I think you disclosed the sustained release sales were about $380 million.
Can you potentially let us know what Concerta's contribution was within that overall amount?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, John, I would have been disappointed if nobody asked that question. But, as you know,
we don't separate out our product sales, so we're not going to be doing that here either. It was obviously very significant
contributor for the quarter.
<Q - John Thomas Boris>: Okay. And then, on gross margin, at least for the quarter, they were certainly under what
we were projecting. Obviously, Concerta had an impact there. Can you maybe just provide some color, either you or
Todd, on the progression of the gross margins as we move into the back half?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Yeah. The back half will be stronger in terms of Concerta contribution to the – or the impact of
Concerta sales in the second half will be less than the Q2 levels because we'll have an escalating gross margin
throughout this year and into early next year.

<Q - John Thomas Boris>: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then just lastly, on the Specifar revenue contribution,
can you just quantify what that was?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. I would say that was in the range of between $60 million and $70 million.
<Q - John Thomas Boris>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

<Q - John Thomas Boris>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. I have two questions. The first is with respect to Concerta inventory
stocking, could you frame that for us? On the one hand, it would seem logical that there would be a lot of inventory
stocking. But on the other hand, you appear to have a lower incentive to stock because cost of goods declines over time.
And, in addition, Paul I think you mentioned that Concerta sales would remain strong going forward, although there's
some seasonality to be aware of? And then second, Siggi, if you could please discuss organic growth ex U.S. in the
second quarter and prospects for organic growth in the second half of the year?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, so it's Siggi here. On the Concerta stocking, I think you all saw that the market
reacted quite well. Our generic penetration was quite strong and much stronger than was experienced with
ADDERALL XR. As we mentioned in the beginning, there is a part of it there the stocking that happens always when
you launch a new product and we probably experienced in the beginning a little bit more stocking due to the experience
that the market had with other ADHD products. But, overall, it's not unusual for a product like that. So, we saw some
stocking in the quarter, but we don't think it will affect our future quarter for Concerta going forward.
I think on the growth outside of the U.S., we – as we mentioned before, the international growth will mainly be through
the Specifar acquisition. Both the third party business is doing well, and the Greek business is also doing quite well.
We estimated that Europe would be flat this year. They remained on the revenue line. The main reason being that we've
been pruning quite a lot of the portfolio to focus on the bottom line in Europe. It's important thing to do once in a while
to look at the bottom line and see. So, we are aiming for a flat revenue line in Europe, but we have seen some revenue
growth in Canada on the other hand. So, I think mixed growth due to Specifar, flat due to Europe, but also some growth
in Canada this year.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: And just to clarify, the European growth you're talking about, you're saying flat, is that,
including Specifar flat or before Specifar Europe is flat?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Before Specifar. Specifar will give growth to Europe going forward.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
<A - Patricia Eisenhaur>: Thanks, David.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just had two questions. The first was on SG&A. Can you just
elaborate a little bit more on the SG&A trend for the remainder of the year? Seems like we had a decent step-up in the
expenses this quarter, I know you're adding Specifar, but can you just again talk a little bit about what's driving that
ongoing bump in SG&A going forward? And then the second question is with regards to, I guess, Specifar, the
integration. Can you just comment a little bit more on your priorities for business development in Europe right now?
Where are you guys looking? What is kind of your – kind of the top of the list in terms of where you'd like to go?
Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay. Well, let me start in the SG&A, and then I'll turn it over to Todd. One of the things that –
ways to grow your business, three ways to really grow our business as we look at it. We can do mergers and
acquisitions, do outside growth and drive growth that way. We can drive growth organically through higher R&D
spending, which we have done in the quarter, and which we will continue to do throughout the remainder of the year.
And the third thing we can do is invest in sales and marketing. And we have chosen to do that not just in the U.S. side
by putting more sales reps on the ground and continuing to drive the value of our brand franchise in the U.S., but we've
also spent more money in our international businesses to help drive sales in those markets. So, those – the general
reason for the increase in SG&A is that investment in the sales and marketing line across our company.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Sure. In terms of the guidance for the year, we've taken up our guidance $50 million for SG&A
for 2011. About half of that increase relates to Specifar and that includes the $6 million of costs we incurred in – the
acquisition cost we incurred in the second quarter. We'll probably – we'll have some modest amounts of additional
integration costs as we go into Q3 and Q4. The remaining $25 million increase in SG&A is the expansion of our Brand
business in Canada, as Paul mentioned, higher international generic spending. We've also got some slight increases in
distribution spending as well. So, that accounts for the remaining $25 million increase in guidance.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And then, Chris, I think you asked about sort of business development opportunities that we're
looking at. We continue to be very aggressive in what we're looking at. We're looking at things around the globe. The
challenge is finding the right kind of opportunity. Specifar is a great example of finding the right opportunity, and then
being in a position to act on it quickly. Thankfully, we're in a great position to be able to do that. But finding the right
opportunity always takes time. And we continue to look in Europe. We'll continue to look in South America; we've
looked in Canada, Australia, all of our markets to see if there's a way to increase our presence in those markets.
Probably the one exception is the U.S. Generics business. Our business is very strong here. Short of looking for
something, maybe a different delivery platform, there really isn't a lot of incentive for us to go out and acquire generic
companies in the U.S. But other than that everything else is on the table, including brand opportunities.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: And guys, just a quick follow-up to that. Does the Specifar acquisition, and the
capabilities, and the manufacturing you acquired with that company, does that change any of your priorities of what
you would look at in Europe, things that maybe were not as attractive before with Specifar now are a bit more
attractive? Or does that really not change anything?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I don't think it changes it very much. Specifar was a tactical acquisition to increase our
internally developed, our manufacturing products. Clearly, the value in all of – in-licensing is a big part of the
opportunity in Europe and everybody has every product, and the more products they manufacture, the more profitable
they are. And so, Specifar really went a long way in helping us achieve higher profitability within the countries that
we're operating. We'll continue to be very aggressive on the in-licensing front and that's a business development
function, but Specifar gives us that base. It also opens up the opportunity to be more commercial, move in maybe into
other markets because they have existing applications that would complement the applications that we have from the
Arrow acquisition in some markets that we're currently not commercializing. So, it does help us, but it doesn't change
our overall focus all that much.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thanks very much.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay. Thanks, Chris.

Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hey, Marc.
<Q - Marc Goodman MBA>: Yeah, Good morning. Could you give us an update on a couple of cases like the
Nexium patent case in Europe? What's happening there, and when you guys are going to start to monetize that? And
then, what are your thoughts on Lidoderm? Obviously there was a ruling there. And then on Mucinex, what's
happening with that one? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'll start and let David jump in and help me out here. On the generic Nexium in Europe,
we're just moving forward with the application. We hope to have Specifar get its approval by the end of the year or late
this year, in which case, assuming everything continues to go forward – and by the way that would be in France, I
believe, is the first market that we expect approval – we will launch. David, is there any other update on the patent
piece?
<A - David A. Buchen>: No. I think everybody is aware that the [inaudible] (27:43) patent was invalidated by the
EPO, and the latest on the trihydrate patent is just that the – there was a hearing on an injunction and request for
injunction by AstraZeneca was denied, two of the latest on the Esomeprazole front.
With respect to Lidoderm, we got a favorable Markman hearing. We like the claim interpretation, and so we will
continue to press that going forward. And then on Mucinex, the Court of Appeals ruled, as everybody I think saw, the
judgment was affirmed, and so we're just now waiting for the FDA to take action on our application, and it's been
pending for about 30 months.
<Q - Marc Goodman MBA>: So, Paul, does that mean that you're expecting Mucinex pretty soon? I mean, pending
30 months, that's even longer than the 25 or 26 months that's average these days.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I'm not sure what the average is anymore, but it may be more than 30 months on the average.
Unfortunately, Marc, it's – the hardest thing we do now is try to predict when approvals are going to come. And we're
working diligently to get that application approved.
<Q - Marc Goodman MBA>: And then, just back on Nexium for a sec, just to try to understand. So, it's approved in
France first, and then you launch in France, or is that for all of Europe?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Let me take it – it's Siggi here. So, we are doing it through a decentralized procedure,
and also, through a national procedure. Our strategy was first to launch in France, but then all over Europe in all the
European markets following the French launch.

Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Merrill Lynch.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Hi. Good morning. Just trying to straighten out some Concerta modeling stuff first. Paul, you
commented on prescriptions, and the seasonality of those, whereas Siggi, I think, talked about de-stocking not affecting
sales. So, could you just kind of straighten us out on what you expect for sales of Concerta directionally over the next
few quarters? We're going to go ahead and assume that all the growth from 1Q to 2Q and ER was Concerta.

You can cough twice if that's a good assumption.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, let's see if I can help you. I mean, on the seasonality, of course, the summertime kids take
a drug holiday in this category, so there is a general decline in total prescriptions.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Yeah.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: We probably will not be – our Concerta contribution won't be affected for two reasons. One,
we'll continue to grow our market share -
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Yeah.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And two, our royalty, our percentage of the gross profit increases -
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Yeah.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: So, our contribution from Concerta will be flat, roughly the same quarter-over-quarter, okay?
So, but total revenue from Concerta should be down second quarter – third quarter as to second quarter, and then back
up in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay. Fair enough. And then my other question, Paul, I was going to ask you to comment on
any specific impact to Watson on the Medco, Express deal that's at least proposed and at a higher level what you think
it means for the generics industry, if anything? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes. Well, as – first of all, both Express Scripts and Medco are good customers of ours, and we
certainly appreciate their business and we never like to see a customer go away. But, the combination of the two
account for about 3% of our revenue, 3% to 4% of our revenue. So, they're not a big contributor to our total revenue.
But, we'll look forward to working with the combined company going forward.
As to concerns, I think – I'm sure I'm not the only person to say this, I think we're all a little concerned as companies
get bigger and bigger that market power, and the leverage that they have is somewhat concerning. But on the other
hand, they can be even a better customer for us. So, I guess, we'll just have to wait and see what ultimately comes of
this. It'll be interesting to see what the FTC's position is on this merger.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Tim.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Hey, Paul. Maybe you could comment a little bit about the base business, ex-Concerta? How are
things holding up in Toprol XL, Micro-K? What sort of assumptions are you guys making for pricing in the U.S.
Generic business? Is it actually holding up better than you thought earlier this year?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. Well, on the base business, I mean, it continues to be strong. We continue to benefit
from some of the missteps of some of our competitors, and that has meant that our base business continues to perform
quite well.
Regarding sort of the big products, Metoprolol and Micro-K, and the like, we have seen a reduction in Micro-K as you
would expect as additional competition is on the horizon, and people are reacting – were reacting to the price in the
marketplace. But Metoprolol has been strong and remains strong. And basically on a quarter-over-quarter basis –
year-over-year basis, I think Metoprolol was even up again.
So – and then I think you asked about pricing. I guess, pricing on the base business, again, you've got to separate out
some of the outliers, but like Micro-K, and the like, but if you separate those out, the base business pricing continues to
be stronger than expected. Our erosion is not in the high single-digits anymore, it's more in the mid to low single-digits.
In fact, in some cases, we've actually even taken price on products where we were underwater on the margins, we were

able to take price up and those prices have stuck. So, a little bit of a new pricing environment out there. Some of that's
due to, again, the missteps of some of our competitors, but in the most part, I think people are being pretty careful about
what they do with price.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Paul, just one follow-up. I think there's an FDA advisory panel meeting today on Narrow
Therapeutic Index Drugs on Bioequivalence. I mean, how close are you paying attention to this? It seems like the FDA
is thinking about maybe even – or the panel is going to discuss potentially even tighter standards for some of these
products?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, this is an ongoing debate and has been an ongoing debate for – since warfarin launched
back in the mid-'90s. We continue as a company and as a generic trade association to argue against additional
standards, additional tighter scrutiny for narrow therapeutic index drugs. All the clinical studies that have ever been
performed on generic drugs show that there is no clinical difference between these kinds of drugs, notwithstanding the
anecdotal evidence that people keep coming up with.
So, yeah, Tim, we're engaged in this process, and we'll continue to be very active in voicing that issue. Again,
anecdotally, everybody talks about this stuff, but when you really look at the data there is no difference. So, we'll
continue to fight.

Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Needham & Company.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Elliot.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Hi, good morning. Just one follow-up question on Methylin ER sales. Paul, I think your
expectation is eventually that margins will converge to something close to Watson segment – generic segment margins
overall. Can you just remind us if that's a timeline specific step-up in margin, or are there some other thresholds that
trigger that? And then is there any – is it sort of a gradual step quarter-to-quarter to quarter, or is there any kind of large
one-time [inaudible] (35:41)
And then follow-up question, I guess, for Todd and just sort of working through some of the changes in overall
guidance parameters and thinking about the $75 million upward adjustment in EBITDA, I come up with an EPS impact
associated with that of about $0.40 kind of using a 35.5% tax rate or so. So, I'm wondering is that just maybe you guys
being a little bit conservative keeping a few extra pennies in the pocket for just in case, or is there something in the tax
or kind of below pre-tax line that I might not be thinking of? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Elliot, I think it just shows that we need a lower tax rate. [Laughter] But regarding the
Concerta, it's time-based. The step-up is time-based, and it's gradual. So, hopefully that covers it. And Todd, I'll let you
-
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Yeah, I think that – we've provided the details in the reconciliation table to show the difference
between earnings and adjusted EBITDA. I think the best we can provide you is that reconciliation.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Morning.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: I have two questions. First is on R&D. Your R&D expense was up about 35% non-GAAP this
quarter, and that compares I think to your comments in the past of expecting around 10% to 12%. I'm just wondering
what were sort of the primary drivers of that and are they sort of temporary factors or to what extent are they more
durable?
And secondly, on the new launches of Generess and ella, could you comment on how those launches are going, and to
the extent you could quantify that, that would be helpful? And also, to what extent are the IMS volumes indicative of
the real progress of those launches?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, let me handle the R&D, and then I'll turn it over to Fred for the brand questions. Michael,
I think we're – you're going to see us continue to spend heavily in R&D on the generic front. Some of that spending is
now the result of products that are in – that are probably – that cost more basically to develop. Things that require
clinical endpoint studies, products like respiratory products, these are more expensive to develop, and bio studies are
more costly than, say, the more traditional generic product. So, you're going to see us spend more on the generic R&D
front because of that.
On the brand side, remember, we include in our brand business not just the small molecule development efforts, but
also our biologic development efforts. And as our FSH product continues to advance through the clinic, you're going to
see more and more spending there. So, we're in a good position to be able to invest and reinvest some of the profits that
we're generating from our – across all of our business segments. And as I mentioned earlier, there's three ways to grow
your business and we're going to do – use all means necessary to grow our business now going forward, and R&D
spending is going to be one of them. Fred?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: So regarding the Generess launch, we're five weeks into the launch. So, you've
seen five weeks worth of data, and the remainder is in the marketplace, which generally the physicians give significant
samples to start the process. So, we're pleased with the growth that's going on in the prescription segment that we can
see, but I think we're even more pleased with the response that we've had on the pull-out of samples, the cards that are
being used and just the general reaction to the product. It's nicely positioned as a 25 [ph] MIC OC (39:21), right, in
between the 20, and the 30; I think that that's a nice uptake. Prescriptions, probably start paying attention to them in
September, when we're through with the real slug of samples that have been distributed.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: And could you comment on ella?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah. So, ella, prescription trends are not a terrific indicator, because we're
participating in two other segments with Planned Parenthood and also, through the mail order or that online pharmacy
segment. Both of those businesses are going okay. Planned Parenthood has been a bit distracted with some other things.
So, they've not adopted some of the programs as aggressively as we had hoped, but we're still working with that
increasingly hard.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. Just a couple; longer term question on Concerta. I know your 2013 EPS growth
targets reflect another generic entrant. But given that we haven't seen any FDA movement on any of the generic
ADDERALL XR filings, how realistic is it to expect the Agency to act on any of the Concerta ANDAs by then?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: [Laughter] David, I don't know is the answer. The Agency is a bit overwhelmed with all the
stuff they've got to do. They're woefully underfunded, as we know. And as a generic trade association, we've been
working hard to work on basically a PDUFA-like program and to get them more funding. That funding probably won't

kick in until – we won't see the benefit of that funding probably until 2013. 2012 would be maybe the first year that
they would see any money. But it's almost impossible to predict how long it's going to take the Agency to get through
complicated issues now with the staff that they have, and the level of funding they have.
And frankly, it's not encouraging to see the government, and the federal budget talks where they are and – because
more funding cuts of the FDA means slower and slower decisions. So, I can't predict when they're going to get to these
questions around partial AUC, and the like, but you've got to assume they'll eventually get to them. [Laughter] I just
don't know when.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Right. And then a question on business development, I mean, bearing in mind that your
debt-to-EBITDA is a good bit lower than your peers, I mean, how high would you theoretically want to take the
debt-to-EBITDA up to in order to get an acquisition done?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, we've talked a lot about this. We've been asked this question a number of times. And
what we've told the investors, and what we've told our rating agencies is that our target number is somewhere around
3.5 times, and that would include of course, any EBITDA contribution from the target. So, we have a lot of headroom
and it's not as much the willingness to spend because we are willing to go out and invest in acquisitions. It's finding the
right acquisition. That is really what takes the longest time. So, we're careful about how we spend money, but – and –
but we do have a lot of headroom and we continue to look.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Company.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Hi. How are you doing, Paul? I've got a question for Fred first. Fred, can you talk a little bit
about what's going on in the physician community for Ob/Gyn, so maybe ACOG in terms of guidelines around
PROCHIEVE, and the data that you have? Can you give us any thoughts of what they're thinking and maybe if they're
– if maybe ACOG is looking to change the guidelines? And then a follow-up question for Paul.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah. So, there's been an enormous amount of work in this area. Obviously, this
is a critical issue for us in successfully marketing PROCHIEVE. There's been a lot of meetings between both the
national, and the local ACOG chapters. It appears that ACOG, and the Maternal Fetal Medicine Group will probably
come together and create a guideline. We're hearing guidelines established somewhere between mid-fourth quarter and
as late as February. But they seem to be coming to a general consensus that there's enough evidence that routine
cervical screening should be a standard of care. And then they go in a series of different directions as to what to do after
you do screening. And in our minds, that's exactly where we want them to go. We'll go fight it out in the marketplace as
to what to do afterwards, but the cervical screening is the critical issue.
There seems to be a lot of noise, I mean, there is two editorials that were in recent publications outlining the economic
advantages, and the benefit of doing cervical screening, and then using some form of progesterone. So, we're in the
right spot and progressing the ball nicely on this one.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: That's great. And, Paul, on Lidoderm, have you guys shared any terms with each other
understanding you said that you're going to push maybe the next legal step, but has anyone kind of swapped ideas here
in terms of settlement?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Ken, we don't – we don't obviously disclose discussions. We continue to move forward with
our case aggressively. As you know, we're expanding our manufacturing operation out in Salt Lake City to be ready to
manufacture the drug as early as possible, in fact, as early as late next year, which is when our 30-month stay expires.
So – I'm sorry, mid-next year. So, we are moving on all fronts and we're always prepared to sit down and chat about
stuff. But we'll keep that to ourselves.

Your next question comes from the line of Shibani Malhotra with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First one on PROCHIEVE, Paul, are you expecting
a panel for the product? And if so, what do you think that the FDA would be looking to discuss at a panel? And then
my second question on Lidoderm. Clearly, the Markman decision went in your favor. But can you talk about the
regulatory standpoint? Why are you still confident – why are you so confident that you will be able to get the product
approved on time? And how does this – how does your opinion get influenced by the FDA comments on VOLTAREN
GEL, and the fact that we haven't seen a generic on that to-date?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah. So, this is Fred Wilkinson. Let me address the panel issue for
PROCHIEVE. It's unclear whether there will be a panel. I think by moving the PDUFA date to February 26, they have
left room to be able to conduct a panel. They have now published their panel dates for the rest of the year. So, there is a
panel date that is set for the 8th and 9th of December that would be an appropriate time if they wanted to do it. We've
gotten no communication that a panel is going to be requested. We're preparing for it. And I think generally with
indications as high profile as this, they're probably just going to put the efficacy evidence in front of the panel and ask
for a vote on the results of the trial. Not unexpected and we're prepared for it.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And then, Shibani, I think you asked about Lidoderm. Well, first of all, remember, patent cases
are inherently unpredictable. Notwithstanding a good hearing result, you have to remember that it's up to the judge and
things can always change. So, it's an argument we've had with the FTC on this matter a lot is that you can't guarantee
anything. So – but we are preparing for success. And as that process goes forward – as the preparations go forward, we
look at things like the citizens petition that's been issued and I think I've – you've heard me say this before that we
believe the Citizens Petition, in this case, has already been answered by the FDA. The arguments that were made in the
first Citizens Petition that was filed by Endo are the same – basically the same arguments they made in the second
petition. The FDA modified Lidoderm guidance and we followed the new guidance. So, I think that issue is resolved,
that's our position, and that's why we're so confident about it. We also know what the status of our FDA application is,
and how it's moving through the process. And we're preparing for approval and we're building significant capacity.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay. Hey, can I ask a quick follow-up just on guidance for '12? I think one of the things
you did earlier this year is give '12 as a percentage of '11, a percentage increase. Now, that you've increased '11 as
much as you have, does that flow through to '12?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Well, I think we're going to hold on giving guidance for '12 until we get through the year and
stick with our convention of giving guidance at the beginning of '12 for '12. Things change. We did tell you that that
percentage growth at the time did not include any acquisitions. So, you guys will have to kind of do your own math on
that.

international generics, can you talk a little bit about the environment there in terms of pricing versus expectations? You
also mentioned you're pruning some products, was that a normal plan process or was that in response to what the
pricing environment was? And then just a follow-up I have for Todd on cash flow aspects. Thanks.
<A - David A. Buchen>: So on Lidoderm, we have not filed for a summary judgment at this point. We're still in
discovery. Typically, courts don't want you to file those motions until the discovery period ends. We're just wrapping
up fact discovery, and then we'll have expert reports into the fall. So, we'll evaluate the right timing once we get
through the discovery process.
<Q - David G. Buck>: Okay.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I think on the European environment, obviously, pricing is a big issue. Overall, it's in
our expectation. I think we announced on our last call that we estimate a low – high single-digit, low double-digit so
around 10% price erosion in the market. It's a little bit higher in U.K., around that in France. It's probably in line with
what we expected. I think the pruning is something that we do regularly, but we looked more carefully into it this time
around because we acquired the business two years ago with the portfolio and with the new pricing environment there's
been a significant pricing erosion over the last three to four years. You have to look carefully into it. But also at the
same time, as Paul mentioned in his introductory talk, we have a significant number of products on file and we have
launched 14 new products in Europe as of this year. So, it's the renewal of the portfolio that allows us to do more
significant pruning than we would otherwise do. So, I think the R&D spending we are working on, the international
R&D is coming up, allows us to take these actions to look at the bottom line in each of the markets.
<Q - David G. Buck>: And just for – Todd, a quick question on cash flow. You mentioned Concerta was one of the
reasons why cash flow from operations was only $16 million, and the rise in receivables, should we be expecting
something similar to be happening for Lipitor and can you remind us what the cash flow impact of that launch will be
say on fourth quarter and into 2012? Thanks.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Sure. We'll have the same impact of Lipitor in the fourth quarter, although we'll only have
roughly one month as opposed to almost two months with generic Concerta. But it will be a similar situation in that we
will not collect any of the receivables for generic Lipitor in the fourth quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of David Maris with CLSA.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, David.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Good morning. A couple of questions. First, what's the difference between $4.25 and $4.50,
and don't say $0.25? In other words, what has to happen for you to get to the $4.50? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think as you can imagine, it depends on the big product, and the competition that we
see, and the pricing we see for those big products. In short, things like Metoprolol. I think you've all heard me say this
before. If Metoprolol remains kind of where it's at, we should be very good. If not, we'll have to adjust our expectations
downward. So, it's really a question of what happens to the pricing of some of the major products.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Okay. When you say you have to adjust it downward, you mean it would still be inclusive in
that range; it just would fall on the lower end, or no, one or two of these go the wrong way and you'd have to revisit the
entire guidance?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I mean, they would have to – we feel pretty comfortable at the lower end of our range
that we're not going to have to move that. But, like anything else, bad things could happen, but we're not expecting that
to occur. So, we're pretty comfortable with the low end of our range and we'll continue to try to exceed expectations.

you looking to develop further in Europe a bigger footprint, or you need to add on technologies here in the U.S., or is it
to start in Latin America? What are you thinking?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, all of the above. One of the things that we're spending a lot of time on is looking at our
brand franchise, and how do we expand our brand presence throughout the Americas. And over the next few quarters,
we'll be launching our Canadian brand business and we're expecting some big things from that. And if we found the
right opportunity to jumpstart a brand opportunity in the Americas, we would certainly be on that. But we'll continue –
but on the same time, we'll continue to look for ways to grow our international generics business by, again, the right
kinds of acquisitions. But, again, it's not a question of cash. We have the cash available; it's finding the right
opportunity that is to some extent holding us back.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Good morning, and congratulations.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: And congratulations on the nice quarter.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Thanks.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: First question I have is about the Medco, Express Scripts merger again. This one actually is to Fred.
We know the impact on the generics that it's going to be moderate that those two companies have a moderate impact on
generics volume. But they seem to have a bigger share of the national formularies. Can you comment and do you
expect more pressure on general pricing in the U.S. market for specialty pharma companies or is that something that is
less likely?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: I think there has already been significant pressure on the brand companies in
most of these environments. Anyway, most of them have been fairly aggressive at implementing not only a three-tier
system, but a lot of [indiscernible] (55:27) and other things that make a tier-three position not as favorable as it used to
be. I think we've created a good relationship actually with our core products with both books of business. We're very
comfortable with the contracts that are there. We think that from a brand perspective we're not going to be impacted
very much with the line that we have.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Great. Thank you. And Paul, regarding Lipitor, I'm guessing some of the market already committed
to either you or to Pfizer's product, but as time progresses and we're not seeing action from Ranbaxy. In your mind, at
what point is the remaining of the market essentially goes out and commit to either you or Pfizer for a product last
November or is this something that it's just people are going to wait off until the last day?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think frankly, some people will wait till the last day because pricing is going to be a big
issue here with Lipitor and pricing dynamics will vary significantly, depending on whether Ranbaxy is in or not in. So,
I think there will be a number of companies that wait till the last minute. I think everybody knows and all of our
customers know, we'll have enough product available to supply the whole market in November. So, I don't think
anybody's really too worried about getting the product from us.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: And is there like a point in the next couple of months that you can look – we can look at the book of
order, saying, if they don't have something by then, I probably will have a step up in expectations?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I suppose there's probably a point in time when it would become clear, and that time is
probably around November, beginning of November, if there isn't sufficient, I mean, if Ranbaxy doesn't have sufficient

inventory, I mean, customers that – they would probably be in a bad position to not tell customers they wouldn't be able
to supply right away. Again, for them, I think it's probably better for them to be in a position where they can fully
supply and that's probably what they're going to do. But, if they're ready in November, they'll tell customers. If they're
not ready, I'm certain that, I know we would tell customers that we weren't ready, because we wouldn't want to make
people angry about that. Thanks.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Thank you.

Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Michael Tong with Wells Fargo Security.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Good morning, Paul. Quick question. If we just kind of forget about, if we assume that
generic Concerta never launched in the second quarter, how would the generic gross margin in the U.S. look like
relative to the first quarter? And then, secondly, as far as international goes, as you prune the portfolio, should I expect
the margins to trend up or is it just enough to offset the price decline? And then, lastly, has Canada been stable from a
pricing perspective or has it continued to be stable on that front? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Michael, on the general gross margin question, I think it would probably be about the same
quarter-over-quarter, maybe slightly down a little bit. And then, Siggi, if you want to -
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes. On the international business, the pruning will stabilize the margin. Also,
remember that Europe is such a small portion of the overall business of Watson that even the pruning won't affect the
overall gross margin so much. But, it's definitely stabilizing the market, and hopefully, in the coming years the new
launches will improve the market going forward.
I think in Canada we have had a better year this year than last year. Clearly, we see a growth with new launches, but
also quite a volume growth. So, we are launching – we have already launched five new products in to Canada and we
have some significant launches in the last half of the year. So, that's the market we are spending a lot of time on to help
to grow to be the second biggest market of Watson.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Thanks.
