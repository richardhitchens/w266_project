MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
This is a bit like an Annual Meeting where half the time I have to hurry my Directors to get them to sit down so we can
get into the matter. If I can get my team to sit down, we'll get into the matter.
We thank all of you for being here. This is a pretty exciting day for us and we would hope an exciting day for our
shareholders and our customers. I hope that I know most of you. My name is Mike Morris, the President, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of American Electric Power Company. And we decided that trying to combine an Analyst Day
and our third quarter earnings would be a better way to get a face to face Q&A between us and the management team
of American Electric Power, so that we can get into depth about whatever issues that are on your mind.
I always enjoy the quarterly earnings update and learn a great deal from the questions that you ask about the things that
are paramount in your mind, but it's always faceless because of the way that we do it. And we haven't had a full blown
Analyst Day for a while but for the things that EEI does, and we thought this would be a perfect way to do that.
And as it turns out for the actual EEI Meeting, Brian and Bob and Nick and Venita, and the team will handle all of that
as we're trying to convince the Chinese that investing in carbon capture and storage is a good thing. And if you know
anything about China, you know that they want us physically there to sign memorandums of understandings. So I will
not be able to go to EEI, not that that's a big loss for you, I'm sure, but at any rate we thought this would be an
appropriate way to go about doing it.
You know when you do things like this, and you've already read the press release on the third quarter performance, it's
clear that we had an outstanding quarter. We feel very strong about how that will allow us to finish the year. We have a
number of levers to pull if needed to, to make sure that we get within that narrow guidance that we provided for you at
the end of the second quarter. There are many questions about that. And because it was the second quarter we felt it
was appropriate to be somewhat conservative.
Many of you said to us after those facts why so conservative. It was just the better time to do that. We now feel very
comfortable about 2010 and we've shared that data with you and of course we're also eager to share with you 2011, '12
and beyond where we think economic recovery will have a substantial positive impact as will Susan Tomasky's
Transmission play as the years continue and permits coming in, capital is put to work, the returns on capital are almost
automatic adjusters throughout almost all of our service territory. So we're kind of encouraged about where we are and
where we're headed.

A year or so ago however, let me get through this – this believe what you want to believe story. A year ago these were
the things that were on our mind coming into 2010. How are we going to work our way through the economic
challenges that face us. What we told you in 2009 was that we had forecasted some recovery in our residential,
commercial, industrial space on a normalized basis and if we didn't see that recovery we will react to it, and of course
we did exactly that.
We said that we would maintain our capital discipline and throttle back from the 4 billion odd dollars we had invested
in 2006 and 2007 and the 3.5 billion in 2008, and throttle that back substantially in 2009 and many of you – and 2010,
many of you said, well, doesn't that slowdown the rate machine and therefore the earnings strength of the company –
and it does. But at the same time and the regulatory pressures that we were facing at that time, we thought it was the
appropriate way to go as we jurisdiction by jurisdiction by jurisdiction made those filings that we thought were
essential to earn our rate of return or at least reduce the regulatory lag between the time capital is invested and the time
you begin as investors to see the benefit of that capital invested, because our customers see it on day one. And we
wanted to shorten the time between when they had the advantage of it and you had the obvious earned advantage of it
as well and we did that. And now as you look at 2011 and '12 and beyond you can see that we think there is room to
make additional capital investments as we go.
Many of you have continued to ask how is it that anyone can manage their way through 11 jurisdictions in 7 principal
operating companies. And you'll get a good view of that today as you get a chance to dialogue with the operating
company presidents and Bob Powers who manages the utilities for us at American Electric Power. Because that has
happened now in a series of years where every year we go in with a stack of rate case increases that we expect to
receive, and each and every year we not only have been there but somewhat above it – 2010 exactly like the many
years before it. And as you look at 2011, the need for recovery in the rate cases is very, very slim, something on the
order of 240-250 million, about a 157-158 that are already in place that will kick in automatically on 01/01/11, so we
feel pretty comfortable about that as well.
Issues that are outstanding that probably are outside of our control but surely inside of an envelope where we can
influence them. Our house states go about the business of creating jobs and how the federal government goes about the
business of addressing the issue of building out a robust transmission grid to handle the renewables and things that they
would like to see done at the federal level, as well as addressing the issue of the global challenge of how to address the
United States' carbon footprint as compared to the world carbon footprint, and we have been deeply involved in all of
those activities.
We were a principal participant with the NRDC in crafting the Waxman-Markey, which we thought was a reasonable
bill coming out of the House. We knew it needed substantial improvement and with the Environmental Defense Fund
and Senators Kerry, Lieberman and Graham before he dropped out, we were incredibly, deeply involved, what became
something that we were real advocates for Kerry, Lieberman. It had things that truly appealed to us. So when we look
at 2010 from the lens of 2009 when we share with you the things of concern and the performance that the team at
American Electric Power has experienced and you as investors have and will experience through the rest of the year,
we feel really good about where we are.
As you know, I've talked in terms of retiring from Chief Executive Officer since I actually went to Northeast Utilities in
1997. Having been born on November 11 and realizing some years ago when I spent a minute looking at it as you do
when you [audio skip] mid late 50s you start to think about, I wonder when I'll turn 65, it looked like it's amazing and
11/11/11 I'll be there.
So, someone asked me the other day, what are you going to work on in 2011? Here are the issues; here are the issues
that we will continue to work on. Many of you were at a meeting yesterday where two of the commissioners, including
the Chair of the PUCO shared with you some issues that are in front of them. Obviously those same issues are in front
of us. Resolution of the SEET hearing as far as it pertains to our 2009 performance is center stage, front and center.
Papers have been filed. Discussions have been ongoing.
And we will see a resolution of that according to the Chair of the Commission before the end of the year. We told you
about two or three months ago that we never thought it would be resolved before the election, which is now only 15

days away, and we feel as comfortable today as we did then. We have made a very strong case with the rationale of the
earnings that both of our operating companies in Ohio have seen and we think that that will come out without a great
deal of impact on us as we go.
The issue will be, will we get enough reading in how 2009 is handled to address 2010 because we're convinced by 2011
the operating companies will be fully separated – excuse me; fully blended together in a merger activity, which will be
filed shortly and we feel comfortable that that will go through without much of a hitch.
The filing of an electric security plan for the years beyond 2010, 2011 will also happen in the first quarter. We think
that's the appropriate time to do that and we feel relatively comfortable about how that will unfold. We are one of the
principal commenters along with many, many others on the FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on how they
finally are going to take the mantle that's essential if transmission is going to be built in this country.
Two issues, one without question is their overriding opportunity to approve projects that are essential and needed
without the mask of second-tier approval authority only after the states have been unable to come to resolution. We'll
probably get another step in the right direction from the 2005 legislation from the FERC and that should be helpful.
But more importantly for us and quite honestly for you as investors is the cost allocation issue, which we think the
FERC will address at long last on something that will be very similar, I would hope, to what the Southwest Power Pool
has done on higher volume transmission lines, higher voltage and volume transmission lines being allocated on a much
broader sense than the lower volume, lower voltage, small energy delivery lines. So we'll see how that unfolds. The
comments have been given; there are many on the Commission who believe the cost allocation is an issue that they
clearly have full sway over and something that I think they'll find the kinds of answers that we're interested in.
Nick will share with you our approach to how we're going to handle the issue of environmental policies. I think you're
beginning to see particularly from our friends in Texas as only they can do thumbing their nose at the federal EPA and
saying, have you even thought about the magnitude of the many steps that you've taken – have you even done an
analysis of the financial impact on the U.S. economy of all of these individual rules that you are putting out seriatim?
The answer to that of course is no. Are you kidding me? We will do each one as a one-off and each one of them has
almost no impact on GDP, but collectively they do.
The Environmental Protection Agency is in fact a controllable organization. Many of you might not believe that to be
the case. It is. And no matter where the elections go in November, I think the EPA's going to have to step back for a
moment, take a break and take a look at that. As you know, we've made some very pointed testimony on the Transport
Rule, not that they were overly concerned about it and how it affects us; it's a plus. The day that they intend to do it, to
pass a final rule, mid 2011 and demand that you deploy a technology January 1, 2012, even they can't do that. Course
they couldn't get it out by 2022, but that's a side matter.
I thought that might just get a chuckle out of you. I want to make sure you're all still awake. But at any rate the fact of
the matter is we think that they'll slow down in the process and ultimately go forward, do things that make sense, allow
for America continue to burn its most prevalent fuel, unless shale gas swamps coal eventually some day; could happen;
might not. Coal is going to play. You've heard me say that far too many times in the world and in the United States. It
will be cleaner, it will be better. We will make those capital investments on the plant where that makes sense, and we
will recover those capital investments and show those results to you, our shareholders.
Succession planning and transition. I am not spending a nickels more with the time on that. The board is in deep
deliberations. They have excellent internal candidates. They are doing their governance due diligence requirement to
look outside as well. By the end of the year we will have selected someone to be president of American Electric Power
and that someone, presuming everything works as I would expect that it will, will be named chief executive officer
November 11, 2011.
And then most importantly, today's discussion on long-term growth and capital allocation plans and the team, Brian in
particular will take you through a great deal of that with granularity. And we're quite excited about the opportunities
that we see in front of us when we look at the company in 2011, so let's go to that slide now.

What you saw in our press release of third quarter 2010 earnings was that the economy continues to be a bit sluggish
but improving. Our industrial sales on a weather-adjusted basis have been good. Our commercial sales on a
weather-adjusted basis have been flat and our residential sales on a weather adjusted basis have been up some.
Having said that, the weather of course has been very good to us in all utilities and a great deal of corporate America
during the third quarter, and we're reflecting that as we go. And that brings us to a pretty focused view of how to
allocate capital.
As I said earlier on, we'll be bumping up the capital spend in 2011 to this 2.6 billion that you see on the slide. That's
intended to take full advantage of the opportunities that we see, some of it in generation, but a lot of it in distribution as
we have tremendous capital needs throughout the entirety of the 11-state footprint.
As you know, equity capital invested in the wires business is almost rarely challenged and usually treated very fairly in
the rate of return and the rate recovery process. We'll bump that capital spend up in 2012 because we think the cash
flows will come along as well and because we have excess capital on hand today as you know from the press releases
of this morning, we will recommend to the board of directors yet this calendar year to have a 9.5% increase in the
dividend that we pay to our investors, because we think in these restricted times giving you back capital by way of
dividend increases is an important way for you to continue to feel comfortable about your investment in American
Electric Power. This keeps us well within our 50% to 60% guidance of payout ratios, which tells you, I hope, and
surely us that there is continued room for improvement as we go.
Some of our colleagues who are in the yield range that we will now be in are with huge payout ratios that at the long
run aren't sustainable without some kind of different approach toward their capital structure and we feel comfortable
about doing that. And because the pension activity has been affected by the overall performance of the stock market,
we have pre-funded much of it in 2010. We'll do some additional cash investments in 2011 and I think that that also
takes care of the financial impact of having to fund it in a much larger sense with an impact on earnings per share that
ultimately would have an effect on the share price. We think this is a reasonable way to balance our employees'
concerns about the funded status of pensions, as well as our investors' concerns about seeing to it that we'll be able to
manage the capital requirements and the cash flows that are essential for the company to continue to be successful.
Brian will take you through some of the statistics, but there is no question that through the work Holly Koeppel did,
Susan Tomasky before her, Brian Tierney now as CFO, during my term as CEO of American Electric Power, I think
we've done an excellent job of managing a balance sheet that was awfully unwieldy when we got here with a high risk
profile on it; that today is extremely conservative with an extremely low risk profile on it, except for the data that's
required for reasonable returns on equity where we'll talk about how risky the business that we're in is.
I thought that might get a chuckle out of you as well, but obviously it didn't. The capital spending plan really as I've
said now for '09, 2010, '11 and '12 and beyond is very much predicated on making sure that we maintain that capital
discipline as we go. Everyone has said to us, you guys seem awfully low compared to your colleagues at 2% to 4%
growth profile going forward. And as you can see in the 2011 number versus where we think 2010 will come in, we're
looking at a 4% growth target, and as you see here on this slide, 2012 to '14, we think 4% to 6%. And that really is a
combination of a couple of things. That's a combination of the economy recovering and transmission playing a larger
role.
When you look at the 5% to 7% range in 2014 and beyond, it again is the effect of the economy finally coming back to
some normalcy, whatever that might be, plus a great deal of the transmission projects now approved moving further
down the line coming online and moving into the rate recovery and return for capital invested. And then by 2014, we'll
have a pretty clear picture of the environmental investments that we have made, want to make and the effect that they
will have on the earnings strength of American Electric Power as we go forward as an integrated combined company
with a great deal of capital investment opportunity.
So we feel pretty comfortable about where we are, where we've been. We think that we've taken the ship through some
reasonably choppy waters without much impact on our shareholders. The returns have been reasonable, not as good as
some, but many – better than many, many others, and I can tell you how proud I am of this executive management

team.
And I'd now like to turn the podium over to Bob Powers, the President of AEP Utilities and his colleagues, the
operating company presidents to share with you the difference that we've taken toward the operating company model
and what we think that it will yield.
We'll then move on to Brian and others and then get to your Qs & As. Bob?
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Well, good morning. Are the lavenders working? Everybody hear okay? Great. Bob Powers, President of AEP Utilities
and it is indeed my privilege to lead the seven operating companies that comprise the AEP System. We're here to talk
about those operating companies this morning and some modifications we're making to our operating company model.
As Mike indicated, it's worth repeating, the operating companies have been very busy since he has come to AEP
delivering rate proceedings over the last seven or eight years.
In fact rate recovery over those seven or eight years has been well in excess of $2 billion and we're here to talk about
some modifications, not the establishment of operating company model this morning.
There are some differences however from 2004 and 2005 when the most recent model was implemented to now and
what are some of those changes. First of all, we have – we had a lot of headroom in rates back in 2004 and 2005 for a
variety of reasons. Number one, the merger had locked and frozen rates across the AEP system for a number of years.
The economy was reasonably robust, so we had some modest growth in electric consumption that all leading to more
headroom in rates.
We also had a situation in which at the time I was in the middle of putting scrubbers and SCRs on power plants and I
always – I cried for more clarity out of Washington, but looking back we actually had quite a bit of clarity and I knew
what scrubbers and what SCRs to put on power plant. Clearly, circumstances these days are different than that and it's a
challenging circumstance that Nick will talk about in just a few minutes. And then third, in current time we have an
economy that is still sluggishly recovering and those circumstances lead to – us needing to assess the operating
company model and make some changes.
As we look at that calculus and we look at that circumstance, the conclusion we come to is that although public policy
maybe established from Washington regarding environmental compliance and although AEP corporate out of
Columbus will certainly have input into the strategic response to those public policies, at the end of the day we need a
tremendous amount of local input and a lot of local design regarding what our response to those circumstances are
going to be and that's where we're going about modifying the operating company model. We are giving the operating
company presidents the ability to strategically respond and financially respond to those circumstances.
So what are we doing? We're giving these people and two others the ability to drive results at the operating company
level. Specifically, we're giving them accountability and authority to allocate capital across the business units, across G,
T, and D within the operating company itself. We're giving these individuals the authority to be accountable across
those business units for O&M and capital results. We're giving them the opportunity to dialogue with their regulators
and their local legislatures to make sure that AEP strategy is in alignment with local needs and local desires.
And finally, we're giving them the absolute ability to make sure they are responsive to customer needs and customer
desires, so that the amount of hostility from our ratepayers towards rate increases, nobody ever likes rate increases, but
they don't necessarily – our customers don't need to be hostile to make sure that our level of service at the operating
companies is adequate to satisfy our customers' desires and make them reasonably responsive to the need for rate
increases.
All that should lead to more efficient deployment of capital. All that should minimize regulatory lag and all that should
lead to AEP strategic response to public policy to be in concert with our local operating company regulators and
legislatures. I think that's a pretty good deal at the end of the day for our shareholders.

What do I do personally to lead this – what gives me confidence to lead the circumstance that I've described? Well, first
of all, I don't feel alone up here. That's a joke also. I've got five people next to me. But I want you to know, this is not
an operating company initiative, that's being thrust or hoisted upon the corporation. This is something that we've
thought long and hard at an executive level, involved the operating company presidents in describing what we're going
to do. But I feel I have absolute support from my executive colleagues at AEP. This is a corporate initiative. Nick
Akins, Susan Tomasky, Brian and Mike, myself are all bought into this model and we are all committed to making it
successful and making it work.
Second of all, I gained some confidence from my own background. I've been at the Utility business now for four years.
Prior to that I was Executive Vice President of Generation and I came into AEP as its Chief Nuclear Officer. I think
that framework gives me confidence. I understand the issues. I certainly understand the challenges that Nick and the
Generation team face in addressing public policy issues out of Washington.
And I think that nuclear background, at least my colleagues tells me, gives me some confidence and some ability to
deal with the discipline issue of how you go about achieving an objective with finite resources but making sure that
there is a focus and a discipline to achieve the results that we need.
So again, and third, I very much depend on these five people and Greg Pauley in Kentucky Power and Wade Smith in
AEP Texas to help this whole thing work. So with that, let me introduce my colleagues here and we'll get right into
some Q&A to hopefully address many of your questions about the operating companies and we'll get going.
To my immediate left is Stuart Solomon, a native of Texas, graduate of Southwestern University in Texas, also has an
M.B.A from U.T. and a J.D. from University of Colorado. He is our President of Public Service of Oklahoma. Sitting
next to Stuart is Charles Patton, President of Appalachian Power. Charles is a graduate of Bowdoin College, a Polar
Bear, and also has a master's degree in Public Policy from the LBJ School at the University of Texas. Charles is a
veteran of Columbus and Southern Company and comes to us with a long history in operating company
implementation. He was the President of AEP Texas as well before going to APCo. So Charles, welcome to the panel.
Venita McCellon-Allen next to Charles is our President of SWEPCO. She is a native of Longview, Texas in the heart
of SWEPCO [audio skip] . Venita is a graduate of Texas A&M and also has – is a veteran of the CSW Corporation and
has had many responsible executive positions in AEP before going back to SWEPCO as President.
Next to Venita is Joe Hamrock. Joe is a native of Ohio. Grew up in Mingo Junction and for those of you – I'm sure you
all know Mingo Junction is a suburb in Steubenville. Joe is a graduate of Youngstown State with a degree in electrical
engineering and has an MBA from the Sloan program in MIT. And Joe cut his first teeth in AEP working in the AEP
Ohio Companies back some years ago in the early 80s.
Next to Joe is Paul Chodak. Paul is a graduate of Worcester Polytech. He is a graduate of MIT with a degree in nuclear
engineering – Ph.D. by the way in nuclear engineering. Paul has a lot of experience in generation. I worked with Paul a
decade or so ago in generation. Has been President of SWEPCO and is now President of Indiana and Michigan Power.
So that is our five of the operating company presidents that represents the AEP system. So folks I teed up an interesting
new model for the operating companies to talk about your discipline and your ability to allocate capital and your ability
to drive results. But I would say as a pragmatist there is no better way to get the financial operation of the operating
companies moving real well than to have a recovery of the economy.
So Joe, maybe you could start off with talking about how the economy is doing in Ohio and maybe broaden that a little
bit to talk about how things are going in the East overall.
Joseph Hamrock, President and Chief Operating Officer, AEP Ohio
Sure, Bob I'd be glad to. I'll speak to the Midwest which is the Ohio Companies as well as Indiana Michigan,
Appalachian Power, Kentucky Power and the economy as is the case on the national stage is front and center both in
the political dimension and in the business community and across the state that we serve. We serve in Ohio, 63 of

Ohio's 88 counties and the story is very mixed. What we've seen is in terms of economic output, 2010 so far has
actually been pretty good, mid single-digit increases in economic output across the Midwest territories, though
unemployment continues to linger at levels that we saw last year at the depth of the recession. So, so far a bit of a
jobless recovery, though certain sectors have really started to show signs of life and that's been encouraging across all
of the territory.
What that's translated to for AEP East, the eastern companies this year is about 1% normalized low growth over 2009
led by the industrial sector just over 4% growth in the industrial sector across the boards, with some notable sectors
inside the industrial class really leading the way. Primary metals in particular, we've seen about an 18% increase over
2009 levels in the East companies and that reflects that the survivors in that industry. We've certainly seen some fallout,
some of the plants haven't come back from the recession, but those who have, have come back strong. We've seen
really strong results in that sector.
Right behind that plastics and transportation at about an 11% growth rate in load so far this year and from there other
sectors, mining in particular in Appalachian Power, Charles has certainly seen some activity in APCo with the mining
industry picking back up and a lot of new load emerging there. It's not just recovery, but it's actually growth in that
sector.
So we've seen industrial lead the way. As Mike said earlier, commercial and residential still relatively flat on a
normalized basis in the East, consumer confidence and the industrial confidence that's one of the key differences.
We've spent a lot of time talking to our major customers and while the production levels are up and load is up, the
confidence and visibility hasn't yet returned to the levels we saw a couple years ago. And most importantly, I think one
of the key roles that each of us play, is in the sphere of economic development. We've spent a lot of time working with
our major customers both on retention and attraction of new investment, new jobs and for us the new load that comes
along with that.
In Ohio, in particular, under the new law we've got the opportunity for 10-year contracts or multi-year contracts. And
we know from experience that even in this market environment that we have in Ohio, the capital intense, energy intense
industrials are looking for more certainty than the market provides. So the opportunity for longer term structured deals
that we can do under the new law and certainly that the other operating companies have some opportunity to do as well,
has been a real opportunity for us and something that we've got a lot of activity in that area.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Okay, thanks Joe. Venita you've worked in the East, you're back out West, and you help me keep an eye on AEP Texas.
So what's going on from a SWEPCO perspective and a West perspective with the economy?
Venita McCellon-Allen, President and Chief Operating Officer, Southwestern
Electric Power Company
Well, at SWEPCo I have the opportunity to serve three of the four Western footprint states. I take the opportunity really
to speak for PSO as well and we're fortunate in that we find that we go into the recession a bit later and come out a bit
earlier and we didn't go in quite as deep and we're having a bit more of a bounce in our industrial sector. For SWEPCo
specifically, our load is at 10% year-on-year compared to 2009 led by our industrial sector and I think we can attribute
that much to the Haynesville Shale and much of the shale play that's going on in our area as significantly important gas
area both in Stuart's PSO area in AEP Texas and also in SWEPCo.
For example, SWEPCo's biggest customer is U.S. Steel. In the recession, it was shut down yet now it is back at full
production, it is a tubular steel production and it provides tubular steel for the Haynesville Shale market and is back at
full production, full roar and we're very excited to hear that. Now we have some of the same thing, residential flat,
customer kiosk flat, commercial field, rocking along not quite as robust as we'd like to see. But we're really excited

about the industrial growth we're seeing. We're hoping that the others will follow along very quickly.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Yeah, I appreciate that. I'm hearing the industrials are coming back pretty strongly. We got to keep our eye on
commercial and that seems to be the case both East and West?
Venita McCellon-Allen, President and Chief Operating Officer, Southwestern
Electric Power Company
Indeed.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
All right. Let's talk a little bit about the new operating company model and you heard me talking here kind of tee it up,
but these folks are on the firing line and they've been through a cycle now and implementing the new operating
company model. So, Charles I would like to get your perspective from an APCo point of view? What's the new
operating company feel like in contrast for the folks? How is it different than it was before?
Charles Patton, President and Chief Operating Officer, Appalachian Power
You know first of all, it feels really good.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Well, that's fine.
Charles Patton, President and Chief Operating Officer, Appalachian Power
Well, first of all I would be remiss if I didn't point out that even before the new operating company model, we did a
good job. I want to make something clear is that it wasn't something that was terribly broken and needed to be fixed, it
just needed to be enhanced. And the bottom line is that historically what happened was the operating companies, we
were like minority owners. And we were delivered a package of as far as what our packet of goods which was our plan
for generation and transmission.
On the distribution side, if you remember back in 2004, we had already received control of that part of the business.
And so that part of the business we were able to effectively manage and make decisions and pull the appropriate levers
to get the most optimization out of our resources. But with the G&T part of the business though with way of run and
though they were great plans that were delivered to us, those plans were delivered to us.
Now those plans were great and if you look in our rate cases and then you measure our performance as a company
against other utilities, you'll find that our generation performance is a leader in the nation. You'll find that our
transmission performance is a leader in the nation, but so 90% of [audio skip] was just fine. It's just that incremental
amount, there's about that 10% where the operating company presidents need to be able to pull on the levers to be
responsive to their customers, to the regulators and to all the stakeholders who are involved in the process and that's the
real difference.

And let me give you a specific example that happened just in the short time that we've been in this particular model.
Well, in APCo generation there was a capital investment opportunity in generation that we didn't spend all that we had
forecasted to spend. In fact, we were about $6 million under what had been forecasted for the spend for this particular
project. Now, what has happened before is that that $6 million would have went back into generation and it would have
been used for something useful, something beneficial for the customer. But from Appalachian point of view it may not
have been the most optimal utilization of that capital. Well, instead of that $6 million going back and possibly getting it
through the previous process generation is there at the table, transmission is there at the table.
We sat down and we planned for Appalachian Power, that $6 million was used to buy 28,000 automated meter reading,
meters for our – demand meters for our larger customers. Now the benefit of that is that there is capital that's being
deployed, that can be recovered, but also by investing in those AMR demand meters, we're going to have – we're going
to be able to lower our O&M on our meter reading with the deployment of those meters. And so that is as good
example as possible of how it works and how it's different from where it was.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
All right, thanks very much, Charles. Paul, you were put into SWEPCo as President under the old model, as we moved
you to I&M back in June, you had a new model and a new opportunity, so how do you see that playing out in Indiana
Michigan?
Paul Chodak, III, President and Chief Operating Officer – Indiana Michigan
Power
Well, we're really excited about it. Each of the operating companies, each of the seven operating companies really are
local businesses. Our folks live in the communities that we serve. They raise their families in the communities that we
serve. And that really provides us a great opportunity to have insight into those communities. And as we look at the
challenges that Nick will talk about coming our way and changes in the industry, there is absolutely no shortage of
opportunities from investing capital in our companies.
The challenge is to figure out where is the best place to put those investments in. And as we work on maintaining our
balance sheet discipline and making sure there are capital spend is in line with our cash flows, the Transco situation
that Susan is going to talk about, formation of Transco will help with that or we're still going to have a real key issue
around prioritizing capital spend. And the local model – the local operating company model will provide us the real
flexibility that we need to sit down and talk to the regulators, to talk to our politicians and to listen to our customers to
figure out what is it that they want.
There are many opportunities around renewables, around grids, more around technology. How do people feel about
coal, nuclear gas? Where would they like to see those investments made? And because we'll be able to have those
conversations and have the flexibility to adjust our investment strategy, we'll be able to pick those investments that the
regulators really support, that the politicians really support on a local level, which will enhance our ability to get a fair
return for our shareholders.
I mean the bottom line is that now we have the ball and it's our job to carry to over the line with each and every project
that we do. And I can tell you over the last three months since I've come to I&M, I've had the opportunity to go out and
travel to our service centers, traveling to our plants and talk to the folks at I&M and really explain to them the message,
talk to them about the ability to make decisions on a local level and also the accountability for making sure that we're
putting that capital to good use to serve our customers, and earning a fair return for our shareholders and I can tell you,
the folks out in the field are just very enthusiastic about this.

Okay, thanks for that Paul.
Venita McCellon-Allen, President and Chief Operating Officer, Southwestern
Electric Power Company
So, when you, Paul just let's say, take no small pride in my comment that Texas has given feedback to the EPA and not
that I take personal responsibility for that because it's been certainly a team effort, but that's partly because the industry
led by AEP has been in the office of regulators, in the office of the TCEQ, using that relationship to help them
understand the affect these regulations are going to have on shareholders, on regulations, on the industry, on reliability
and that helps funnel that perspective back to Washington.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Thanks, Venita, thanks Paul and my friend, Stuart here. It's fair to say in 2004 that financial performance of PSO was
somewhat anemic. Today, you have double-digit ROEs and so, as you hear Paul, Venita myself, Charles described
some of the differences in the new operating company model. Did you use any of those over the last five, six, seven
years to turn PSO around?
Stuart Solomon, President and Chief Operating Officer, Public Service
Company of Oklahoma
Yeah, absolutely and good morning, everybody. And I think as a follow-up to what all my colleagues have talked about
we put in place a number of years ago a plan, a strategic plan to try to address what our situation was, which was low
single digit ROE. And that plan wasn't done in a vacuum or it wasn't done in isolation. It was done as a part of going
out talking to our regulators, talking to our customers, to customer focus groups, talking to key stakeholders like
legislators, like interveners in our rate cases. And we put together a plan. What they told us was that of all the things
that they wanted us to focus on, they wanted us to focus on improving our reliability bottom line. They wanted us to
improve in our customer care. And so we put a plan in place to do that, we call it our reliability enhancement plan, a lot
of tree trimming as you might guess is part of that plan.
But we also had a component of that plan which was kind of unique at the time and that was to strategically take
overhead lines and covert them to underground lines where it made sense, particularly in the urban areas. And we put in
place a funding mechanism for all that through a rider including a rider that allowed us to take that capital investment
with very little regulatory lag into earnings, so almost on a real-time basis. We got more people out in the community,
we expanded our community presence in order to address one of those concerns we heard from regulators. We also
worked on a number of things to improve our customer satisfaction and customer care.
All those things came together because we talked and dialogued with our key external stakeholders. We're able to put a
plan in; we improved in a lot of operational areas. But we also were able to sell the ground if you will in order for us to
improve our financial performance. We had a number of rate cases over that period of time, 5 major cases over 6 years.
But the success in those cases that ultimately drove the double-digit returns you're talking about Bob was because we
listened, we dialogued, we put in plan or put in place that plan to address those local preferences, local needs and that
local design that you were just talking about. So a great example I think within the distribution segment of what we're
going to do on a larger basis through the operating company model.

So thanks Stuart, and operating company results can be turned around. So let's get into some OPCo specific questions
and Charles I'll put you in the hot seat. In 2009 APCo's ROE was about 7%, you received an order in Virginia for a
base rate case and you filed in West Virginia for a base rate case, what you see is the prospects return in 7% ROE into
something that's in the double digits?
Charles Patton, President and Chief Operating Officer, Appalachian Power
Feel very optimistic. First of all, we have a case currently filed in West Virginia and in Virginia we will be filing next
March as part of our bi-annual case. In addition to that, Virginia has a number of riders or trackers that we'll be eligible
for also and we're evaluating them. And so as we look forward and as we reach out to our commissions as my
colleagues have mentioned and reach out to stakeholders, I am very confident that we will be able to successfully
navigate through these cases and do quite well.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Okay. Venita, a couple of questions for you in SWEPCO, between you and Paul over the last couple of years you
successfully filed rate cases in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. What's your assessment on the potential conflict
between obligations or file those rate cases, invest that capital and ratepayer – the key for rate increases, where were the
opportunities in SWEPCO?
Venita McCellon-Allen, President and Chief Operating Officer, Southwestern
Electric Power Company
Well, Paul and the team did all the heavy lifting on the rate cases and I inherited the good rates that come with that and
the good returns. So, I have to give him credit for that. And as many of you know those rate cases that were filed in
Arkansas and Texas and annually in Louisiana through a formula based rate are the first rate cases that were filed at
SWEPCO in 25 years. And so, we have the big obligation coming of brining both Stall fully and Turk into the rate base
by 2013 or so. And we are very much focused on the headroom that we need to get that work done and we're optimistic
that we do have that headroom available.
Now are we cavalier about it? No, we're not, because a rate increase is a rate increase and it's difficult no matter what it
is. Our rates are some of the lowest in our area, in fact they are the lowest in all of our areas with the exception of
OG&E and Arkansas, who has a case pending. And so, we believe they will pass us if their case is adjudicated. And so,
we have the lowest rate. But customers don't care that their rate are not as low as a neighboring utility. They only care
that their rate is higher than it was last month. And so they, we have to be very cautious, very careful about how we
position rate cases, how well we communicate, how we sow that field, something that we talked about a lot and use that
headroom wisely so that we do get Turk into the rate base a big, big investment for SWEPCO and something that we
take a big responsibility for on behalf of the shareholders in making sure that we do that with as minimum of regulatory
lag as possible.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
And you know Venita, it kind of reminds me thinking about it. When we look at where our rates are, we're in a similar
position in both Indiana and in Michigan and we've got to somehow help people understand the value that we bring to
them. When we went for the rate case in Texas, there were challenges, it was a pretty small rate increase on an absolute
basis, but you got to help people understand that the NFL package that they're paying $50 a month for, that electricity
actually brings more value. And when you go out there and talk to our employees they are really our ambassadors in
the community. So for example, in Indiana Michigan Power, we've got 2,500 employees that are at the soft ball games.
They're standing outside church on Sunday and they have the opportunity to reach out and talk to our customers. And

as part of this operating company model providing that identity to folks to go out there and really talk to our customers
and help them explain the value of electricity is really going to help us.
Venita McCellon-Allen, President and Chief Operating Officer, Southwestern
Electric Power Company
We've got to be strategic about it; we've got to be careful not to pancake too many cases. But to be thoughtful about
how we do it and we do believe that there's room to get Turk into the rate base which is something we're all focused on,
even Paul still at I&M is focused on that.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Fair enough. And a quick fact to it on value proposition, my team told me the other day that plug-in hybrid electric
vehicle and off-peak rates, you charge that vehicle at the equivalent of $0.60 a gallon gasoline, $0.60 a gallon gasoline,
folks there's lots of opportunity in electric sector for value and this team is going to put that opportunity to work. But
speaking about, and you said, you talked about pancakes, right, Venita? Talking about a big pancake, let's talk about
some that impacts SWEPCO rates and that's the Turk Plant. And not only how it – let's – I think on everybody's mind is
how are they – what seems to be the numerous legal proceedings that inevitably are associated with the project as
complex as that, how is all that going at SWEPCO?
Venita McCellon-Allen, President and Chief Operating Officer, Southwestern
Electric Power Company
Well, if you look at the big picture, actually believe it's going well. So if our big picture goals are to gain our required
regulatory approval, start construction of the plant and continue construction of the plant without interruption, we're
doing quite well, that's exactly what we've done. We've gained all the required regulatory approvals. We've started
construction in November of 2008 and we have been busy constructing the plant; on total construction basis we're
about 44% complete on the plant, and we're building the power plant and it's a beautiful plant. You're going to be very
proud of it on behalf of shareholders when you see it.
Now all of this noise that's coming from the interveners and the opponents is a lot of noise. And so certainly it's a
challenge, it's something that we live with every day and we vigorously defend the reputation of the company. We
defend the [audio skip] everyday. I'll certainly be glad to answer more specific questions about that. But I will tell you
we are focused on continuing construction of the plant and we are being successful in doing that.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Venita, I don't know anyone more tenacious than you to make sure that's well Shepparded and that they will get a good
result. Paul, I'll turn to you for a moment though, did I mention by the way that Paul's Ph.D. is in Nuclear Engineering
and we thought it would be kind of cute to put someone with a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering at I&M where we have
our 2 nuclear units. So, you've been there 3 or 4 months now. What's your perspective on the Cook rotor replacements
and potentials to upgrade the Cook plant and how do you plan to address those opportunities along with your fossil
fleet?

Well, Cook just absolutely continues to be a shining star in the Indiana Michigan portfolio. Their performance is
nothing short of outstanding. As we look forward we will be replacing the rotor on the Unit 1 outage in fall of 2011 and
beyond that we'll be making investments in the plant to make sure that we take advantage of our 20-year license
extension that we recently received on for both Cook units.
So we'll make those investments and we continue to look at the potential for an up rate and as I talked about earlier we
absolutely have no shortage of opportunities to put capital to work at Indiana Michigan and across the operating
companies. So what we'll need to do is, is really put that Cook up rate and take that capital investment and kind of put
in the stack and see where does it fall out in terms of going to work for customers and really building a return for
shareholders.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Okay. We teed up Stuart earlier that the environmental regulations are changing frenetically out of Washington. You've
got couple of coal units in Northeastern Green Fork, if I remember, that's right.
Stuart Solomon, President and Chief Operating Officer, Public Service
Company of Oklahoma
Right.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
So what do you see happening for a company the size of PSO as you contemplate scrubbers, SCR enhancements, other
environmental requirements in PSO?
Stuart Solomon, President and Chief Operating Officer, Public Service
Company of Oklahoma
It's actually going to be a great opportunity for us to put this operating company model into good use. We, as Bob said,
we have two coal units at Northeastern, about 950 megawatts total and for a variety of reasons all the environmental
rules that we've been talking about, we're looking at spending several hundred million dollars of environmental controls
in order to comply with those various rules, but before we just start walking down and putting in those sorts of
investments, it's incumbent on us to engage in a very good dialog with our regulators, community leaders, our
legislators and general customer base on what that decision really needs to be. We need to partner with those folks on a
decision of that magnitude for our size of a company.
And so we'll be talking with them about those options and the options really range from putting all those environmental
controls on all the way to retiring the unit and replacing it with something either another capital investment in terms of
a power plant or purchases or whatever we decide to do in concert with them. But I believe that working with them,
we're going to be able to put in place the right kind of decision that includes a funding mechanism for that capital
investment. Again, the operating company model designed to turn those capital dollars into earnings and we think that
it will be a good time for us to work externally and also internally, we're going to have to be prioritizing capital in order
to support that decision. So, we'll be putting the model in place internally as well.

Joe, we haven't forgotten you. You run our biggest operating company for no other reason than that, people are very,
very interested in Ohio. But in addition you've got some interesting activity with ESP that needs to be revised and
you've got the SEET opportunity. So what do you see going on, both in terms of your thoughts about the ESP and
SEET?
Joseph Hamrock, President and Chief Operating Officer, AEP Ohio
Well, we continue to adapt in Ohio to a dynamic regulatory environment and a dynamic market environment, and we
really are between the two, the way the business model works in Ohio. In terms of adapting one of the things that we
were doing, Mike referenced it earlier, as we filed yesterday with the PUCO to merge the two Ohio companies
something that's been long in the making. I've been with the Ohio companies for a fair proportion of my 25-year career.
And the Ohio Power and Columbus Southern entities have been operated as one for nearly two decades now and
acquired – CSP was acquired by AEP back in 1980.
And so, we've come a long way in terms of capturing the synergies to go with combined operations. We're now at that
point where it makes sense to merge the entities, merge Columbus Southern into Ohio Power. That helps us position for
an increasingly dynamic marketplace and the new regulatory environment that we face in Ohio that as a result of
Senate Bill 221 a couple of years ago. Beyond that as you referenced Bob, the ESP – the SEET proceeding is right in
front of us, the hearing for the Columbus Southern-Ohio Power SEET is next week.
We feel that we've put together a very solid methodology, very solid results and the commission has a wide latitude in
terms of how to apply this new instrument. And we're confident that the commission recognizes that the need for
capital investment in this uniquely risky environment that we have in Ohio should bring with it the opportunity for the
kinds of returns that we've seen with Columbus Southern Power in the past year. Certainly not something that we
expect to lock in over time, but the opportunity to earn at those levels is commensurate with the risk we face,
particularly the market risk that we face in Ohio and the opportunity for customers to migrate to other providers.
In terms of the ESP, you will see from the Ohio companies a new ESP filing by the end of the year and it will reflect
the dynamics that I referred to in particular the market environment. We have in our current ESP some legacy rate
design issues, rates that don't necessarily reflect the way the market would structure rates, we expect to show a much
more comprehensive market based rate design in the ESP and an opportunity to be in a much better competitive posture
given the market dynamics that we see in the coming couple of years.
And while the merger itself won't affect rates for the Columbus Southern and Ohio Power company customers, we do
expect in future filings including the upcoming ESP to start to move toward a combined set of rates and programs for
customers and it will position us well for the coming environment.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Okay Joe, let's dig in just a little bit more on something that you alluded to in your comments and that's customer
choice in Ohio, what do you see is the opportunities and the challenges of customer choice for Columbus Southern and
AEP Ohio?
Joseph Hamrock, President and Chief Operating Officer, AEP Ohio
Sure, sure. Customers have long had choice in Ohio, since Senate Bill 3 passed nearly a decade ago. It actually passed
more than a decade ago. The customers have had the opportunity for choice and up until about the midpoint of this year
we saw very low switching rates in the Ohio companies, our rates have been low historically and we saw market prices
that were well above the tariff rates that we presented.

Of course we all know that's changed this year. We saw low rates of switching through mid year, that started to tick up
here in the last quarter or so, but still very low rates. We're at about 2% of our customers migrating away through
September, just less than 5% of the load having switched at this point. And we've got projections in for next year that
show some increase in that.
But one of the things that our team has done is our customers nearly always reach out to our team. Many of my
colleagues have talked about the relationships that we have and customers when presented with these options and these
opportunities to switch, always come to us and ask, how should I evaluate this? And we want them to do that in the
most informed way possible that includes a look forward. Many of the opportunities that they see today are for prices
that will lock them in for two and a half up to three years in some cases and the rates that we have in place expire at the
end of next year. So we encourage them to make sure they make an informed decision that they take a look at all of the
options that they have, including the tariffs that CSP and OP provide.
And so, we're proactively reaching out to customers, making sure that they're making informed decisions. We think that
will help with switching that will be very rational in the near term and will allow us to position more competitively in
the longer term with those customers.
Robert P. Powers, President, AEP Utilities
Okay. Thanks Joe and thanks team. We're going to wrap it up at this point, so we can get on to other parts of the
agenda. But I do want to reemphasize that there are many, many factors that influence circumstance and strategic
response. But we see this battle being won locally and we prepared ourselves to win that battle locally. And I hope by
meeting the operating company presidents you get a sense of their capability, their capacity to deal with this
circumstance and their enthusiasm to deal with this circumstance. They've been looking forward to this responsibility
and they relish the opportunity around their operating companies as a P&L and I know they're going to do just very,
very well.
From that we're going to get efficient use of our capital. We're going to minimize regulatory lag and we're going to
make sure that AEP's strategy is closely aligned to what our regulators and legislatures that our operating companies
believe is important for their regions as well. So, it's going to be a good deal.
With that, we have the pleasant opportunity to turn the agenda over to Nick Akins, who will talk to us about the
challenges coming out of Washington with the Generation team.
Nick Akins, Executive Vice President, Generation
Thank you, Bob. Pleasure to be here today. I want to thank all of you for taking the time to really learn more about
AEP and what we're trying to do in the future. And I think you're going to find out that we're being transformational in
terms of the activities that we're dealing with. And when you look at the EPA, I know there was a – there's a party
running here in New York. I believe that was – the rent is too damn high party. And I think you could easily say that
we're a part of the EPA as too damn aggressive party, but that's not all of the things that we deal with. And when you
look at the market fundamentals and the way they're changing our industry and our resource mix of the future, you're
going to find that AEP is very prompt and ready to address all the issues and to move forward in a very positive way.
I'm going to go through some of the environmental aspects, but first I want to touch on something that Joe Hamrock
mentioned. He did discuss some of the issues around customer migration from CSP. Just note that AEP is a big
company and while it may appear schizophrenic, we do have in commercial operations in the area that I'm responsible
for, we have begun an AEP retail operations, it has been in operation for several months and we're aggressively
pursuing customers in all of the jurisdictions in Ohio.
We're certified to do business in FirstEnergy, Dayton and Duke's footprint as well as AEP and certainly we see that as a
potential for our growth engine in the future in relation to addressing customer needs through the areas that have retail

choice. So, we're very proud of that activity. It's often moving very well and there's something that I think that will be
able to hedge against some of the issues of customer migration.
At the same time, off-system sales margins obviously will be impacted as well as customers migrate, generation is
released and we're able to market that not only in the wholesale market but also in the retail customers through AEP
retail operations. So hopefully you'll see that as a positive. And I really believe from a retail standpoint for those
jurisdictions, we're going to be very measured in our approach. But at the same time, we're going to look at
opportunities throughout our footprint in terms of the ability to grow that type of operation. So we see that as a key for
the future.
I was previously an operating company president and you don't really know how the company actually runs and how
you have to actually allocate capital until you sit in that seat. And certainly it's one that's challenging, because you're
not only addressing the internal needs of the corporation, but you're addressing the community needs, the commissioner
needs and trying to reach the nexus of what is important, through our customers in our company and our shareholders
moving forward. And I think that experience really let us and Bob mentioned that all of us, the executives, are
supportive of moving to this stronger operating company model and it's for that very reason.
As I was going through the process at Southwestern Electric of deciding what generation to put in place in various parts
of the company, it was important for us not only to have hand on what was going on internally within the corporation,
but also being able to manage commissioner and staff expectations of where we were planning to head. And I think
we've managed it very well. All – we're in the third project, two of those projects have been concluded, the Mattison
and Stall facilities have done very well and in fact new construction is going very well from a Turk perspective and we
have every intention in having a facility there that everyone can be proud of, including the people in the community
nearby.
So as we go forward, I want to make sure that we all understand that from a resource mix perspective, we're trying to
move toward a transformation in the future and execution will be key and that's why from an operating company
perspective, we're going to have to be able to put plans together to put in front of the commissioners and customers by
jurisdiction because as we go through the environmental impacts that we're going to deal with, there will be different
answers based upon what jurisdiction and what commission and what customers in each jurisdiction feel like their
resource mix ought to be in the future. And we have to be flexible in that regard.
So I'm going to go back and backtrack just a little bit on the first slide here I just have a background of the AEP
generation capacity, then you all probably already know this but we're by and large coal-fired in the east and but we do
have significant natural gas capacity in our Western footprint. It's largely gone unused until recently with natural gas
prices going down considerably, we do have more utilization of our gas mix in the western footprint. There is also a
lesson for our eastern footprint. As you look at the East, we have the ability from a market perspective, you have the
REX pipeline coming through. You have the Marcellus Shale that's picking up that activity and you have pipeline
suppliers. You are wondering what the fundamentals are going to do around their pipeline capabilities in the future.
AEP East is sitting right in the nexus of all that. And I think that provides us a great opportunity to really put forward
transformational opportunities for not only our customers but in the end, our shareholders as well. So I want to point
you to a couple of things on this slide that I thought were pretty germane. I'm going to save you the trouble of looking
at the fine print, because I do want to focus on the fine print where we say that 91% of our coal is committed. You'll see
from the coal price there and I don't know if there is pointer here or not. Is that a pointer? Okay, well you can see it.
Under average delivery costs in the East, you see that the coal process essentially going down and the estimate for '11
is $51 a ton it's slightly lower than the previous year, and note that its 91% committed.
We actually went to through the process of thinking we were 100% committed last year and we want to be 110%
committed. So, we want to be very flexible in the future in terms of how we deal with coal supply going forward. We're
going to have to contract in a different fashion as well, because as we go – as we look at our risk associated with
potential retirements of small coal-fired units and as well of the market risk of natural gas in the market versus marginal
coal process. We really do need to be mindful of how we commit to future coal supplies and we are being very
judicious about what we do there.

So, we will – there is a very positive story in this though and that is, our commercial operations, our generation, and our
resource planning are working better than they ever had before. We have one of most robust resource planning
processes here at AEP than we've ever had. And the reason is because of the confluence of the activities associated with
whether these small coal units are actually going to run or not. And we've gone to a very significant operation in terms
of our extended startup program. This is first in the industry, is being copied by several others now First Energy, Duke,
others are looking at it; TVA as well. It really is a method by which we're optimizing the use of those small coal-fired
capacity units primarily during the seasonal operational periods.
And when you look at it that coordination is key for us, we will only have additional coal cost that drive up, because
markets higher than $51, we will only do that if there is a market that supports operating those facilities. So if our coal
prices go up it will be because of incremental supplies but by virtue of the margins that we are receiving from the
market that will make sense to it. So, that's the kind of analysis is getting done every single day in terms of how we
operate our – particularly our smaller coal-fired units.
Also I want to point out on the bottom left slide. You will see we have vintage of units and then whether they are
controlled or not controlled. The right side obviously is what we are looking at the older coal-fired units, right over
here; I'll step over here right here. Those units are primarily the older coal-fired units, not controlled, not likely to
succeed in an EPA environment and certainly one that we're very focused on in terms of replacement capacity. Now the
question becomes, how much of that capacity you actually replace and that depends upon what the market does; what
our economy does in terms of coming back, but also in terms of what our options are relative to conversion to natural
gas and other things.
We have investigated how to deal with capacity on these particular units, you'll run into situations and this is some of
our comments relative to the EPA transport rule, you have black start capability, you have voltage control
requirements, you have all those types of issues that you have to look at, not to mention undepreciated plant balances to
deal with from a commission perspective to ensure that we're able to retire these units and replace them on these
Brownfield sites with much more efficient natural gas capacity. That's primarily what we would be looking at although
how much of it will depend on how well we're able to deal with gridSMART Energy efficiency and the other forms of
resources that we look at.
So it will be different by different commissions, but we'll get there with those kinds of plans. So, what I'm actually up
here to talk about is the confluence of all the activities associated with the EPA and what it means to our coal fleet and
Mike was right, the EPA has not evaluated the cumulative effect of all of these rules that are being promulgated on the
existing capacity and when you look at it from a country perspective, there is many things that come together to deal
with the forward-looking cost of coal and when you look at the forward cost of coal, it really is defining what that
threshold level is for retirements of existing capacity and that's something that's very serious because if we retire too
much capacity too quickly we'll not be able to survive from a system dynamics standpoint and that's particularly
important.
So when you look at this, I've sort of shown this as a funnel with several filters but when you look at the clean air
transport rule, the renewables mandates, which essentially take away from baseload type capacity, we have to be
concerned about well what kind of capacity do we actually replace as we go forward and then from a climate change
legislation perspective which we have managed very well from an AEP perspective we've been at the forefront of the
activities in Washington relative to the climate change, and we intend on continuing to do that hopefully we'll be able
to get a two year delay associated with some of these EPA rules so that we can have the right parties together including
Nehru the regulatory commissioners, the DOE, the NERC and FERC and other independent agencies to really take a
rational view of what a transition should look like, but one thing that's in particular that I want to point out to you in
this slide is the pure fundamentals and how they're changing, this is not something that AEP just all of a sudden
decided.
We got this EPA rules coming down we need to do something about it. We started the process a year and half ago in
front of our board, when we were dealing with the climate change aspects and the results were the same. We were – we
know that we're long on capacity, coal capacity; we know we have older coal-fired units; and we're setting in motion

projects that will take care of – and plants that will take care of the issues associated with this type of generation. And
as we look at it the market fundamentals themselves are changing and when you look at natural gas with a 3.80 price
which is about what it is today 3.48, I believe, and you look at a 6,000 heat rate unit that's marginally competitive with
coal capacity. So we have to be able to make sure we enable that transition to occur but it has to be done in a rational
fashion. And when we look at the transport rule, the coal ash rules all those cumulative effects, it does have an impact
in able to define how far we go into the generation set of the need for replacement.
We know we have about 5,000 megawatts of subcritical coal-fired capacity that's on its way out. And this next slide
sort of demonstrates that. I want to mention the dark spread compression the fundamentals obviously are showing and
with the shale gas activities in 2009 we expect that dark spread to continue to migrate toward being essentially neutral.
So if that's the case then even from a marginal perspective, you won't see new coal units built, you'll see natural gas
built in its place and that's something that I think we're very focused on.
So this is what we've been sharing with our board for probably a year and a half, it's been refined as we go a long, but
threshold that I was talking about earlier is really defined in this center category the partially exposed units. We have
several units that we have already said are fully exposed and that's the 5,000 megawatts of subcritical generation; we
need to find replacement for that. The cumulative effect and the time tables and targets associated with the EPA rules
are going to define how far we go into this partially exposed category.
Now, nominally on AEP system like I said the 5,000 megawatts are basically the 200 megawatts subcritical units older,
the partially exposed you get into the 500 megawatt nominal capacity and in fact it could get to 1,300 if it's
uncontrolled. Most of our 1300s are controlled obviously. The only one we've been talking about is Rockport that we
have to make a decision on. But, normally the partially exposed are the 500 megawatt units and the cumulative impact
of the EPA rules are going to define how far we can go. Obviously when you're looking at spending $1 billion on a
scrubber in SCR versus building new capacity with natural gas or whatever, we have to stop and take a look at that.
And that's what the operating company Presidents will be looking at as they go to the commissions and say, here's what
the options are. And when they define those options for the commission, obviously the commissions are our boss in
many respects because we need that revenue to support the shareholders' investment we're going to do what they tell us
to do. So as we go forward, we'll make sure that we are putting those plans together plenty time in advance with the
commission so that there is a firm understanding to enable that regulatory recovery.
From a national standpoint, it's very serious when you look at it. The partially exposed category and the least exposed
category, you get upwards to around 40%, 40% to 50% of the fleet in this country. And if you're looking at retiring this
amount of generation in the 2014 to 2016 timeframe, that's very ominous in terms of our ability to keep our system
operating the way it should and make sure the economies operate the way they should and cost impacts are mitigated.
And that's something I think that we have to have in terms of a rational plan moving forward.
So what is AEP doing at this point? Obviously I mentioned earlier our plan for the old, smaller coal-fired units. We did
seasonal operations, our extended startup program where smaller units will not operate unless there is a critical need for
them to operate and in fact if we're making margins off of our ability to operate those units. We'll transition them
toward retirement. You probably already know that we did file for, in Ohio, for retirement Sporan four and five unit
and that's test case for us to figure our exactly what the issues are going to be. Obviously un-depreciated plant balances
are, we want to make sure we continue to recover those. But, also you can't credibly – this is sort of a unique situation
with Sporan four and five because it was already slated for retirement, but as we go forward with these other units we
need to be able to tell the commission what the replacement is going to be, what the plan is for developing and retiring
this generation. So the regulatory plans for recovery are going to be extremely important.
We'll continue to evaluate partially exposed units. As Mike said earlier we're heavily invested in the activity associated
from our legislative front and from a EPA front. We've made our comments. Our commissioners have commented on
what the EPA is doing, trying to get some realm of reasonableness associated with the time table and targets. If we're
successful in doing that there'll obviously be a much more balanced view going forward of our partially exposed units
and that's what we're intending to do. But, we're not sitting by waiting for that kind of result to occur because
interestingly enough we are long on coal capacity in the East, we know that and we're going about the process of

making sure that we're ready for the future.
So the ways that we're doing at this point is we're adding non coal-fired generation. Clean coal is something that we're
obviously slated for in the future. We haven't made any investments and we're not going to make any investments in the
near term in new nuclear or coal-fired capacity at this point other than Turk. We'll finish up Turk but we are looking at
the possibility of starting our Dresden facility. And we're also looking at new natural gas facilities on brownfield sites.
We already having permitting, we already have the site, water and so forth. So it's going to be very economical to
convert those in some respect.
We have moved away from re-powering, refueling those types of options because it really is suboptimal given the new
technologies of natural gas-fired capacity with a quick start capability and with the ability to serve not only from a
energy perspective, from a capacity perspective as well, so we will replace with new facilities. And then renewables
you know that we did announce a new solar farm in Ohio. So we're moving on the solar front, but we'll do that to the
extent that we have requirements for those renewable mandate. And we'll be – certainly be concerned about the
ultimate cost on our customers to make sure there is a balanced view of looking at those – the entire portfolio calls in
the changes there.
We also are working on new technologies and Mike mentioned earlier, we're visiting with the Chinese and others, the
Indians, the Canadians, the Australians around the world trying to get support for the second phase of our Carbon
Capture & Storage project. We intend on coal being a part of the picture of the energy mix of this country moving
forward. And for us, I know invariably we're on a – if we're on a panel, we're the coal guys that are on the panel, we
have a much more balanced view of that because we do have to review what our customer requirements are and those
needs are but we want to ensure that coal remains a large piece of the fuel mix of this country because it is an
indigenous resource that supports the vitality of the economies that we serve.
The energy storage technologies and gridSMART activities and we have four gridSMART pilots that are continuing to
operate in Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio and Indiana. Those are really providing lessons learnt not only for us but the
commissions that are involved with those projects to understand what can actually be done at the customer end. We're
dealing with much more system efficiencies as well from integratable VaR control to Community Energy Storage.
Those types of activities are going to be transparent to the customer and will probably make a lot of sense to do anyway
as opposed to some of the issues where customers decide within their homes. So we'll continue that progress and that
will be a part of our portfolio mix for the future. And as we go forward, you will see that we're much more receptive.
We're not assuming like we did 20, 30 years ago, what's the next central station generation, what's the next investment
to be made in our central station generation. We're going to make wise decisions about whether this generation should
even continue to operate, whether we should continue to invest in it and then what the replacement capability is and
support the operating company Presidents as they make their decisions with the commissions.
So again, I want to thank you for the time and I'll turn it over to Susan Tomasky now, who is going to talk about the
next growth engine for AEP the Transmission play. Susan?
Susan Tomasky, President, AEP Transmission
Morning, everyone. It's terrific to be here this morning to be able to talk about AEP's Transmission strategy. 2010 has
been a year in which we've been able to put some meaningful points on the board with respect to our transmission
strategy. And of course, it is a year as we've talked to you in the past, it's a year in which we've worked very hard to
build the regulatory platform required to grow this business at the pace that we intend to grow it.
I want to talk today as I have in the past about the progress we've made of the three legs of our transmissions strategy.
And I also want to share with you a little bit more information than perhaps we have in the past about some specifics
around how that investment is going to unfold over the coming four, five years and what we can see in terms of
earnings contribution.

As you know, we have three things that we're – three areas we're pursuing aggressively in order to make this
transmission strategy viable in the near-term, the mid-term and the longer term. Texas moves forward aggressively. It is
an operating utility company with the rate base and we've received CCN approval. For one line, I'll talk a little bit more
about CREZ in a minute. The Transco strategy also moves forward as we have a settlement in front of FERC and
continued to plan investment in that area. I'll update you a bit on some of our joint venture and I also want to assure you
that this is not the end of the story. We continue to work on new deals all the time and I am very hopeful although we
have nothing to announce today that we'll have two very interesting deals to be talking to you about very soon.
So, let's talk about ETT. ETT is an operating utility company. It has a rate base of 385 million and it's expected to grow
every year significantly over the next several years by 2013 and that's the point at which the CREZ projects come on,
we should have a rate base of that company of $1.4 billion. The progress on CREZ, of course is critical to this and that
is where we're moving pretty quickly. ETT had the only anonymous settlement on the citing of the line and that
settlement has been approved by the Texas Commission. That's the Clear Crossing to Dermott line and it's 95 miles for
$160 million of investment. Engineering work is going forward. We have three more lines that are also, as you can see,
on a schedule to get the citing and the certificate work done. And we do plan that we will have the CREZ lines done in
the timeframe that we talked about. The PUCT continues to confirm there commitment to the need for these lines and
we continue to believe that we are operating in territories where citing is very feasible and that we're going to produce
the results that we said we would with respect to CREZ.
And we have also identified another $1.6 billion of investment over time through 2017. These are opportunities that are
now in the hands of ETT transferred from our Texas operating companies, significant new projects that will work their
way through the ERCOT approval process, so that we think there is – we have a plan that ETT will be a $3 billion
company by the year 2017.
If you look at our Transco strategy, again, this is a very important part of AEP's transmission strategy in the near to
midterm. This is exciting for us because it's a 100% AEP investment, it draws on opportunities within our footprint and
has dual benefits for AEP. It has both the benefit of providing transmission growth and also an opportunity to access
capital from different sources in order to be able to relieve some capital pressure from our operating companies and
move forward with a transmission-only investment strategy under FERC – regulated rates. Key to that of course is
getting the FERC rate in place, and this has been something that we've worked on good part of this year; and I'm
pleased to say that we now have a settlement that's pending in front of the FERC for approval under exactly the terms
that we hoped that we would get.
We were seeking to mirror the settlement terms that we had in place with respect to our wholesale customers in the east
and west, and that's pretty much what we have. They report a 11.49 return in the east in the PJM customers and 11.2 in
SPP.
That settlement has unanimous support on the ROE issues. The only significant outliner on the policy issues, the
Indiana Commission, who continues to raise questions at the commission about whether or not the Transco is a good
idea. Everyone else is in full support. We feel very comfortable on the record that FERC will support it. And we are
going to continue to be working through Paul Chodak and our team in Indiana, and we feel very comfortable that once
we get in front of the Indiana Commission with our specific proposal, that they will see the benefits for Indiana and
we'll be able to go forward.
Our spending for this year, $50 million, was more modest than we had hoped for this year. But we're going to plan to
make that up in the coming couple of years. What we've done is focus our investment in Ohio, where we have an
applications pending, but where there appears to be strong receptivity to the commission. And in fact, it is effectively
the same rate effect on a pass-through basis as we have under the Ohio tariff now. So understandably, Ohio has got
plenty else to think about right now at the commission; but we do believe that this is just a matter of time of getting it
out the door once the FERC settlement is confirmed.
And of course in Oklahoma and Michigan, we have a lot of – we don't actually require regulatory approval for
formation of these Transcos. So we're able to move forward with those investments without going through a regulatory
structuring proceeding in those states.

And in fact, that's where our focus will be in terms of our investment; has been in 2010, and will be in 2011. 2011 will
be a year in which we will work to get our Transco filings done in our other states, and you'll see investment planned in
those other states for the Transco in 2012.
I want to talk a little bit also about the progress that we're making on our joint ventures, and I want to spend in
particular a little bit of time with respect to PATH, where I think that there is obviously a great deal of interest in a very
important part of AEP's transmission strategy. The PATH project, to remind you, is a $2.1 billion project. AEP's
investment is about 700 million of that, and we have an allowed return with incentives at FERC of 14.3%. This is
obviously an extremely ambitious project and one that will require us to navigate some significant challenges in the
state commission.
The key to that and our ability to do that lies in the support that we have had and continue to have pretty strongly from
PJM. PJM – although they have in recent years moved the date around – they have confirmed consistently over the
course of this year that there are very significant reliability issues, both from a voltage support perspective and a
capacity perspective in the year 2015. They've been quite emphatic about that. Back in June, they [audio skip] public,
it's on the PJM website that says please do everything possible, make the investment to meet this 2015 date. In every
discussion that they have had publicly since then, they have confirmed the importance of that date.
The affidavits and the filings that they have made as we have reactivated the regulatory proceedings in the three states
continue to be consistent with that. We have re-filed in Virginia with strong support from PJM and we have renewed
the activity in both Virginia and Maryland, where we continue to go forward.
PJM has indicated that the RTEP is final with respect to PATH. They continue to do evaluations, because it just seems
like that's what PJM does. But I do believe – and it will be our job to translate PJM in these state proceedings, so that
they do understand how critical this is. But if you look at the affidavits that have been filed by PJM recently and look to
coming board action that we think will continue to confirm it, I feel very good about our prospects to complete this
process. It is challenging to get through these regulatory proceedings and get this deal on the ground by 2015. But it's
urgently needed, and we're going to do it.
The second important step forward has been with respect to the Prairie Wind project. This is a project that has been
approved as a priority project by the Southwest Power Pool. And it's a project where we are already beginning the
engineering, beginning the siting process in the State of Kansas; and that too is another project that will get into service
within the near term.
With respect to Tallgrass, which was another piece that we have been pursuing, the future of that project does rest on
future deliberation from the Southwest Power Pool with respect to the voltage at which that will be built. That could
well be a long-term process. We are continuing to support the SPP in their deliberations on that issue. We do believe
that as a technical matter, the right thing to do with respect to SPP is to continue to pursue an overlay at the 765 level.
But as I've told you in the past, we intend to be ready to build. The time to projects that will be approved, and we will
continue to see I think either through PSO or other utilities, we're going to see significant opportunities either through
the Transco and other joint ventures with respect to SPP.
The other point I want to make with respect to future projects is the Pioneer project, which as I'm sure many of you
know has being lingering for a while. It's a project proposed by [inaudible] Duke has been identified by MISO as an
important part of their RGOS study. This is not obviously a decision to build, but an important step forward in
understanding, as MISO goes forward, identifying the projects that they would like to see developed for purposes of
wind integration of MISO and PJM.
The challenge, of course, for that project is that it sits on the seams between MISO and PJM, and the RTOs have not
done a very good job of figuring out how to do that. I'm going to talk in a minute about the efforts that Turk is making
in order to make the necessity of that a little more apparent to the RTOs, and hopefully even to make it a little easier for
them.

The last thing that you should watch is the results of our SMART Study. We understood the need for a significant
analysis to underpin the development of a system to bring – to harvest the wind from the upper Midwest, and we talked
to other utilities in the area, we agreed to support a comprehensive study. We did that with the full participation of the
RTOs. And we now have two phases of that study public. One are the design features, and the other is the cost benefit
analysis that does show significant benefit to moving forward. The next phase will be commercialization of specific
projects around smart grid, and that's something that we are actively working on with other partners.
So I want to talk about what all this capital investment means and how you can look at it, what to expect in the coming
years. And what – obviously, our capital investment is subject to a number of variables. It's subject to regulatory
approvals, it's subject to RTO review in some cases. But what I hope this slide does is illustrate for you how this
investment builds up, what we feel comfortable putting in our base case, and what will be the things that will determine
our ability to realize those higher levels in investment and the higher levels of earning.
So if you look at the blue down at the bottom – oops, I thought that was a pointer but it wasn't. We failed on pointing
today, apparently. If you look at the blue at the bottom, that is ETT. And the ETT investment that I have described is
very much in line with what's been approved through CREZ, that comes online in 2013. And the rest of that growth are
the additional projects, the 1.6 billion, that as I suggested will work its way through ERCOT over a period of time.
If you look then next at the green, those are the projects, the JV projects, with which we have a fairly high level of
confidence. As I said, Prairie Wind is already approved, that's the smaller part of that green. But the other is PATH, an
approved project, one for which we have a rate in place, the job there is to get it through the states and get it online by
2015.
When you then get to the gray, what you see is the Transco investment. And what we've done is to reflect our very
specific projections for the year 2011 and 2012, which as I mentioned is $160 million, 350 respectively. And we
continue to see the opportunity – assuming that we can move forward with the Transcos in our other jurisdictions – we
continue to see the opportunity for comparable investment.
The Transco investment is an investment to enhance and to extend the current transmission system. There is great need
across our system for transmission investment. We have a lot of old facilities, I know you hear that from other utilities.
But what the Transco does is give us the opportunity to direct capital specifically to this investment under the FERC
formula rates.
And we believe that with the Transco filings up and running – the Transco companies up and running – we're going to
be in a position to realize that investment. And as you see, it has the potential to be quite significant as you get to the
post 2013 era.
And then the high case box – which is the box that has the dotted line around it – really are the future investments. And
we have not chosen to try to put too much around that in terms of dollars with any specificity. But these include things
like the projects that will come out of the SMART study. They include future SPP development. They include pioneer
other projects very much in the works, things we're actively involved in and thing we will continue to pursue with
partners around the country.
And I do emphasize that there continues to be a huge amount of excitement in this space. This is way more like
baseball than basketball, and the – which is good because I like baseball. And it is something that requires us to move
in steps, and as a consequence, it is hard to – perhaps you don't understand when we attach so much significance to
these steps, but they are very significant. PATH is very well placed. The Transco opportunity is very well placed. And I
do believe you're going to see some pretty significant and very interesting announcements in the near future.
I'd like to conclude by spending a couple of minutes talking about where regulatory policy is going. We have talked a
lot about the importance of regulatory change to our strategy, even as we've been very vigorous in pushing through
projects within the regulatory frameworks that we currently have. But I do want to make sure, particularly as legislation
appears not to be on the horizon in the immediate future, I want to make sure that you understand the importance of
some of the regulatory progress that has been made, some of the policy evolution that's going to complement what we
and others in the transmission sector are trying to accomplish because 2010 really was a year in which a number of

important things moved forward.
From our perspective, I think I could probably say, maybe the single most important thing that happened was the
approval of the cost allocation methodology in the Southwest Power Pool. That was important because it provided the
basis for approval of our Priority Projects that includes Prairie Wind as well as a project that we will be developing
through our Oklahoma Transco primarily.
And these are really – so this is a very significant step forward to have addressed this. It was supported by SPP on a
consensus basis and importantly pointed to by FERC not only as something they were prepared to prove but as a model
for other regions. So we are very excited about the progress that was made with respect to SPP, and also related to that,
the approval of the Priority Projects that will serve as the basis for future development in that area.
I also want to point your attention to the work that has been done in the Midwest ISO in looking more broadly at
transmission needs. This is something that has been very important to us for a long period of time. We believe that
transmission planning has been trapped by a bright line test where the solution is to solve yesterday's reliability
problem and that the vision required to think about reliability, congestion relief, and the integration of resources has
been a very difficult thing for the RTOs to embrace.
MISO stepped out of that mould both with respect to the RGOS Study and their identification of Multi-Value Project.
And this is a really important step forward and I think was important in feeding FERC initiative with respect to the
NOPR. And so I'll close by touching on that briefly. What FERC is attempting to do is explore the limits of its
authority. And I think it's quite clear that it intends to push as far as it can to facilitate precisely the kind of transmission
development that AEP has been talking about for the last couple of years.
They have proposed and asked for proposals on how to mandate the RTOs to move and to address these issues, to deal
with cost allocation more broadly both within the RTOs as well as on a seams basis to require other RTOs beyond the
ones who are attempting to explore multi-value projects to have them look at those as well. So it's a very exciting step
forward from that perspective.
FERC also recognized that cost allocation and planning are part of the same puzzle. And they have also begun to ask
the RTOs and they asked significant questions in this NOPR about what can be done to try to identify projects that
serve this broad range of policy purposes. These are very exciting steps forward. It is obviously tricky ground for the
FERC and not everybody loves it quite as much as we do. But I will tell you that I think they are passionate about it and
I believe that it has changed the scope of the policy today and created momentum that we're going to do everything
possible that we can to build on.
So with that, I am going to conclude my remarks, and with pleasure, turn it over to Brian Tierney, who is going to talk
to you about third quarter results and give you a financial update. Thank you.
Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Susan. Before we get started, we've had your attention for nearly two hours and are very grateful for that.
But we would like to reward people with a humanitarian break if we can go ahead and do that. I think that might be in
order at this time. We still have plenty of time to answer questions, go over third quarter results and forecast for 2011.
If we could be back here at 10:05 sharply that would be great. And we'll get started again at that time. Thank you,
everybody.

Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay, good morning, everyone, and thank you again for being here. Appreciate the time that you've put into this and

The topics that I am going to cover today are going to be quarterly and year-to-date earnings; guidance for 2011 with
some detail on capital allocation and expenditures; an overview of AEP's dividend policy and record with
management's recommendation for a dividend increase; and an overview of AEP's liquidity and financing; and a view
of AEP's long-term earnings per share growth rate.
Let's start by looking on page 24. At the third quarter 2010, performance where AEP earned $552 million for the
quarter, $1.15 per share versus $443 million or $0.93 per share in 2009.
We have listed for you some of the detail on the right-hand side of the slide. And let me go through some of the major
reconciliations. On the positive side, rate changes accounted for $0.10 per share or $74 million. Weather accounted for
a full $0.18 per share or $131 million. And this reflects the fact that this was the third hottest summer in the east part of
AEP's system and the fourth hottest summer in the west part of AEP's system in the last 30 years. Off-system sales
were positive $0.06 per share or $42 million.
On the negative side of the ledger, firm wholesale margins were down $0.03 or $21 million. O&M net of offsets
accounted for negative $0.02 per share or $12 million due to employee-related expenses in the third quarter. And other
utility operations net accounted for negative $0.09 per share or 83 million and were mostly related to the loss of the
Cook accidental outage insurance policy.
Turning to slide five, we'll take a look at the September year-to-date numbers where you'll see that year-to-date AEP
has earned $1.272 billion or $2.65 a share, versus 1.124 billion or $2.49 a share for the year-to-date period in 2009. At
this time, we're revising 2010 full year guidance to the range of 2.95 to 3.05, which is the narrowed mid-point range of
the previously announced guidance of $2.80 to $3.20 per share.
Overall, the themes that we are talking about here in the year-to-date period are much the same as they were in the
quarterly period with the major positive comparisons including rate changes, which accounted for positive $0.25 a
share, $175 million; weather, which accounts for positive $0.29 per share or $202 million as 2010 is on track to be the
most extreme year in terms of heating degree days and cooling degree days combined for AEP in the last 30 years.
Off-system sales is positive $0.06 per share, all from the third quarter. Year-to-date O&M net of offsets is positive
$0.05 per share or $38 million.
Principal negative comparisons to last year's year-to-date numbers include share count effect of $0.16 per share
reflecting 479 million average shares outstanding versus 452 million last year, reflecting the dividend reinvestment
program and the equity issuance of 2009. Firm wholesale margins which accounted for negative $0.08 per share or $58
million due again to the loss of the wholesale contract customers. In other utility operations net being negative $0.32
per share or 275 million and reflects the loss of the Cook accidental outage insurance, higher interest expense, higher
depreciation and amortization, and higher other taxes for the year-to-date period.
Many of you are interested in how for so far ahead for weather and at 2.65 for the year-to-date period, we are guiding
to the mid-point of the range. There are a couple of offsets that have been reflected and we've talked about as we've
gone throughout the year. Clearly, retail load is not recovering as we had talked about and that continues as we had
forecast and that continues to be the case as we make our way through the year. We are heading into the outage
component of the generation season. So O&M will be up, and versus last year, there certainly won't be a repeated
positive income tax effect that we reflected last year. So those are offsets to the balance of the year that you may want
to factor in as you look to the balance of the year.
Let's turn to slide 26, and we'll look at some of the normalized retail load trends that we've experienced as we've gone
through the year and we'll also start giving you some guidance into what the numbers look like for 2011. The third
quarter of 2010 residential normalized loads were up 1.3% and that brings the year-to-date number to 1.2%. We're
forecasting a similar rate of recovery for 2011 in the residential retail sector.
You've heard from Joe and Venita earlier in the presentation about how commercial sales have continued to struggle as
we've worked our way through the year. The third quarter commercial sales were down 1.6%, bringing the year-to-date
for 2010 to a negative 0.4% and we're forecasting a modest recovery of 0.3% in the 2011 period.

Looking at the bottom left-hand side of the chart, you'll see that the industrial class, which was the hardest hit a year
ago, has steadily recovered. The third-quarter comparison to last year is up 6%, bringing the year-to-date up 4.8%, and
we're forecasting continued recovery in the industrial sector of 3.6%. We'll give you a little bit of color on some of the
industrial sector as well, which we've done in the past that I think you may be interested in.
The top five industrial sectors, which represent 59% of our industrial sales, were up 5.8% and 3.7% for the quarter and
year versus 2009, respectively. In fact, for our top 10 industrial sectors, all of them were up for the quarter and the year.
Notable among these are primary metals, our largest industrial class, which is up 9.6% and 3.5% for the quarter and
year, respectively; and the industrial mining class, excluding oil and gas mining, our fourth largest class, which was up
7.8% and 3.1% for the quarter and year, respectively.
On the bottom right-hand side of the chart, you'll see overall normalized retail sales for the quarter and year being up
0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. And we're forecasting overall normalized load recovery of 1.7% for the 2011 period.
We'll do a deeper dive on page 27on the 2011 earnings drivers. You've heard this management team say several times
that we're forecasting load growth, as the economy continues to struggle, of our underlying utility business to be in the
2% to 4% range. And we are forecasting 2011 earnings in the $3 to $3.20 per share, which is squarely in the midpoint
of that range.
We'll start with some of the reconciliation from the midpoint of this year's range to the midpoint of next year's range.
And clearly, we can't forecast positive weather that we've had this year since it's been such an extreme weather year to
the positive for our sales and if we adjust for that, that's a negative $0.20 comparison to next year or $148 million.
Non-utility and parent will represent negative $0.08 per share or 40 million and reflects lower anticipated earnings from
the generation of marketing sector; the absence of a gain on the sale of ICE Exchange – of IntercontinentalExchange
shares, which occurred this year and won't be repeating next year; and the absence of some favorable tax true-ups in
2010, which also are not expected to be repeated next year.
We talked a little bit about and Joe talked to some degree about this customer switching in Ohio. And he said that's
slightly less than 5% particularly in the commercial sector sales where for the first time we are seeing wholesale prices
dip below the ESP prices in that sector. We continue to watch how switching occurs as we go through the balance of
the year, and are forecasting that to pick up somewhat next year, to a total of about 14% of Columbus and Southern's
total overall sales. That impact will have a negative $0.07 per share or $53 million in 2011. We believe that additional
switching in both Columbus and Southern and AEP Ohio – I'm sorry, Ohio Power – will be negligible, due to the fact
that wholesale prices continue to remain above the ESP prices that we have there.
Other utility costs net are forecast to be unfavorable by $0.06 per share and reflect about $0.02 per share of share count
dilution and $0.06 per share of increased depreciation and taxes, partially offset by reduced interest expense.
Off system sales net of sharing for next year are forecast to account for a negative penny compared to this year. That
would be $286 million in 2011 on volumes of 21,600, versus $293 million expected this year on volumes of 19,400
gigawatt hours. We're anticipating natural gas prices to be about the same next year as they are this year in the $4.40 in
MMBtu range, and the AEP date and hub prices to be very similar to this year's in the $38 to $40 of megawatt hour
range. We're anticipating increased volumes due to some of the customer switching that we've experienced and lower
forced and planned outages for next year.
Transmission operations, which reflect earnings from our Transcos and transmission joint ventures, are expected to
earn 23 million in 2011 versus 10 million in 2010 for a positive $0.02 per share comparison.
On the operations and maintenance expense side, we've talked to you about the discipline and effort that we've been
putting into our cost cutting initiative. And we're starting to see that investment pay off, in that O&M cost net of offsets
will account for positive $0.04 per share next year, or 131 million. You'll see in the detailed slides in the back that
O&M increases about 100 million from about $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion overall; but we are recovering an incremental
$129 million in trackers and other rate revenue offsets, meaning that O&M net only actually decreased by 31 million.
This increase is after other increase – this decrease is after other increases and operating expenses. which means that

the employee base is very focused on maintaining that O&M discipline.
Load recovery, which we discussed on the prior page, will account for positive $0.14 per share or $100 million, and
reflects the increase in total normalized load of 1.7%.
Rate relief is expected to contribute positive $0.32 per share or $235 million in 2011. Of this amount, AEP has already
secured 158 million or 67%. Remember back during the hype of our environmental CapEx program, we secured as
much as $659 million in annual rate relief. Given our reduced CapEx program and the reluctance of regulators to pass
on huge increases at this point, we believe that this amount of rate increase is appropriate and achievable.
I'm going to stop for a moment and talk about some of the pool impacts that have been discussed a fair amount in the
investment community of late. At a high level, I think many of you are familiar with AEP's East Generating Pool. At a
high level, it allocates the capital and energy charges along with off-system sales among the East AEP Generating
companies. This agreement has been in place for the last 59 years and has served the customers and the companies of
AEP's East system very well during all kinds of cycles, during periods of capacity and energy surplus, deficit during
business cycles that have been up and down and during extended plant outages, it's allowed for smoothing of costs over
time to the East operating companies.
While this has served the company and the customers very well for the last 59 years, we regularly look at opportunities
as to whether or not it's time to modify or terminate the pool in some future period. As we do this, we're not just
looking at today's capital or capacity and energy prices. We're looking at a whole number of factors that need to be
taken into account. And we do this regularly. We look at potential environmental regulations, capacity retirements,
RTO, design, must-run requirements and energy price – in addition energy pricing and capacity pricing.
We have to give an opinion and form an idea of what all of these factors and the costs of them mean to the various
customers and operating companies as we go forward. If at the end of this current analysis that we're engaged in, it's
determined that it does make sense to terminate or modify the agreement, we'll do so in a slow, measured manner;
taking into account the interest of our customers, the companies and the shareholders.
We're confident that we can do this, because we've been through this process before in the early 2000s when we cut an
arrangement that modified the pool significantly as we were approaching an idea of corporate separation into a
regulated and deregulated company. At that time, there was a long-term contract back from the surplus companies to
the deficit companies in a manner that met everybody's needs. The customers and the companies had the issues that
they needed resolved in terms of access to capacity, energy and other such and off-system sales, and the company had
its interests met in terms of its earnings requirements during that period.
There's been a lot of questions about Ohio Power and the fact that it receives positive capacity payments from other
deficit members of the pool; but it also shares with those members of the pool its energy and it shares its off-systems
sales with those other companies. If Ohio was on its own for whatever reason – and this wouldn't happen quickly
without everyone having some transparency into that issue – it could certainly sell its capacity and energy into the
market, but it would also get to keep all of its off-system sales.
How would this impact Ohio? Again, you can't just look at today's pricing in energy and decide if it's a good or bad
thing for AEP Ohio. Perhaps if AEP Ohio or Ohio Power had been in that situation, it would have sold its capacity and
energy forward when energy prices were high. And I can assure you, we would certainly manage the risk of the
capacity and energy in Ohio Power differently under that scenario than we would today.
In any event, there are many issues that need to be considered. These issues will be considered with our customers, the
companies, regulators and our shareholders in mind. It will be thoughtful and methodical in how we go about doing it.
It will be transparent and public and more confident that as much as we did in the early 2000s, we'll be able to meet
solutions for all of our stakeholders as we go about looking at any modification of the pool arrangement.
Let's turn to slide 28 and talk about capital allocation. I wish I'd started counting at the beginning of today's discussion
how many times members of this management team had used the word capital allocation or capital efficiency. I hope
that those of you in the audience and those of you listening on the web understand that this management team gets it.

That we are a capital-intensive company in a capital-intensive industry. And we're acutely focused on where we spend
our next 100 million, 50 million – or in the example that Charles gave, $6 million – as we go about thinking about
where to put our capital to work.
We get it, we're focused on it. We know that that's what we need to do to be successful as a management team for the

With that in mind, in the near future, this management team has looked at where we put our capital to work in the near
future. And so we are putting some portion of capital to work as Mike said at the beginning of the discussion, for
capital growth. We want to put plough money back into the business to provide service to our customers, because we
have an obligation and the desire to serve them; but also because we want to grow earnings for our shareholders. And
that's why we're increasing the capital budget by $150 million in 2011, and we're calling for a capital budget of 2009 –
I'm sorry, of 2012 of 2.9 billion.
We are also returning capital to our shareholders in the form of an increased dividend, which will be recommended to
our board of directors for the fourth quarter of this year. It is always been a component of this company's culture and
history that we return current period earnings to our shareholders, and we intend to do that through the increase and the
dividend, which will bring us into line with many of our peers and will certainly be sustainable.
And then we're also putting capital to work reducing risk on our balance sheet. This year we had planned to put $150
million to work reducing pension liabilities on our balance sheet and as we looked at the years that went through we
actually increased that amount to $500 million for the year bringing our un-funded pension liabilities much lower. We
anticipate allocating additional 150 million for pension liabilities in 2011.
Our focus is on returning – is making a competitive return in the marketplace and we're certainly planning on managing
the company for the long-term. We get capital allocation. We know it's our job. We're acutely focused on it.
Let's take a look at some of the detail of that. Turning to slide 29, you will see that in 2009 the company spent about 2.5
billion in CapEx and in 2010 we anticipate spending about 2.2 billion. Previously when we talked about spending in
2011 we had talked about 2.5 billion and we're increasing that to about 2.6 billion with incremental spending in
transmission and new generation, some of which you heard Susan and Nick talk about.
In 2012 we are planning on spending 2.9 billion in capital significantly more in the Transco's particularly Ohio,
Michigan and Oklahoma and in our transmission JVs particularly PATH and Prairie Wind as Susan just updated you
on. The Transco and JV spend in 2011 is significant, but the spend in 2012 really starts to produce some earnings
growth from the transmission growth side of our story.
Let's take a look at liquidity and financing for the company as we look ahead to 2011. First let's talk about the core
credit facilities that underpin our liquidity position, both of these today are undrawn. There are two $1.5 billion credit
facilities the first of which was to come due in 2011. And we renewed in June of this year with lots of support from our
banking partners significantly overscribed, favorable terms and pricing for that credit facility and it was a smashing
success to be able to get that in place nearly a year ahead of the expiration of that facility.
We are going to be looking to do the same thing again with the facility that comes due in April of 2012 as we work our
way through 2011 and anticipate the pricing terms and support from our banking partners will be just as strong as it
was in the first renewal.
On the financing highlight side, our credit metrics are expected to remain solidly in the BBB to Baa2 range with debt to
total capital in the 55% to 59% range, and FFO to debt in the mid-to-high teens.
We expect to access the capital markets in 2011 to a little bit greater than a $1 billion and that comprises maturities of
about $620 million. We expect to take advantage of the current low rate environment to have some possible redemption

and we expect to access the debt markets for some incremental debt as well to fund the transmission and new
generation projects.
We expect net debt to increase finally about $50 million as we go through the year. Our cash flows are supportive of
both our capital program and the dividend program that we discussed.
Turning to page 31, let's take a look at the dividend policy and recommendation. I know many of you know that in June
of this year, the company celebrated paying its 400th consecutive dividend. In September, we announced the payment
of our 401st quarterly dividend. I think that should give you some sense that our board of directors and the culture of
the company is dedicated to paying out a consistent portion of the current period earnings in form of a dividend to
shareholders.
Management, as we discussed a couple of times at this meeting, will recommend an increase in the quarterly dividend
by 9.5% in the fourth quarter clearly subject to the approval of the board of directors that will increase the quarterly
dividend payment from $0.42 to $0.46 a share and the annual payment will go to $1.84 a share.
Let's look at the right hand side of the page here; we have a chart for you. And assuming the dividend increase, the
compound annualized growth rate for the dividend since 2004 is 4% which mirrors the compound annualized growth
rate for earnings for the same period. Rewarding shareholders through dividend increases consistent with the earnings
growth has been a hallmark during the Mike Morris era at American Electric Power.
American Electric Power is at the bottom end of the slide; American Electric Power stated dividend payout ratio
remains in the 50% to 60% of earnings and at 2011 earnings of $3.10 this increased dividend will put us at 59.4% of
earnings and brings our payout ratio into line with many of our peers and reflects AEP's commitment to reward its
shareholders with current period earnings.
Let's go to slide 32 and we'll take a look at AEP's long-term earnings per share growth rate and prospects. We've been
consistent in our message that during the recovering economy, our traditional utility operations will return 2% to 4%
earnings per share growth and certainly the midpoint of our guidance for 2011 at 3.10 is squarely within that range.
As we look to the period 2012 to 2014, we believe that we can put capital to work at about twice the rate of
depreciation and earn returns in the 10.5% to 11% range. This period of our story is slow, steady growth within the
means of our balance sheet. Anticipated financings need to grow during this period are financed exclusively with cash
flow from operations, the dividend reinvestment program and incremental debt at current debt ratings.
For the period after 2014, we believe we can grow earnings per share at an average annual growth rate between 5% and
7%. We can do this by continuing to invest in our underlying utilities, while investing incremental capital at the
relatively higher blended ROEs that our Transco's and transmission JVs allow for.
We will not waver in our focus on capital allocation. We're going to continue to focus where can we earn higher ROEs
and places where our ROEs are lagging. I think you got a sense from listening to the operating company presidents that
they are acutely focused on getting those ROEs improved so we can continue to invest for the benefit of our customers
and our shareholders and that will be a key component of our growth strategy going forward.
In the end, the higher end of our growth rate is going to be driven by earnings from our transmission story which we
expect to significantly juice our earnings growth rate.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Morris for some wrap up comments and then we'll have some questions.
Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, if you could turn to slide 33, I guess, I can – there you go, thank you; pretty simple, pretty straightforward. We're
pretty excited about where we are. We're pretty excited about where we've been. I think you've had enough exposure to
this group and I think you all know that many of them have held many jobs during extended periods of time which
gives me some comfort and I hope you some comfort that this is a well seasoned team. We've been through a lot

together with a great deal of success and we're ready for what comes our way.
Setting a target of 3.25 for 2012 is where many of you already are; some little higher, some little lower. I think you
know from our history we don't talk about things that we don't think are accomplishable. So we feel comfortable about
the future. This is a tremendous time to be in this industry and American Electric Power will continue to lead and affect
the outside impacts that we feel as we go forward.
So with that let's get started with our question and answers. Thank you.
Q&A
<Q>: I wonder if you could comment in some more depth about this study that you're doing of the Eastern power pool.
When the PJM capacity market was created you all chose to self supply; now it seems like you're revisiting the
possibility as I'd understood your comments Brian, that's perhaps participating in the capacity market. And I was
wondering what went into the initial decision was changing and perhaps influencing your considerations now. Can you
give us a view on the changed economics and what the potential upsides might be?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's pretty straightforward, if
you think about the early capacity auctions, by being a self-supplying capacity player, it worked to a great advantage to
our customers. We also had an opportunity to take a bit of the overhang of our capacity in the Eastern pool into those
very high capacity prices in the early PJM auctions which year after year after year went up. Our [audio skip] great
benefit from that and our customers did as well.
Today there is a bit of a reversal going on. We think that it may be better to review the pool to see if taking apart
something that was put together in 1951 for the benefit of our investors and new customers to see if there is an
advantage there for our customers as well as those who invest in the company. It's not clear that that's the case. I know
again, much of this came up in the Virginia rate proceeding where they wanted us to do a report to them in early 2011.
We'll do that and what Virginia will see when we make that filing is the pool has served them extremely well over a lot
of years. Probably avoided building 4,000 megawatts of power that would have served Virginia customers and back
then -- take a look at Rockport. When Rockport was built Kentucky wanted no part of it. We ended up building it in
Indiana; that's fine and they took a power contract for some of it. Today Kentucky would love to have those jobs, that
property tax base in their state. We're seeing the same thing throughout the pool.
So what we've committed to do in the Virginia rate case settlement proposal that we talked about was take a look at
that. I hope Brian made it crystal clear that that's a long and intricate process that will go forward only if we find
benefit for everybody in the equation, and by everybody I surely mean our shareholders as well as our customers. So
the math has changed; the facts have changed. There are some things that would be benefit to all of us. We don't
recover everything in the pool today. We don't recover the cost of environmental investments; we don't recover the cost
of the additives to run the existing retrofitted fleets in the fuel recovery cost filing. A lot of that would be good for our
investors as well as our customers we think going forward. So there's pluses, there is minuses, but anyone who thinks
this will happen and net-net we'll take some belly blow from it, just doesn't understand the way that we think this thing
will unfold as we go forward. Paul?
<Q>: Just a few quick questions. The GDP growth estimates for 2010-2011 that you guys have in your sales forecast --
what are they and how sensitive are you guys to that?
Secondly the APCo ROE in the appendix is 9%, yet I believe for 2011 you guys are very confident getting to double
digits. There's been a lot of resistance in Virginia and West Virginia is not exactly easy. Just what's going to drive that,
if you could just elaborate a little bit more on that.
And just finally the Columbus Southern, Ohio Power merger, it sounds like you guys saw opportunities there yet
you've been [audio skip] company it sounds like as well. So I wasn't really clear what that would bring about. And if
you could just give us a little more flavor on that. Does it help you with the shopping? Would that make rates higher?
How would the rates change there if you were to do that and sort of what timeframe are we talking about?

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So because I'm as old as I am, I'll go
from the back first. The concept on merging the two is positive in what we think too. We have been running them as
single company. This we think is just a better way over time to blend together the rate structure so that has a
constructive impact on the potential shopping. Not enough to make it as though it would seem to dampen shopping and
that we think is important with the regulators because I'm sure the commission as they shared with you yesterday, they
are pretty pleased with what they've created.
Today's market may be an anomaly; it may not be; it may be a longer term play. Equally important bringing the two
companies together we think gives us the opportunity to address the SEET clearly in the tail end of I think 2009 as I've
told you a million times will work out just fine. 2010 will be an open issue. We'll find an answer for 2010 as that year
unfolds in early '11 and we're reviewing the performance of the Ohio companies. By the 2011, 2012 review of 2011 it'll
be a moot point because blending the companies together give returns on equity that will fall well within the guidelines
and the guidance. So we see a couple of pluses. And right now, it's just an – we've met with the customers, we've met
with everybody you can meet with; there is just no pushback whatsoever, the time is right to do that. So that's the logic
behind that one.
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: GDP growth is slightly above
consensus for national averages in the west part of our system and slightly below consensus for national average in the
east part of our system, as is unemployment. So unemployment drives a little bit higher in the east part of our system
than it does in the west, and so we're about moderately above GDP in the east; sorry, in the west and moderately below
in the east part of our system.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It's always --
<Q>: [Question Inaudible]
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It's like 2%, give or take; so in the
east, it's a little less than that; in the west a little stronger than that. And we don't think that's outside of what you're
seeing the general macroeconomic folks talking about.
In Appalachian Power, Charles and I and the Appalachian Power team had an opportunity to meet with Governor
McDonnell and his team last week. I would argue at the executive level, the pressure on Appalachian Power Virginia is
off. We are clearly in a political season there. You'll continue to hear one of the House of Delegates who wants to
become a stronger player in the politics banging on us. But I think the governor's team and our team are working
together very closely. West Virginia rate case moving along fine; we don't see any bumps in the road.
And remember the logic behind Charles Patton going up there. He came from Houston Lighting & Power with a lot of
years of success and then came over with AEP to do our lobbying in Austin and did well at that. Ran AEP Texas and
had the largest rate increase that central Southwest operating companies had ever experienced in the state of Texas
because before he did the rate case, he met with everybody in the world that could have a meeting and explained to
them exactly what they were doing exactly why they were doing it, and set a standard for how you do rate cases,
already underway at the encouragement of the governor of Virginia doing the same thing. We've been out to every
Kiwanis Club and every chamber that you can talk to, trying to let them understand, these are rate increases most of
them [audio skip] environmental rules out of Washington which support the coalminers in the very region where we do
business. Yes, we know you don't like rate increases, but they also have a lot to do with your jobs in these regions, and
I think you'll see some pressure come off of that, although will be a bit of political fodder as we go that should allow
for the returns on equity; Appalachian Power to get better in line.
What you see at AEP consolidated for Bob's Utility group is an overall 10%+ return on the overall consolidated equity
invested in utilities. Someday some are plus double-digits, someday single-digits. As Stuart said it took him three or
four years to stair step his up; SWEPCO has stair stepped up from a number of cases that we've gone through. So from
any point in time at any operating company should not overwhelm you. It's -- I think Nick made it when he said
mention of -- it's the magnitude and the scale of AEP. We can -- I don't like customers switching in Ohio but a $0.07 hit
based on what we will do with our own retail operation and other things that we'll do in 2011 as we look at the

challenges in front of us, we can tolerate those kinds of things inside of the portfolio that we have.
Yeah, Greg
<Q>: Mike, Brian, I think the -- other than the system agreement issue as a structural concern, I think the other big
concern in '12 more than '11 as it pertains to your 325 aspiration is how the ESP negotiation will unfold. And at a high
level investors look at where market prices for power are, they look at where your rates are, they see some of your
customers switching. It sounds like you need rates to go up in Ohio and yet it seems to me that the pressure would be
down. So how do you homogenize your needs with sort of the minutia of how this process is going to go forwards that
there's a mutually beneficial solution for customers?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So don't forget the major reason you
see customers shifting is that the price to beat if you will is a G-rate price. So there is maybe some tightening in the
G-rate that we'll see, but you can make capital investments in the Transco as Susan had already mentioned. And you
can also see some serious capital that has been invested in AEP Ohio on the distribution side with the smart grid
program, and others will continue to make those investments. So going in with the belief that rates go down in the ESP
to avoid shopping is probably a concept that won't materialize in what we file. And what we file will ultimately I think
yield itself to a settlement over time. And so you won't see the same kinds of increases you may have seen in the last
couple years for that shopping piece on the G-rate, but you'll see some increases without question in the T and the D
and other activities that go into an overall ESP filing.
Upfront here, Leslie. Right here.
<Q>: Just a quick question to clarify your capital plan. You said you plan to access $1 billion in the capital market; 670
of that's debt. The other --
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No, no, no. Yeah; sorry; let me
clarify. 620 is maturities. We're going to take advantage of some additional low rates that we have available to us today
to have some incremental redemption and then we're going to issue some new debt as well.
<Q>: Okay; so it's all debt.
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: All debt. And Leslie with the
exception of the dividend reinvestment program which is going to contribute about $150 million here.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Just right in front of you, the – Ali,
right next door.
<Q>: Also on the CapEx to be clear, when would you expect to start seeing the ramp-up from environmental-related
CapEx in your portfolio? How much if any of that is in that '11- '12 number? If not what should we be thinking about
incrementally for environmental CapEx?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think as you looked at the 5%
to 7% earning cycle that we spoke to in the 2012 and beyond or the 2014 and beyond cycle, that really has its – the
basic business itself the U.S. economy recovering associated with the capital investment ultimately yielding share price
returns on the transmission play, plus then the environmental investments that will be made on the fleet that Nick broke
down for you in a pretty granular way. So it will be that kind of a timeline before A) you can physically get the work
done; and B) you can incorporate it into some type of a rate adjustment mechanism going forward. So that's when you
will start to see those impacts, Ali, as you go forward.
<Q>: So '14 and beyond?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Right.
<Q>: And some magnitude, would you like to share with us?

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It all depends how crazy our friends
in Washington are. Again this – I hope – I mean I know you know this. I know you all know this. There is no more
technically confident generation coal fleet utility in the country, no offense to my friend, my good friend, David
Ratcliffe. And we'll deploy all the technology we can as cost effectively as we can. And we're going to continue to run
those plants no matter what the environmental requirements become. And as you know, under utility law, anything that
you're doing to comply with federal legislation is recoverable at the state level. It may take time. And that's why we
think it will be more like the 2014 period and beyond.
But it would be difficult for me to tell you, we think that's $1 billion on retrofitting or $800 million on retrofitting
because I don't know what they'll do with mercury. I really don't know what they'll do with coal ash. I don't know what
they'll do with the transport rule. The way they stand today, they are illogical, and they cannot sustain, the way that
they have been put forward in preliminary activities that we've all commented on. Thanks.
Yeah, way in the back, Jim?
<Q>: Thank you. Two questions on the financials, if you would, please. The first one is on the cash flow, from the
appendix. There is a $650 million swing in working capital in 2011 versus 2010. Can you talk about those drivers?
And then the second question is higher debt balances but lower interest expenses '11 versus 2010, just some of those
drivers there. They may be obvious but can you talk about it, please?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: The '09 to '10 driver, a lot of that
was driven by the one-time severance payments that we made of about $300 million. And there is also some
incremental deferred fuel as well that's a contributor to that. And we are obviously not anticipating severance type
payments next year as well and anticipate being about cash flow neutral for next year. So two things, '09 to '10: the
pension – incremental pension cost of 350 million, the severance payments of about 300 million; that's '09 to '10. And
then next year we are anticipating not having those clearly and being about cash flow neutral for the year.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Since you already have the
microphone, go right ahead.
<Q>: Just on the EPA issues.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.
<Q>: Can you just walk through how you guys see legislation or action changing that would preclude the EPA from
acting? And then the idea that money doesn't get spent till 2014 when there is rules written and clearly in place both
today and rules written in 2005 and 2008 that would suggest you had visibility to compliance, kind of how that fits
together?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The election – Senator Rockefeller's
two-year slowdown on carbon was passable before they all went home. Senator Reid chose not to bring it up because
he knew it was passable. And he has made a promise to Senator Rockefeller that it'll come up in a lame-duck session;
that may or may not happen. It will clearly happen early next year when the whole process gets slowed down for some
period of time. But just slowing it down doesn't stop those implementations as well as other activities that are going on
clearly under the current purview of the Clean Air Act.
And so again, it's difficult for me to say exactly what years they will come to play and when the capital will need to be
invested and how then that will roll through the rate play. What we tried to show you in the long-term, post-2014 is we
think that's when those investments will have matured as far as the impacts on the earnings strength of the company
going forward. As you know, we have taken – we actually made some investments based on our NSR settlement. We
have made some investments based on what we thought the care and camera rules were back when they were the law of
the land and obviously a law that was reversed.
So in some jurisdictions when you make those – look, remember where we are making these capital investments. We
are making them in Appalachia coal country. It's coal jobs. It's property taxes for power plants that don't get shut down.

There is a lot of benefits that the economies of the states where we're making those investments. And frequently, when
there's headroom in the rates -- and lord knows, you heard that from the operating company folks -- we'll go forward
and make some of those investments because we'll be encouraged to do that to get ahead of the cycle.
Remember when you look at the retrofitting for SOx and NOx under the Clear Air Act as it stands today, we did a lot
of that stuff at $250, $300 a Kw. Folks who are doing it now and still catching up are $500, $600 a Kw. So we'll be an
early mover when we can as long as the regulator understands why we're doing it and sees the benefit of what we're
doing in that process.
<Q>: What do you guys see legislatively that's going to happen to marry together all the EPA policy? It sounds like
that's part of your goal, is to repackage. How do you see that looking?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, there's a move afoot of
Democrats in the house from coal country to suggest to the EPA the same thing that the state of Texas has suggested, to
Venita's point. We were movers behind that activity in Texas. We were movers behind the activity in the House. So it's
a congressman from Virginia, a congressman from Ohio, and a congressman from West Virginia, all on the Democratic
side who will bring forward some application for our friends at the EPA to look at a consolidated study of the aggregate
impact of what they are doing. And I think there will be pretty good legs for that kind of legislation going forward. I am
sure the new Republicans, no matter how many they are, will be eager to have that kind of an activity.
So again understand what we're trying to do. We are trying to put rationality in this. We have never been – that's not –
never is too far -- we are not just saying no utility, although we may have been in the past; that's not where we are in
the future. Where we are in the future is, let's make the air better, let's make the capital investments better, let's keep
King Coal in play; and most importantly, let's keep these massive capital investments that we've made on behalf of our
customers viable for the near-term, mid-term, and long-term. And we just think that will happen.
Thanks. Right behind you in the middle row?
<Q>: Brian, when you talked about these different periods of time and the different growth rates in '12 to '14, I think I
heard you list out number of sources of capital but I don't think you talked about external equity in that '12-'14 period.
Is that – did I hear that right? And should we be thinking as sort of beyond – '14 and beyond is the earliest you might
be, based off these plans, be back in the market?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Certainly through the 2014 period,
we have no plans to issue any equity, certainly consistent with the CapEx and growth rates that we've described. I think
when you start to look out towards the latter part of the decade, if this transmission business takes off, there are
opportunities for us to either access the equity market, get some – do a partial spin of that business, which is how we
have organized it, as a transmission holding company, or access other forms of capital to bring it in to drive that
growth. That would be a story that we'd come out, we'd talk to you about, you'd hear about, and you'd understand why
we would be accessing that incremental equity, what our plans with it were, and how it fit into the growth story of the
company.
But certainly, in the period 2012, 2011 to '14 we have no plans to issue equity and believe that the CapEx and growth
that we've described can be funded with incremental debt and with the dividend reinvestment program that we have.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: As you know, it's a pretty strong
dividend reinvestment program. It yields $150 million plus a year. A lot of smart shareholders see the benefit of just
rolling over and staying in the stock.
<Q>: And if I may just on another subject, you're talking about $0.07 of margin erosion in Ohio in 2011. I'm guessing
some of that is the full year impact of what you saw mainly in the second half, or you are seeing in the second half of
2010. How much is embedded in the 2010 base on the same kind of measure?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it would be silly for us to tell
you how much load we think we're going to lose. So we won't do that. But rest assured, we have built the impact of
what we think the market prices are, our competitive position in Ohio, particularly at Columbus Southern, and the

impacts that will have when we talk about being in the range that we gave you for 2011 on the earnings profile of $3 to
$3.20 a share. We've baked all of that in. And as you might imagine, we've been aggressive about the potential impact.
And I think that tells you directionally about as much as we'd like to share on that. I don't want to energize any of my
competitors.
<Q>: Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: There is another issue – all right, fine,
yeah, sure, Michael?
<Q>: Yeah, Mike. An industry-wide question. We're in a period of really high leverage at kind of the state financial
level, even in federal government -- the low-trend GDP, high unemployment, at a time when rate pressures, albeit with
shale gas, fuel costs may be down a bit but renewable costs are up causing rate pressure. Environmental costs will
likely cause some rate pressure. Can you point us to a period of time historically where that same circle of events
happened, how it played out for the broad sector and what's likely different this go-round?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So, think of Jimmy Carter and think
of the early Reagan years as President Reagan corrected some of the incredible malaise that the country went through
with 20-plus percent inflation, 20-plus percent cost of capital and we saw a huge impact on the macroeconomics of this
country then without the export machine working. So when you ask me what's different from then to now? Couple of
things.
Much of what we've experienced in – I was sharing this morning with some folks over breakfast -- you look back today
and you now know that the economic impact is an event that began really in 2007; not really recognizable then because
it was small. 2008 it become pretty serious. The minute the Lehman thing tumbled everything unraveled in a hurry. We
never saw the 2008 impact until last half of the 12th month in 2008 because of the export machine. So coming out of
this one, we think that the growth in Asia is going to allow money of our large industrials to the points that Paul made,
the points that Venita made, the points that Charles made, I think about the shale gas play moving across the country.
What you're seeing at US Steel Tubular for shale play in the greater Southwest, you'll see repeated throughout our
service territory. We are in the midst of shale country everywhere that we are. So I think there'll be some different
things going on as the economy recovers and most of it having to do with the potential for export.
If you look at August exports, September exports, but for planes, which as you know are very, very volatile, it's been
up again. So the world continues to grow and U.S. will continue to satisfy that growth. So jobs will come back over
time. We're all sitting on massive amounts of capital. What we don't know is what it cost to hire somebody. And I
would argue and I would hope that as we get more balance in the United States Senate, which is essential for this
country's well being, and I wouldn't want 60 Republicans any more than I like 60 Democrats. I think you'd be much
better to understand what the Senate was created to do which was to slow down ideas that look great when you first
think about them. But when you pass a 1,200 page healthcare bill with 67-87 regulations yet to come, with seven or
eight new agencies yet to be created, and we'll learn about it as we go, how could it be sillier than that?
So I think that balance will help all of us as we go forward. And corporate America from my exposure to Business
Roundtable, Association of Manufacturers and other, it's eager to get -- go forward and grow. Bob made the mention of
$0.60 equivalent a gallon to put some electric vehicles on the road. You've read a big story today about the battery cost
going on it. That's technology. It will all get fixed. So I think this will be a different recovery, slow but when it comes it
will be strong, it will be sustainable and it will have a lot to do with the export engine that we call the American
industrial complex.
I want to talk on one other issue, because it's a very important issue, it's come up of late and Ali and I had a chance to
talk about it in the hallway before we came in here, and that there's some concern that the deferred fuel contracts are
getting little outlandish. We agree with that. Then there's some concern that over time there will be an inability to
recover those. We surely don't agree with that. I think Alan answered that question yesterday. Got asked more than
once and I think he put it to rest.

But just think about the politics of this. So you bought all this coal from Ohio and it was expensive and lot of Ohioans
got the benefit of all of that. And now you're trying to recover the cost of all that benefit from the same Ohioans that
had the potential benefit of it by the economy going forward in Ohio. I mean the politics are out of balance when you
think about that. The chance of that happening is remote. That what I learned years ago in law school was there is never
"never" in any answer but the chance of that is hugely remote. So I'd like to at least put a point on that. Steve? (2;34:38)
<Q>: Yeah. Question on the – in Ohio on the Cohen plants. So I guess Duke had said that they might sell their plants.
And I'm just curious kind of how A) would you have any interest in owning more of those plants; B) how many of
those plants are ones that might need to be shutdown are on that high risk group of plants and how are the companies,
given the co-ownership figuring out, how to make decisions on these plants?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, those are questions that I can't
answer other than the one about our interest level: very low. As you heard Nick say, our next best option is finishing
the Dresden station, and we're taking a hard look at that for our 2011 cycle; that's combined-cycle plant. If you think
about $4 gas and a 6000 heat rate, that's going to be a pretty nice plant that will run well. We see our gas plants in the
eastern footprint being called on a lot more than coal. So let Jim explain to you the value proposition that he thinks that
he has. But there is a lot of smart money buying generation facilities in this country today. So I am sure if he puts
[audio skip] be some come in to buy it. We'll take a look at him just to see if there is anything we're missing in any
region of the state that we think may make sense. But it would take quite a deal to energize us to get involved in that
activity.
<Q>: You may have partially answered this question from some of your prior comments. But can you give us – can
you give us a feel of the politics in Ohio for a state that the gubernatorial election doesn't seem to have utilities as a
front line issue, there is a very overt divisiveness from the companies in the state as far as where the support is. So can
you [inaudible] I think your previous comment maybe alluded to that, some of the issues under the surface that we
should be aware or were missing?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It appears as though a very decent
fellow who got dealt a very interesting deck of cards did his best to manage his way through Ohio. There is the
potential that Ohioans who are very conservative who have been voting now for, what ,about 15 or 16 days may well
put Governor Strickland back in the saddle, just simply saying he is a really decent fellow who did as much as he could
to rectify Ohio. But he is hitting a storm of you and your colleagues lost 400,000 jobs during the last four years. I don't
think we can tolerate any more of that. So there is high potential. John Kasich, who is a very charismatic, very
energetic individual, may well win that race.
Our team has been as bipartisan as you can be in those events. I think the world of Ted Strickland; I think John Kasich
would be a great governor, if that's the way it turns out. And for us it will work out well no matter how it happens.
Utilities aren't top of the list; there are other issues that are very much top of the list issues for people in Ohio, most
importantly jobs. Who is a better economic developer than the utilities? So you may have seen a couple of weeks ago
we announced a contract to take the commitment for our solar requirements, if and only if the solar manufacturing
facility is built in Ohio, bringing in 600 jobs. That goes back to the point that was raised back here: you get a lot of
upward pressures on things like renewables. We're only going to do that inside of an envelope that makes sense.
Again, if you look at the gigawatt hours that AEP Ohio sells, buying a few megawatt hours – gigawatt hours of solar is
not going to move the needle a great deal. We feel comfortable the way the politics will unfold. It looks quite likely that
we will have Senator Voinovich, a very staunch Republican, replaced by Portman, a very staunch Republican. Sherrod
Brown is a very dear friend of Susan's and mine and other members of our management team. I think we're in great
shape politically in Ohio. I'm not concerned about it at all. You can imagine if in fact we go forward with Dresden plant
it will be 700 or 800 jobs early on, people swamping around at that station in Ohio. There will be a lot of happy
politicians to see more people working. So utilities and executive offices need to find a way to get along, and they will
find a way to get along. It's one of the things that's essential for how we do our business.
Okay, one more and then we are at 11 o'clock; you've been more than dutiful. We'll all hang around for little bit to
answer other questions that you might have.

<Q>: Quick question on the guidance. The 2012 number -- does that include the same level of shopping as the '11
number? And then also have you baked in any SEET impact in either of the two years?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So again that's more granularity than
we're really prepared to share. I can assure you that we think shopping will go on. When we look at the 2014 and
beyond cost of energy in the marketplace, we expect that it will begin to drift up, not continue to drift down. We think
-- if you are a shale producer and you've already spent your money, you're happy to put fuel in the market at what it
brings today. But there is a time when you pause and you say, hey, look at these sub $4 rates; I'm just not coming.
When you start getting north of $4 our coal plants kick back in. That pushes the market price throughout the whole area
up some as shale gas prices increase; that reduces the shopping potential. If you blend those two companies together
and over time you blend their rate structures together, that puts downward pressure on the cost at the Columbus
Southern commercial marketplace and I think you'll see some positive effects of that.
As far as SEET is concerned, we see it as a zero earnings impact issue and eventually – again blending the companies
together SEET is a yesterday challenge rather than a today challenge. So thanks.
Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I'd like to thank the team for being as prepared as they were. Chuck, you and the IR group deserve a great deal of
credit. Our third quarter has been outstanding. With that, we think makes for a very strong 2010. We're comfortable
about our 2011 forecast, 2012 and beyond. We couldn't be more bullish about the potential upside for investing in
American Electric Power. And you'll make your own decisions in that regard. Thanks for being here with us.
