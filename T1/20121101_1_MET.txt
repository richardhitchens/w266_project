MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session; instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to
historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial
results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.
MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result
of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to John McCallion, Head of Investor Relations.
John McCallion
Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2012 earnings call. We will be
discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP
measures.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to most directly comparable GAAP measures may
be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com and our earnings press release, our quarterly financial
supplements and in the other financial information section.
A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not
accessible, because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative
gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and
John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions.
Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including; Bill Wheeler,
President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris
Townsend, President of Asia.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our financial results for the third quarter, I want to
express my condolences to those who have suffered great loss as a result of Hurricane Sandy.
At MetLife, we are doing everything we can to help our customers cope with the impact of the storm. Our claims
associates are on the ground helping customers find shelter, facilitating temporary repairs and issuing advance
payments for immediate expenses. We know there is still a tremendous amount of work to do before life returns to
normal, and our thoughts are especially with those who are hardest hit by the storm. I also want to thank all of you for
being on this call on these difficult circumstances.
Now let me turn the MetLife's financial performance. I would like to begin this morning by discussing the goodwill
impairment we recorded in the third quarter of 2012. As we've indicated on previous earnings calls, as well as during
our interest-rate call last November, a prolonged low rate environment might cause us to impair some or all of the
goodwill in our U.S. retail annuity business.
In the third quarter of 2012, we took $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment in this business to reflect the expected
market impact of continued low interest rates, changes in the regulatory environment and other market and economic
factors.
MetLife delivered another solid quarter with operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% from the
third quarter of 2011. Adjusting for certain one-time items that depressed the results in the prior-year quarter, operating
earnings still rose by 23%.
John Hele will discuss our third quarter results in greater detail in a few moments. I would like to highlight a few
aspects of MetLife's performance that tie to our enterprise strategy, which we developed to address the external
economic environment facing life insurers.
As you know, one of our strategic goals is to refocus the U.S. business by shifting our business mix from more capital
intensive and interest rate sensitive products to simpler protection and fee-based products.
Our results and activities in the third quarter were consistent with this strategy. Premiums, fees and other revenues rose
by 9% in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefit business on strong sales and on revenues from the TRICARE
Dental contract. Variable annuity sales in the United States declined by 46% from the prior-year quarter to $4.6 billion,
in line with our plan. We continued to manage the risks associated with this business.
During the quarter, we launched a new product with lower withdrawal and payout rates. In addition, we limited the
ability to deposit new money into a number of our existing contracts that have more generous guarantees.

In our Corporate Benefit Funding business, sales of structured settlements and pension closeouts were both down,
reflecting the lumpy nature of this business segment. We see tremendous opportunity in the pension closeout business
especially as interest rates rise over time. However, as with any use of capital, we are committed to ensuring the new
business in this segment clears our hurdle rate.
During the quarter, MetLife also announced the creation of our new third-party asset management business. This
fee-based business requires very little capital and leverages the strong investment expertise we've built up over the
decades. We have well-established business platforms for originating commercial mortgages, investing in real estate
equity and sourcing private placements. We also possess the talent, scale, reputation and in-market presence to acquire
high-quality assets with the potential for strong returns.
Finally, I would point to our pilot project with Walmart to sell term life policies to the middle market. While we are in
a very early days and do not have reportable results, we will continue to pursue these kinds of innovative approaches to
selling simple protection products through new direct channels.
Another strategic imperative for MetLife is to grow our business in emerging markets. The third quarter saw progress
on this goal as well. In Latin America, sales rose 28% year-over-year led by large group life cases in Mexico. And in
EMEA, sales rose 15% year-over-year, driven by our acquisition in Turkey, a higher credit life sales in Russia.
Regarding the sale of MetLife Bank, two key developments occurred during the quarter. First, we amended the
purchase agreement to sell the bank to GE Capital Retail Bank, which has submitted its application for approval to the
Office of the Controller (sic) [Comptroller] (8:08) of the Currency.
The key terms of the agreement remain unchanged. And second, MetLife received a letter from the Federal Reserve
granting us an extension until January 5, 2013 to file a revised capital plan. Until our de-banking process is complete,
we remain regulated by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company. After our de-banking process is complete, we
face the possibility of being named a non-bank, systemically important financial institution or SIFI, which would place
us back under Federal Reserve supervision.
As we have said many times, we do not believe regulating insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial
system. However, in the event that MetLife and other insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact will depend on
how the final prudential rules are written. It will be important that the prudential rules be tailored for the life insurance
business model, which differs dramatically from that of banks.
Overall, I am pleased with the results MetLife delivered in the third quarter. Our continued solid operating earnings
performance reflects the fundamental strength of our diverse global business. Our focus on pricing discipline and risk
management is especially important in this challenging economic environment, which shows few signs of abating. We
will continue to monitor the external factors impacting our business and respond accordingly.
In the coming weeks, we'll be finalizing our 2013 plan projections, which we will share with you on our next Investor
Day call this December 13.
Before I conclude, I want to mention that this will be John McCallion's last earnings call as Head of Investor Relations.
John is becoming the CFO of our EMEA region and I want to thank him for his help in communicating our value
proposition to MetLife's investors over the past two years. John will be handing the reins to Ed Spehar, who has
covered the insurance industry for more than 20 years as an equity analyst.
It is now my pleasure to introduce John Hele, our new CFO. John has more than 30 years of experience in financial
services industry; having worked for Arch Capital Group, ING Group and Merrill Lynch among others. His deep
technical expertise of world markets, knowledge of world markets and strong risk management skills are a welcome
addition to our global leadership team.
With that, I will turn the call over to John.

John C. R. Hele
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I wish to add to Steve's comments of our concern for those still without power
and/or heat. And for those who've had damages or losses in this historical storm. As for the potential financial impact to
MetLife from Hurricane Sandy, at this time it is too early to develop a reliable estimate.
Before I review our results in the quarter, let me provide some color on the key macro factors impacting our financial
performance. Interest rates continued to remain low in the U.S., assisted by another round of quantitative easing and
also in most countries in which we operate.
While the 10-year Treasury yield was essentially flat in the quarter, closing at 1.63%, it is down nearly 30 basis points
versus the year-ago period. In addition and perhaps more significantly, U.S. corporate spreads further tightened in the
quarter across most asset classes in which we invest, generally by 10 basis points to 50 basis points. While asset spread
tightening is not readily apparent in our product net spreads, as provided in our quarterly financial supplement, they do
impact our new money rates and will pressure product spreads over time.
On the plus side, the U.S. equity market performed well this quarter with the S&P 500 up 5.8%. By comparison the
S&P 500 was down 14.4% in the third quarter of 2011. This change in the S&P 500 performance resulted in a positive
year-over-year variance of approximately $120 million of after-tax operating earnings in our retail annuities segment.
With that as a backdrop, let me now discuss our results for this quarter. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4
billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% over the third quarter of 2011. This quarter's results included a few offsetting
significant items. However, the prior year third quarter had several significant items, which had a net negative impact
on operating earnings per share of $0.17. Adjusted for those items, operating earnings were up 23% year-over-year.
In addition, as noted in our 8-K filed on October 24, in the third quarter of 2012, we began to report all MetLife Bank
operations as divested businesses. This change in reporting positively impacted operating earnings per share in the
quarter by $0.02, while lowering operating earnings per share in the prior third quarter by $0.02.
On a U.S. GAAP basis, MetLife reported a net loss of $984 million, or $0.92 per share, which includes a $1.6-billion
after-tax goodwill impairment and net derivative losses of $467 million after-tax.
As previously disclosed, we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the third quarter. This year the testing
indicated a full impairment of the goodwill associated with the U.S. retail annuities business, resulting in a non-cash
charge of $1.9 billion, or $1.6 billion after-tax. This includes $176 million of goodwill recorded in the corporate and
other segment representing tax benefits related to this annuity business.
Goodwill testing starts with the estimating the fair value of the business based on a market participant's view. While
interest rates are below for some time, during the third quarter U.S. Treasury rates hit their lowest point since World
War II. Also the Federal Reserve extended the timeframe they see low interest rates being warranted until 2015 and
also initiated quantitative easing 3.
These factors indicated that an extended period of low interest rates needed to be reflected in the fair value estimate,
particularly on the returns a market buyer may assume associated with the fixed income portion of the separate
accounts.
We believe buyers of an annuity business, particularly a variable annuity block, would be looking for capital efficient
structure, most likely one involving captive and/or offshore strategies. Given the industry-wide inquiries on the use of
affiliated captive reinsurers, buyers may now discount the ability to fully utilize these structures. These and other
market conditions led to a significantly lower fair value for the business than in prior years. And when you follow
through to the measurement step in the goodwill accounting process, this lower value resulted in full impairment of the
recorded goodwill. This charge does not have an impact on the bank holding company capital ratios, which exclude
goodwill from the calculations nor on our U.S. statutory results.
As for the potential DAC and GAAP loss recognition impairments, while we review these each quarter, we conduct a
comprehensive annual review of all the model assumptions in the fourth quarter, which include interest rates, equity

returns, policyholder behavior, mortality, et cetera. We will need to complete our analysis before determining if there
would be any impact in the fourth quarter.
As for the net derivative losses in the quarter, it was primarily due to, one, the impact on the value of embedded options
in our VA hedging program, as a result of Met's own credit spreads tightening in the quarter. Two, the rise in long-term
rates. And three, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies such as the euro, Canadian dollar and
British pound in the quarter.
Next, I would like to discuss some of the key financial metrics we focus on each quarter. First, as I mentioned earlier,
our investment spreads remain stable despite the low rate environment and tighter corporate spreads.
As stated on prior calls, there are several factors contributing to our stable spreads including our ALM discipline, use of
interest rate floors, private asset originations and the performance of our variable investment income.
In the quarter, pre-tax variable investment income was $260 million, just above the top of a 2012 quarterly guidance
range. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $165 million.
Next, expenses remain well-controlled. Operating expense in the quarter were $2.8 billion, up only 0.4% over the prior
year period. While the operating expense ratio did increase 30 basis points to 24.4%, the increase was primarily driven
by lower revenues as a result of pension closeout sales in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding closeouts, the expense
ratio would have been unchanged at 24.8% between the two periods.
Turning to the top line revenue, premiums, fees and other revenues, or PFOs, were $11.6 billion in the quarter, down
1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and lower pension closeouts, PFOs were up 2%
year-over-year.
Book value per share excluding AOCI was $47.70 as of 9/30/12. This reflects growth of 2.6% year-over-year despite
the goodwill impairment and net derivative losses discussed earlier. And finally, year-to-date 2012 operating ROE was
11.4%, up 140 basis points as compared to the comparable period for 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by
higher operating earnings, up $880 million on a year-to-date basis.
Now let's discuss the business segments starting with the Americas. The Americas operating earnings were $1.2 billion
in the quarter, up 58% year-over-year with growth across all segments.
Retail, life and other reported operating earnings of $204 million, up $83 million year-over-year due to higher net
investment income. In addition, the prior year third quarter results of this business included $29 million after-tax of
catastrophes in excess of plan in our retail, property and casualty business and $27 million after-tax charge to increase
reserves in connection with the company's use of the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File to
identify potential life insurance claims that have not been presented to the company.
Retail annuities reported operating earnings of $288 million, up $195 million year-over-year. As noted earlier, $120
million of the variance was due to the initial market impact related to the performance of the S&P 500 in the respective
quarters. In addition, this business had an increase in separate account fees, improved interest margins due to wider
spreads on the general account and lower expenses.
Also, I should note the variable annuity sales were $4.6 billion in the quarter, down 46% year-over-year. We continue
to see sales trend down due to the pricing and de-risking actions that we've taken this year. We would expect to see
sales continue to decline in the fourth quarter in line with our full 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $283 million, up $130 million year-over-year,
largely due to the segment's prior year third quarter results, which included an $82 million after-tax charge related to
the aforementioned Social Security Death Master File and $20 million after-tax charge for catastrophes in excess of
plan in our Group P&C business.
In addition, the segment had favorable claim cost trends for dental, favorable catastrophe and non-catastrophe
experience in Group P&C, as well as improved interest and expense margins in disability.

Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $303 million, up $31 million year-over-year due to higher
interest margins as a result of general account asset growth and lower expenses. Spreads remained stable for this
segment.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $152 million, up $11 million year-over-year and 15% on a constant
currency basis. The key drivers were growth in Mexico and direct marketing in the region. Higher net investment
income driven by growth in the general account and a one-time tax related benefit.
Moving to the top line, the Americas PFOs were $8.3 billion in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year primarily due to
lower pension closeouts and structured settlements. Excluding closeouts and structured settlements, PFOs would be up
3% year-over-year.
The next segment, Asia, reported operating earnings of $259 million in the quarter, up $37 million or 17%
year-over-year due to premium growth in Japan and Korea, as well as higher net investment income driven by asset
growth and higher yields. PFOs for the region were up 7% or 9% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis,
Japan PFOs were up 9% due to an increase in Life and A&H sales and improved persistency, while Korea's PFOs were
up 11% due to higher fee income.
In the third segment, EMEA, operating earnings were $62 million in the quarter, down $3 million year-over-year.
However, on a constant currency basis operating earnings would have been up $10 million driven by our acquisition in
Turkey and Russian credit insurance. PFOs were down 10% year-over-year and flat on a constant currency basis. The
Turkey acquisition benefited the top line, which is offset by weakness in Western Europe and Greece.
Finally, let me discuss our capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at September 30, totaled
approximately $5.7 billion. This includes proceeds from the issuance of $750 million of 30-year senior debt, which was
completed in August, which will be used to pay off maturing debt next year. I should note the balance sheet excludes
the $1 billion of proceeds received in October from the remarketing and settlement of our common equity units.
We also have $400 million of senior debt maturing in December, which we'd expect to repay at that time. Lastly, as we
announced last week, we will be paying approximately $800 million in common dividends in December.
Our preliminary U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and U.S. statutory net income for our domestic insurance
companies for the third quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively. For the nine
months of 2012, U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $2.8 billion
and $2.9 billion, respectively, in line with our full year expectations.
With that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.

Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Nigel Dally>: Great. Thank you. Good morning. These variable annuities, still seeing very strong sales and net
flows, I think a lot of investors will prefer to see the pace of sales decelerate at a faster pace. Appreciate the comments
that you made with regards to some of the steps that you're taking, but why not get significantly more aggressive in
putting in place quotas, raising prices or reducing guarantee rates?
And then second on Corporate Benefit Funding, one of your competitors are continuing to land large pension and
closeout transactions. I think a lot of us have been surprised that Met hasn't been a participant as well. So, perhaps if
you can discuss why that's been the case? Is it that these deals are not hitting your hurdle rate or are there other factors
at play? Thanks.

<A - William J. Wheeler>: Hi, Nigel, it's Bill Wheeler. Okay. With regard to the VA business, sales for this quarter
were $4.6 billion and that's probably a little misleading because we, as both Steve and John alluded to, we changed our
pricing and adjusted some of our features this quarter and that resulted, I would say, in some mini fire sales to – for
lack of a better term. And so, sales were a little inflated. We're – our run rate in the fourth quarter is meaningfully
below the $4.6 billion that we recorded in the third and so, you know, we are seeing changes in that number, and that's
why we're confident that we'll be at $18 billion.
With regard to our Corporate Benefit Funding or the closeouts, as we've talked about on a number of calls, we are
seeing more, large closeout activity and I expect that to continue, though, the deals are lumpy and they won't
necessarily be one in the quarter. We are competing for that business, but we are being very disciplined about achieving
our hurdle rate, something that we're doing across the board in all our businesses and this is no different.
<Q - Nigel Dally>: Okay. Thanks a lot. Bye.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Hi. Good morning. I just had first some unsolicited feedback. I think your disclosure
changes, I don't know any large company that changes its disclosure as often as you guys have done and no one really
lumps P&C products with life insurance. So they're actually making it difficult to analyze the performance of some of
your businesses and track them over time that these are long-term businesses, but when the disclosure changes every
three, four quarters, it's just hard to keep track of stuff.
But the question that I have is on the international business, the results, obviously, have been moving around by
division. Europe hasn't been that great, Asia has been strong, weak in other quarters, but then maybe you could talk
about how the Alico business has done since the acquisition? Where it's done better than maybe what you would have
expected? And where it might have not done as well? Because if you look at – look back a year or so ago, the Asian
business seems like it's actually – the earnings are emerging a little bit weaker than I would have thought and I have
another question after that.
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Hi, Jimmy, it's Steve. Alico is tracking what we expected. Obviously, there's some
pluses and minuses country-by-country, but overall the transaction has come in very much on plan and we're still very
encouraged about the prospects of those business long-term. It's now given us exposure to markets that obviously we
weren't in before that have significant growth associated with them. It increases significantly our exposure to the
emerging markets. We've mentioned before that we're now up to about 14% of our profits from emerging markets and
we anticipate by 2016 that number will exceed 20%, given us growth trajectory and our likelihood of doing at least
some small transactions in those kinds of countries.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay. And then another one just on interest rates, you mentioned obviously, overall, you've
– in the past year, you've mentioned that you have expressed comfort that you can – your results can hold up despite the
rate environment. But as you indicated corporate bond spreads coming in, new money yield is probably dropping faster
than you would have thought a few months ago.
How much of this do you expect overall to be offset by your hedges and if you could just give us some details on when
the hedges begin to runoff? Is it more beginning in 2014, beginning in 2015? And then if rates do remain low, just your
level of comfort with the rest of the goodwill on the balance sheet, I think it's around $10 billion and some of that
relates to businesses that are interest rate sensitive as well.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi. This is John. As you can see our spreads have held up well this year, even though rates
have been lower than say projected a year ago and that's – you've seen the impact of the floors and the other hedges that
are in place and that's helping quite a bit this year and our spreads have been maintained. So, that's a good news.

As you point out over time, those hedges will slowly wear off, and I think there have been various projections in the
past last year that try to project that out at a level of 2% treasury rate and that – those projections still stand. The impact
of the other sides, thinner corporate spreads as well as other economic factors, we'll have to take into account going
forward. Steve, can probably add little more on how these wear off over time.
<A - Steven J. Goulart>: Hey, Jimmy. It's Steve Goulart. A couple of things. One just on spreads let me add one thing.
Remember, spreads are basically at their long-term averages right now. Yes, they've tightened significantly over the
course of the year, but that's from very, very wide levels. So, we're not surprised at all at the levels of spreads and we
continue to practice good ALM around that.
Regarding hedges, also think back to the presentations that we made earlier this year and even last year where we did
show you the fact that our protection runs out for a number of years, in fact even into the next decade. So, we have a lot
of protection in place and certainly for the next several years here, we're very well protected.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Lastly, you had a question on goodwill. In the third quarter, we test all of our units with
goodwill and applied the same logic and thinking that we applied to the retail annuity segment to the other segments
that were also interest rate sensitive. The most sensitive one of all though is the retail annuity segment and that's why
the market value – or the fair value was most affected by it. And the other units, we still have some buffer on before,
we won't have any issues there on the remaining $10 billion.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to pick up on the goodwill question or issue again. Can
you give us a sense of, sort of, where you had been valuing the goodwill in terms of a multiple, maybe a multiple on
book or something and where you're valuing the business now? I just want to get a sense – I know the write-down was
$1.6 billion after-tax, but I just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about the valuation of that business?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, we don't – it's John, Suneet. We don't give out the details of this – but I'd say, in
reviewing the prior-year's goodwill analysis, it was passing but not by a large amount. So, the price-to-book was just
above from a fair value perspective and now it is below.
And in a goodwill test, it's an assessment or trying to come up with a fair value, meaning what would a – this block or
this business transact in the current environment between a willing seller and a willing buyer. It doesn't have to be a
distressed price and it doesn't have to be literally at that month or even in that quarter, but as you factor forward and
think about it over the course of a year or two years, you have to take into account reasonable transaction prices.
Given there haven't been any variable annuity blocks sold is another key factor that there's pressure on prices clearly,
even though there perhaps have been some willing sellers. So, you have to take all of these into account and when we
came up in really many different measures of it and ways of thinking about it, really as if you were thinking of buying a
block of business, people use different techniques to value businesses, including multiples, price-to-book multiples,
price-to-earnings multiples actual appraisals. We did all those and came up with a fair value that was less than our
carrying value and thus the goodwill had to be written off.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. I mean, I guess to follow up on that, if you are valuing the business below book value
now, which is, I think what you said, kind of getting back to what Nigel's line of questioning was – I mean, what does
this say about your commitment to the variable annuity business and your willingness to put more capital in the
business for growth, when clearly the valuation of that business is not being recognized by the market?

<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, this is John again. Let me just stress that the goodwill test is a market view. It's a fair
value and it's what we believe, if we try to sell that business today that you would be able to transact in the business
today. That can be different from our long-term assumptions and how we see value over a longer period of time. There
are two different tests. They are somewhat related; you have to make sense between the two. But markets can over and
underprice true value, which is, I guess why we all buy stocks.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. Got it. And then just on capital management, I realize that there's not a whole lot you
can say on that, but the converts that I guess converted earlier this quarter, in the fourth quarter, I think there was an
expectation at some point that you'd be able to repurchase those or offset that dilution. I just want to clarify, I'm
assuming that that potential is essentially the same as normal share repurchases, so we should think about you're not
being able to offset that dilution unless you get out of bank holding company status and get permission from the Fed. Is
that a fair read?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: This is John. Until we have clarification on the future as a bank, the future being a non-bank or
de-banking, and the future as a non-bank SIFI as well as what the rules would be under that, we can't give any guidance
on capital.

Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. Two questions, if you will. So, following
this goodwill impairment, how much equity are you now allocating to the annuity segment and more specifically to the
VA business?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We don't give out equity by business line.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay. And then the second question is one more for Steve. A few months ago, I think most
insurance executives including yourselves were getting perhaps more hopeful. If I can characterize it that way, the Fed
officials and other key folks in Washington were recognizing some of these key differences between insurance
companies and banks and thus it was looking like the stress testing for insurance company SIFIs might be under a
different methodology than what's been applied to banks and what's been applied to you as a bank holding company.
Steve, just – if you have any incremental thoughts as a couple of months have passed on – or on any sort of more recent
observations that you can share around that?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Hi, John. No, I think really not a lot has changed since that point in time, I made
those statements. Treasury and Fed officials have said in different settings; both in speeches and before Congressional
hearings that they plan to acknowledge the difference in the business models between banks on the one hand and other
industries that might become non-bank SIFIs under their supervision. So, those words were encouraging, but as we've
mentioned the rules have not been written. There was a draft out there and comments have been provided back to the
Fed. We provided comments, others have as well.
And until this clarification around what those actual rules will be, it's very difficult to provide any sort of clarity to you
and others. So, we're really just standing by waiting, monitoring. We are in discussions where appropriate with Federal
officials, but we certainly have to wait and see where all of this comes out, both as to whether we become a non-bank
SIFI once we dispose of our bank and de-bank as a holding company and then what kinds of prudential rules they put in
place to regulate non-bank SIFIs, should we become one.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay. If I can sneak one more in, just thinking about Asia, following up maybe a little bit on
Jimmy's question, on a year-to-date basis, if I sort of take those results and annualize them, it looks like Asia overall is
looking about 5% or more below your original guidance for 2012 for that segment, at least from an earnings
perspective. Just curious as to what areas of pressure you might be seeing relative to what you are expecting and

whether you expect that pressure to dissipate as you look forward.
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: Hi. It's Chris Townsend here. If you look at the overall operating earnings for the
quarter, we're 17% up year-on-year. You break that down to the key components, which obviously are driven by Japan
and Korea, Japan is up 14% and Korea is up 52%. So, Japan performed strongly in terms of PFO growth, expense
control and Korea is up on – in terms of equity markets and higher surrender value.
If you look at it sequentially, which is, I guess where you're going with this, there's two key issues which have
impacted the earnings this quarter. One is, some beneficial VII that came forward in the prior quarter. And secondly,
there's a number of items which really a true-up of lapsed assumptions and expense items for Japan and Hong Kong,
which have impacted this quarter which are one-off issues.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay. So, as we look out to the full year, I guess the question is, how do you expect results to
fair versus that original guidance and do we just have to expect that there's a new baseline that's perhaps a little lower
despite the strong year-over-year growth in Japan and Korea?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: I think you need to look at the broader picture. The PFO growth is very strong
across the region we're up 7%; in Japan, we're up 9%; in Korea, we're up 11% and some of the other factors are quite
beneficial for us, particularly in terms of persistency, we're up 1.5 to 89.5 in Japan, which is a consistency and which
we articulated to you at the Investor Day in Tokyo.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Please go ahead.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Hey. Great. Thanks. I had a couple of follow-ups, first on goodwill, just to hit that from one
different angle. You mentioned in the comments that buyers may have to discount using kind of a captive or an
offshore structure and I just want to clarify why that would be the case? Is that due to kind of regulatory concerns that
are emerging around VA runoffs?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Randy. This is John. There are various – some states have launched investigations and are
reviewing captives. Although, there's been no conclusions or points of view on this yet, we think buyers would be more
cautious. Historically, some transactions we know were viewed being – optimizing fully the offshore structure and
others take a range. We at Met, we do use an offshore captive, but we allocate economic capital fully against all the
risks in the company, so we run it, I would say, on a conservative basis. Other buyers may take different views and we
think with these investigations underway that buyers would be more cautious now, in terms of valuing these types of
businesses.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Okay. So, it's more of a kind of a captive review; it's not necessarily kind of regulatory concerns
about the insolvency fund being on the hook or something like that?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: No. Not at all.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Okay. And then, if I could, just a follow-up on the pension closeout conversation. You
mentioned that some of these large blocks that have gone have not met your hurdle rate objective. I guess my question
is, if you could clarify for us what that hurdle rate objective is and if it may be subject to change given your
low-for-long rate outlook?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Don't put words into my mouth Randy. I didn't say – I said we competed for that business and
we have pricing discipline about, and obviously, we didn't win those closeouts, but that's the way it goes. I think there'll
be more.

In terms of our pricing objectives, and I think we actually talked about this on the last earnings call; we view our cost of
capital today in – domestically as 12%.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Okay.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: So that's our minimum hurdle rate. So, if we don't beat 12% we're not adding any economic
value at all. We generally are trying to price business with a target of a 15% return. And you have to remember a lot of
these liabilities are going to be around for a very long time, and it's important that we – if you price it poorly you're
stuck with that for a long time. You don't get an opportunity to change the numbers a couple of years from now. So,
that's why we're maintaining our discipline here.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Do you think as we look at these yields from the outside, is there a good rule of thumb we can
think of about like the capital you would allocate to a book as a percentage of assets and liabilities? Is – I mean,
generally, and I think annuity books are kind of like 5%, I mean, is that how we should look at the capital allocation to
try and get to those returns?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: It's tricky. I guess I'd hesitate to give you a rule of thumb because, what we've seen already is
that the mortality differences between these various blocks that have – had transacted are quite material. You think
there – you would guess sort of, they're generally retirees so they would be the same, but they are not. The mortality
differences were quite different. So – and that has a pretty big impact on whether or not what the capital allocation
would be. So, I guess I would hesitate to give you a rule of thumb.
<Q - Randy Binner>: All right. Fair enough. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Thank you. Actually, my first question is a follow-up for a comment or question that
Suneet had. And, I guess I'm just curious, back to the annuity business. The original intent behind the sales target for
the year of, call it, $18 billion was to be capital neutral in terms of the statutory capital that was allocated. At least,
that's my understanding. And, I guess I'm just kind of curious, you've had a few quarters since that was put out. You've
had some market movements, equities up, rates volatile. Is that, in fact, holding out or are you continuing to add capital
to the annuity business?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: This is Bill. I think rate neutral is still a fair assumption here, or capital neutral. Obviously,
the business is performing better than planned, mainly because of the market environment, and our sales targets are
basically where we expected them to be. So – but, I think neutral is still a good term for this.
Just if you pull back a minute, obviously with this low interest-rate environment, the VA business, especially the
in-force block, is not performing terribly well with regard to the exposure to interest rates and such. On our new sales –
our new sales this quarter had a 14% ROI and that's with a full economic capital allocation using today's environment.
So, we view that as pretty attractive business.
And so we're being tough-minded about annuities and making sure that our risk exposure there doesn't grow too much
relative to MetLife overall. But this business is profitable for us. And certainly today's sales are profitable, and this is a
consumer need which isn't going to go away and is a part of all of our customers' financial planning as they deal with
retirement. And so this is a business we like. We can't let it get too big relative to the size of MetLife, and I think that's
why you see the big pullback.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, I guess, still a few. On Latin America,
constant currency growth, maybe a little bit light. I think there may have been a group case that was lost. But can you
just talk a little bit about the growth outlook in Latin America and what expectations you would have for that?

<A - William J. Wheeler>: Yeah. So Latin America on the surface looked like it had a pretty weak top line quarter,
but of course, we did allude to the fact that sales growth was actually very good this quarter. You know, it was up 28%
and we're seeing very strong sales. Interestingly, the strongest area of growth is in direct marketing in Latin America,
and that's in a number of different countries. So top line is actually good. The premiums, fees and other income this
quarter are – certainly the currency adjustments hurt us and that were – as you alluded to there were a number of other
sort of anomalous factors. You know there were some group cases that didn't renew where the revenue was probably
more important than the – was more impactful than the profits were. We had a reinsurance adjustment, which affected
the top line, but didn't have a bottom-line impact.
So I view Latin America top line growth, when you kind of parse through all that, as something like 6%. That's
probably a little bit, year-over-year – that's probably still a little slower than normal. I would think – I think of Latin
America in total as being sort of a high single-digit revenue grower. We've certainly hit 10% in certain quarters. We've
probably averaged to something like 8% or 9%. And that's would be my long-term outlook.

<Q - Joanne Arnold Smith>: Hello? Can you hear me?
Operator
Yes. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Joanne Arnold Smith>: Okay. Can you hear me?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yeah, Joanne, we can hear you.
<Q - Joanne Arnold Smith>: Okay. Sorry about that. So, I want to go back to something that was stated at the ACLI
Conference last week, and that was with respect to the non-bank SIFI rules that have yet to be written. There was a
presentation where somebody characterized separate account assets as general account assets waiting to happen and
that the capital ratios that some of these life insurance companies are putting up are not necessarily truly reflective of
the real capital status of those companies. And I was wondering if you could comment on that and how in your
discussions with the Fed, they are talking to you about separate account assets?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Joanne. This is John Hele. There are many discussions, of course, and submissions going
on to the regulators about the future rules for non-bank SIFIs. We're participating in that as is the ACLI and other
people in the industry. But as of right now, we can give no feedback or guidance on where these will end up.
<Q - Joanne Arnold Smith>: I guess just in terms of the comment that was made about separate account assets being
general account assets waiting to happen. How do you respond to something like that?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: I wasn't there and don't have the context for all those points. The bank rules – if you strictly
apply bank rules today, separate accounts are included as general accounts. We are saying they should be excluded,
because it makes sense from a legal structure as an insurance company. It's quite a different framework from the
banking frameworks and the legal structures of banks. And that's a key point that we are making continually to the
regulators and we'll have to see where all this ends up.
<Q - Joanne Arnold Smith>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Thank you and good morning to everyone. My first question, I have two – my first question is
probably best directed to Bill Wheeler. Bill, why are these pension closeouts taking now – taking place now? The
reason I ask is that plans have been underfunded for a while. The supposed new accounting rules that create all this
volatility on balance sheets and income statements, I don't think they're new; they're three years old.
The Pension Protection Act, which makes it harder for companies to maintain underfundedness, was passed seven years
ago. So, why now on these pension closeouts, especially given the extremely low level of interest rates, which I believe
would act as an impediment to them?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: That's a great question, Eric. If you remember, and I know you do, we've been a big –
talking about large pension closeout opportunities for a long time, and of course nothing happened until very recently.
And you know, in talking to the treasurers of companies who have these large pensions; one, they're not being – in
most cases they are obviously not being used as a benefit anymore, their pensions are closed.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Okay.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: And the blocks that have been closed out are on retirees in any case. So, I think what's
going on is even – I think companies have said, you know what, I can't wait any longer for interest rates to improve. By
the way, I have a very large pension obligation here. I can start closing out pieces of it, maybe average into better
interest rates over time.
I also think they recognize that being a first mover here is probably a good thing. There is not an unlimited amount of
capital today that's available to support pension closeout business, and I think those who feel like they go early are
probably going to get better deals than those who go late.
And who knows how that will play out? But I know that's the sentiment out there. So you're right, in some cases, you
would think that this would not be an ideal time. But I think what's happening is companies have decided they just can't
wait any longer and they should get going.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Okay. And with the respect to the goodwill write-off, or I guess, it's not a write-down, you've
written off, I believe – please correct me, if I make an error here, 100% of the goodwill assigned to the retail annuity
business. Why is the stock market entering into this, in the sense that the stock market is – the reason I ask the question
again is that, the stock market has pretty much recovered to its pre-crisis peak or is close to it, we've had a good year.
Why is the current level of the stock market or maybe it has to do with when we come to where we are, why has that
depressed the value of the business?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Eric. This is John.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Please go ahead, please.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes, the stock market is back up, so the equity returns, say, in the variable annuity business
within the retail annuity business overall has recovered. When we speak of the market impact, we're speaking of how
buyers view – if you had a pure annuity company, a retail annuity company traded on the stock exchange, what
price-to-book would that be trading at today. So it's the valuations that...
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Okay.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: ... a retail annuity businesses would have to purchase that business. So when I refer to the
market environment, I'm referring to, call it, the high betas or the low price-to-books, lower historical price-to-books
that people have today and have been here for some time on these types of business.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Okay. Thanks very much.

And your final question today comes from the line of John Hall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - John A. Hall>: Good morning. And I guess, since Ed is probably not going to ask a question, I might just ask –
fill in about the risk-based capital for him. Could you give that out John, please?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, John. Nice to chat with you again. And I have to tell you that the risk-based capital
calculations Met does annually and we'll be giving that in our December forecast.
<Q - John A. Hall>: All right. Great. For Steve Goulart, the BAA assets have been moving up progressively in the
fixed maturities portfolio over the course of the year; is that because of an allocation in that direction or are you just –
or is that a result of credit changes?
<A - Steven J. Goulart>: No, that's our own action, as we've looked at portfolio opportunities in this market, and we
have modestly increased our BBBs. We think that's a good place to gain extra yield and still be comfortable with credit.
<Q - John A. Hall>: All right. Great. And then just, lastly, Steve Kandarian, you mentioned in your comments at the
outset, the agreement that you have with Walmart, and it's an intriguing, I guess, venture. Could you just describe a
little bit more about what you're doing there and perhaps the cost that might be associated with that? I mean, how are
you going to be accessing the Walmart customer?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: John, it's – as you mentioned, it's a pilot program, so it's early days. There isn't a
great deal of capital associated with it at this point in time, but that obviously could grow over time as sales increase.
And I really don't have much to mention at this point in time from a financial perspective, because it is very much in its
incipient stage. I think the most important thing here is that MetLife is going to innovate. MetLife is going to find new
ways to get to market and provide these kinds of products to our customers. And we know there's a tremendous need by
people in the United States to get greater coverage and protection from life insurance products. But perhaps we, as an
industry, haven't made it easy enough historically for them to complete a sale and this is one of the ways we are looking
to increase participation rates out there in the public in the arena of life insurance.
<Q - John A. Hall>: I guess what I'm asking is, is this a direct effort off of their website? Is this a kiosk in the store
that's automated? Is this a person who works for Met standing there selling policies? I mean, what's the access point?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: I mean, it's in the store. It's more of a kiosk sort of environment. You walk in there,
you'll see displays with – basically like a card on there that can go and you check out at the counter and it's prepaid.
And then – there are a few questions that they answered, then phone calls to be made by the customer to activate the
life insurance.
<Q - John A. Hall>: Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: John, we'll walk you through one, if you like. We'll go with you.
<Q - John A. Hall>: All right. We'll make a trip to Walmart together. Thanks, Steve.
