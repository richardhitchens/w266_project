MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Raytheon Third Quarter 2011 Internal Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Deanna, and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay
purposes.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed,
sir.
Todd Ernst
Thank you, Deanna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. The
results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call, and the slides we'll reference, are available on our

William H. Swanson
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon's performance was solid in the third quarter. Our focus on
execution drove strong margins and cash flow. Our new awards resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.12 and reflects good
customer demand for our products. Execution was strong across all our businesses.
Our bookings were driven in part by 13 programs over $100 million each, primarily driven by Missile Systems, which
had over 50% of these contract awards. I want to point out that this was the second highest quarter in bookings ever for
our Missile business.
In dollar terms, these 13 awards represent more than 40% of our $6.9 billion for the quarter. The remaining 60% of
orders was comprised of hundreds of programs averaging under $5 million each. The takeaway for us is that our
customers continue to invest in our affordable and innovative solutions that Raytheon has to offer. It's also notable
during the quarter we received just under $1.3 billion of international orders. We continue to see strong demand
globally for our technologies and products.
Our classified business remains an area of strength as well, with sales increasing by 10% in the quarter, the vast
majority of which was organic. As we all know, the overall budget environment remains fluid. Once again, we're
operating under a Continuing Resolution, which is reflected in our updated guidance. Dave will provide some color
around this in his remarks. Given the economic environment, we're focusing on the things we can control. We continue
to work closely with our customers to reduce costs, shorten timelines, and improve efficiency.
Our efforts to streamline the supply chain, reduce overhead and optimize our facility utilization are moving forward
and we are seeing continued improvements. Given today's global threat environment, we believe defense will continue
to be a high priority in our government's future spending plans. As such, I want to take a few minutes today to highlight
some of the recent key technology wins, and there's a lot of exciting work that we're doing to support our customers
which will drive future growth.
Raytheon BBN received an order or orders from the U.S. Army for a variant of the Boomerang shooter detection
system, which pinpoints incoming small arms fires from the shooters, helping to protect our troops.
IDS was awarded a contract for developing an integrated GPS-based system for Navy surface ships and subsurface
platforms, which uses open architecture net centric approach to allow hosting of positioning, navigation and timing data
in a common computing environment, thus enhancing the ship's operability with onboard systems.
While at the same time, SAS received a contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory for the development of
advanced high anti-jam GPS situational awareness sensors for applications on small weapons and UAV systems.
And just to further emphasize our cutting-edge technology and innovative solutions continue to be well aligned with
our customers' evolving requirements. Particularly in the areas of air and missile defense, ISR [intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance], EW [electronic warfare], air traffic management, Homeland Security, and training.
Let me sum up by saying we had a solid quarter in a challenging environment. Our strategies and our efforts to take out
costs are reflected in our results, and we will continue to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders. All of
this is made possible by the dedication, hard work and world-class talent of the Raytheon team.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.

Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks starting with third-quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to
questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the Web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
If everyone could move to page thee. As Bill noted, we performed well in the third quarter. Our continued focus on
performance and execution across the company drove margins, EPS, and operating cash flow results during the quarter.
Our total company bookings for the quarter were $6.9 billion, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1.12.
Our adjusted EPS, which excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment and a favorable tax settlement, was $1.39, up 3%,
driven by capital deployment actions as well as operational improvements. Sales were $6.1 billion in the quarter, about
$100 million below our guidance and reflects the challenging environment. Adjusted operating margins were up 20
basis points to 13%. We delivered strong operating cash flow from continuing operations of $859 million, which is
better than expected driven primarily by working capital. I'll address updates to our 2011 guidance in just a few
minutes.
During the quarter the company repurchased 7.6 million shares of common stock for $312 million, bringing the
year-to-date share repurchase to 20.1 million shares for $937 million. And as we announced last month, the company's
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common
stock.
It's also worth highlighting that on October 17, Moody's upgraded our long-term senior unsecured credit rating to A3
reflecting the company's strong financial position.
Turning now to page four. Let me start by providing some detail on our third-quarter results. Our total company
bookings for the quarter were $6.9 billion, and on a year-to-date basis were $19.4 billion. Taken together in the last two
quarters, we have seen solid bookings on both a domestic and international basis.
Notable bookings in the third quarter included $584 million of missiles for the production of AMRAAM for the U.S.
Air Force and international customers, $329 million for the development of Standard Missile-3 for the Missile Defense
Agency, and $221 million for production of Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles for the U.S. Navy and international
customers. SAS and IIS booked $468 million and $313 million respectively on a number of classified programs.
NCS booked $187 million for the production of Sentinel radars, spares and services for the U.S. Army and international
customers. IDS booked $142 million for the production of Airborne Low Frequency Sonar systems and spares for the
U.S. Navy and $93 million to provide advanced Patriot air missile capability for an international customer. And
Technical Services booked $256 million for domestic training and $67 million for foreign training programs. Backlog
at the end of the third quarter was $35 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million over year end 2010.
So if you'd now move to page five, sales were $6.1 billion, slightly below our previous expectations, due to the timing
of program awards as well as our cost reduction efforts.
Comparing sales by business to last year's third quarter, IDS had net sales of $1.2 billion. The change in IDS was
primarily due to lower volume on international Patriot and the Zumwalt program as a result of the revised funding
profile which I spoke about on prior calls. It's also worth noting that the 30 day formal notification for Saudi Patriot
was submitted to Congress on October 19. We expect to receive approval – our approval letter from the State
Department after the 30 day clock expires.
IIS had third-quarter 2011 net sales of $760 million compared to $735 million in the third quarter of 2010, primarily
driven by higher sales on classified programs.
Missile Systems had net sales of $1.4 billion, in line with the same period a year ago.
NCS had net sales of $1.1 billion. The change in net sales was primarily due to ground based sensor programs for the
U.S. Army which are nearing completion.
Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 5%. Primarily driven by growth on
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance programs as well as sales related to Raytheon Applied Signal Technology.

The integration of Applied Signal Technology is going well and their programs and results are tracking to our
objectives.
And Technical Services had net sales of $817 million. The 6% change was primarily due to lower sales on programs
that are nearing completion, including a DTRA [Defense Threat Reduction Agency] program and a TSA program.
Moving ahead to page six. We were pleased by our overall company margin performance. Our adjusted margin was
13%, up 20 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted margin was 12.7%, also up 20 basis points over the
comparable period in 2010.
The strength of our margins reflects the benefits of our broad portfolio of programs, both domestic and international, as
well as our focus on executing cost reductions and efficiencies. So looking at margins by business,
IDS missiles and NCS and Technical Services' margins were up in the quarter compared with the same period last year,
the result of solid operating performance. IIS margins were essentially in line with prior year's Q3.
Now at SAS, the change in margins was in part due to acquisition and integration related costs which had an impact of
approximately 60 basis points in the quarter, and a $14 million charge or 110 basis points related to a contract
modification. You may also remember that last year's third quarter was exceptionally strong for SAS from an overall
performance standpoint.
Turning now to page seven. Third quarter 2011 adjusted EPS was $1.39. The increase was driven by program
performance and capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases. And on a year-to-date basis, adjusted EPS
was $4.17, up 6% from the same period last year.
If you'd now turn to page eight, I'd like to comment on our current guidance for the year. We now see sales for the year
in the range of $25 billion to $25.3 billion. Broadly speaking, the revised outlook reflects the current environment that
the industry is facing. More specifically, there have been delays in new program starts and funding. We expect this to
be the case for the balance of the year, driven by the CR from a domestic standpoint. Further impacting the near-term
sales outlook is the timing of international awards and our cost reduction initiatives.
As we've done in prior years, during the third quarter we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans.
As a result of the update, FAS/CAS pension expense for the year decreased by $27 million from $365 million to $338
million. We have raised the lower end, narrowing our adjusted EPS outlook to be between $5.55 and $5.65. We
increased our 2011 guidance for GAAP EPS to be between $4.94 and $5.04 which reflects the updated full year
FAS/CAS pension expense and a slightly higher than expected tax settlement.
Our current operating cash flow outlook for the full year of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion remains on track. Overall, our
updated outlook for 2011 reflects our ability to drive performance through operational improvements and capital
deployment actions. And as you can see on page nine, we've reflected the change in our guidance by business. The
increase in margin reflects the expected additional benefits of productivity and efficiency initiatives. Overall, we're
pleased with our operational performance and the results we've delivered, while at the same time, passing along cost
savings to our customers.
Now typically, we provide initial guidance for next year on our third quarter call, but given the environment, the
Continuing Resolution, as well as the outcome from the Super Committee's recommendations, which we expect to see
on November 23, it wouldn't be prudent to provide 2012 guidance at this time.
As we look ahead, there are a range of possible outcomes from an industry perspective. With that said, we believe
Raytheon is well positioned given our diverse portfolio, international content, strong performance, bookings, efficiency
results and a solid financial foundation.
We've had a strong book-to-bill for the last two quarters at an average of 1.16. We are taking costs out of the business
and we've seen the results in our operating margins and again, our broad portfolio of technologies and products are well
aligned with customer priorities, both domestically and internationally.

As we've done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2012 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January.
So if you could please move to page 10, we've provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2012 as we've done
in prior years. And just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out
2011.
Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize. We saw solid performance in the third quarter and in many areas
exceeded the guidance we provided back in July. We had strong bookings, strong margins, and better-than-expected
operating cash flow. Our results reflect the actions we've taken to continue to deliver solid performance
notwithstanding the current economic environment.
Looking ahead, we remain laser focused on delivering best value for our customers. This includes making sure the
company continues to be proactive and has the right cost structure to operate effectively and efficiently in a dynamic
and evolving marketplace. We're well-positioned to address the challenges in our industry and deliver affordable,
innovative solutions that meet the needs of our customers while also creating value for our shareholders.
So with that, Bill and I will open the call up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Heidi Wood, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thanks, Heidi.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Bill, various Defense contractors have taken a range of strategies to kind of offset the Defense
budget down cycles focusing on international or healthcare IT. It seems like you are spending more and more time
working on Homeland Security. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you are differentiating your strategy on that
and when you're going to start to see more and more effects of the efforts you're putting in there?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. Heidi, it's a great question. I'd like to just go back and say we've got a solid
foundation in Air and Missile Defense and ISR, EW, and if you look at cyber and the other areas we're working on. For
us they really provide us the foundation for Homeland Security. And when you look at it, it really goes into border
security, and it really goes into the command and control that some nations need to be able to integrate their air picture,
their ground picture into providing what I call high fidelity information to them so they can make decisions.
So for us, the homeland or border security really brings together all the aspects of the company, and it's really a natural
and you know our portfolio, so you can imagine how it all comes together. So for us we've got international C2
[command and control] opportunities that we expect to see in either Q4 or Q1. We've got some international sensing
programs that should be coming in that will tie all that together.
And I guess the way I look at it is as you look at the U.S. pulling out of our forward presence, one of the things
everybody wants to know is what's going on on the borders. And we believe our company has all the tools to be able to
do that. From a bookings point of view, we expect to be around $750 million, $800 million this year and we expect
sales to be between $750 million and $800 million in the same range. Both of those are increases over the prior year, so
we see growth, if that helps.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Great. And then my follow-up question, Bill, is that – and I unfortunately burdened the two
executives yesterday with this question, so you weren't alone in this one. But the Pentagon is engaging in the should
cost exercise, which appears to be going not just to the primes but also to the suppliers. And of course, you have
industry leading margins. Doesn't this exercise imply lower margins, lower revenues, and, in fact, possible contract
delays because this government analysis is going to create disagreement and thus delays in contracting?

<A - William H. Swanson>: I guess I don't look at it that way, Heidi. I view the kind of programs we have, if you take
AMRAAM, we're in our 25th or 26th year. And every year we're asked to deliver AMRAAMs. We've grown them
from model A to model D. And if you look at it, the government looks to us to give them more increased capability and
to be able to do that at a lower price. And so we kind of get up every day and have to do that and it's part of our DNA
culture. And as Dave talked about, our margins went up because we're taking costs out of business and you know what?
When we propose it next time, those proposals will reflect that lower cost, so that's good for our customers. And we
don't have a hang-up with it. I mean, our company's DNA is being competitive and doing what we do. So that's I guess
why I don't have any concern about it.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.
Operator
And the next question will come from the line of Carter Copeland, Barclays Capital.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Hi, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a couple of quick ones. First off, Dave, on the margins for – that are implied in the
fourth quarter, I'm sure you're prepared to answer this one, but in TS, we're obviously implying a bit of a deterioration.
And on IIS, you're implying about 9% it looks like given the guidance. And in NCS about 13%, which is running
below where you've been the first three quarters of the year. Can you just give us some color on what's happening in
those three segments in terms of profitability in the fourth-quarter?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. So with respect to TS, both the third quarter and year-to-date was above guidance as
we generated strong performance on some of the contracts that are reaching the end of life, basically. Q4 there is a mix
change from efforts on lower margin work. And we also expect lower throughput in our Customized Engineering and
Depot Services business, which is a higher margin business. We did raise the margin outlook for the year 60 to 90 basis
points, and that, as you've noted, is driven by the year-to-date performance.
So you asked about – I'm sorry, the other two businesses were IIS -
<Q - Carter Copeland>: IIS and NCS?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Right. So there's nothing too remarkable going on with respect to IIS. They've performed
well. As you know, early in the year a letter of credit was drawn by the UABA (sic) [UKBA] (23:32) and that impacted
the year-to-date results. Q4 does include sales on some higher margin programs, and we have a lot of confidence in that
business just given the way they've delivered throughout the year. The last business, SAS – I'm sorry, NCS.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: NCS, yeah.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: NCS. For both the third quarter and year-to-date, we've exceeded our expectations. There
are some mix changes slightly in Q4 which are driven by new starts, new program starts on development work and also
a ramp down on some longer standing production programs, specifically for the U.S. Army. We have raised our
full-year guidance 30 to 50 basis points. And again, that's driven by the year-to-date performance and the timing of
some cost improvements that's been initiated in that business.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. And then a follow-up on the pension front. I wondered if given where we are today if
you could tell us a little bit about how you're thinking about pension funding for next year and beyond and how that
may have changed given where we are with the discount rates?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Right. So obviously, this is forward-looking. Today, the environment for the discount rate
would be somewhere in the 5% to 5.25%. In 2011 from an assumption standpoint, we would use 5.75%. The expected

returns, long-term expected returns at 8.75% for '11 are expected at this point to be the same for '12. From an actual
return standpoint, as of close of business yesterday, we were – our pension assets were running at just about negative
1%, so we're right around breakeven from that standpoint.
From a funding perspective, given those assumptions looking ahead, we would see gross funding at about $1.3 billion
next year, which is up from $1.1 billion this year. Now obviously, neither of those numbers, '11 or '12 includes any
discretionary pension contributions, the type that we've done in the past.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thank you and great quarter.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thanks, Carter.
Operator
The next question will come from the line of Troy Lahr, Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Thanks. I know you didn't want to talk about 2012, but in a flat budget environment, can you still
see Raytheon having some growth next year?
<A - William H. Swanson>: It's Bill. Let me answer this. If we were to assume that DoD is flat to slightly negative
due to inflation, we believe that in that case our international backlog opportunities and portfolio and our technology
would more than offset this impact, if that helps. That's kind of how we think about it.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Okay. So flat to down you might be flattish I guess you're saying or...?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Or up a skosh. It's all the timing, but from our standpoint, I think how we look at it is
DoD flat to slightly negative including inflation.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Okay. And then a follow-up. Can you just update us on what you're thinking about bookings? I
think you were previously at $27.5 billion?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. Right now if you look at it, crystal ball would say we're about at $27 billion plus or
minus $500 million, and we're probably right at the midpoint there.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Great. Thanks, gentlemen.
<A - William H. Swanson>: So it's still strong bookings in this environment.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Okay. I appreciate it.

The next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Sam.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Hi. Can you talk a little bit about – I guess if you take the, call it $500 million or so of sales
that you've pushed out in terms of the year, can you characterize that in terms of what are program delays versus maybe
cancellations and even in the cost-plus world where you've lowered the cost structure so you're actually getting hit

because of the cost-plus nature of those contracts?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. So, Sam, that is a good question. And we'll add some clarity to that. So if you think
about the outlook coming down $500 million to $600 million, about half of that – a little more than half of that relates
to the timing of awards that we've been talking about on the last quarter or two. Around 25% of it relates to the
Continuing Resolution that we now find ourselves in. And a little less than 25% relates to the cost reduction actions,
again, that we've been engaged in throughout the year.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then just as we think about and look at the Continuing Resolution and what may
change. Given your large backlog, can you just talk about which businesses are probably the most sensitive to near
term changes in the budget environment, where you would call them I guess, short cycle type of businesses, where a if
we see a reduction it immediately affects your business?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. Usually short cycle is lower margin kind of business. And for us, RTSC's margins
aren't that bad, but they'd be probably more affected than anyone on short cycle. If you look at Missiles, their programs
usually have good gestation periods, as I call them. They run three to four years. IDS, SAS is in that category. IIS
would probably be next to RTSC only because the intelligence community runs on a shorter span cycle, and then I
would say NCS would be in the middle, if that helps.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Because what generally happens is programs that are fungible, if you're looking at Fed
IT, or IT kind of things, so that's where people can really cut first and have an effect. So that's where I would see part of
the pressure coming.

And the next question will come from the line of Rob Spingarn, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Rob.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: A couple questions on the segments. IDS you talked about the lower Patriot, or the absence
of the – an international contract there, but Dave, could you walk through – the margins went up, the sales went down.
Wouldn't this have actually reduced margins, or was there an award fee or reserve reversal in the Q that helped?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No. There was no reserve reversal. The – what we alluded to with respect to the
international Patriot business was just the timing of activity year-over-year. I would read absolutely nothing into that.
The Patriot business for us is very, very strong, very, very healthy. We have a very solid pipeline. We've articulated a
multitude of opportunities. It's simply just timing of activity this quarter versus last year's third quarter for programs
that are essentially in production.
From a margin standpoint, IDS did perform exceptionally well. It was driven by a combination of both contract mix,
domestic and international, as well as overall cost reduction improvements.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So I hope that puts the right framework around what you're looking for.

<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Well it does. And then I would ask you, cost reduction is a theme here. We're seeing a lot of
cost take-out across the contracting base. Not just from you, but from peers as well. I mean, how much further can this
go? How much headroom do you have?
And then the other thing I wanted to ask you about is you talked about the weaker Army – this is in tangent to Sam's
question – the weaker Army business you saw at NCS, Army looks like it's going to get hit the hardest here in the
budget. So how long can – how much downside do you see across the segments in Army? So cost take-out and Army
downside.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. So Raytheon has strong margins historically. And certainly that's the case for 2011
and in particular, the third quarter. We continue to find ways to improve the overall efficiency of the business and the
byproduct of improving efficiency is improved cost and higher margins and ultimately a more competitive business.
I would suggest that we will continue to find ways to improve the overall efficiency, to take costs out of the company,
whether that's in supply chain, in overhead, in G&A. We have – we're approaching NBI [new business investment]
differently today than we did in the past and we've become very, very efficient on bidding on new programs, both
competitive and sole-source. So I would say you could expect the cost reduction improvements that we've made to
continue into the foreseeable future.
With respect to the U.S. Army production program, that's something we've been talking about for quite a while. It's
primarily ground-based sensors and products related to ground-based sensors. This is – it's not new news. It's
something we had planned on, it's something the customer had planned on. NCS is doing a fine job in transitioning that
business into a broader portfolio of products focusing on international, on Homeland Security, on air traffic control.
And we expect NCS to deliver very well for Raytheon as we go forward into '12 and beyond.

And the next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Dave, a quick overview on the bookings. I was wondering if you were to – you obviously had
some good bookings in the quarter, but if you were to split them out between exports and domestic, what was the sort
of year-on-year growth or decline in those two buckets?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. So from a bookings standpoint, in Q3, Bill actually mentioned this earlier. We had
about $1.3 billion in international bookings and $5.6 billion in domestic bookings. Overall, the bookings increased by
about $1 billion. And that was – over last year, that was, I believe, and I'll confirm this, split about equally relative to
both international and domestic. But I will confirm that for you.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And Dave, I would add that we see bookings this year being about 30% international and
sales being about 25%, so that will give you an idea of the mix, kind of how we look at where the year will end up. Just
to add a little color there.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Okay. As a follow-up related to the exports, Bill, I was wondering if you could give us an update
on some of your major targets out there on the export market and whether any of these are being delayed as tends to
happen?

<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. How much time have we got here?
<Q - Rob Stallard>: The big ones. Just the big ones.
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, I'm just joking. There's a lot going on in international for us. And let me kind of tick
them off my mind here. We've got TPY-2 radars that are both domestic and international. We expect about $800
million in radar side of those between I'd say Q4, Q1. I'd say half international, half domestic.
We've got Taiwan Patriot that we're expecting to wrap up this year. That would be Q4, say $600 million plus or minus
$100 million.
We've got Kuwait two or a four lot depending on what they really want to do, so that could be $600 million to $1
billion. We look at that at first half of fiscal year '12.
We've got Paveways which are continuing to be in demand due to replenishment and so forth, so we see about $500
million in that, late Q4, some in the first half of fiscal year '12.
Our air traffic control radars are about $200 million to $300 million, we see those in Q4, Q1.
Missiles, even though they had a great quarter, we are seeing another $600 million to $800 million for them. About
a-third in Q4 and I'd say about two-thirds of that will show up in the first half of next year.
Training, about $100 million. We see internationally in Q4.
We've got Turkey, Patriot. We expect to hear their decision sometime later this year, and that should be awarded say,
mid next year on that program, and that will be good-sized depending on what they get.
You probably read Oman is looking for ground-based air defense systems, about $1 billion to $1.5 billion, so we're
working that.
International C2, we expect to see $400 million or $500 million internationally in Q4, Q1.
And what am I forgetting? Oh, and international border security, kind of at $100 million probably fourth quarter this
year. And I think I could keep going, but I'd stop there.
The international, very strong. There are delays, but I guess the way I look at them, I don't like delays, but we live with
them. They are not cancellations and that's the way you got to look at it. We feel very good about our product line and
what we are discussing with our customers and their buying. Just pinpointing that time is hard because their schedules
are different than ours. And of course, patience is not a Western virtue. So we work hard to get them done.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Okay. Thanks, Bill.
<A - William H. Swanson>: If that helps.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Hey, Rob, just last thing. While Bill was talking, I was just able to just confirm, it was
about 50%/50%. The incremental $1 billion is split between international and domestic on about a 50%/50% basis.

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Hey, Dave, could you touch a little bit on cash flow? You maintained your guidance, but I
think in the quarter you came in a couple hundred million ahead of your expectation. Obviously, that would still put
you in your guidance range. But could you maybe talk if you're trending towards the high end of that?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. I think that this stage – again, we give obviously, bookends, cash is the toughest
thing to nail from a point estimate standpoint. If you think about the midrange to high-end, I think you're more in line
than thinking about it at the lower end of the range. That's where I would suggest if you're trying to figure out where
we're going to close out the year. That's what I'm seeing.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And you're still on track for about $700 million in cash taxes for the year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Slightly under. That's right, slightly under. Now we did receive that tax refund you'll recall
of about $100 million, so it's slightly under $600 million.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: All right. And my follow-up, just may be a little bit nitpicky, but if I take your segment
expectations and take those add them up to what it means for an EPS number, I come in well above what your EPS
guidance is, using all the other assumptions. What is the plug? Is that conservatism, or what am I missing?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, no. I mean, I think if you stand back from this, there is a range on each one of the
segments. And then you have to look at what goes on from an inter-company standpoint, what gets eliminated. So the
math does work. I don't think you are missing anything. From a big picture standpoint, as we took down the expectation
on sales $500 million or $600 million, that impacted us by about $0.10 or $0.12. And that was offset by the margin
improvement that we spoke about a little bit earlier today. We have tightened up the range on the share count from a
high end of 359 million to a high end of 354 million. And we had a little bit of a change from a tax rate standpoint
because the assumptions on PBT from a taxable income perspective is slightly higher than what we had seen earlier in
the year. But taken all together, the math does work if you add up the pieces.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: All right. Thanks.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay, Dave.

And the next question will come from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much. And Bill, thank you for the review of your foreign potential. So
if I take the numbers you've given us, so you've taken the bookings target down $500 million to $27 billion, you're 30%
international. By my math, that assumes something like $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter. It doesn't look like you've
gotten a whole lot here. Is that in jeopardy that some of that stuff could slip, just because it looks like it's a pretty big
number?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. Cai, that's why I was kind of giving you Q4 and Q1. It's – you, of anyone on the
call knows the dates on how international happens and I wish I could tell you it's going to happen on December 12.
You can't predict those that well, so you try and put them in a range. And so for us, we put them in a range that we
think they'll will be Q4, but they could be the first part of Q1 and that's not so bad.
The other part is when you look at our bookings of $27 billion, to be within $500 million of that at this point in time
with everything going on in the world, I don't think it's that bad. And the point is, you always know my frustration on
the fact that they don't happen, but we size our business. We do all our workforce planning across the company so that
we can, as I call it, win anywhere, perform anywhere, and ship anywhere. And we do that so that we can handle these
ebbs and flows and that you don't see wild swings in our workforce. And it's because we do this work and we're pretty
good at the planning aspect, but there is a chance that that could move, but it's not moving 12 months if that – if you
kind of figured it that way.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Right. Alternatively, if you look at kind of what your numbers seem to imply for domestic
bookings, it looks like it's a number like [ph] $4.9 billion (44:05), which would be maybe a book-to-bill of 0.85, 0.87 in
the final quarter. Relative to history, that looks a little bit conservative. I don't know, in today's environment maybe it's
not. Maybe you could give us some color in terms of is that a -?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I think what's going on there, Cai, from our standpoint is that if you go to Washington
and you talk to people that, November is when the CR is supposed to end. I guess, in our planning we're kind of
thinking it's going to continue for the year. That's back to the question if you look at DoD being flat to negative because
of inflation, and that's kind of how we're thinking of it. And we're planning it.
You know us, there's, the way I always call it, A, B, and C. You look at best case, you look at worst case, and you look
at most likely. And we plan on most likely. And that's the way we size or business and we run our business. And I think
it's reflected in our margins and our results that we're pretty good at pegging it. We're probably a little bit more
conservative on the CR than some might be, but that's – we just went through the longest one in history going to May
and I want us to be pragmatic about it and that's how we've done it.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: You've done an extraordinary job of kind of delivering spectacularly good profitability -
<A - William H. Swanson>: Cai, would you repeat that again? I kind of missed it. That was -
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yeah. Well, very good profitability despite the sales missing. I mean, it kind of looks here
like we might see another slip. Is there a point at which it becomes more difficult to deliver that excellent profitably if
you kind of get decremental sales?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I would tell you it gets harder, but it's not foreign to what we do. If you were here and
part of the team, everyone, including the functions here at corporate and out in the businesses, everybody knows that
our customers are being asked to do more with no more. And we take that challenge very seriously, and there's great
alignment on it. It's hard. I wish it wasn't as difficult on everybody, but that's the condition we're in. And from, at least,
everyone in Raytheon, I've seen no objections to taking on this task. In fact, everybody takes great delight in finding
ways to do it better.
And Six Sigma really drives our results around here. It's not a buzzword, it's not a cliché, it's how we do things. And
that's, I think, on this call, people have asked me about margins now for eight or nine years, and we continue to find
ways to improve. And we're not going to give up on that, if that helps.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Terrific. Thank you very much.

<Q - Doug S. Harned>: I'd like to, Bill, get a little bit more sense from you on the environment. Because as we look at
the impact of the CR, and this continues to go on, do you see us in a situation where the weaker revenues we're seeing
at Raytheon and other – basically at all the defense companies, this becomes a new reality that we're just sort of
plugging away at this tough situation in Washington or is it something that you would expect pent-up demand to occur
as we get a year or so down the road and have to basically address the issues that we've had working through a very
tough decision-making environment in D.C.?

<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. I think from my standpoint, if I look at it – I'll just give you my perspective,
personal perspective, that we're going to be coming out of Iraq. Afghanistan, tough situation. We'll continue to work
hard there, but we'll come out of Afghanistan. When you do that, the troops will come back, much needed rest. But
we're going to have to resize, regroup and be ready for the next mission. And I think the next mission is that as a
country, we're going to have smaller forces that have to operate globally on a moment's notice. They're going to have to
have different tools and technologies to help them bridge that gap. We're going to have to recapitalize what we've
worn-out because we've never seen an up tempo like this for this long.
And why I feel so strong about the things we're working on, I mean, I don't get to always talk about our technology
programs, but some of our wins I didn't touch base on are we're working on sense and warn. How do we handle the
shoot-and-scoot kind of threat using asymmetric tactics? We've got that going on in one business program that we won
there. We've got new advanced thermal imagers that we're looking at that are uncooled that can do more, lighter
weight, less energy consumption. We're looking at predictive, understanding the future technologies. We're looking at
advanced nonlethal weapons that are solid-state, quantum computing. I didn't get to talk about classified, but for us, our
classified is running about 16% of sales year-to-date. We expect growth year-over-year of about 10%.
So as we look at our portfolio, we think the things we're doing are going to be in demand as we resize, regroup and take
on the future. I know that's a long answer, but I think your premise is a good one. Right now, we're consumed with
getting our budget in order or our house in order as a country, and once we do that, then people are going to work on,
okay, what is this new environment that we're in and how do we make sure that we're one of the most capable nations
in the world? I don't think that'll be lost. And national security has always been a priority for the United States. So I'm
hopeful.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: And against this backdrop, one of the things you've clearly done is pushing cyber as a growth
opportunity. You've done a number of acquisitions there. When you look forward now, do you have what you need
there? Or are you still seeing this as an area that you would push harder on in terms of a use of cash?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I'd probably continue to push harder. I believe the threat isn't constant, that this is a threat
that travels at the speed of light. It's one click and the threat morphs and you have to work on it from both ends. And
that's why we continue to do that. And if you look at it, you not only have to look at it from what I'd call a DoD or
intelligence point of view, but the commercial world is realizing the exposures that they have. So this is the new reality,
and it's getting a lot of attention. I'm just glad we've got a four or five year head start on this one because we saw this
one coming, as you know.

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So George, why don't I take that question. On a year-to-date – in the quarter, international
sales were down about $40 million on about $1.5 billion, that equates to about 3%. And that was driven by a number of
different things we talked about earlier. We do expect it to rebound in the fourth quarter and be in the mid- to
high-single digits as we close out the year.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And what will happen here is the Saudi program will start to take off because as Dave
pointed out, we're in Congressional notification. Expect that to happen in the next 30 days and then it'll take off.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yes.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And then the other one, probably more for you, Dave. In the last two quarters,
you've lowered the high end of the sales guidance by about $1 billion, about 4%. My question is, while other
companies have lowered their sales guidance as well, yours seems to be somewhat more than others. And I was just
wondering if you'd thought about why or had any reasons for why that might be happening?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No. It's a fair question and I can talk about Raytheon in particular. I'll use the words that
Bill spoke about earlier. We have been seeing program awards moving to the right. It's not a matter of losing new
programs. This has happened both on a – from a domestic standpoint, as well as to some extent, from an international
standpoint, sort of in line with your first comment.
We also have focused a lot of our attention on cost reductions. And we've been talking about that for a while now. And
that obviously impacts our cost-type contracts. We also began to see, as we moved into the second half of the year, our
customers thinking through the timing of how programs will be let, sort of in line with the first comment I made.
What I'd like to focus your attention on, with all of that said, is the bookings profile. If you look at Q2 and Q3 together,
we had a book-to-bill of about 1.16, and I understand the arithmetic. The sales are a little bit down. But even with that
said, it's a very strong book-to-bill ratio. As Bill spoke to just a few minutes ago with someone else, with Cai, we see
the book-to-bill being – we have a range of about 1.05 to the high end of about 1.1 as we close out the year. So I think
your observation may be correct. But with that said, the bookings continue to be strong. And I think the bookings and
the backlog are the best indicator of how the company looks over the longer term.
<A - William H. Swanson>: George, it's Bill. I would add that the CR has a bigger effect on us for this taking it down
that when we looked at sales before, we kind of believed what we're hearing, that people were going to enact the
budgets, put them in place. And I think now, we're probably really pragmatic, maybe a little conservative in the sense
that we think the CR will continue and we want to reflect that. That's the way I'd really answer it. There's – from our
standpoint, I just think it's going to be difficult to get things done, and you're getting our best estimate and that reflects
the CR continuing.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: I just wanted to follow up on, I think, two questions ago the new norm versus temporary
situation debate. And I guess what I struggle with is, we've had most Defense companies now miss the top line in the
quarter and reduce the full year outlook and attribute it to timing and delays. And as we all try to figure out the forward,
timing and delays has an implication that, that situation is going to reverse itself and get better sooner than later. But if

we just look at the Defense budget, investment is down 3% in the base in '11, and we're now seeing pretty much every
Defense company's revenues down about the same amount. And then when we look at where the '12 and '13 numbers
are likely to shake out, base investment looks pretty similar. So that would tell you should just plug in these kind of low
single-digit declines for revenue for the next few years, whereas, delays in timing would tell you to do something a lot
different. So how do we get our arms around which it is and why shouldn't we just look at the Defense budget?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I think depending on the company, you can look at the budget. I think for us, the top
line's not the indicator. For us, it's the granular detail that's within the budget. And if you look at and slice it right, you
get both hot spots and cold spots. And when you look at the big programs, they're going to be under a lot of scrutiny
and a lot of attention. And so from that standpoint, you really got to look at each company and their portfolio and
what's at risk going out in the budget environment.
But clearly, to give you my impression, there are delays. And what it is, is that our customers are trying to figure out
and do their budget planning. And right now, it's a movable stake in the ground. And it's movable because they're
trying to figure out do they plan to a 10% cut, a 5% cut? Do they plan to whatever? And when you're doing all this
planning, you're not doing your day job. And it's really hard to get that done.
And so from our standpoint, the way I look at it, it's like in a business, you need a budget. You need to be able to plan
for something. Once you have that, you set your strategies around it. And what we see right now because of the
uncertainty with the Super Committee and the budget process for the country, it's hard for our customer who gets their
funding in that regard.
But also when you look at it, about two-thirds of our funding comes from DoD. The balance is international, it's
agencies and so forth. So the company itself has changed and morphed over time and we'll continue to do that. So it's
really different, depending on the company. It depends on your fixed-price, cost-plus basis. For us, always think of us
as 60% or 55% fixed-price versus cost-plus. Other companies are the other way around. They might be 60%/40%. So it
really depends on each company as we do that. But my bottom line, it doesn't feel like cancellations. It does still feel
like delays.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Does that help? I mean, it's really hard to pinpoint. But I would tell you that we don't see
programs disappearing.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And I think that's the important part that I'd probably have a different concern and I'd talk
to you differently if I saw things just evaporating. We don't see that.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: No. I mean, it makes sense and it's helpful. I mean, I guess, it just takes it back to, I think,
George's question, which is that, on paper, it makes a lot of sense to think you guys would outgrow your peers given
the international footprint, the focus on cyber intel, the upgrade of existing versus make of new, but the actual bookings
and growth numbers have been very similar to others for several quarters in a row. But I guess, you're saying some
delays in international in particular and the impact from the CR being disproportionate are probably the explanation for
that and still feel like the forward for you is above average?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes. I feel the forwards there. I think the other thing I would say is if you look – I'm
trying to go from memory – that we were 1.2 in the second quarter, 1.12 this quarter. And so if you look at it, I think at
the beginning of the year, I had made the comment that I thought our bookings would pick up near the last half of the
year. We've seen that, as we look at Q4, we've got a big quarter in front of us. And when you look at this year with the
budget process and everything going on, it feels a little bit like Q4, Q1-ish kind of thing. But it's not Q4 and Q3 of next
year, it's within a short window. So that's why we feel positive about what we see, and there's just a multiplicity of
programs that we have going. That's one of the strengths. And what was a little bit unusual this quarter is to have 13
pretty good-sized programs over $100 million. But those should have happened earlier in the year. And that's the way
to think about it.
