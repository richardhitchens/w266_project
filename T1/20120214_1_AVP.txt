MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, my name is Ruth and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Avon's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on
mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions]
I'll now turn the conference over to Amy Chasen, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. Ms. Chasen, you may
begin your conference.
Amy Low Chasen
Thank you. Thank you for joining us this morning. With me on the call are Andrea Jung, Avon's Chairman and CEO,
and Kimberly Ross, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today we're going to spend our time discussing topics we
believe are most top of mind. Andrea will start with an update on our business review and some perspective on 2012.
Kimberly will then discuss her first impressions and her key areas of focus. We will not be reviewing the quarter or the
year in detail, but instead have posted relevant data in a deck on the Investor Relations section of our website, and we'll
be happy to answer your questions in the Q&A session later.
With that, I refer to the cautionary statement in today's earnings release, as well as to our non-GAAP reconciliation,
which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual, on the call we will focus on these adjusted
non-GAAP financial measures.

Andrea Jung
Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everybody. With me on the call is Kimberly Ross, who I'm very pleased is here today to
share her first thoughts and observations, as well as our priorities for 2012. As all of you know, Kimberly joined Avon
at the beginning of December from Ahold. Many of the business challenges she successfully dealt with there have
application to Avon, and I have no doubt in the short time we've already worked together that her experiences will be
hugely beneficial to address the opportunities for improvement here at Avon. So, I know you'll join me in welcoming
her to the company and to this call.
Let me just begin with a quick comment on leadership transition since I haven't spoken to you live since my
announcement last December. This is the time of tremendous change for the company and my critical priority is
providing stability and day-to-day leadership as we continue to motivate and focus our 40,000 associates and our
millions of representatives. Their full engagement is essential at this juncture and I'm highly encouraged by the
collective sense of urgency and commitment in every market around the Avon world, as we keep the entire
organization focused on reaccelerating growth and getting this business back on track.
The CEO search is underway and, in the interim, we continue to aggressively drive the end-to-end operational and
financial review of the business. And as a reminder, we began a full, deep-dive assessment in December, and that major
work continues with the appropriate speed, rigor and strong external support.
Kimberly and I will share a little insight where we're able to at this juncture, but as we said in the press release this
morning, I have made the obvious decision to delay the review with all of you. It clearly makes sense to wait until a
new CEO is on board and takes the appropriate time before sharing longer-term financial and operating objectives for
2013 and beyond.
In the meantime, my main message is that the organization is not standing still during this transition period, teams are
moving forward and taking action where it makes full sense and thoughtfully tabling others where we should definitely
wait. While I am deferring decisions that have strategic impact for the longer term, we are making decisions that are
necessary to keep the business recovery moving forward.
So, an example of an organizational decision I will defer: whether or not to appoint a Chief Operating Officer.
Obviously, important to wait and determine with a new CEO, given his or her strengths and operating philosophy. On
the other hand, the biggest example of actions we will move forward with center around costs; Kimberly and team are
intensely focused on identifying cost-reduction opportunities so that we can execute as soon possible. We are close to
completing the first phase of identifying cost opportunities focused on head count, as well as non-head count areas, and
we'll share early thoughts on this.
In terms of 2012, and how we are operating the business in the near term, our priorities are: improving top-line
performance, cost management and cash generation. After a challenging 2011 where full-year revenues were up 1% in
constant dollars, the priority is restoring revenue growth. Direct selling is a momentum business. However, sustainable
growth will take time and there are still factors of macroeconomic weakness and internal volatility over the next several
quarters.
The negative impact of commodities, foreign exchange and wage inflation will also continue to pressure results. In a
year of transition, therefore, we're not planning for margin recovery in 2012. In terms of cash generation, we continue
to focus on working capital improvement and, as you read this morning, we announced the dividend for 2012, which
maintains the current level at $0.92.
With that overall perspective, let me comment briefly on the status of our key geographies. In Brazil, results in the last
quarter remained pressured, as the combination of slowing Beauty category market growth and continued internal
service challenges impacted performance. Going into 2012, systems issues identified around the ERP implementation
are stabilized and sustainability of supply and demand planning is now the important focus of the team going forward,

along with reengaging representative morale and energy.
The revenue performance may continue to be spotty in the near term as we work to drive sustained improvement in
service and sales representative engagement, and it will take some time to regain share. However, having made the
necessary infrastructure investments and changes in 2011 to support future business expansion, our number one priority
in 2012 is to restore Brazil's growth and operating performance as we move through this year.
Last week we announced new a General Manager in Brazil, as our previous head of Brazil will be leaving after 30
years of service. Effective March 1, David Lager will assume the role. David is an Avon direct sales veteran and one of
the company's most experienced general managers with significant operating experience in Latin America. Most
recently, he has led our business in Mexico, where we have delivered our third year of sustained sales and margin
turnaround and another quarter of double-digit, strong, share-gaining growth.
In addition, Fernando Acosta, Avon's new head of Latin America, has been on board since early December. Like
Kimberly, Fernando has hit the ground running, and he has been in Brazil several times already in the last 60 days.
Together, Fernando and David will be completely focused on driving performance improvements in the following
ways: from a field perspective, their first priority for 2012 in Brazil is to ensure sustainable, stabilized service and
re-ignite representative engagement. In this high-touch direct selling model, Brazil's field leadership continues to
maintain very close personal contact with our top sellers. In the first half of 2012, this will be supplemented with
additional meetings to touch 40,000 top sellers and give them previews of our major upcoming product launches.
To capitalize on the strong market growth in the northern regions of Brazil, we are adding a sizable number of new
zones to maximize penetration. In terms of incremental category focus, we are aggressively reinforcing the fragrance
category with significant portfolio additions specifically tailored to the unique consumer preferences in this market. In
Color Cosmetics, we will build on our number-one, leading share position with a major launch of our value brand this
summer, and in Skincare we are recalibrating pricing across all tiers and plan a major launch of Genics in the spring.
At the same time, beyond these immediate steps, the new team is evaluating Avon Brazil's longer-term growth
opportunities as a key part of the company's operational review. On the consumer front, this includes an assessment of
Avon's brand equity, the evaluation of a more Brazil-centric product development approach and a segmented
go-to-market model.
From a channel standpoint, we're taking a bold look at opportunities to accelerate our service model and representative
value proposition in this highly competitive market. A reminder that Brazil, unlike Mexico, has not yet implemented
Avon's multi-level sales leadership model. David Lager's experience in Mexico will be important here as we carefully
evaluate the opportunity. And importantly, we are stress testing Avon's growth investment equation for Brazil and the
cost to compete going forward.
In Russia, fourth quarter performance was in part challenged by a volatile beauty market condition and aggressive
competitive pricing environment, which negatively impacted our representative recruiting and activity early in the
quarter. In response, we made adjustments to our customer and representative playbook and began to see improvements
in field growth as we exited the year. Though market data is not yet available for fourth quarter, year-to-date revenue
declines among top beauty players lead us to believe that macro factors have been a part of Avon Russia's 2011
slowdown.
Our 2012 priorities are to drive order growth through a comprehensive recruiting and activity drive, which will be
supported by TV and digital advertising. Having said that, as we look ahead validating Russia's longer-term
competitive position is a key focal area for the operational review. We are conducting an in-depth study of external
market and channel growth potential, a current assessment of Avon's product and brand relevance in this market,
particularly in Skincare, and an evaluation of our sales leadership compensation model, and its impact in the last few
years.
In the United States, the recalibration of our product mix and brochure merchandizing offers is working, and succeeded
in stemming the average order declines experienced in the earlier part of 2011. Average order, which was negative
through the third quarter, was up low-single-digits in Q4. Demand for the Christmas holiday offers was very strong, in

fact, stronger than we anticipated, although we did not chase sales as we eased back into these categories.
In addition, the focus on value Beauty offers was successful and, in the fourth quarter, we grew mass market beauty
share for the first time in over three years in the U.S. So, the strategies to grow average order improvement are
aggressively planned throughout 2012. There is a significantly increased number of Smart Value Beauty products
flowed across the year, and selective giftable Beauty and non-Beauty offers have been added around key
holiday-giving events, like Easter, Mother's Day and Father's Day, which were essentially absent in last year's brochure
offers.
Importantly, you are all aware that One Simple Sales Model, the Avon U.S. field transformation, is being implemented
as we speak. Throughout the fourth quarter, notifications to all district managers were completed. The western half of
the United States will complete the re-districting in March and the balance of the country by June. We have
appropriately planned for volatility, given the magnitude of the change as we reduce approximately 500 districts. That
said, Jorge Martinez-Quiroga and the team are pleased that the early days seem manageable and the execution of the
change is being handled extremely well in the field.
After we move past this period of change in the first half, all focus in reinvestment centers around driving the success
of the company's enhanced multi-level sales leadership model, with increased compensation opportunity for up-line
representatives and maximizing the re-districting for consumer segments, for instance, Hispanic and African-American
populations are much better served given the new configuration.
Having said that, beyond these 2012 initiatives and the One Simple Sales Model implementation designed to stabilize
the U.S. business, this market is obviously key in the overall corporate, operational, and financial review. A
comprehensive relook encompasses Avon's consumer and brand relevance, the health of the direct selling channel in
this market and the specific competitiveness of Avon's channel offer within that. At an even faster pace, we're
identifying the cost decisions required to return Avon U.S. to acceptable margin and cash contribution.
As a final comment on the North America segment, you read that we took a non-cash impairment charge related to the
acquisition of Silpada. The accounting charge to goodwill in intangible assets was driven by revaluing revenue and
income projections, given the unanticipated significant rise in silver prices since the acquisition, and the negative
impact on revenues and margins.
Our operational focus is to continue to improve product assortment, geographic coverage and representative activity,
and stay the course through this tough commodity environment, as this is an attractive direct-selling business that
should deliver good growth, profit margins and domestic cash flow.
Finally, in terms of the internal investigation and FD matter, our priority continues to be to try and move these matters
forward. While we're unable to predict the duration, scope or consequences, we continue to cooperate with the
government in an effort to work towards resolving these matters.
So that's a high-level perspective on 2012 and our near-term priorities before a new CEO comes on board. I continue to
believe that, despite our current challenges, Avon is a unique company with strong growth opportunities, and I look
forward to continuing to offer my full support to the CEO, the company and the board.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kimberly.
Kimberly A. Ross
Thank you, Andrea. It's a pleasure for me to join today's call for the first time as CFO of this great company. My
remarks this morning will be lengthier than normal, so I may share some of my initial impressions after 10 weeks on
the job. Since joining Avon, I've had the opportunity to meet many associates, visit our largest market, Brazil, and
began to identify our strengths, as well as some of our challenges.
Some of these challenges have been self-inflicted, and have been well-documented by our management team on
previous calls and meetings. Addressing the issues we face requires us to take a fresh appraisal of what we have that

works well, and what we need to adapt and revamp so we can achieve our full strategic and financial potential. The
challenges are such that progress will be measured in quarters, not months. However, what I've seen so far gives me the
confidence that these are fixable issues. With the right analytics, execution, and top-to-bottom organizational
engagement, I am certain we can win over time.
With that said, it may be helpful if I share some of my first thoughts with you. We need to improve operational
excellence in the following areas. First, service. We must continue to improve our service levels so that we can get all
of the right products to the representatives when promised. And this cannot be done at the expense of inventory levels.
The second is forecasting. We must improve forecasting to optimize the amount of raw materials purchased, the
amount of inventories produced and maintained and the financial results to be achieved. Also, our systems, processes
and skills have not consistently kept up with the rapid growth in our international markets. We've witnessed this in
Brazil and have already begun working to improve in this area to avoid similar issues in other fast-growing markets.
I believe all of these factors have contributed to our volatile financial and operational results. And looking forward, if
we can improve our flexibility in time-to-market, there is even a bigger opportunity for efficiency, customer
satisfaction and improved working capital. In addition to these operational areas, I see room for cost savings, and we
must improve our cash flow, which I will speak more about shortly.
These are not necessarily new issues and part of addressing them must come from how we work. I strongly believe we
must instill a stronger culture of ownership and accountability by improving clarity around roles and responsibilities.
We also need to continue to work on enhancing our processes and procedures. Additionally, I think it is important that
we make any changes in the context of who we are. It strikes me the more I learn that we cannot consider ourselves a
traditional CPG company, nor do we face the same issues as our smaller direct-selling peers. Given our scale, channel
strength and vertical integration, we must make sure that the changes we are making reflect our unique nature.
For example, and different than a traditional retailer or CPG company, we reset our store every two to three weeks,
which requires us to have flexibility in manufacturing and inventory flow that many of our global beauty peers don't
have. On balance, I feel that the company's brand, geography, channel and category gives us built-in strategic
advantages. We are in the right markets for growth. We have enthusiastic, knowledgeable, dedicated associates and the
energy and commitment of the representatives is second to none. I have been inspired by what I have seen and heard
when visiting our operations and talking to our representatives and our customers.
Our focus now is on how to best capitalize on these strengths to produce results that reward our shareholders on a
consistent and sustainable basis. So, what are we doing? Andrea already gave you an update on our business review
and indicated that we are deferring our update on this process until both I and a new CEO have had time to study the
business and develop our thoughts. That said, let me be clear, we're not standing still. I am helping to drive the business
review and I've seen obvious operational and cost-cutting opportunities that we can realize in the short and medium
term.
We are taking actions to get at these costs, decrease decision-making churn and instill a culture where every penny
counts. We are confident that these are the right actions, irrespective of strategic decisions made in the future. In
addition to immediate actions on cost, we are both continuing with the diagnostic process while identifying the core
competencies that will lead Avon over time.
We are focusing on three key areas of revenue, cost structure and cash generation. Andrea talked a bit about what we're
evaluating in terms of revenue in our major markets. I would like to take the next few minutes to share some thoughts
on two remaining key areas that are of utmost priority, cost and cash.
Costs have increased in the organization, and we continue to face wage and commodity inflation, as well as foreign
exchange pressures. Thus, we must decrease costs to remain competitive. We have teams examining each functional
area. We are currently focused on cost-saving areas we refer to as tactical, which is to say savings that can be
accomplished in the near term and are not dependent on the long-term strategy of the company.

The two areas of opportunities I see so far are in the areas of head count and indirect spend. First, head count. As the
business has continued to evolve, we have opportunities to streamline processes and eliminate duplication that will
allow us to do the work with fewer people and enhanced accountability and speed. While these reductions are not
expected to be of the size and magnitude of those seen in the past, I see some immediate and medium-term
opportunities to reduce head count and corporate cost.
We will start acting quickly on the immediate opportunities and as part of our review process we will validate and
quantify the amount of any medium-term opportunities. There could be charges associated with any reductions as early
as the first quarter, and we will give you more clarity as we go.
Second, indirect spend. Examples include: professional fees, print and paper and corporate offices. I would note that
while each of these examples may be small individually, in aggregate these savings can be significant. The larger point
is that we will leave no stone unturned in the process to get costs down.
Turning now to our cash; cash generation is a top priority and a major focus for me. First, we are actively addressing
how we can improve cash flow. Reducing costs, improving operational performance and overall improvements in areas
of working capital will lead to enhanced cash flow. In order to improve working capital, we need to address underlying
operational issues and return to growth. These require operational changes that are being identified as part of the bigger
diagnostic process.
Tying back to my earlier comments, as an example, improving our forecasting abilities will increase efficiency in raw
material purchases, and faster time-to-market will reduce our finished good balances. In addition, Fashion & Home is
an area for significant improvement in inventory management. As these are not necessarily quick fixes, improvement
will take time, but I do think we have an opportunity here.
Now, moving on to our dividend, which has been a topic of much discussion. We understand the great value
shareholders place on the dividend and recognize that its sustainability and consistency lies in paying the dividend with
the P&L, not the balance sheet. After careful consideration, we are maintaining our dividend at $0.92 per share for
2012, which is approximately $400 million.
Let me give you some additional color on our decision. In 2011, we generated about $650 million of cash flow from
operations, which included approximately $100 million of cash outs in 2011 that will not take place in 2012, primarily
higher contributions to the pension fund and payment of long-term incentive plan and bonuses. Even if you were to
assume no growth in our adjusted net income in 2012 and CapEx, which should be flat, we would generate sufficient
cash to pay the dividend.
We have also made the decision not to indefinitely reinvest current 2012 foreign earnings. This will give us access to
cash flow generated from our business overseas. As a result, we expect our 2012 effective tax rate to be in the range of
approximately 35% to 36%, excluding any discreet items. I would note that the incremental taxes will be non-cash, as
we will be utilizing some of our foreign tax credits. So, that is how we're thinking about 2012. We will continue to
review the dividend strategy for 2013 and beyond, in conjunction with the long-range business review and a new CEO.
Now I'd like to briefly discuss our perspective for 2012. 2012 is a transition year, and we're not providing a specific
outlook. But I want to share some color on the year. As Andrea said, our priorities include improving top-line
performance, cost management and cash generation. In terms of margins, we don't expect recovery this year. The
macroeconomic environment remains volatile and, as with many other global consumer companies, we expect
continued headwinds from commodities, foreign exchange and wage inflation over the year.
Additionally, you should know that our margins early in the year will be impacted by investments in key markets. In
Brazil, we are spending to reengage our representatives in an effort to improve satisfaction, and we are restoring our
advertising spend in this market as well. In the U.S., we continue to invest as we implement our One Simple Sales
Model strategy.
While I know there is a broad desire for additional information, including quantification of our business opportunities
and targets, and how we will execute against them, from my past experience, I have learned not to make any

commitment until I am fully confident that we can deliver on our promises. In summary, we have a lot of work to do,
and we are moving forward with urgency.
From what I have seen so far, I am certain that Avon's unique competitive position will continue to create an advantage
global platform on which this strong brand can succeed. I have been most impressed by the commitment and desire of
the entire organization to improve our prospects and I look forward to working with our team to do so. I also look
forward to developing a dialogue with all of you as we take the appropriate steps to restore Avon to sustainable,
profitable growth.
With that said, let me hand it over for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Please note, you will be limited to one question and a related follow-up question until all callers in the queue have
posted their question. Please note once again, once you have asked your-related follow-up question your line will be
muted once again. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.
Your first question comes from Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Hi, it's Bank of America. Hey, Andrea, I guess the fact that you are staying on as
chairman even after you hire a new CEO, I guess it's raised some concern out in the marketplace that the new CEO
would have or would or wouldn't have the autonomy that a typical new CEO would have coming into a business,
especially when you're in a turnaround situation like you are.
I was just wondering if you can just give a little bit of color into the decision process in staying on as chairman and then
also give us a little comfort that a new person will have the latitude to do what they want and to break some glass, so to
speak, make some changes that were put into place by the previous management team. Thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, thanks, Chris. Just to be very clear, the new CEO will have absolute autonomy to find his
or her strategic and operational priorities for the company, to set the targets and to break the glass that needs to be
broken in the company. I think this is an opportunity, with my commitment to support the new CEO, the board and the
company, to provide continuity and with bold change at the same time, and to make sure that the transition with any
understanding of direct sales in the Avon business is there, but he or she will absolutely have full autonomy to run the
business.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: And just as a follow-up, I mean, is there any – has there been an issue in recruitment that
you guys are already undertaking basically a strategic review of the business before you even have the new person in
their seat? In other words, I mean, I guess, is there any concern internally that you'd look at this as potential new
candidate as more of the same going forward, and they're kind of married to the conclusions that you guys draw over
the next couple of months, depending on how long this CEO search drags out?
<A - Andrea Jung>: I think hopefully you heard from Kimberly and myself that we've been very, very thoughtful in
making sure that any decisions that we feel, were we to be in a new CEO's chair, could be reversed or have strategic
implication, that those would be things, I think, that the both of us said that we should table. But the more tactical and
obvious ones that are important, especially right now, just to commit to continue the business recovery are the ones that
we'll lean forward on.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: All right. Thanks.

<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi, Morgan Stanley. So, Andrea, the active rep change in the quarter was the worst we've
seen in more than a decade. Can you just give us a sense of if you think the supply chain issues in Brazil are causing a
lingering morale impact for reps in Brazil, and if you're seeing any signs of improvement there so far this year?
And then also just give us some of the issues at the corporate level, do you think rep morale is also suffering on a
global basis here?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, just – on that, well, let me to start, I think the deceleration in the active rep growth was
primarily from Brazil and Russia for different reasons and, yes, certainly activity was pressured in Brazil. The number
of representatives is still very high, but activity was pressured due to the service challenges, and the continued service
challenges.
The systems challenges that were created by ERP are stabilized as we exited the year and so, as I said, all focus now is
just on sustaining service recovery and engaging our representatives. In Russia, I think a lot of it was about tough
macros pressuring also representative activity.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay, and outside of those regions, rep morale is a big concern?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Outside of the regions, I mean – well, rep morale, I think, continues to be very lengthened and
high where, again, service is good, where especially if you just take a look at some of the changes that we're making in
the United States, I mean, we're seeing growth in President's Club or Top Sellers in this cycle. And so there are some
positive signs, as it relates to some of the initiatives that we're taking.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay, and then just for clarity, the plan to maintain the dividend, is that a firm decision at
the board level, or is that clearly subject to review under a new CEO and after the strategic review is complete? And it
sounds like it is a firm decision, at least for 2012. Is that correct?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yes. It was reviewed with the board, and the board has approved the decision.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And does the new CEO have input in that, or could that change after the strategic
review, or you think it's a firm decision for 2012?
<A - Andrea Jung>: I think the discussion we'll have after the strategic review as well the new CEO is what should be
the dividend for 2013 and going forward, because dividend discussion is clearly part of a bigger picture that needs to be
taken into account with the strategy review and input of a new CEO.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Bill Gerald Schmitz>: It's Deutsche Bank. Hey, guys, can we just drill down a little bit more on the cash flow?
Because if you kind of looked at the free cash flow per share, it's about $0.87, and I guess the sort of pro forma GAAP
earnings are about $1.64-ish. So, is there any way to kind of reconcile the difference? I know you said, call it $75
million of pension contributions and then maybe another $35 million of LTIP. But will there be a point in time where
the GAAP earnings and the free cash flow per share will start to be pretty close to each other?
<A - Andrea Jung>: I think one thing you need to take into account were the non-cash items both from last year that
Venezuela, or should I say 2010, Venezuela, as well as we had the Silpada item that took place in 2011. I'm not going
to get into, will it be equal in the future or not going forward. Cash flow is clearly going to be something that we're
going to be focusing on in 2012 to get some improvement there.
<Q - Bill Gerald Schmitz>: Okay. I mean, but is there nothing you can provide in terms of specifics, and why that
delta is so wide? And then also, in your sort of due diligence in the company, I mean, can you totally take restatement

off the table in terms of historical financials?
<A - Andrea Jung>: A couple of things. One, you know, if you want to dive into real detailed cash flow analysis,
happy to take that offline with Amy. What I will say to your second question is, like any public company, Avon is
required to maintain a system and internal controls for financial reporting, as well as for control of its assets. As part of
the year-end close, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls and found them to be effective. And like any
public company, we continue to enhance our processes and procedures around this area.
<Q - Bill Gerald Schmitz>: Okay. And then just lastly, what was the cash restructuring piece in the year?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Don't have that at hand, the exact cash restructuring piece. We'll get back to you with that.
<Q - Bill Gerald Schmitz>: Okay, great. And then just a final, final, final is where on the cash flow statement does the

At this time, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your next question comes from Lauren
Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks, good morning. It's Barclays Capital. There were a number of your – the major
markets that you guys usually comment on the performance of that were absent from the appendix today. So, can you
just briefly let us know, U.K. then – as well as Turkey? I mean, things that have really moved the needle in the past, at
least let us know better or worse sequentially in the fourth quarter?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, what we've done is we're focusing on our four key markets in the release now, as well as
touching on any significant items that have occurred during the quarters. In the 10-K, you'll be able to see all the detail
around the other markets and, so, going forward, this is how we'll structure it. But, again, if there are any specific items
in the quarter, then we'll call those out.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Okay. Well, I guess the follow-up was going to be in and still is that – just so I know,
we're not – trying not to focus too much on the fourth quarter, but it feels like there may have been a lot of spending put
back in the business with the goal of stabilizing the top line with not that much return. And I know absolutely, it's a
momentum business and these things take time. But it would feel like there was a deceleration in major markets that
were not just Russia, and that's where I was looking for some commentary on. Thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Let me just – a significant acceleration from 3Q to 4Q in Venezuela, U.K., and, to the lesser
degree, Turkey. Some deceleration, I think, Europe was in general, weak, Lauren, as it related to a combination of
tough macros in the U.K, the Fashion & Home categories. But, yes, when you look at the RVP investment in the fourth
quarter, it was primarily U.S. for the One Simple Sales Model, and Brazil in terms of service recovery, et cetera. And
those things will have a lag effect, those two.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Okay. And also – Andrea, thank you for that. You guys had mentioned that you're
planning for some bumpiness as One Simple Sales Model kind of goes in in March and June. I mean, just how much
disruption are you expecting at this point? We talked about it, it was last quarter or the quarter before, when I
referenced the redistricting that happened in Mexico several years ago, that that was quite disruptive. This is much,
much bigger. So, would that suggest that it's going to make it awfully tough to truly stabilize revenue trends in North
America in 2012 with that much to change coming to the field?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, obviously, we're assuming that there will be some volatility. This is different. It is not
exactly the same as Mexico. One of the things that, obviously, we're encouraged by is the average order improvement

over the quarter, and over the campaigns. I mean, I think I mentioned that the Beauty sales in the fourth quarter look
like they gained share in mass Beauty in the U.S. for the first time in over three years. And volumes were actually up in
the United States from down in the third quarter. So, some of the merchandizing and product changes have definitely
made a significant, significant increase in average order change momentum.
Obviously, a lot of these things are planned through the first half and hopefully we'll contra some of the volatility that
we see, and we'll know more about it as we go through it. I think it's happening as we speak, but I do think that the field
leadership and our leader there, Jorge Martinez-Quiroga, are planning for volatility, but their goal obviously is to make
it as least disruptive as possible with a lot of these new plans that can keep representatives engaged and help increase
their average order basket through the change.

Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, from Citigroup. My first question has to do with China specifically, and whether you
think you're on track. I think by 2012 you were supposed to be growing and turning a profit, if I remember correctly.
So, are you on track with that? And then the follow-up to that is, just broadly speaking, you're halfway through the first
quarter, do you think the first quarter will see organic sales up or down? Thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Hi. Wendy, we're not going to talk about the first quarter, but let me just say that, as you
remember, we said we would start to stem some of the sales decline and reach breakeven profit, that was the goal in
2011, and in fact, we made a small profit in the year.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: But you're giving us guidance that you're reinvesting heavily, and so margins are going to
be down on the first quarter, but you can't give us a sense for the timing of the payback on that in spending?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Are you talking about China?
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Well, no – yeah, China, specifically, but then for the overall organization. So, thank you
for the China comment. Now, my question is globally, overall Avon. If you're spending a lot of money in the first
quarter, is that going to lead to an acceleration in the sales growth?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Some of these things, to time them in terms of when there's a lag or a concurrent sales growth, I
mean, a lot of the investments in One Simple Sales Model, which we saw in fourth quarter continue until we're fully
transitioned, that would be the U.S., and we continue to spend in Brazil.
I think we've talked about the fact that we're restoring advertising to a higher level in the first half of the year in
combination with the product pipeline, as well as the reengagement effort here with representatives – and how long
exactly that takes – but it is the right strategy as we stabilized their business market.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: All right, thank you.

Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Stifel, Nicolaus. I guess, Kim, a question on your thoughts on the cost savings and your
early thoughts on being in the job for 11 weeks now. So, $1.1 billion in restructuring savings or cost savings all-in since
2005. I guess, given what you've seen so far is, A, is this an accurate reflection of the costs that have been reduced by
the company?

And then second, we've obviously heard about cost-cutting before. No offense, but it sort of seems like cutting head
count sounds oversimplified. Like, why hasn't this been done before? I guess I don't understand what's different this
time around, and what you've seen here that maybe Chuck or some of the other executives who had looked at this in the
mid-2000s are seeing differently?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: You know, clearly, the company has been taking initiatives to get cost out of the system. I
think a fresh perspective is always helpful when looking at costs. I also think that cost is one of those things that you
don't look at as a one-off, but it's something that needs to be look at on an ongoing basis, especially as the business
continues to change.
So with that said, again, we've made changes over the years. I think we need to continue to look at additional changes
we need to make, specifically in the way we work, and in some of our processes. Specifically, if I look at finance, I see
opportunities to be able to take it to the next level, and be able to make things more efficient and effective in that area,
and I see the same in other areas.
So, I think this is something that needs to take place. Again, we're looking at both costs that we can get at in the short
term that are both people, as well as non-people costs in this, and then we'll also take a look more at the medium-term
which, again, may involve doing significant changes to processes or how we organize some departments, and those are
something that will take a bit more time to implement.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: So, on the first part, is the $1.1 billion in savings out of the business since 2005, is that
accurate, and where has that money gone?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: My focus is going forward. I obviously wasn't here in the past, so my focus is on what are
we going to do going forward.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey guys, I'm from Bernstein. So, even with all the discussion out there about things you're going to
do and kind of the buzz words, I can't help but to have the feeling that it's kind of a rudderless ship right now, whether
it be results this quarter, whether it be obviously bribery from before, whether it be Venezuela, whether it be this
Silpada thing, which we were told we were going to love. It just doesn't seem like the business is being run cohesively
over the past years. And to be clear, look, I think it's unfair to blame or frankly, have hope in just one or two people.
So let me ask my question this way, we often receive letters, anonymous or not, from current or former employees at
companies suggesting things for us. And to be fair, we have difficulty verifying the veracity of these letters. But one we
recently got about Avon kind of struck us, and the letter essentially posed the question as to why there's so limited
internal succession planning, with the possible, obviously, exception it sounds like, of David in Brazil.
In other words, and this may not be perfect, you had two CFOs in the past six years, both from the outside. And with all
due respect to Kimberly, your LatAm CBU just came from the outside, and that's the second in two years. A new
marketing head is somebody you're looking for and, again, that's – from externally you've had five in the past six years,
I think all from the outside. CIO, General Counsel, HR, IR, all from the outside recently. Of course, now you're looking
for a CEO from the outside when you recruit somebody. So, the question I guess in short is, why? Why is that the case?
What's the problem here and particularly in the context of this rudderless ship analogy? Thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Ali, I think if you look at the combination of all of the executives running both the operations, as
well as the functions, most of the commercial business unit leaders and general managers who are running the business
from the ground are extremely long tenured and long years of service in not only direct sales but, specifically, Avon.
So, four out our five commercial business unit leaders have over 25 years experience on average each in the company.
So, in terms of running the operations, I think we've got a very healthy balance.

<Q - Ali Dibadj>: In that context, is – to follow on a previous question, is the restructuring, a head count reduction in
particular, the right thing to do. I mean, you've been in restructuring for all, but three of the past thirteen years. At some
point, these charges may just be the way you have to run your business and not be one-time in nature.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, as I said before, I think cost is something that one needs to be continuously looking at. As
businesses change, you need to be changing your processes and your procedures and your structures around that, and so
I think it is important that we continue to look at this.
Again, I don't envision the charges that we would have to be anywhere near the size of magnitude of what you've seen
in the past in Avon. But I don't think it would be prudent for us not to change our structure just because there's
potentially a cost associated with it. As long as we're getting a good payback from the cost, and whether that – and
that's not always necessarily measured directly in this is how many dollars we saved, but also in efficiencies, it's
measured in effectiveness, roles and responsibilities being clear so then we can get our jobs done in a clearer manner,
those are all benefits that you get from making changes in the organization.
So – and again, this isn't just about head count. I think there are also quite a few areas in indirect spend that don't have
charges associated with it that we need to take a look at. And just so you know, I'm also very focused on some that
might potentially have an accounting charge associated with it, but it might be cash flow positive if we do it going
forward. So, I think there are a lot of dimensions to this and I think it would be inappropriate for us not to be looking at
potential cost savings just because they might have a cost associated with them.

Your next question comes from Alice Longley. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: Buckingham Research. I have one quick question and then another. You said we should
not assume that margins will be up this year. Should we assume that margins might be down?
And then my other question is about the increase in support, and RVP in particular. It seems as though over the last few
years one of the pressures that has been constant is RVP going up as a percentage of sales. And it sounds like you have
to – with RVP and other support in SG&A, you have to give the reps more and more in terms of compensation and
other support in order to drive sales and yet it doesn't seem to be enough to drive sales. Should we expect the RVP and
other rep support to go up more than sales yet again this year? And is there any sense of when enough is going to be
enough?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, this is Kimberly. Let me first take the margin question. Look, with regards to 2012,
really, the only thing we're going to say is that we're not planning for margin improvement at this time. And I'll turn the
one over to Andrea.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, in terms of RVP for 2012, it is growing modestly, not ahead of sales. And on a longer
term, that evaluation of the levers of RVP that we've been spending, and we look at their effectiveness, et cetera, as
implied back into the model are part of the long-range operational and financial review. And that's a big piece of the
work that we're looking at.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: And is it fair to think that you're shifting your product line to more value-oriented goods?
Just listening to some of your plans, it sounds as though you're shifting down the mix in some important markets?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Some of the important markets where we still can see consumer pressure, yeah, we are looking at
the price tier of value and having greater flow in 2012.

Your next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Hi, Caris & Company. Kimberly, you kind of referred to an assumption of CapEx being
flat in 2012. Is that an actual projection or I just – a lot of your comments indicated there needs to be improved
forecasting and capabilities in certain areas. To me, that's says higher investment to achieve that. And looking out
beyond 2012, do you have a sense for whether long-term there's really a lot of investment required? Because Chuck
Cramb used to say that, that he believed there was underinvestment in the company in the past.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, a couple of things. First of all, with regards to forecasting, some of it I think is process
improvement, not necessarily going to need a huge system implementation or something like that to get at it. So, I think
with process improvement, we can get a part of it. Some of it is changing things we do.
For example, I truly believe that if we can get to market quicker, that even that would be able to impact our ability to
forecast better. So, these are some of the things that we'll be looking at. Again, I've been here 10 weeks so I have early
sights on that, some people may prove me wrong with some of that.
Just with regards to the longer term, this is something that we really need to have a discussion with the new CEO
coming into play because we will have to set our priorities as to where that we want to invest for growth, as well as
other investments, for example, systems.
With that said, if I look at 2012, I've gone through the plans of CapEx for spending in 2012. I've seen the amounts that
are expected to be spent on systems, as well as on distribution. And a lot of that stuff is stuff we're moving forward
with. I think for 2012, we have a pretty good line of sight of what we'll be spending, and it is about the same as what
we spent in 2011.

<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning, BMO Capital. Could you talk about the qualities that you are looking
for in a new CEO, qualities or experience? That would be great, thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Just a few comments on the CEO search, I mean, it is proceeding well. The search committee
consists of an independent group of our board and, obviously, this is a big priority, and they're proceeding with the
sense of urgency, but they want to take the time to get the best and the right candidate for the position, because this is
the world's large direct-selling company and one of the world's leading beauty companies, so we're looking for the best
out there.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: But nothing about the kind of qualities that would affect the way the way the company
has run, because it's almost as though you're looking for a certain sort of leadership that can take Avon to the next level,
and what would that look like?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, I think I don't want to get into the search specifics on the cal. I'll just say what I said before
that I think that, again, the independent committee is proceeding, and we're making sure that we get the best person to
take this company to the next level and return this business to the kind of same profitable growth that it should be
delivering, and it will. Thanks.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: If I could ask a follow-up on Venezuela, because there is in the paper over the last
couple of days we've seen some imposed price declines of 25% to 50%. I'm wondering if you have a sense of which is
your categories is affected, and if you have the price caps that will affect your categories yet, and what the impact
would be?

<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, this is Kimberly. I'll give you a little bit of color just on Venezuela in general. I think
Venezuela continues to have many social, economic and infrastructure problems that remain unresolved. A couple of
different areas that have impacted us, one is the fact that it's been very difficult to obtain dollars for our imports. And so
what we've done now is change more to local sourcing in an effort to try to reduce the exposure that we had there of
having to continually put more dollar liabilities into that business. With that said, we still have some significant risk
there if there is a large devaluation.
The other is, yes, there have been some restrictions with regards to some of the categories, to the pricing of some of the
categories. It's really not impacting us as much. It's about less than 10% of what we have. Shampoo, conditioner and
deodorant are kind of the main categories that are being impacted by us from a pricing perspective restriction.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay, great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Javier Escalante, Consumer Edge Research. Good morning. I have a question and a
follow-up, if you can help us dimension how much reinvestment power or flexibility the new CEO will inherit, if you
will. Over the past five, six years you have extracted $1.1 billion in savings. My understanding is about $800 million of
them has been reinvested. And basically, I would like to know to what extent these moneys can be redeployed or spent
differently without disruption. My main concern has to do with this RVP spending, whether it has become part of the
rep's compensation, and therefore cannot be cut back without aggravating the reps going forward. And then I have a
follow-up.
<A - Andrea Jung>: This is a big part of the operational and financial review, Javier, especially, as it relates to looking
at the RVP, which would be the riskier places to switch it or move it, which would be the places that perhaps aren't
getting us the right payback and, therefore, a new CEO would be able to look at how to redeploy to reinvest there. But,
again, without making any decisions, all of the deep analytics are being worked on, particularly in our top markets to
start, and then broader. And I think this will inform a new CEO with the information and the analysis to make those
kinds of trade-off decision.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: And the other question related to the RVP again, right, you only have disclosed incremental I
think that is around $400 million, roughly. But there is a greater amount that's stuck in the P&L. And I have been
unable to get an answer of how much of those monies could be redeployed. So, basically, it will be very important for
investors to know what is the reinvestment power that whomever takes the helm at Avon will have.
I mean, because, I mean, what you're basically saying is is that it's part of the assessment. But we would like to know,
is that already compensation? And realistically, can you take that compensation away without the business tanking
even further.
I mean, if you even in this situation, you are increasing RVP spending, it seems to me that you are doing this because
you want to contain the leak of the reps. So, therefore, if you can help us understand the selling and spending, how
much, not only the incremental RVP that you've been disclosing for the last four years, but how much in there is viable
enough as to for us to know whether the new CEO has any reinvestment flexibility? Because otherwise you are
basically spending this money, and we don't know whether the new CEO will be able to fix anything. Thank you.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, go ahead. You have another question? One last question, operator, or no?

exchange has wreaked havoc in Avon's P&L through transaction over the last few years. And I think the volatility, at
least, just given all the political issues out there is probably going to persist. Just curious what you think in your early
days on if there's any solution to reduce the sensitivity to all the volatility in FX? Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, I think that's a good question. Reducing volatility is something that I'm focused on. I
think a couple of things, being an ex-Treasurer obviously exploring, hedging the transaction exposure is something that
we're taking a look at. The company has been doing a lot of effort with regards to changing the sourcing or also locking
in rates in the contracts for sourcing, so we're looking at that again.
We haven't made any final decisions, but it is definitely something that's on the radar screen, how can we try to get
some of the volatility out of the business. I'm not a big fan of hedging translation, so the part that I'm really looking at
is the transactional side.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. I'll now turn the conference back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
Andrea Jung
Okay, thanks, everybody. We appreciate your time this morning. Hopefully, you have a clear understanding of how at
least we're approaching 2012 in terms of operating the business with the priorities of improving the top line
performance. You heard Kimberly talked about her thinking at this point on cost management opportunities and,
obviously, the huge priority the company has on cash generation.
So, despite the current challenges you've heard her say and, again, the whole organization in this interim transition
period is completely focused on getting this business back on track. It is a unique company, it's got a lot of strong
growth opportunities and, as I've said, I look forward to continue to offer any kind of support and my full support to the
company and the new CEO.
So, thanks, everybody. Have a good morning.
