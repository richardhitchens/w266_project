Thank you, Nancy.
We're pleased to report the results of our third fiscal quarter. We established new all-time quarterly record for iPad unit
sales and new June quarter records for iPhone and Mac unit sales, leading to our highest June quarter revenue and
earnings ever. Revenue for the quarter was $35 billion representing year-over-year growth of 23%. The $6.5 billion
increase over the prior June quarter's results was driven primarily by strong growth in iPad and iPhone sales. Operating
margin was $11.6 billion representing 33% of revenue. Net income was $8.8 million increasing 21% over the prior
June quarter's results. The quarter's net income translated to diluted earnings per share of $9.32.
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We sold 4 million Macs,
establishing a new June quarter record. This represents 2% growth year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published
estimate of a 1% contraction of the global personal computer market in the June quarter. Last month we updated the
entire MacBook line with faster processors, graphics, memory, flash storage and USB3 connectivity. We also
introduced the all-new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, all flash architecture and quad-core processors and
customer response has been excellent.
While we're seeing tremendous momentum for the iPad in education, which I'll discuss later, we also experienced our
best quarter ever for U.S. education institution Mac sales with portables representing nearly three-quarters of total Mac
sales. Notable large education transaction closed during the June quarter include Rutherford County, North Carolina,
which has purchased 6,000 MacBook Airs to support its twenty-first century digital learning environment and Pueblo,
Colorado School District 70, where all high school students and K-12 staff in the 22 school district will convert to
MacBook Air. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory, which is
below our target range of four to five weeks.
Tomorrow we will release Mountain Lion, the ninth major release of OS X. Mountain Lion introduces more than 200
features, including all new Messages App, Notification Center, system wide sharing and Facebook integration. We've
built iCloud into the foundation of Mountain Lion, making it easier than ever for customers to keep content up to date
across all their devices.
Moving to our music products, we sold 6.8 million iPods compared to 7.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Total iPod
sales were ahead of our expectations, and iPod Touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share
of the U.S. market for MP3 markets remained at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD, and
iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK.
We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.
The iTunes Store generated very strong results in the quarter, with revenue of over $1.8 billion, thanks to continued
strong sales of music, apps and other content. We were pleased to launch the iTunes Store in 12 countries, including
Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan last month. Customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and
download from iTunes. We are continuing to see great interest in iTunes U. Since rolling it out in January, there have
been over 14 million downloads of the iTunes U app, over 700 new k-12 schools and districts and over 125 colleges
and universities have enrolled in the iTunes U program, while over 750 new courses have been published.
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We sold 26 million iPhones compared to 20.3 million in the previous June quarter. That
represents 28% year-over-year growth and was ahead of the amount we factored into our guidance following very
strong sales and channel inventory build we achieved in the March quarter. We added several small regional carriers
during the quarter and now have iPhone distribution through over 250 carriers in over 100 countries. We ended the
quarter with about 8.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential decline of about 300,000 iPhones, and we
remain within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from iPhone
handset and accessory sales was $16.2 billion during the quarter compared to $13.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, an
increase of 22%.

Enterprises across the globe continue to choose iPhone as the standard device for their employees. We estimate that the
number of iPhones in the Fortune 500 has more than doubled in the past year. iPhone is helping businesses and
employees be more production wherever they are. PepsiCo has deployed thousands of iPhones with an in-house app
built specifically for their field merchandisers. This app has eliminated paper reports and provides real-time
information to managers, sales teams and delivery drivers. And German insurance provider, ERGO, has built an
in-house app for iPhone that thousands of agents use to process insurance claims, which has significantly reduced
paperwork and improved processing time and customer satisfaction.
Turning to iPad, we were thrilled with sales of over 17 million iPads during the June quarter compared to 9.2 million in
the year-ago quarter, an increase of 84%. We saw very strong year-over-year growth in iPad sales around the world and
are pleased to be selling iPad in 97 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPads and iPad accessories during the
quarter was $9.2 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 52%. We ended the quarter
with about 3.2 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.2 million units, which left us just
within our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory.
The iPad continues to be a great success in the U.S. education market, with sales setting a new quarterly record and
nearly doubling year-over-year to just under 1 million iPads. While interest in the new iPad was high, sales of the
reduced price iPad 2 in the k-12 market were particularly strong. And even though, as I mentioned earlier, we achieved
all-time record Mac sales to U.S. education institutions during the quarter, we sold more than twice as many iPads as
Macs to U.S. education institutions. We are extremely pleased with these results.
One great example of iPad's adoption in education is the Mansfield Texas Independent School District which has
purchased 11,000 iPads. This fall, every Mansfield High School student and teacher will receive an iPad under the
district's Power Up initiative. Some teachers will use a flipped classroom concept, putting their lessons and resources
online, where students can access them anytime with their iPads. As a result, students take responsibility for their own
learning, and teachers are able to increase their interaction and personalized content time.
IPad continues its rapid adoption within the enterprise. We estimate that the number of iPads in the Fortune 500 has
more than tripled in the past year. iPad has become an indispensable tool worldwide to help employees across
industries do their jobs more effectively. British Airways has incorporated thousands of iPads across their business
from customer support and check-in to cabin service directors, replacing paper printouts with detailed customer
preferences and provide real-time updates.
And homebuilder, Daiwa House, in Japan is actively building smart homes that will be controlled by iPads, and their
sales reps are using iPads to show floor plans and upgrade options.
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, we surpassed 410 million cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 45
million in the June quarter. With App Stores in 155 countries, the iOS ecosystem continues to grow. The App Store
now offers more than 650,000 apps including over 225,000 apps specifically for iPad. We are extremely pleased to
report that we have surpassed $5.5 billion in payments to developers and customers are loving iCloud. Since its launch
in October, more than 150 million people are using iCloud services.
In June, we previewed many exciting new features of iOS 6 at our Developers Conference, including our fabulous new
Maps app, new functionality and broader language support for Siri, direct Facebook integration, shared photo streams
via iCloud and passbook, the simplest way to get all your passwords in one place. We believe iOS 6 will significantly
enhance the experience of owning an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch and we can't wait to get it into the hands of customers
this fall.
I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue was $4.1 billion, an increase of 17% over the year ago
quarter with growth fueled primarily by all-time record iPad sales and strong growth in iPhone sales. The stores sold
791,000 Macs, compared to 768,000 in the year ago quarter, and almost half the Macs sold in our stores during the
quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened a total of nine new stores in the quarter and
exited the quarter with 372 stores, including 123 stores outside the United States.

With an average of 367 stores open, average revenue per store was $11.1 million, compared to $10.8 million in the year
ago quarter. Segment margin was $868 million compared to $802 million in the year ago quarter.
We welcomed 83 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, compared to 74 million visitors in the year ago
quarter, an increase of 12%. That translates to an average of 17,000 visitors per store per week.
Total company gross margin was 42.8%, which was 130 basis points higher than our guidance. We experienced upside
from better-than-expected commodity, warranty and other costs. These factors were partially offset by a stronger mix
of iPad sales, a higher mix of lower priced iPhones, and a stronger U.S. dollar, relative to our expectations.
Operating expenses were $3.4 billion and included $378 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was
$288 million and the tax rate was 25.6%. Turning to cash, our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities
totaled $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, compared to $110 billion at the end of the March quarter, a
sequential increase of $7 billion and about $81 billion in cash was offshore at the end of the June quarter.
Cash flow from operations was $10.2 billion. Today, we are now seeing that our Board of Directors has declared a
dividend of $2.65 per common share payable on August 16, 2012, to stockholders of record after the close of business
on August 13, 2012. Going forward, subject to declaration by our board, we expect to announce record and payment
dates for future dividends concurrently with our quarterly earnings announcements. Also, as we previously announced,
our board has authorized a three-year $10 billion share repurchase program starting in our fiscal 2013, which begins on
September 30, 2012.
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of
forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34
billion compared to $28.3 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38.5%
reflecting approximately $70 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.5
billion including about $390 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $175 million
and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $7.65.
In closing, we are pleased with our record June quarter results including sales of over 17 million iPads. We established
new June quarter records for unit sales of iPhone and Macs and posted our best quarter ever for U.S. education. We
remain extremely confident in our strategy and the investments we are making in our business. We are very excited to
be launching Mountain Lion tomorrow and iOS 6 in the fall, and we have some more amazing new products in our
pipeline that we look forward to discussing with you later.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton
We'd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. May we have the first question please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Yes. Thank you. Peter, I want to better understand the gross margin guidance for September
given that it's been nearly two years since you've operated at a sub-40% gross margin. I understand mix may go against
you a little bit in the near term, but it should be structurally higher than two years ago. You have NAND pricing
moving in your favor and the products that you're selling in the market are relatively mature, so manufacturing costs
should be favorable. Can you just talk about the dynamics that are pushing gross margins down again in September?
And then I have a follow up.

<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Okay. We expect our gross margin, as I said, to be about 38%, which is down about 430
basis points sequentially. We expect most of this decline to be primarily driven by a fall transition and to a much lesser
extent, the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, the warranty benefit that we saw in the June quarter not repeating and a
full quarter of the back-to-school promotion. So that's what we see doing it, Katy.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. And then as a follow up, Tim, you've obviously seen spectacular growth in China over
the last several years, but there are some macro concerns in the market and your Asia-Pacific growth rate did decelerate
from over 100% to I think 25% this quarter. So can you talk about what you're seeing in China as it relates to overall
demand? Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes, Katy. Hi. It's Tim. The growth in Asia-Pacific was 25% as you indicated and the vast
majority of the difference in our sequential growth rate was a result of greater China, which represents about twothirds
of our revenue of that region. As we reported for Q2, our greater China revenue was $7.9 billion and in Q3 our
revenue was $5.7 billion. Now the $5.7 billion is a 48% year-over-year increase, and so it still is growing at incredible
rates.
Virtually all of the $2.2 billion sequential revenue decline was due to iPhone sales in greater China, and about half of
that $2.2 billion is attributable to changes in the channel inventory, not the underlying sell through of the iPhone.
As a reminder, in the previous quarter in our fiscal Q2, we launched the iPhone 4S in China in January. We added
China Telecom as a second carrier in March, and as we proceeded across the quarter we increased the channel
inventory to accommodate the sales and to reach our target inventory of four to six weeks.
The remainder of the sequential revenue decline is mainly attributable to normal seasonality after the very successful
iPhone 4S launch. We did not see an obvious impact in Q3 that we would associate with the economy in Mainland
China. We look at the economic reports, as all of you do, and see the press, but again, we did not see something that we
would attribute to the economy in China.
In terms of iPhone in general in Mainland China, we were incredibly pleased with our results. We were up over 100%
year-over-year and as you probably know, just last Friday, so in Q4, we launched our new iPad in China after we
resolved the iPad trademark issue and so our sales did not benefit from the new iPad in the June quarter in Mainland
China.
Also, our new portables that we announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference began to ship in Mainland China
last week, after we received a routine regulatory approval. And once again, the June quarter sales did not benefit from
these products.
So, we remain really confident about our plans and are very excited about our opportunity in China, and are very much
looking forward to incorporating more local services, as you probably saw in the Worldwide Developers Conference
announcement of iOS 6, which will be coming in the fall.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Bill Shope.
<A - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Great. Can you talk about your thoughts on the individual segments trends when looking at
your guidance? I know last quarter you'd given us some thoughts on that. Can you walk through how we are thinking
about it now coming off of the sequential declines this quarter, particularly on the iPhone segment?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure, Bill, it's Peter. Let me start off, and if Tim wants to add something, he can. I will
first talk about the products and then a little bit about how are thinking about the revenue.

For iPhone, we would expect to have a year-over-year increase in sales in the September quarter. For iPad we also
expect to have a year-over-year increase, but we would point out that we increased channel inventory in the June
quarter by 1.2 million units and in the year-ago quarter, we also increased the iPad inventory at that time by 1.5 million
units. And for Mac, we would expect a sequential increase.
As we think about revenue, we are providing revenue guidance that is up 20% year-over-year and, we have included
several things in our thinking. The first, we are not expecting the economies in Europe or the natural resource-based
countries including Australia, Brazil and Canada to improve from what we saw in the June quarter. As Tim said, we
saw no obvious evidence of the economy impacting our sales in China in the June quarter or in the U.S., but we are
reading the same things that you all are about these economies. So we will have to see.
Our weekly iPhone sales continue to be impacted by rumors and speculation regarding new products. We exited the
June quarter in supply and demand balance, and we were within our four to six week inventory target. We also don't
expect to add any significant new country or carrier additions in the September quarter.
Regarding iPad, as I said, we were able to increase our iPad channel inventory in the June quarter by 1.2 million units.
We ended the June quarter just within four to six week channel inventory target. And we increased last year by 1.5
million units in the September quarter, which also put us in our four to six week inventory target. These increases in
channel inventory will impact both the year-over-year and sequential compares for iPad.
The current iPad lineup that we're selling includes the very successful $399 price point, which we did not have in the
year-ago quarter. So this, along with mix in the line, will impact the ASPs in the September quarter.
Finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most currencies around the world, including the euro, Brazilian reais,
the Chinese RMB, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Swiss franc. We expect this to
have an adverse impact to revenue in these countries in excess of $400 million sequentially, net of our hedges, all that
being said, we very much look forward to introducing iOS 6 in the fall and we remain very confident in our business
and our new product pipeline.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. And just to follow up if I could on the sequential iPhone decline, you gave us a pretty good
outline of what was going on in China, but can you walk us through some of the trends you saw for iPhone demand
sequentially in the other international region?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, Bill, it's Tim. First of all, at a global level I think it's important to understand as you
compare our Q2 iPhone sales to Q3, there's a fairly large channel inventory difference that is embedded in that. As you
recall, in January we completed the iPhone 4S roll out in all of the major countries including China. It was our fastest
iPhone roll out ever. We were also able to get the channel at a – within our target inventory range of four to six weeks
by the end of March. And so what that did was it increased sell-in over sell-through by 2.6 million units. In the quarter
that we just finished, our sell-in was less than sell-through by 300,000 units. And so the net change in channel
inventory across the quarter is about 3 million units. And so I think it's important to understand that to look at the
underlying sell-through trends.
In terms of what we see happening in the different geographies, the U.S. was very strong, running at 47%, Japan was
strong at 45%. I've already mentioned greater China. Greater China was up 66% but mainland China was over double
as I said before, it was over 100% up.
The geography that did not perform well was Europe. Europe was essentially flat, slightly positive year-on-year and
that really hampered our total results. Within Europe – now I'll switch from iPhone to talking about more of the gross
revenue level. We see a marked difference between the countries. The U.K. was relatively solid at 30% growth, but
France and Greece and Italy were particularly poor and Germany was also only a single digit positive growth for the
quarter.
Eastern Europe was strong, materially stronger than Western Europe but obviously the Western European countries
drive the preponderance of the revenue in that segment and so we are certainly seeing a slowdown in business in that
area. Fortunately, the U.S. and China, although I realize it's getting a lot of press, we're not seeing anything there that

we would classify as an obvious economic issue.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Next we'll go to Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah, thanks a lot. My first question I wanted to ask about the fall transition you
mentioned, Peter, when you were talking about gross margin. Can you talk a little bit about that? What is the sequential
impact on margins and revenue that you are baking in? And then qualitatively, how much would you get back in the
December quarter or how much of it is short term?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Okay. Ben, I don't want to frustrate you or others but the fall transition that I spoke about
is driving most of the decline that we see sequentially in gross margin. It is not something that we're going to talk about
in any level of detail today, and we could not be more confident in our new product pipeline.
<Q - Peter Oppenheimer>: Okay. Just with regard to the iPhone in general, you mentioned there were speculation
about new products and rumors, though, but do you have any quantification of how much that hurt sales in the quarter
either from you or Tim? And how much that maybe channel inventory reduction you'll need to do in the next quarter
maybe resulting from that type of speculation?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Ben, I think there's a lot of speculation out there. It's difficult to sort out, but I'm fairly
convinced, based on what I've seen, that there's an incredible anticipation out there for future products and as you
would expect, given what we've been able to deliver in the past. And so I think it's a reasonable amount.
In terms of channel inventory, in the current quarter we put our current thinking in the guidance that Peter provided
you.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Next we will hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about the Mac business? It was up 2%
year-over-year, clearly still outperforming the market, but can you talk about what you're seeing there? How much of
the slower growth was from the product transition versus weak economy and any thoughts on cannibalization of Mac
by the iPad?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Shannon, it's Tim. It's clear the PC market is weak based on those latest IDC data, but
frankly we believe the primary factor for our lower growth rate in the Mac area is the timing of our portable
announcement within last quarter.
As you know, we announced an entirely new portable lineup that's been incredibly well received. That was done with
three weeks or less than three weeks remaining in the quarter. The year ago compare we made a transition in the
portable area in February, and so we were selling our new lineup for the entire Q3 period.
If you look at the data underneath that to further illustrate this, prior to the developer's conference, our weekly Mac
sales were running below the prior year. After the developer's conference, the MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs drove
year-over-year increases in weekly sell-through. They were to the level that got us back to an overall positive territory

for the quarter and our 25th consecutive quarter of growing faster than market.
The MacBook Pro with the Retina display was incredibly well received. We ended the quarter in backlog, and we still
have not caught up with demand yet but anticipate doing so next month. Also to further illustrate the portable point, for
the month of June, the NPD data, that just came out for the United States showed our portable share at 25.5% and a
record 47% of revenue share in the month of June. So, I would attribute a large amount to what has happened in terms
of the timing of our portable announcement.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. Could you talk a little bit, Tim, about what your conversations are like with the
carriers in terms of pricing subsidies? There's still a lot of talk about that over the last few months. How are your
discussions with the carriers going clearly into the product transition that's coming?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: [Laughter]. Let me avoid talking about product transition, but you are very smart to ask that.
I don't want to get into specific topics about with different carriers, but generally, I would just say that our role is to
make the very best smartphone in the world and that has an incredible user experience far superior than anything out
there customers want to use every day. I think at the end of the day, the carriers want to provide their customers with
what their customers want to buy. So the most important thing for Apple, by far, is to continue making the best
products in the world and we are very deeply committed to doing this, and we're maniacally focused on it.
From the carriers' perspective, I think it's also important to remember that the total subsidy that they pay is fairly small,
relative to the monthly payments they collect over a 24-month contract period. I think many would tell you, they
certainly told me, that iPhone has several advantages for them over other smartphones. The churn rates are much less.
You see carriers now focusing on shared data plans, and I think an iPhone customer is more likely to have a tablet or an
iPad. So they really value these customers quite a bit.
Also our engineering teams are very sensitive to working with carriers to find the most efficient way to deal with data.
We think we are the most efficient smartphone on the market for smartphones that are in an app-rich ecosystem. So, we
are going to continue to focusing on making the best product, and I think the carriers will be very motivated to make
sure they provide that to their customers.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question?

Next we will hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you. I have one for Peter and one for Tim, please. Peter, you talked about how you
were above expectations relative to your guidance on iPhone. You also mentioned you were above expectations on
iPod, and you said you were thrilled with iPad, yet your EPS I think came in 5% or 6% above your guidance. So
perhaps you can help us illustrate where you were disappointed relative to your original guidance, because I think the
commentary would certainly point to a much larger beat?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Toni, given what's going on around us, we are happy with our quarter. Sales of each of our
products did exceed what we had factored into the guidance. That was especially true of the iPad, which set a new
record at 17 million units. The $35 billion of revenue that we've reported grew by $6.5 billion year-over-year. We do
think some things did impact us in the quarter, so let me comment on that.
The economy in Europe is not doing well. We think is impacted our results. We also saw some economic impact in the
natural resource based economies, including Australia, Brazil and Canada. As Tim discussed, regarding the iPhone, we
are reading the same rumors and speculation that you are about a new iPhone, and we think this has caused some pause
in customers purchasing. The timing of availability of Intel's Ivy Bridge and resulting rumors about the new portables
impacted our sales in April and May. Tim talked about how after WWDC we saw a large increase in sales both in terms
of weekly sales before WWDC and on a year-over-year basis. Customers are loving the new MacBook Pro. We did not

get the benefit of launching the new iPad in China or the new portables, as we were pursuing routine regulatory
approval.
Finally, the dollar strengthened against most currencies around the world, which reduced our revenue growth
sequentially by over $200 million net of our hedges. So we think these things impacted the quarter. We are very happy
with how the business is performing and are excited about our new product pipeline.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you for that. Tim, the question that I have for you is whether you could talk a little
bit about smartphone growth in emerging markets? China is obviously the biggest one. Some of the data that I have
seen suggests that about 70% of the phones that are – smartphones that are being purchased in places like China and
other emerging countries are under $300, and in many cases under $200. Do you agree with that market
characterization? And at some point does that limit your ability to gain share in a marketplace where it is 70% of the
units are at a price point that you currently don't play in? At what point does that math prevent you from gaining share?
And what are your strategies for ensuring continued share going forward, if indeed that is an objective?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Toni, the specific data you quoted, the 70%, doesn't map to what I've seen, but let me try to
answer your general question without that specific. We have been very focused, as you know, on China because we see
it as an enormous opportunity for us and I am very pleased that we were able to grow our iPhone sales over 100% last
quarter. So I feel very, very good about that, and I firmly believe that people in the emerging markets want great
products like they do in developed markets and so forth. And so we're going to stick to our knitting and make the best
product, and we think that if we do that, that we've got a very, very good business ahead of us. So that's what we are
doing.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And the share objective in and of itself is not an explicit one, Tim? That's a consequence
of making good products? It either happens or it doesn't? Or is that an explicit objective for the iPhone business on a
global basis and on an emerging markets basis?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Our North Star for the company in total, so not just iPhone but across everything that we
make, is to make the very best product and that's more important and overshadows all other things. But we do believe
by doing that, that we will have a great business, and I think that our results today really show that.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?

From Pacific Crest we'll go to Andy Hargreaves.
<Q - Andy Hargreaves>: Hi. Just first a clarification. Is the channel inventory commentary all on a look-forward
basis?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: You are talking about the weeks, Andy...?
<Q - Andy Hargreaves>: Correct.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: The weeks that we quote are forward looking because inventory is in the channel for
forward sales.
<Q - Andy Hargreaves>: Okay. So then the comment on iPad being just slightly within the range of four to six weeks
would seem to imply a fairly significant slowdown sequentially in sell-through. Can you comment on what's driving
that expectation?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Keep in mind that the channel inventory is only for the indirect channel but it's not used for,
to support any direct sales and direct sales are Apple retail sales, Apple online sales, Apple education sales. And so I
don't want to give you specific guidance for iPad sales. It's important to keep that in mind. And that's just not the case

with iPad but it's the case with all products. I know that there are some companies out there that refer to their channel
inventory in terms of their gross sales, but we don't do that because we feel very strongly that it only supports the
channel sales and that's how we calculate it.
<Q - Andy Hargreaves>: Okay. Thanks. And then just, you obviously talked a fair amount about pricing umbrellas in
the past and on the iPhone side you've done things to address that. How are you thinking about that now on the iPad
side now that there's some slightly higher quality competition like the Nexus 7 at lower price points?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We repriced the iPad2 to $399 and it did very well in the quarter, the most popular iPad is
the new iPad. The iPad2 did very well. It was particularly key in the K-12 area that Peter spoke about earlier where we
sold about a million units for the quarter. So we have been very aggressive in this space, and I don't see changing that.
In terms of competition, we've all seen, I think, many different tablets, hundreds of them come to market over the last
year and I have yet to see any of them really gain what I would call any level of traction at all. We have over 225,000
apps that have been optimized for iPad. There is an incredible experience on iPad, and I still think the market very
much or most customers feel that they are not really looking for a tablet, they're just looking for an iPad. And we're
going to keep innovating in this space and keep making great products, and I think keep a very, very strong business
going forward.
The 17 million iPads was up 84% year-over-year, and we've now shipped over 84 million, and this is as of the end of
last quarter, iPads, which if you look at that on a trajectory rate, it took us more than twice as long to achieve that on
iPod and a third longer on – or we achieved it in third less time on iPad than iPhone. So, we feel really, really good
about our momentum in this space.
<Q - Andy Hargreaves>: Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yep.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Andy. Can we have the next question, please?

Next we will hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Good afternoon. Tim, I know you just talked a little bit about the iPad. You gave a little bit
more information on the iPhone. Can you talk a little bit more about just what segments have been driving it? You
mentioned a little bit of education. Is it U.S. consumer, U.S. corporate market, is it channel fill in other markets, any
more kind of feedback for us to help navigate how to model this for the next few quarters?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes, sure, Gene. We're seeing, with an 84% up year-over-year, we are seeing triple-digit
growth rates in many, many geographies. Generally speaking, the international markets in the aggregate are extremely
strong, in the triple digits internationally. The U.S. is a bit lower, but I think it's important to keep in mind that the U.S.
was on a faster adoption curve with iPad and so we are thrilled with the numbers everywhere. Latin America is tripling.
We are seeing growth out of countries, that border on being shocking in terms of the growth rates. We would not have
dreamed of shipping over 17 million last quarter and feel very, very good about it.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: That's helpful. Did you give, maybe I missed it, but did you give an Apple TV number for
the quarter and any kind of updated thoughts on how you're thinking about that going forward?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes. It's a good question. I did not give it, but I can. We sold 1.3 million last quarter. This
was up over 170% year-over-year. It brings our fiscal year to 4 million units, which is pretty incredible. It is still at a
level that we would call it a hobby, but we continue to pull the string to see where it takes us, and we are not one to
keep around projects that we don't believe in and so there are a lot of people here that are believers in Apple TV, and
we continue to invest in it and see where it will take us.

bigger.

There are a lot of believers in it.

From JPMorgan, we will go to Mark Moskowitz.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you. The first question is around ASPs. The iPad and the iPhone, the blended
ASPs seemed to have declined a little more this quarter versus the prior quarters. Is that a function of the product
portfolio or Apple just testing price elasticity as you expand into the emerging markets?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Hi. It's Peter. The iPhone ASP, we don't talk specifically about iPad and iPhone ASPs, but
I would like to give you a little bit of color this quarter, because they did change some sequentially, and in the case of
the iPad year-over-year. Beginning with the iPhone, the ASP was down due to a higher mix of lower priced models and
a stronger U.S. dollar. That was the case generally on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. Regarding the mix, we
believe that this was largely driven by all the new product rumors, economic conditions, particularly in Europe, and we
had a change in the ending inventory by model that also influenced the ASPs.
For the iPad, it was down more year-over-year than it was sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was really
attributable to four things. We had a higher mix of lower priced models; we reduced the price of the iPad 2 to $399;
with our expanded distribution, we had a higher mix of indirect sales this year than we did a year ago; and the dollar
impacted us as well.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. Thank you, Peter, for that. Tim, I want to shift gears longer term. You talked
earlier about hobbies and their relevance. What about Passbook? I'm not trying to imply that it's a hobby, but could
Passbook be perceived as kind of a stepping stone to Apple having a greater role in a digital wallet type of
infrastructure?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I would not want to comment specifically on that point but Passbook, in general, is a very
key feature. I think all of us have found that we were getting many passes and many tickets and so forth that were
scattered all over, maybe boarding passes, etcetera. They were scattered all over our iPhones in different apps. So,
Passbook does an incredible job of pulling all of those to one place, whether it's offers or passes or tickets or whatever
it may be. And so, it's an important feature of iOS 6, and I would not want to speculate about where it might take us.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Mark. Can we have the next question, please?

From Deutsche Bank we will go to Chris Whitmore.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I wanted to follow up on the pricing question and ask specifically
around the iPad as to whether or not you think the lower price point drove elasticity of demand for that product? In
other words, were your sales incrementally higher or, as a result of this economic environment, did you see customers

migrate down market to lower-priced products because spending is a little tighter these days?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Chris, it's Tim. The reason that we did it was because we believed that the sales would be
incrementally larger that there was price elasticity, and that there was a buyer that really wanted the best product and
needed it to be a little less expensive. And so I believe that we saw that. I think it did help our sales. I think it's
particularly helping in K-12. The adoption rate of iPad in education is something I have never seen from any
technology product in history. Usually, education tends to be a fairly conservative institution in terms of buying or
K-12 does, and we're not seeing that at all on the iPad. So I think it's been a big help for us. I'm really glad that we did
it.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: To follow up, I wanted to ask about the opportunity that you see in India. A few
years back you talked about initial investments in China and having cracked the China code. Why hasn't Apple been
more successful in India and what is your outlook for growth in that geography, specifically, going forward?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Chris, I love India. But, I believe that Apple has some higher potential, in the intermediate
term, in some other countries. And that does not mean that we're not putting emphasis on India, we are. We have a
business there. That business is growing. But the sort of the multi-layer distribution there really adds to the cost of
getting products to market. So we're going to continue putting some energies there, but my own perspective is that in
the intermediate term, there will be larger opportunities outside of there.

From Sterne, Agee we will hear from Shaw Wu.
<Q - Shaw Wu>: Thanks for having me on. Just a quick question in terms of component availability, particularly new
components? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Shaw, it's Tim. We factored supply into the guidance that Peter has given you. Generally, I
should say that we have been short of the MacBook Pro with the Retina display. We ended the quarter with backlog,
and we're working really hard to deliver those to customers quickly and we believe that we will be in supply demand
balance in August. In terms of new products, I obviously don't talk about new products nor the parts that are in them.
It's just sort of a limit to what I can say there, other than anything that we know about, we've obviously included in the
guidance, and if we were short of something you can bet that we would all be spending our energies on trying to
mitigate that.
<Q - Shaw Wu>: Okay. Thanks for color. Just a follow up I don't know if you can talk about, in terms of the new iPad
with the Retina display, I don't know if any constraints there?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: The iPad, the new iPad ended the quarter in just over the four week line, which we
associated with our target of four to six weeks in terms of channel inventory. Now that said, as a reminder we did not
ship the new iPad in mainland China until the quarter that we are now in, in Q4, but in Q3, we feel like we ended in a
balanced situation.

And that will come from Brian Marshall with ISI.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys. Clearly Apple's design philosophy has been about building great products
as opposed to kind of going into the market hitting certain price points. But how do you think about the opportunities to
address maybe some of those opportunities that are down at some of those lower price points with your existing
products without essentially compromising the core features that basically make Apple's products great?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Brian, it's Tim. Our North Star is to maniacally focus on making the world's best product,
and economic turmoil may push us side to side but we're going to stay on that journey and stay focused on making the
best product and not deviate from that. We've seen it again and again throughout the years that during these type of
periods, are – where we distance ourselves further from people that don't innovate, and it increases the gap between us.
And so that's what we're focused on.
Now when we can do that and hit more aggressive price points, we're also going to do that, and I think you've seen with
what we did with the $399 iPad just a few months ago and the iPhone 3GS is free in the United States and in several
other countries, and there's been quite a lot knocked off the price of that in certain other markets. And so our North
Star, though, will be making the best products in the world and that's why we breathe, that's why we live and we're not
changing that.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Thanks. And then when you think about how the iPhone has penetrated the planet, obviously
we've had some pretty phenomenal success, and some of that success there's been some downside to that as well with
respect to volatility, about rumors and speculation about kind of future products being announced. And so can you talk
a little bit about how you try to manage sort of the iPhone transitions and the carrier ramp as well? I mean, obviously
you mentioned you're not going to be launching any major countries or carriers in the September quarter, but it's widely
speculated that we're going to see something later on in the year. So if you can you talk a little bit about how you kind
of manage that whole sort of transition/carrier ramp that would be great. Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Brian, we try very hard to keep our product roadmap secret and confidential, and we go to
extreme – do extreme activities to try to do that. That, however, doesn't stop people from speculating or wondering and
we'll never do that. And so it is a great thing about this country, people can say what they think and so forth, and so I'm
not going to spend any energy trying to change that. That's just the environment we're in.
I'm glad that people want the next thing. I'm super happy about it, and there are obviously quite a few that want what
we're currently doing as well as witnessed by the amount of products that we're selling. And so I'm not going to put any
energy into trying to get people to stop speculating. I don't think it would – I don't think that's going to amount to
anything.
