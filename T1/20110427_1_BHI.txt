With that, I'll conclude our discussion of the administrative details and turn the call over to Peter Ragauss. Peter?
Peter A. Ragauss
Thanks, Gary. Good morning.
This morning we reported net income on a GAAP basis attributable to Baker Hughes of $381 million or $0.87 per
share. Revenue was $4.5 billion, up 78% or almost $2 billion compared to a year ago, and up 2% or $102 million
sequentially. EBITDA per share was $2.19, up $0.86 or 65% compared to a year ago, and up $0.01 from last quarter.
To help in your understanding of the moving pieces, I'll bridge Q1 of last year to Q1 of this year. GAAP EPS a year
ago was $0.41 per share. Add $0.02 for acquisition related expenses incurred in Q1 last year. Subtract $0.13 for the
impact of the higher share count and a higher effective tax rate. Subtract $0.07 for higher corporate costs and net
interest expenses. Subtract $0.05 for the impact of the incremental non-cash amortization costs associated with the
acquisition. Last, operations added $0.69 per share. That brings us to $0.87 per share. It includes the operational impact
of the North Africa geopolitical events and weather in North America and Asia-Pacific this quarter.
Bridging the sequential quarters, GAAP EPS for Q4 2010 was $0.77 per share. First, add $0.07 per share for
acquisition related costs net of the gain on investment in Q4 2010. Subtract the impact of the higher relative tax rate,
higher share count, interest, and corporate expenses of $0.02 per share. Subtract $0.04 per share for the impact of
higher seasonal export sales in Q4 2010. Last, operations added $0.09 per share, again, including the operational impact
of the North Africa disruption and weather from other parts of the world, which gets us to $0.87 per share.
In Table 3 of our earnings release, we provide financial information on a pro forma combined basis, with revenue and
profit before tax of BJ Services included into the prior period's results to allow meaningful comparison between
quarters. From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit, and operating profit
margin refer explicitly to Table 3.
Revenue in North America was $2.35 billion, up 43% compared to a year ago and up 6% sequentially. North America
operating profits were $460 million, up $284 million year over year and down $18 million sequentially. North America
margins were at 20% compared to 11% a year ago and 22% last quarter.
Gulf of Mexico profit was down sequentially as large orders for completion equipment delivered last quarter did not
reoccur this quarter, costing us about 50 basis points in margin. Colder than normal weather also reduced operating
profit by nearly 200 basis points.
International revenue was $1.9 billion, up 8% compared to a year ago and down 2% compared to the prior quarter.
Operating profits were $233 million, up $101 million year on year and up $58 million from the prior quarter.
International margins were 12.2%, up 319 basis points sequentially, as we continued to progress towards our
international operating margin target.
Our Industrial Services and other segment revenue was $270 million, up 9% compared to last year and down 4%
compared to last quarter. Operating profit was $14 million, down $4 million compared to a year ago and down $14
million sequentially. First quarter results were impacted by seasonally lower activity for our pipeline commissioning
business. The operating margin was 5%.
Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter end our total debt was $3.8 billion or flat with the prior quarter. Our total debt
to capital ratio was 21%. Our capital expenditures were $429 million this quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had
$1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And we also have $1.7 billion undrawn and available under our
committed credit facilities.
Now let me provide you with our updated outlook for the balance of 2011. We now plan interest expense to be between
$200 million and $205 million for 2011. Corporate costs are unchanged at $250 million to $260 million. The
depreciation and amortization range is unchanged at between $1.38 billion and $1.43 billion. And annual capital

expenditures at $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion is unchanged. And our tax rate is still expected to be between 36% and 34%.
Last, I want to remind you that the Canada breakup will have a very significant impact for us in Q2, given the size of
our business there now combined with BJ Services, and coming off strong results in Q1. And decrementals are very
high during the breakup.
Growth in profit in the rest of the world could offset the decline in Canada. And if that happens, earnings per share
should be roughly flat with Q1 2011.
I'll now turn the call over to Martin, who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Peter, good morning.
Let me start with international operations. We had a good quarter despite some extraordinarily hostile market forces,
including geopolitical uncertainty in North Africa and the Middle East and abysmal weather in Asia-Pacific. That said,
the actions we are taking to improve international margins are evident again in this quarter's results.
Turning first to Latin America, revenue increased 19% year over year but fell 2% sequentially, as increases in the
Mexico, Venezuela, and Southern Cone geo markets were not sufficient to offset the lower seasonal sales in the first
quarter in the Andean and Brazil geo markets. Margins improved sequentially as volume growth, incremental cost
management, and efficiency gains offset seasonally high fourth quarter sales. Operating profit margin is now 13%.
Activity in Brazil remained strong. Our teams there continue to push the limits of technology in the pre-salt reservoirs
of the Lula field, formerly known as Tupi. For example, we were the first company to kick off in the salt section and
successfully drill the first directional well in the field. This is very important because Brazil's pre-salt reservoirs are
unique in that the target reservoir itself lies immediately below the salt section. Therefore, by kicking off and building
angle within the salt section allows for more reservoir to be exposed to the wellbore. This was achieved using an
advanced directional drilling package. For Brazil's largest independent, we drilled our first two wells as part of an
integrated operations project with estimated revenue this year at $60 million.
Turning to the Europe/Africa/Russia/Caspian segment, revenue fell 3% sequentially, as revenue increases in Africa and
Europe were more than offset by geopolitical disruptions and lower revenue in Libya and seasonally weaker export
sales.
In the Continental Europe geo market, increases in the land rig count were supported by rising unconventional gas and
geothermal activity in Poland, Turkey, and Germany. As highlighted at our March analyst conference, we achieved an
exciting technology milestone in the first quarter, installing the first GeoFORM, our open-hole, conformable sand
management system, offshore Italy, with positive feedback from the customer.
Drilling activity in the UK geo market slowed this quarter. We saw operational delays caused by higher levels of
maintenance and refurbishment of rigs and the associated blowout prevention equipment to meet certification
requirements. And given our strong market share position, these impacts were not insignificant to our profitability. For
Q2, we expect the weather and rig issues to be behind us, allowing us to execute on recent contract awards.
Turning to Norway, we were impacted by the inclement weather and increased pricing pressure from competitive
bidding. In Q1, we won a two-year completions contract by a super-major valued at more than $200 million as a result
of our solid historical performance in country.
The Russia/Caspian geo market was flat sequentially through Q1, even against the usual seasonal weather impacts. Our
outlook is strong for the remainder of '11. And we expect to realize some pricing improvement, particularly on the
D&E product lines going forward.

In the first quarter, we won a multimillion dollar integrated operations contract for complete rig management and
deployment of our full suite of products for an NOC in the Yamal Peninsula. In Western Siberia, we secured a
multi-well project planned for 2011, utilizing an advanced directional drilling package for a leading Russian major.
And in offshore Sakhalin, where we have been historically strong in our completions and pressure pumping business,
we won a 10-well, three-year contract for high pressure fracing and gravel placement services.
Turning to Africa, activity is increasing in sub-Saharan and Eastern Africa, and we see some incremental growth, given
that oil prices is hold. Nigeria looks more secure as the governors' elections are complete and presidential elections are
on the horizon. And from a business perspective, pressure pumping was particularly strong for us in Nigeria this
quarter.
In North Africa, the situation is mixed. Algeria is improving and Tunisia is recovering. However, IOCs remain cautious
throughout the area. And Libya is, of course, completely shut down operationally, but fixed costs continue.
On a positive note, in Angola we won a three-year deepwater drilling and evaluation services contract for Block 18
from an IOC. And another IOC has awarded us with a two-well drilling and evaluation program for Block 16 and
Block 23.
Turning to the Middle East/Asia-Pac segment, sequential improvement in the Middle East offset weaker activity in
Asia-Pacific, which was exposed to a litany of weather disruptions. The sequential improvement in the Middle East
segment was due to production enhancement activities in Iraq, where sales doubled sequentially, strong wireline and
chemical sales in the Gulf geo market, and margin improvement throughout the region.
With regard to new rigs coming online in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, we fully expect to gain our fair share of the
incremental work based on our prudent performance in country and solid relationships with the NOCs.
A couple of highlights in the quarter; in order to help Saudi Arabia meet domestic gas demand, we deployed an
advanced underbalanced coil tubing drilling solution to enhance production from existing gas wells. After resolving
startup issues, the project has hit its stride and is delivering record results in terms of footage drilled and non-productive
time. Our non-productive time is now 5% compared to the nearly 18% average of the five wells drilled prior to the
beginning of our contract.
In Iraq, despite slower than anticipated drilling activity, we're seeing our completion and production business flourish.
We are deploying all of our C&P product lines on workover rigs and rigless operations, with heightened demand for
cementing, coil tubing, cleanout, open-hole and cased-hole wireline services. And recent awards for wireline and a
coring tender will further strengthen our position in Iraq.
In Asia-Pacific, severe weather disruptions adversely impacted revenue this quarter. And similar to the North Sea
deepwater rig issues mentioned earlier, some Asia-Pac rig activity was delayed as operators audited their rigs for safety
compliance and kept some in the shipyards for extended repairs. Additionally, we saw the usual seasonal decline in
product sales following a strong fourth quarter.
So far in 2011, Asia-Pacific remains a competitive market, with limited ability to move prices. On the upside, we are
witnessing increased shale drilling activity in China, with opportunity for us to leverage our strong North American
expertise in unconventional drilling technologies and our completion products portfolio.
In the first quarter, in the Southeast Asia geo market, our Reservoir Development Services group commenced a
15-month development study for an NOC to increase production of oil and gas in a mature field offshore Malaysia.
And on the same project, Baker Hughes was awarded with a multimillion-dollar production enhancement contract, with
strong upside potential moving forward. This is a significant award in that the NOC has chosen our Reservoir
Management team to manage the field and make the operational decisions. And while the financial upside is
significant, we're really excited about the change that this business model represents.
In India, we were awarded a five-year deepwater integrated operations contract from an NOC. Valued at almost $300
million, we will provide drilling systems, fluids, liner hangers, cementing, and mud logging services. This integrated
operations project will position us well for incremental business in shale gas and redevelopment of depleted fields

throughout India.
Moving to our Industrial Services group, it performed as expected in Q1. This group is comprised of downstream
services, specialty chemicals, and pipeline inspection and commissioning services, all of which were seasonally
impacted.
Finally I'll turn to our North American operations. This market remains exceptionally strong for us, buoyed by a rising
oil price more than offsetting anemic natural gas prices. Overall spending levels on land have increased as incremental
spending on oil and liquids-rich natural gas plays has offset weakness in dry gas plays.
Last Thursday, Baker Hughes announced that the oil rig count has now surpassed the gas rig count in the United States
for the first time in 16 years. The foundation of our North American land activity has been the unconventional shales
and the corresponding demand for our horizontal drilling, advanced completions, and pressure pumping.
Weather was a positive for us in Canada, where the drilling season was extended, but a net negative for North America
considering the impact of cold weather on southern U.S. pressure pumping.
In U.S. land, our drilling, completions, wireline, and pressure pumping businesses delivered very strong results this
quarter, as we continue to realize market opportunities from our expanded product portfolio.
I'd like to highlight a few customer successes in the quarter. Baker Hughes pressure pumping continues its pull-through
success, this time with Cabot Oil & Gas, for a multi-well package in the Marcellus Shale, with estimated annual
revenues of more than $150 million. We secured an incremental contract for drilling services, drilling fluids,
completions, wireline, and chemicals for this independent operator.
Adding to our portfolio of work in the Marcellus, another independent operator has awarded us a 39-well, $140 million
contract to perform all of their Marcellus Shale work as a complete and full package this year and into next.
In the Eagle Ford, we won a contract from an independent operator for a total drilling and completion package,
representing 12 wells and more than $100 million of revenue for 2011.
As highlighted at our analyst conference, we are aggressively pursuing nanotechnology to help our customers
overcome technical challenges in the wellbore. In the first quarter, we announced our FracPoint premium system,
incorporating In-Tallic balls, which decompose in a controlled way during the fracturing process. We've deployed these
balls in the Bakken, the Marcellus, and the Anadarko Basin.
In Canada, we had a very strong quarter, driven by oil activity. While total rigs increased 25% year over year and 45%
from last quarter, the oil rig count in Canada was up 57% year over year and up 70% sequentially. In the quarter, we
had almost 10 extra revenue days because of the late start to the spring breakup.
Shale plays are ramping up in Canada, and our pressure pumping business has clearly benefited. In Q1, we installed a
complex fracture treatment with OptiPort coiled-tubing deployed frac sleeve technology, which significantly reduced
average fracturing time by 45% and reduced fluid usage by 30%.
And finally, turning to the Gulf of Mexico, where we have a very strong market position, profitability was sharply
down sequentially. The decline was primarily due to the sequential drop-off of completion product sales.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Chad.
Chadwick C. Deaton
Thank you, Martin. Good morning, everyone.
Q1 was another good quarter for Baker Hughes. And in closing out the session this morning, I wanted to take a look at
some of the major themes that we discussed at our analyst conference and see how we progressed during this recent
quarter.

First, international margins improved again by over 300 basis points sequentially, more than covering the impact of the
geopolitical disruptions in North Africa and the weather issues in Asia. We made steady progress towards our goal of
exiting 2011 with mid-teen international operating margins.
The early focus of our plan to increase international margins was cost management and improving operational
efficiency. I want you to keep in mind that during the reorganization, we carried duplicate resources. And beginning
last fall, we started to bring these back in line. We've made significant gains here, as evidenced by our marketing,
general, and administrative costs, which were 6.2% of revenue in Q1 compared to 12% a year ago, which is a huge
difference. Now with costs in line with our expectations, the focus of our improvement efforts is on continuing to
advance operational efficiency.
As we move towards the second half of 2011, activity growth becomes a much more important driver of future
improvement. And based on what we're seeing on the international front, I'm confident the activity will be there.
The second topic we discussed at the conference was that we expected to lead in North American margins through the
cycle. Our confidence in the strength of the North American market has continued to increase. Service intensity in the
unconventional shales is growing as we grow longer horizontal wells requiring more frac stages and complex
completions.
The addition of FracPoint premium and AutoTrak Curve has strengthened what I believe is one of the strongest
technology offerings the industry has to address the challenges of the unconventional shales. With our pressure
pumping sold out in North America, we expect to accelerate the deployment of new hydraulic fracturing fleets. Our
conviction remains strong that supply will not match demand this year.
As a measure of our confidence, we are increasing our annual average U.S. rig count forecast from 1,740 to 1,790 for
2011, and that compares to 1,548 last year. And we are increasing our Canada rig count forecast from 340 to 390, and
that compares to 348 last year. The activity increases will help support higher margins and realized pricing.
We also expect the Gulf of Mexico activity to begin a nice build for the rest of the year and support higher margins as
well.
A third key objective from the conference is that we expect to remain a leader in the offshore markets, both on the shelf
as well as the deepwater. The permitting of 10 rigs this quarter in the Gulf of Mexico is encouraging. However, we also
recognize that the 10 deepwater wells recently permitted to be drilled will only be a fraction of the activity levels we
saw before the drilling moratorium was announced. This level of activity is insufficient to offset the 380,000 barrel per
day or 23% drop in Gulf of Mexico oil production, as forecasted by the EIA [U.S. Energy Information Administration]
for 2012 compared to the 2010 time period.
A significant amount of the work has already been contracted for these recent 10 permits. And work for several other
permits that are pending have also already been assigned. We've been awarded more than our historical share, and look
forward to seeing this move past the permit stage and finally turn into some actual contracts and work.
Fourth, we expect to lead the market in competency assurance. Over the last year, we've continued to invest in our
training, our safety, and our competency assurance programs so that our experienced people are ready to go when the
deepwater activity resumes. Our customers have also been busy auditing our processes and procedures in anticipation
of resumption in deepwater drilling activity. I believe that with a combination of our experienced people and our suite
of advanced technology and services, we are in a great position as activity starts up.
Last and certainly not least is the supply chain. We've continued to progress with our multiyear supply chain effort.
This quarter's most notable accomplishment was the opening of our new PDC drill bit manufacturing plant in Dhahran,
Saudi Arabia. The opening of the plant is another step in moving our supply chain closer to our customers and markets
and diversifying our manufacturing footprint.
I was on hand for the opening of the plant with senior Saudi Aramco officials. And they paid us a very nice compliment
during the ribbon cutting ceremony, saying that no company in the last four years has introduced more technology into
the kingdom than Baker Hughes. And the following day, they shared the news that Saudi Aramco is ramping up

drilling activity from 92 to 118 rigs, with an increased focus on oil producing projects. We made some nice progress in
these last four or five years in the kingdom. And with our recent performance, which Martin highlighted earlier, we
expect that we will receive our fair share of the incremental activity.
And during this same trip to the Middle East, we were also told by ADNOC that Abu Dhabi planned to add 16 rigs.
And several of our clients recently, both the IOCs as well as the NOCs alike, have noted that spare production capacity
has become stretched and may not prove adequate given the geopolitical tensions across North Africa and the Middle
East. And when you combine that tension with a growing economy and the energy implications of the tragic events in
Japan, we've come to the conclusion that exploration, development, and production spending will increase, thus raising
our confidence that the second half of 2011 will set the stage for a strong 2012.
So Gary, let's open it up for some questions.
Gary R. Flaharty
All right; thank you, Chad. At this point, I'll ask Ashley to open the lines for your questions. To give everyone a fair
chance to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and a related follow-up question. Ashley,
could we have the first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey good morning.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Well done on the margin front, congratulations. Now the real work begins, Chad, as you start to
embark on hitting that mid-teens exit rate for next year. You mentioned you feel very confident in the potential for
E&P spending trend to pick up in the second half of the year. And I guess let me just start by a bigger picture question.
Given the fact that we've had $90-plus oil for almost a two-year period now, and the outlook for $100 oil being
sustained for quite some time, how come in your mind, why hasn't the customer base moved more aggressively to
increase spend up to this point?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I think everybody was sitting back trying to just watch this and see if it was real. You had
the general economy around the world, Kurt, that was in question. So I think people were trying to watch which way
that would go. I think it required a stimulus or something to kick it off. And I think clearly in this case, with Aramco
announcing their increase, followed very quickly by ADNOC in Abu Dhabi, and also you've seen Brazil will be quite
bullish for the last year. So I think that's what has been the stimulus behind us and kicked everything off.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, and then in terms of from a spare – you mentioned spare capacity on the oil production
front; what about the spare capacity on the oil field services front? Some of your primary competitors here last week
discussed the international market as still being extremely competitive from a pricing standpoint. I think Martin
highlighted a couple of different areas were that was still the case. At what point do you think oilfield service capacity
will be sufficiently absorbed and you'll be in a position now to have a little bit more pricing power?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I think by the end of this year, you'll see that. Last quarter, we talked about from an
international standpoint, the first area we saw starting to get a little bit of tightness and some improvement in pricing
was Russia. This quarter, we're starting to see it in the Middle East. We're starting to see a little bit of it in parts of
Europe. So I think by the end of the year, services equipment especially is going to be tight enough, and people, that
will start getting some meaningful price improvement.

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then lastly, if I may, your exit rate for '11, once again, is mid-teens on your
international margin. Beyond that, where is your expectation and where do you think you can take international
margins in 2012?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: As we said in the conference, we're going to be competitive in 2012. So I think we'll have
room to improve on that mid-teens in 2012.

And our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
<Q - Bill F. Herbert>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - Bill F. Herbert>: I want to delve a little bit into North America for a sec here, Peter, recognizing that indeed,
we've got breakup in Canada on the one hand. On the other hand, however, you've got more the non-weather conditions
in the Lower 48. You've also got a Gulf of Mexico rig count which is up, probably going to be up pretty sharply quarter
on quarter from the Q1 averages. And also the March exit rate rig count in U.S. land up pretty sharply relative to the Q1
average. So shouldn't the U.S. at least offset the profit demise in Canada in Q2 when you roll all those elements up
together?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: I think it's going to be close, Bill. The Canada impact is absolutely huge. We're the biggest
service company in Canada now. And it's a big drop and it happens every Q2, And it only happened – now the impact
is almost twice as big as what it used to be for Baker Hughes. But we do expect U.S. land to spring back, almost offset
it, and we do expect the Gulf to come back. So it's going to be a close call. We still expect revenues to be down
sequentially in North America a bit. And whether or not the margins offset that, we'll know more in three months' time.
<Q - Bill F. Herbert>: Time will tell, right. Remind us what percentage of North American revenues Canada
represented in Q1. Was it close to 25%?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: A little less than 25%.
<Q - Bill F. Herbert>: Okay. 20% to 25% or thereabouts?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yes.
<Q - Bill F. Herbert>: Okay, next topic here is with regard to your delivery of new frac capacity, Martin. Are we still
at 40,000 horsepower every six weeks, or has the supply chain improved? And walk us through the leading-edge
pricing dynamics on the frac front.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Because of our late start, Bill, I have to remind you that really this management team got
involved in the lot of this capital planning in the third quarter of last year, right?
<Q - Bill F. Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And so we came out of the blocks as fast as we could. Our suppliers are working very
closely with us. Your estimate of around 40,000 horsepower every six weeks is about what we did in the first quarter.
<Q - Bill F. Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We are heavily, though, back-loaded in the second half of this year. And we have full
expectation that we'll deliver what we budgeted. But we are back-loaded in the second half because of the late start.

<Q - Bill F. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And in terms of pricing, we still see price improvement for incremental placement of
equipment. And certainly, we would prefer to have a lot more coming out than we do.
<Q - Bill F. Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: But it is what it is on the supply chain, and we just don't see any degrading of the price at
this stage.
<Q - Bill F. Herbert>: Neither do we, but is it fair to assume that with regard to your back-end loaded capacity
delivery that we should be expecting improving net pricing with that equipment as it gets absorbed?

Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Hey, good morning; good quarter, guys.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Thanks, Angie.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Hi, Angie.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Chad, on your international margins, obviously very impressive here in Q1 at 12.2%. And as
you've stated, you want to hit mid-teens by the end of the year. Could we be at 15% margins before Q4, potentially Q2
or even Q3 for international?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: December 28th; I think a lot of that, Angie, is going to come on – the first question from
Kurt was on pricing. When will we start seeing some price movement? And we keep in mind when we said the 15%,
that was our goal we were going to get to without a lot of price influence on that. So whatever we can get on price in
Q3 and Q4 will help us get there faster.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: And so give us your thoughts on Q2 for international margins.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I think Q2 will be probably a little bit better than Q1, and we'll see our real benefit
coming in Q3 – Q4. And again, that comes based off of the volume side more than the price, so that's how we've got it
plugged in.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: All right, okay. And then in regards to volume versus cost management and improving
efficiency, how far along are you on your cost cutting efforts? Is it now 75%, or is it actually still closer to 50%? Where
are we on that?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: No, in fact we were surprised we did as well as we did. In the first quarter on the cost
side, we did better than we thought. So I think we're pushing more up on to the 90%-plus on the cost, and now it's
really pushing the efficiency, supply chain, and volume.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, that's helpful. And then finally on the Gulf of Mexico, clearly, we peaked at 33 rigs
working before Macondo, and I believe we're at 13 today. Given the time to ramp up activity, what quarter should we
begin to see a more meaningful impact on your numbers, Q3, Q4? Is it 2012? And also, in Q3 of 2010, we saw
decremental margins of 50% to 60%. Could we see incremental margins ultimately at 50% to 60%?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: First, keep in mind that these 13 rigs are permitted, not necessarily working.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Right.

<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: So a couple of them have gone back. But we have still not seen all those permitted rigs to
go back. And the second wave of permits that sit out there, an additional 11 permits, we're plugging in to hopefully
come in some time Q3, Q4. So total, you've got 20-plus, 21 rigs plus or minus out there. I don't think all of them will be
back to drilling by the end of this year just simply because I think there are still going to be some challenges out there
and some other things coming.
But I think Q2, we're going to see a better Q2 than we saw in Q1. And then, hopefully, Q3 and Q4 will be building
quite rapidly. And with the tightness of equipment, not just us, everybody out there, then yes, I think you'll start seeing
some very nice incrementals flowing through, especially in early 2012.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great, that matches my expectations. Thanks so much, Chad.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Hill with Tudor Pickering.
<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Good morning.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Great quarter. I was pleased to see both international margin performance and the lack of
any unusual items. It was a really clean quarter to go through.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Thank you.
<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Just getting along some more esoteric lines, it has been about a year since you guys closed
the BJ deal. Can you give us an update on how you feel your relative competitiveness is in the integrated ops area a
year into BJ at this point, and just compare it to where you were a year ago?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: It was year ago that we closed it on the international side; and as Martin talked about
only two quarters ago that we were able to close it on the US side. And so, I think you have to – although one may not
be considered integrated ops, it definitely requires a lot of combined services.
So internationally, I think we're still doing better in some countries than others. When it comes to integrated ops,
Martin made a comment about an award in the Yamal Peninsula for a major Russian client that, to me, is probably one
of the biggest single exploration wells, IO-type package that I've ever seen being awarded, very complicated. And that
was awarded to the entire group for us. You see what's happening in the coil tubing drilling projects in Saudi Arabia,
where we've got the BJ side in there cementing and coil tubing as well as all the Baker Hughes legacy equipment.
We're seeing some good things down in Latin America in the Andean area, where we've won several projects there.
Martin talked about the project in Malaysia, where we won not only the reservoir evaluation study, but also all the
services that are combined with that going forward. So I think we're gaining traction internationally on IO.
And then domestically, where it's not really called IO, again, I think the Cabot award up in the Marcellus, the other
independent that was awarded, the independent down in Eagle Ford; these are total packages covering everything from
wireline to cementing to pumping to coil tubing. And that was a little bit of a combination of legacy Baker Hughes
clients awarding the pressure pumping; and in the sense of pressure pumping with BJ legacy clients, giving us the rest
of the services. So I think we're just really starting to get into our stride.
<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Okay. And then I know you guys have had some placements of the In-Tallic product, and
you talked a little bit about OptiPort. Just from a conceptual standpoint, would you expect the penetration of those
products to have an impact on coil tubing demand in the Lower 48?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: A lot of the OptiPort is more Canadian than it is Lower 48. There is very little of that is
done in the Lower 48. So I think it would be more of a question of what could happen on the Canada side.

As the In-Tallic balls come on, clearly once you get to the point you're dissolving or decomposing the ball, and
eventually the inserts or the seats have taken those chokes out of there, it's a pretty efficient system.
<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Okay, so there would be less requirement for a standby coil at that point?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Possibly, yes.
<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Okay.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: But we're sold out of coil tubing units, so we can put them to work elsewhere.
<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Okay, that's good to hear. And finally, it looks like you've broken a little bit of a logjam in
Angola with some contract wins. Could we expect to see more activity there for you guys going forward?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Let's be patient here. They were a couple of nice wins. They're small, but it's a step in the
right direction, as Martin said. It's going the right way, so I wouldn't count on Angola being a big 2011 play for us right
now.
<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Okay, fair enough. That does it for me, thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lamotte with Guggenheim Partners.
<Q - Michael K. Lamotte>: Thanks, good morning, everybody.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael K. Lamotte>: Martin, if I could just follow up with you quickly on the U.S. and some cleanups on
pressure pumping, where do we stand vis-à-vis 24/7 operations?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a good question. I expected that. We're not where we want to be. And again, it's a
capacity constrained. It's opportunity rich. Several of our bases are running 24 hours, but not very many, and it's really
a question of staffing at this stage. We're ramping up as quickly as we can. The market opportunity is there. The
customers are willing. But we're probably – I don't know. Maybe 10% to 20% of our fleet is able to accomplish that at
this stage.
<Q - Michael K. Lamotte>: Okay. And then in terms of the head count, if I think about moving towards 24/7 and
adding as much horsepower as you are over the next three quarters, are you seeing any challenges or difficulties on the
hiring front and any wage pressure that we should be mindful of?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think yes. I think that's the reality, is that there is wage inflation. But as we said, later
we're able to get that back in the pricing. It's really the attraction of the talent. And we're all out there hiring as
vigorously as we can, Michael. But yes, staffing these and staffing them right is the challenge, and we're all faced with
it.
<Q - Michael K. Lamotte>: And what's the non-productive time on a new recruit? How long does it take to get them
generating revenue?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: It depends on the individual, of course. On the engineer front, it can be pushing close to
nine months to a year. And then on let's say the more conventional labor, it's probably 60 days.
<Q - Michael K. Lamotte>: Okay, great. Thanks, Martin.

And our next question comes from the line of Steven Gengaro with Jefferies & Company.
<Q - Stephen D. Gengaro>: Thanks, good morning. Look back to the international margin question. When you laid
out the plan, looking at your goals, you're 700 basis points through your 1,000 basis points of margin improvement
already. And my sense from conversations at your conference with Art was the supply chain was really going to kick
in, in the second half of the year; I guess two parts to the question. One, are you surprised internally how good the
quarter that you just reported was? And B), if you were, how should we think about maybe the upside to those targets?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I wouldn't say that we were shocked at how good the quarter was. I made the comment
that I think we were pleased that our cost controls were a little better than what we anticipated, which was a nice
benefit. But I think we had said in the last call that we felt that the first quarter was going to be an improvement and a
step. And I think we even said in the last call that Q2 was probably not going to be the next inflection point. There
would be a little bit of improvement, but we would really see the inflection point come Q3 – Q4.
So yes, we're happy with the quarter, especially on the cost front. I think our supply chain has not changed. I'll let
Martin comment on this; it reports to him. But I think the supply chain is doing what we anticipate. It's like, I think,
every service company out there right now, probably pretty stretched and working hard. But we expect the benefits to
really start showing up Q3 – Q4 on the supply chain side. Martin, do you want to make a comment?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes, Stephen. On the supply chain, it gets back to the whole reorganization that we
triggered two years ago next month. We wouldn't have had the capability to do any of what we're doing on the supply
chain had we not made that reorganization. And yet, this is probably not the market environment you want to be
rewiring your entire supply chain in terms of the buoyancy we see in the market. But we are in a state of flux. And I'm
real happy, real happy with the job that our people are doing out there on the manufacturing front, the logistics front,
the sourcing front to keep us where we are. And your comment about this thing being more back-loaded in the second
half and into '12 is right. But we're on schedule on the supply chain side.
And then in terms of your comment about were we surprised, I'll follow up on Chad. No, this is why we pulled the
trigger two years ago was to get closer to our customer, to have an integrated approach in solving the problems. And
we told everybody at the analyst conference that the reorganization is done, and we're executing on what we've
committed to. So this is what we expected to make happen, and we still see a lot more coming.
<Q - Stephen D. Gengaro>: Directionally, we weren't surprised. The magnitude is what we were surprised by. When
you look at the three geographic regions internationally, is there any commentary you can give us as far as how they –
any materially better or worse than the others as we move through the rest of the year as far as progress?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I think you'll see continued improvement in the Middle East. The Middle East came back
strongly in Q1. Asia had its challenges, which you've heard from everybody that has reported before regarding weather
and everything. And Asia is probably a tougher pricing front right now than about anywhere internationally we have.
But I think Middle East is going to do well.
I think we've turned the corner, knock on wood, in Africa. We've taken it back now from where it was hurting us on the
negative side to contributing. I think Latin America in the second half will continue to improve. And Europe will do
better in the second half. So I think with the exception of Asia right now, everyone is going in the right direction. And
Asia, by the end of the year, I think you'll see with the tightness of equipment and people, et cetera, you'll start seeing
that improvement in Asia.
<Q - Stephen D. Gengaro>: Great, thank you.

<Q - Ole Slorer>: Thank you very much.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Hello, Ole.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Back to the rather impressive international margin expansion, would it be fair to say that because
this wasn't volume driven, given that your sequential revenue was down very modestly, was this then all to do with
costs? And your system, is it not fully in place? There is no more incremental to be collected there in the second
quarter. Is that the way to understand it?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I think you're pretty close to that. There won't be a lot of incremental on the cost side to
collect in the second quarter, correct.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Also, you had Latin America sequentials up 440 basis points; Europe up just under 400; Middle
East/Asia 160; some very impressive numbers there. Was there anything that was a one-off or light on startup costs that
will come back in the second quarter? Was there anything unusual that will swing the other way? Did you borrow
anything from the second quarter anywhere?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I think the big one, and Peter already hit it. The big one is Canada. And...
<Q - Ole Slorer>: I'm talking international first.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I consider Canada international.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: North America, okay; not North America.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: No, we didn't have anything that was big on ramp up. I think what also probably helped
us quite a bit, we did have a lot of cost when we moved in to quote two of the drilling units into Saudi. These were two
big investments to get in there. That's done. They're up in running and doing extremely well right now and contributing.
Iraq, we had some startup costs last year. But a lot of what we're doing in Iraq is more along the workover. And we
may have some things depending on awards coming forward that we'll do, but that's probably more of a Q3 event. So
no, I don't think there is anything that was one-off. Martin, do you have...
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Ole, I'd say to your comment on Latin America, Mexico was a real problem for us in the
latter part of last year. And stabilizing that patient helped a lot this quarter.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: And looking forward into the next quarter, Martin, is there anything that you see that will be a
lumpy startup cost or some other unusual item that sequentially could depress margins in any region?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Nothing comes to mind. But this business, given the scale and the scope of where all the
places we are, it's possible. But honestly, nothing comes to mind at this stage.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: The only area could be Russia on a couple IO-type projects that we've been awarded. But
I don't think they'll be huge, Ole.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay. So turning back to North America, you highlighted that just under 25% of your sales to
Canada in terms of benefit from a seasonally very strong market. Yet, at 19.6% margin, you came in 400 or 500 basis
points maybe below the benchmark amongst the large-cap peers that you have. And the pure-play pressure pumping
rental tool companies are knocking at margins in the high 20%s. So does that then suggest that your U.S. business is
significantly underperforming? And is that just a matter of having old equipment, and that will improve when you get
new equipment? Or is there something else that underlying should improve rapidly, more rapidly?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yes, I think there are a couple things there, Ole. One is weather clearly hurt us. We were
just sold out, especially in the pressure pumping area. When they came back, we weren't able to make up that
difference for the couple weeks that we lost. So that was a big one. The other one is, keep in mind. In fact, one of the
things that we said is that we wanted to have leading margins through the cycle.

<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: And part of that will mean because of our – we've got a significant part of our North
American revenue that does come from the production side, the ESPs and the chemicals. And those will never – you'll
never see the margin improvement because rig count goes up quickly in those two areas. But I think also you'll see U.S.
land bounce back very nicely in Q2 with much stronger margins, which will put us more back in that hunt. If you break
it out on D&E and pressure pumping versus production type chemicals, ESPs, et cetera, our drilling, our logging, our
pressure pumping margins I think are as strong as anybody's.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: So the momentum going into the second half of the year is going to be on the D&E and on the
production side on the ESPs? Is that the next leg to the story on margin in North America?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I think when you'll see the next point of leading through the cycle is when you see,
eventually, if the rig count goes down or pressure pumping becomes very competitive. And the chemical and ESP side
of the business will stay very strong, and it will help us hold our margins better than perhaps some of the pure-play
pressure pumping companies and others.

And our next question comes from the line of Matt Conlan from Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew D. Conlan CFA>: Ole touched on what I was looking for as well on North America. So you're saying
that the margin underperformance versus your competitors is mostly a mix issue on your total product lines?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yes, I think it is a mix issue. I don't think it's a one-quarter mix issue. I think it's a mix
issue in the North American business.
<Q - Matthew D. Conlan CFA>: Okay. And within that mix, are the Canadian operations, which are stronger than we
could have expected going in, are they inherently lower margin than the U.S. business at this point in the cycle?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: No, not necessarily. The Canadian also has a huge chemical and ESP side of its business
with all the heavy oil and tar sands and other things up in the mining area.
<Q - Matthew D. Conlan CFA>: Okay. So that's disproportionate on the mix issue?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yes, that's fair to say.
<Q - Matthew D. Conlan CFA>: Okay. And quickly just on Mexico, you said it's stabilized there. But within that
stabilization, was it a little bit worse or a little bit better than last quarter?

faster than we would have expected. Could you just talk about the current size of that market for Baker and just maybe
the potential two or three years from now? When does that become an important driver of results?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: All in all, it's a very small part of our business now, but I think you've hit it on the head.
In time, it's going to be a significant player. But I think you've got to look at it by region. For instance, I think Eastern
Europe will have some logistic issues and challenges in order to get its shale-type plays put together. It's going to take
some time, quite a bit of time, I think, to develop that. Right now, it's mainly in clients trying to understand exactly
what they have, do some drillings or vertical drillings, some basic fracs and things to try to see what's there.
China is probably going to be the area that takes off. With the Chinese demand and thirst for energy, and you know that
they will not have a problem running pipelines across country or wherever else in order to transport this gas. We've
been quite successful in China on our unconventionals. We were recently by a major Chinese oil company there, we
were awarded two big fields for their high-end technology support services. Anything that has to do with things like
premium FracPoint and so on and horizontal drilling the completions, it becomes complicated and we get called in. So
we like our position in China.
I think the other interesting area is Argentina, where there seems to be a lot of push right now. The other area is still sits
in the Middle East, where the Saudi Aramco is going to be looking at six different areas or six rigs to look at shale gas
in the kingdom. And I just got back from Oman, meeting with the Minister of Petroleum there. And they talk about
their oil shale potential that they have that they're looking at developing. So it's starting take off internationally just like
it did about four years ago for the gas side in the U.S. And now we're starting to see some of the oil interest
internationally.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Hey Doug, this is Martin. Let me just follow up on Chad's comment about infrastructure.
Recently, we were in discussions with a pretty big operator in Argentina. And to spec out a job, should it ever occur,
say of what is typical in the Eagle Ford, it would have taken us all of our horsepower and our two big competitors on
the location together. And that's the limitation that's out there on some of this frac capacity. So the opportunity is there,
but I think we're talking years of evolution for it to get meaningful.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: That said, say in three years, could it be something we start seeing show up in the numbers,
or is that still too short a time period?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think every number is important, every dollar we make. So is it going to show up? You
bet. But is it going to become something that's, again, like North America? No, not for a couple of years, I don't think.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay, and then just a quick one on the UK North Sea. The North Sea has generally been a
strong market for Baker Hughes. The tax increase has gotten a lot of attention. Is that something you expect to have an
impact on your business?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Our guys say they don't think that will have an impact until 2012, so we're not worried
about it in 2011.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: But it will have an impact in 2012.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Fair enough, thank you.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: You bet.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brad Handler with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks, good morning, guys.

<Q - Brad Handler>: Maybe I can draw you out, please, on the Eastern Hemisphere revenue side. The revenue
number was stronger than we were looking at. You mentioned Iraq progress. But nevertheless, if I think about that in
the context if your two big competitors, it really was a lot stronger. So were there some areas that you can help us out
with that also showed some nice sequential revenue progression in the Eastern Hemisphere?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yes, I think a couple come to mind: Abu Dhabi, Saudi. Russia did a little better than I
think we were expecting for the quarter revenue. What else Martin, can you think of anything else off the top of your
head? Eastern Hemisphere, obviously if you throw in Latin America, Brazil did well.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Central Europe was strong.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yes, Central Europe was up. And I just don't think we were hit as hard in Asia, perhaps,
as some of the competitors. And Australia...
<Q - Brad Handler>: Right.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: ...that probably helped us.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Right, that makes sense. Was the sequential, the year end completion and wireline sales that you
historically enjoy in the fourth quarter, was the down dip a little smaller than it has been in some years?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: We haven't sold a lot of wireline equipment for several years now. We stopped that quite
a while ago.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: There were no wireline sales in the quarter.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: That's not something that has affected us for several years.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Only the completions and artificial lift.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Got you. Okay, all right. That's helpful, an unrelated follow-up then, please. Can you speak to
some of the pricing progression in the North American market away from pressure pumping? Some of your peers have
been talking about a bit of a broadening, if you will, getting some pricing in some other product lines. I'd just
appreciate your comments on that.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yes, we've seen some price improvement in completions, especially in the premium type
FracPoint extended reach in our longer well completions. Drilling services, directional MWD/LWD [Measurement
While Drilling/Logging While Drilling] is seeing improvement. We're seeing some in drilling fluids, a little bit in
chemicals and ESPs. And bits and the wireline side have basically been flat this last quarter. So we're seeing a trend in
almost all of the product lines. We're seeing a little improvement.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Bits, you're getting some improvement; wireline is flat. Did I get that right?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Bits basically flat in Q1. We didn't see much price improvement in bits.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: And keep in mind, the shale drilling is not as good for the bit businesses as perhaps some
of the verticals or classic sands or other type areas. So you don't do as well on shale in bits as you do other areas.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Sure, that makes sense. But just for perspective, so you saw some pricing in Q1. Were you also
seeing some pricing in Q4, or is this market a bit of an inflection in some of those of the products, like the drilling
service products you just mentioned in fluids?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: We saw some pricing in Q4 in drilling services.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay.

<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I think we're seeing a little bit. In Q1, we were we're seeing some changes in drilling
fluids and the ESPs chemical side.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay, got it, thank you. And then if you think about where things are headed, do you see the
tightness continuing across the service lines? Pricing potential still pretty good, you think?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I do. And I think in a couple areas, we're going to have to have it. For instance in
chemicals, a lot of our feedstock and a lot of our raw materials on the chemical side are hydrocarbon related, so some
of our customers are also our suppliers. And they're not shy in terms of cranking up their price to us right now on the
chemical side.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Right.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: So we're going to have to – we've got some inflation happening now that we're going to
have to pass on. Yes, I think we'll see some pricing improvement that.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay, got it. Thanks for the answers, gentlemen.
