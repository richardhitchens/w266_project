MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, for introductions and opening comments, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor
Relations, Miss Paula Waters. Please go ahead.
Paula Waters
Good morning. And thank you for joining us. We will begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and
CEO, Wayne Leonard, and then Leo Denault, our CFO, will review results. In an effort to accommodate everyone with
questions this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two questions.
As part of today's conference call, Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and
uncertainties and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in
the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC
filings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Wayne.

Thanks, Paula. Good morning, everyone. The theme of our 2011 annual report to stakeholders is adapting to a changing
world. Given the schedules involved for design and illustration, each year we must select our theme four to five months
in advance of production and distribution. As it turns out, the selection now looks like we had foreknowledge of what
was to come. It would be, except in Philosophy 101 you learn two things on day one. The first is the beginning of all
wisdom is to know thyself. The second is the only constant in life is change.
For some time we've been communicating to you our plans and initiatives to address risk or uncertainties, and given
our strengths and limitations, to adapt to the coming realities that we are now facing.
Today I will update you where we stand and will provide a context for our accomplishments and our challenges.
Starting with one of our key utility initiatives, the proposal for each of the utility operating companies to join a regional
transmission organization, specifically the Midwest Independent System Operator, or MISO. Events continue to move
us closer to achieving that goal. In a significant development last week, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
issued its order conditionally accepting MISO's tariff provisions regarding cost allocation for transmission projects
upon Entergy's transition into the MISO RTO.
Just to remind you, last September, FERC denied MISO's request for a tariff waiver to implement this same proposal.
However, FERC noted in its order that it was not making any findings on the merits of the proposal at that time. The
request for the tariff waiver was just the wrong procedural vehicle to implement the proposal.
In the April 19 ruling on the merits, FERC found that it was just and reasonable for MISO and its existing transmission
owners to agree to establish a transition period to ensure that no entity must bear the cost of transmission facilities from
which it has not been shown to benefit, consistent with traditional cost causation principles.
Prior to this FERC ruling on March 16, Entergy Arkansas reached a settlement with its Arkansas co-owners and its
coal-generating plants, including Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation, one of the interveners in the FREC
proceeding. The settlement regards how the plants will operate after Entergy Arkansas integrates into MISO.
This agreement extends the benefits of MISO participation to all co-owner utilities if the Arkansas Public Service
Commission approves the Entergy Arkansas proposal to join MISO. In line with Entergy Arkansas, these groups
represent 80% of all Arkansas Electric customers in the state.
In addressing other concerns, utilities have agreed to give the Entergy regional state committee, upon unanimous vote,
the authority to direct the operating companies to add projects within the Entergy region to MISO's transmission
expansion plan during the five-year transition period after the Entergy utilities join MISO. This arrangement is
designed to address concerns expressed by regulators. FERC's recent decision on transmission cost allocations along
with the additional authority to add projects to help address the stated concerns by MISO and provide a wider path for
the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and for a seamless and successful integration and the realization of up to
$1.4 billion of projected net customer savings over 10 years.
These projected customer benefits derive from joining an RTO with substantial scale and a mature Day 2 market. As
you know, Day 2 refers to an RTO that includes day-ahead and real-time energy markets and uses market-based
mechanisms to manage congestion. A Day 2 market brings about efficiencies by using one central unit commitment
and dispatch based on the economics of transmission and generation resources. MISO has one in place today, SPP does
not, although it has plans to.
Even assuming SPP will get there, further independent third-party analysis has recently undercut the arguments of
those who have opposed our proposed move to MISO. In a study prepared by the Charles Rivers Associates for SPP,
SPP is the one that commissioned the study, CRA estimates that SPP members would receive $22 million in trade
benefits over the 10-year span from 2013 through 2022 as a result of the Entergy and Cleco regions entry into MISO.
Not only that, this study projects that those same SPP members would see an increase in net production costs of $17
million if the Entergy and Cleco regions joined SPP instead. At the retail jurisdictions in testimony filed in March in
Louisiana, all parties except SPP conditionally support or do not oppose at least the move of us to MISO. Hearings are
scheduled to begin next week in Louisiana and at the end of May in Arkansas, with potential decisions coming in the
summer.

Regulatory proceedings are also underway or will be soon, in Mississippi, New Orleans, and Texas. Based on the
established procedural schedules, or in the case of Texas, a 180-day requirement, we currently anticipate having final
decisions on our MISO proposal in all retail jurisdictions by the end of the third quarter or early in the fourth. Of
course, joining an RTO is critical to our transaction with ITC Holdings to completely separate Entergy transmissions
business through a spin-off and subsequent merger.
Joining MISO is an incremental step in improving our business model, but the ITC transaction is transformational,
offering customers and other stakeholders the opportunity to benefit from complete independence, the advantages of
scale, and at the same time greater focus. Over the past three months we have continued our outreach efforts in
conjunction with ITC to obtain the input and perspective of our regulators and other stakeholders. With the benefit of
greater understanding from these discussions, we are preparing to make initial retail regulatory filings beginning around
mid-year.
As I've said before, we fully intend for those filings to further explain our view that spinning off and merging our
transmission business with an independent transmission company of the caliber of ITC provides a solid platform for the
future. There are no perfect solutions to any long-term issues of public policy. There are, however, options. Sometimes
the idea is simply bold and exciting, but the potential for success is huge leap of faith with enormous risk. Sometimes
the idea is simply one whose time has come; the potential and logic are compelling and success is highly likely. We
believe this is clearly the latter of the two.
On balance, we will ask regulators to consider the net benefits of the transaction. On the one hand, gaining an
independent transmission company in a footprint where, even without de-regulation, the merchant capacity is almost
half the size of the regulated capacity in the region and whose sole focus is transmission versus, on the other hand, the
change in jurisdiction as a result of the spin/merge.
Initiation of processes related to other key approvals will follow. The target to close the transaction remains in 2013.
Our incoming Group President of Utility Operations, Theo Bunting, has been instrumental in developing the regulatory
plan we are now executing. He will take over the top utility spot on June 1 from Gary Taylor, who announced his
retirement earlier this year.
Gary is on his last earnings call today, which he just reminded me of, and he will certainly be missed. But I know he
would tell you that he is turning the utility over to very capable hands. Theo, who is on the call with us this morning as
well, currently serves as Entergy's Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. In his 20-plus years at Entergy,
he's had broad-based experience ranging from strategic and financial planning, regulatory strategy and risk
management, to operational support areas including customer service. He was the obvious choice.
Next, I will briefly recap some other developments. In Mississippi, the annual formula rate plan filing was made in
March for the 2011 test-year period. The evaluation report reflected an earned return on equity of 10.92%, within the
performance adjusted bandwidth; therefore, no change in rates.
In Louisiana, the Public Service Commission approved Entergy Louisiana and Gulf States Louisiana's application for
the Ninemile 6 project on March 21. As you'll recall, earlier this year the New Orleans City Council authorized Entergy
New Orleans' participation.
Ninemile 6 is a 550 megawatt new, modern, state-of-the-art, natural gas-fired combined-cycle plant to be built on an
existing Entergy Louisiana site. With regulatory approvals in hand, Entergy Louisiana issued full notice to proceed on
the construction of Ninemile 6. The new plant is expected to go in service in the first part of 2015.
As you know, we disclosed in the fall of 2010 that we had received a civil investigative demand by the U.S.
Department of Justice to investigate competitive issues concerning certain generation procurement, dispatch, and
transmission system practices and policies of the utility operating company. Due to the confidential nature of this
matter, I am limited on what I can say today. All I can say, or more accurately, all they will let me say, is that it remains
outstanding and we believe the documentation we've provided to the DOJ demonstrates that our practices and policies
have been appropriate and consistent with regulatory orders and industry practices.

With respect to our announced acquisitions of the Hinds and Hot Spring facilities, the parties have satisfied their
obligations under the Hart-Scott-Rodino act but the DOJ is still reviewing the transaction. I do not know if the
complexities of our discussions with DOJ will affect the timing of DOJ's review of the Hot Springs and Hinds
transaction. Obviously we don't think it should, but you should be aware of that possibility. Also with utility, I'm proud
to report that once again, for the 14th consecutive year, Entergy was recognized with leadership in storm restoration.
This year we won both Edison Electric Institute's Emergency Recovery and Emergency Assistance Awards.
The 2012 hurricane season starts June 1 and happily, predictions call for a contained season, but of course it only takes
one. Should a severe storm strike, we will be prepared as always. At Entergy Wholesale Commodities, the Vermont
Yankee nuclear plant entered the period of extended operation under its renewed Nuclear Regulatory Commission
20-year license on March 22. Three days before that, rulings by the Federal District Court and the Vermont Public
Service Board provided the clarity we'd requested; that VY would continue to operate while legal and regulatory
proceedings are pending.
The Vermont Attorney General and the Vermont Department of Public Service have stated their agreement with that,
and the Vermont Public Service Board has acknowledged this reality even if they don't agree. On April 16, we filed our
amended petition for a Certificate of Public Good for continued operations required by the Vermont Public Service
Board in their order to resume the proceeding in a new docket.
Vermont Yankee's continued operation supports the public good through employment, taxes, and other sources of
government revenue to Vermont, which together with the multiplier effect, offer substantial economic benefits to the
state. Continued operation also provides for a potential sharing of revenues, offering value and protection against
higher energy prices in the future.
The Public Service Board has scheduled a status conference for May 2, which may shed some light on the timeline.
Concurrently, [indiscernible] (13:35) Vermont's appeal of the January District Court decision to the Second Circuit
Court of Appeals in New York are likely to extend through most of 2012, assuming each fight takes its maximum
allotted time.
That said, a decision is not expected until well into 2013. At Pilgrim, just a few days ago, the NRC staff issued a
memorandum asking the NRC Commissions to authorize issuance of the – Pilgrim's renewed license. A response was
requested of the commissioners on their recommendation by May 8.
Staff specifically noted that although a new late-filed contention has been referred to the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, or ASLB, when an appeal of an ASLB decision is pending before the commission, the NRC is not compelled to
await exhaustion of those appeals before renewing the operating license. This represents an important step. That said,
though, the commission has requested a decision from the ASLB on admissibility of the new late contention by no later
than May 29. That said, the state may wait until that date before taking any action.
With the license expiration date of June 8 just around the corner, we're not there yet. But in any event, the NRC's timely
renewal doctrine would apply to allow continued operation if the proceedings extend past June 8. We continue to
believe none of the items identified should preclude issuance of Pilgrim's license renewal through 2032.
Regarding Indian Point, NRC and state proceedings related to license renewal remains ongoing, but we know you've
been following with interest Governor Cuomo's Energy Highway Initiative which has brought more attention to Indian
Point. First of all, this initiative is very preliminary. In the preliminary meetings to date, the state of New York has not
expressed a goal of closing Indian Point. That is either good legal advice or good common sense. Instead, the New
York administration has identified the uncertainty regarding continued operation in light of other proceedings,
specifically license renewal and related state water quality proceedings.
The continued operation of Indian Point advances New York's stated goals and objectives and directly provides high
value jobs to more than 1,000 workers in the state of New York. Indian Point's continued operation is essential to
achieving environmental sustainability, affordable energy, and long-term reliability electric systems. Those benefits
were described and quantified in last summer's independent Charles River Associates report prepared for New York
City's Environmental Protection Department.

In other developments regarding Indian Point, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision on
damage claims against the U.S. Department of Energy for its breach of obligations regarding the spent fuel disposal
contract for Indian Point Units 1 and 2. Assuming no further appeals are filed, EWC could receive cash payments
estimated to be in the range of $100 million in the next several months.
For our other nuclear plants, damage claims for DOE's failure to begin disposal of spent fuel in 1998 are at various
stages of planning or litigation. While we had a number of tactical and strategic successes during the quarter, financial
results were negatively impacted by a number of items, resulting in a decision our 2012 operational earnings range
even though it is still early in the year.
In a few minutes Leo will review the details. As he does, keep in mind that in our view the underlying issues are either
not new or are non-cash or in some cases, both. First, financial results in the quarter were negatively impacted by
unseasonably mild temperatures this winter, a reversal of the colder-than-normal weather of the past two years. To put
it in perspective, the southern region had the third-warmest first quarter in 118 years of record-keeping.
In fact, Arkansas and Mississippi set a record for the warmest March over that same time period, with Louisiana and
Texas not far behind, at third and sixth warmest, respectively. In the context of long-term valuation, credit cannot be
given for the highs and lows, of course, of weather. But nevertheless, the bottom line is we're out $32 million of cash
after-tax due to the weather.
Another fact reflected in our revised 2012 earnings outlook is the impact of historically low interest rates and the
termination of pension expense. As we discussed in our last earnings call in January, final pension expense assumptions
were different than what we assumed in setting guidance. The discount rate was overestimated and we later received
updated information on other pension assumptions.
Finally, the two charges for the Vermont Yankee impairment and the regulatory asset write-off are non-cash in nature.
In the case of the regulatory asset, customer rates were unaffected by the change – by the charge, I'm sorry. Rather, we
had an asset recorded on our financial books under an accounting method that goes back to the Gulf States acquisition
in the mid-'90s that was simply overstated. For Vermont Yankee, whatever you believe about the value of the plant,
that should not have changed because of the impairment charge.
The impairment test, as the accountants refer to it, is a valuation that has been consistently performed and disclosed by
us since the state actions necessitated it in 2010. The ramifications of this low natural gas price environment is not
unique to Vermont Yankee, but the key for us was where there has been a triggering event requiring an impairment
evaluation as in the case of Vermont Yankee. Due to Vermont Yankee's unique position in the courts, it's accounting
valuation requires consideration of all potential outcomes resulting in a value that is discounted for the legal
uncertainties.
This impairment reflects the result at March 31 of applying the accounting rules applicable to VY utilizing our best
judgment in consultation with our external accounting advisers who have also been involved in other past accounting
valuations. This charge does not reflect a change in Entergy's point of view on the legal and state regulatory
proceedings, nor on the accounting value of the plant based upon our point of view assuming it operates for another 20
years.
In any event, we could try to excuse the accounting issues as basically non-cash or nonrecurring, but it's our job to
deliver the results you expect and clearly we didn't. That does not mean we've given up or thrown in the towel on 2012.
We will continue to work to meet or even exceed our original earnings guidance, but the numbers just aren't there right
now. With natural gas and power prices continuing to fall and gas inventories overflowing, as well as a full agenda of
regulatory and legal challenges at the utility and EWC, it sometimes seems the news is all negative. It's not.
The Board of Directors and management team are focused on adapting to the world as it is and as it will be, not how we
wish it to be. There are ever new challenges, but there will be opportunities that come along with those changes. For the
example, initiatives like the MISO proposal and the ITC spin/merge transactions create real benefits for our customers
and other stakeholders and reflect our first rule – know thyself. The structure delivers value we simply cannot do on our

own. There are other similar opportunities.
Commodity prices have a long history of volatility. With today's bearish natural gas price levels, which are likely to
persist in the near term, we're closely examining options to manage through this down cycle and at the same time
prepare the business to capitalize on the options when markets improve. But I should be clear about that. While the
current low prices do not appear sustainable the old days of double-digit natural gas prices do not appear to be realistic
either. For the economy, for jobs, for the environment, for customers, for sustainable growth, abundant natural gas at
moderate prices creates a promising future. And while low prices may not be the best news for Entergy's merchant
fleet, we will adapt. This brings me to the second rule, change is constant. But we will continue adapting, not to losing,
but to new ways of doing business and creating more flexibility, agility, and greater options.
And now I will turn the call over to Leo.
Leo P. Denault
Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover first-quarter 2012 financial results,
our cash performance for the quarter, 2012 earnings guidance, and some closing remarks. Slide two summarizes first
quarter as recorded in operational earnings results and slide three outlines the major factors that drove the
quarter-on-quarter results.
First, I'll cover the two special items for the quarter. These two items are included in as-reported results but are
excluded from operational results. One special item is for expenses incurred in connection with the proposed spin-off
and merger of Entergy's transmission business which we announced in December. Spending on our spin/merge
initiative reduced earnings per share by $0.04 in the quarter; $0.03 at the utility and the balance at parent and other.
The other special item is for an asset impairment recorded at EWC for the Vermont Yankee asset. Under Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles, long-lived assets are typically accounted for on a historical basis unless a triggering
event occurs which requires an impairment evaluation. For Vermont Yankee, the initial triggering event was in early
2010 when the Vermont Senate voted down a bill that would have allowed the Public Service Board to consider VY's
application for a Certificate of Public Good.
The vote raised questions regarding the operation of the plant through 2032. As a result of this vote and ongoing efforts
by the state to shut down Vermont Yankee early, the plant has been evaluated for impairment under the accounting
rules every quarter since the first quarter of 2010. The accounting rules call for a two-step process. First, the book value
of the asset is compared to an estimate of future undiscounted, or nominal, net cash flows expected to result from
ownership of that asset. If the cash flows are equal to or higher than the book value of the plant, no impairment is
indicated and the test is complete. Cash flow estimates consider future operating expenses and future market prices as
well as the availability of the asset.
The impairment analysis compares the carrying value of the asset to probability-weighted expected cash flows
measured at the end of each quarterly period. As you might expect, a key driver for cash flow estimates is forward
prices. For impairment analysis, we have consistently used observable market prices where available. As you all know,
at March 31 those prices declined significantly, which produced a different result this quarter.
Because the undiscounted cash flows were less than the book value of the plant, we then performed step two of the
analysis, which compared the book value of the assets to the fair value as of March 31, 2012. Fair value is typically
determined using discounted cash flows. Because the fair value of the plant was less than the book value, an
impairment charge of $356 million pre-tax, or $1.26 per share after tax, was recorded to reflect the fair value of the
plan. The write down represented approximately 70% of the book value of the assets and was allocated pro-rata
between plants, construction work in progress, fuel, and deferred refueling outage costs. While accounting details help
to understand the actual impairment entry, there are a few points that I'd like to emphasize.
To repeat a key point Wayne made earlier, the impairment does not reflect a change in our view of the legal and state
regulatory proceedings and the overall economic value of Vermont Yankee, assuming we win and operate for 20 more

years. Also the impairment derives from the unique legal and state regulatory processes surrounding Vermont Yankee,
which make it uncertain that the plant will operate until the license expires in 2032. Absent this uncertainty, the
evaluation for impairment would not have been required.
The Vermont Yankee impairment naturally raises questions about our other non-utility nuclear plants. However,
Vermont Yankee is unique for the reasons I noted earlier. As we sit here today, no triggering event has occurred for any
of EWC's other nuclear plants, so no evaluation is required or planned. However, even if we had evaluated EWC's
other nuclear plants using our current operating assumptions and the March 31 price assumptions, an impairment would
not have been required.
Now let's turn to operational results. Slide three summarizes the major drivers for operational earnings. Utility results
were lower than a year ago due primarily to higher income tax expense, lower net revenue, and higher non-fuel
operation and maintenance expense.
Utility income tax expense was higher due to a non-cash write-off of a regulatory asset associated with income taxes. I
won't repeat the same points that Wayne made in his remarks, but there are a few details that I'd like to note, primarily
on the accounting aspect of this issue.
During the quarter, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana determined that its regulatory asset for income taxes was overstated
because of the difference between the regulatory and accounting treatment of certain income tax items, primarily those
associated with pension expense.
In the regulatory construct, there are two methods for determining how much income tax expense are included in
customer rates: normalization and flow-through. At a very high level, normalization follows GAAP income tax
expense, while flow-through follows income tax payment. While normalization is typically the preferred method, some
jurisdictions do use flow-through for various items.
EGSL's retail rates were developed using the normalization method, but the financial accounting assumed that rates
were being set using the flow-through method, which had actually been the case prior to the GSU merger. As a result,
EGSL's accumulated regulatory assets for future recovery of income tax expenses that were already being recovered in
rates. The normalized method has been appropriately applied to the income taxes associated with pension expense in
rate making. As a result, this adjustment has no impact on customer rates. The disconnect was in our financial
accounting assumption and the non-cash write-off aligns the regulatory asset with the regulatory treatment.
Utility net revenue was lower this quarter than a year ago, due largely to unfavorable weather in the current quarter
compared to favorable weather last year. As Wayne noted, weather was significantly warmer than normal this quarter.
Excluding the effects of weather, retail sales increased 3.3%, which was consistent with our expectations. Sales
volumes were higher across all customer classes. Industrial sales were up 4.6% as the positive effects of facility
expansions continued. Weather-adjusted residential sales increased 2.6%. Growth was particularly strong in the
Louisiana jurisdictions.
Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense also contributed to the lower earnings results. Higher O&M was
partly due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, which was driven by higher benefits costs. We noted on
our fourth quarter call in January that pension expense would be higher than planned due to a lower discount rate, as
well as other updated pension assumptions.
Utility also had higher fossil expenses due partly to the Acadia acquisition, which is offset by higher net revenue from
the rate action associated with that acquisition. Higher fossil outage expense also contributed to increased O&M, a
portion of which is considered timing.
Slide four summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of the current and previous year. This
quarter's operational adjusted EBITDA declined due primarily to lower net revenue and increased non-fuel operation
and maintenance expense. EWC's net revenue decreased compared to the first quarter of last year due to lower energy
pricing for its nuclear fleet. Prices were down for both contracted sales as well as power sold at market.

The average contracted price was $50 and the average price sold at market was approximately $30. The increased
generation from the nuclear fleet also contributed to the decline in net revenues. Billed sales were down less than 1%,
with slightly higher planned and unplanned outage days. Lower net revenue from the nuclear portfolio was partially
offset by increased net revenue from the non-nuclear assets, largely due to the RISEC plant acquired in late 2011.
Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses also contributed to the decrease in adjusted EBITDA. The
increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, which includes pension expenses.
Before we leave EWC, I'd like to mention one item in our earnings release. Starting this quarter we've expanded the
sold forward table to include details for EWC's non-nuclear plants. The additional information will provide details on
the energy and capacity sold, as well as expected net revenue for that portfolio at a point in time. Parent and other
operational results declined due to several individually insignificant items.
Slide five provides a recap of our cash flow performance for the quarter. Operating cash flow for the current quarter
was roughly $600 million, about $280 million higher than the same quarter last year. The increase was due to lower
pension funding and lower working capital requirements. These increases were partially offset by lower net revenue.
Slide six summarizes our 2012 operational earnings guidance, which we recently updated to $4.85-$5.65 per share.
Several items were considered in our revised guidance range, some of which we discussed on our last quarterly call.
Pension expense for the year will be higher than planned due to a lower discount rate and other updated assumptions.
Market power prices have continued to decline since our original guidance was issued. As of the end of the quarter,
average pricing for the unsold nuclear portfolio was $30 for the full year compared to $46 assumed in guidance.
Weather was significantly unfavorable in the current quarter. The regulatory asset write-off noted earlier also reduced
earnings.
Operating expenses at VY, specifically fuel, refueling outage, amortization and depreciation, will be lower going
forward as a result of the asset impairment. The ongoing effect for 2012 is estimated to be $0.14. This effect declines
over the next few years due to the effects of the write-down of the shorter lived fuel and deferred refueling outage
assets.
Slide seven provides details on the ongoing effects by category. Opportunities to offset some of the factors that have
gone against us so far include reductions in non-fuel operation and maintenance expense, lower than planned interest
expense based on financings completed to date, and potential income tax benefits incremental to the original plan. Our
updated 2012 as reported earnings guidance of $3.55 to $4.35 per share includes specials recorded through the first
quarter, but does not reflect any potential future expenses for the special item in connection with the proposed
spin/merge of Entergy's transmission business. As reported earnings guidance will be updated to reflect this special
item as actual costs are incurred throughout 2012.
Before we close, I'll provide some details on our recently completed credit facilities. On March 9, we completed new
five-year credit facilities totaling $4.15 billion for the parent company and four of the operating companies. Pricing
terms for the parent facility is LIBOR plus 175 basis points drawn and 27.5 basis points undrawn. These rates increase
from 2007 levels, but were in line with other recent utility transactions.
Circumstances like the spin/merge transaction announced with ITC last fall caused us to delay this financing longer
than we otherwise would have, though not by design or any attempts to time the market. The final turns achieved
reflected improved market conditions from the levels a year ago. In February 2011, estimated pricing was at 200 basis
points drawn and 30 basis points undrawn. Assuming $1.5 billion drawn, today's terms compared to a year-ago yield
approximately $4 million per year lower cost. Since Hurricane Katrina, we have obtained significant improvements in
our liquidity position. At the end of 2004 we had $1.6 billion in credit facilities and negative storm reserves. At the end
of the first quarter we have $4.3 billion in credit facilities, of which $2.8 billion is available.
We also have storm reserve escrow accounts in Louisiana, Mississippi, and New Orleans totaling $336 million. These
improvements give us confidence that we are prepared to quickly address a wide range of potential events that could
affect our liquidity, including storms. This is especially important as we move into the summer and hurricane season.
As we look ahead, we continue to work to create value for all of our stakeholders by focusing on both operational

excellence and portfolio management.
For operational excellence we manage our everyday costs and look for ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness
through continuous improvement efforts. All of our employees focus on safety and operational excellence to get
optimal performance from our assets. License renewal and legal efforts to ensure our ability to run our nuclear plants
through an extended license period is also a priority.
We also work to effectively communicate and demonstrate that our plants are safe, secure, and beneficial to the
communities they serve. We look for ways to provide benefits to our customers and sound investments that include
safety and reliability and improved efficiency. We also focus on risk management to understand the risks in our
business, such as the declining commodity price environment that we've seen over the past few years, and we look for
ways to mitigate those risks, such as new hedging strategies consistent with our point of view.
On portfolio management we create meaningful benefits in all of our businesses for our customers and other
stakeholders with initiatives like the effort to join MISO, which is projected to produce $1.4 billion in savings for our
utility customers over a 10-year period.
Our proposal to spin-off and merge the transmission business with ITC, an independent transco, will benefit customers
and other stakeholders with improvements in financial flexibility, operational excellence, and the independent and
transparent ITC model. EWC also explores ways to get the most out of its portfolio, such as we did with the RISEC
acquisition. We also look for ways to create other opportunities. We continue to take steps necessary to maintain
financial flexibility, as reflected in solid credit metrics and strong liquidity.
The bottom line is that the utility fundamentals are still strong, weather-adjusted sales were good, we have a
constructive investment program, and our strategic initiatives, like MISO and ITC, which will benefit our customers
and other stakeholders, are progressing. As Wayne said, it doesn't mean we won't work very hard to overcome these
near-term issues, it simply means that they are near term.
EWC is obviously a different story in today's price environment and all of the political issues, but we are also working
to preserve and enhance the value of that option through our regulatory strategy, operating model, and market-facing
activities. But in both cases our long-term strategies to manage risk, remain financially solid, and rationally grow the
businesses remain intact. Our management team is focused on accomplishing the goals we set out and to move us
towards our over-arching goal of creating and delivering sustainable long-term value to all of our stakeholders.
And now our senior team is available for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning, guys. How are you?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just in terms of the ITC transaction, I guess listening to ITC and what have you it sounds like
you guys are planning on doing a filing in the retail jurisdictions in the summer of this year. And I can't recall a
transaction in which it took that long between the announcement and the actual filings to take place. And I was just
wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what's going on there and how your conversations are going on
with the regulators.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: I'm going to let Gary Taylor, since this is his last call, get a chance to speak here.
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: Thanks, Wayne, I think. Actually, it's gone as we would have planned. Early on we talked
about the fact that it was very important for our regulators to focus on the RTO transition piece and then follow that up,

as there was more clarity with the transmission program through ITC. And that's what we've done. So if you look at the
timing, we wanted to make sure that all the hearings were done. They have all been scheduled and clearly those will be
completed this summer with a ruling from each of the commissions on an RTO.
The second part was that we wanted to also ensure that, many of the commissions have ex parte rules, and we wanted
to have meaningful conversations with each of them so when we made the filings this summer that they were complete
and addressed the concerns that they had. With that we're on schedule to do that, as Wayne has said, to meet our goal of
both transition to the RTO by December 2013 as well as supporting the closing of the deal with ITC by the middle of
2013 as well, so very much has been consistent. And as far as our regulators in general they've been very open, very
objective, and I think with what the staff has seen, this is a very logical way to address it.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: I'll just add one thing to that. Gary made a good point yesterday in that – I know you've all
– many of you have talked to the regulators. You've heard statements by the regulators. And if you go back to MISO,
where we were at in that process – and you were well down the road on MISO now, but the ITC, we're basically where
we were on MISO at this point in time with the regulators taking a wait-and-see approach, waiting to hear the
testimony, waiting to see exactly how we are going to address some of these issues. And that's their job. And on MISO,
once the numbers were put on the table, and they could see what the trade was, then it's been very positive ever since.
So maybe it appears a little slow coming out of the box, but we expect that once we make the filing that things will pick
up pretty fast.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And just in terms of the flexibility of the transaction, if one of the states, I mean, you're
dealing with a variety of states there, if one of the states pulls out, just simply says no, or objects I guess is a better way
to put it. How flexible are you guys in terms of dealing with that or any potential change, like a settlement, what have
you? How flexible is the transaction, do you think, in terms of dealing with that potential situation from developing?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Gary? I was just kidding, Gary, about that one.
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: Okay.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: I was going to give him all the questions today just as a surprise.
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: I'm surprised.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Leo, you want to take that?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Sure, sure. Paul, that's just not a place that we're going to go. We anticipate that we're going to
get – make the same case in every jurisdiction in terms of the benefits and that we'll get this done across the board.
Certainly there's considerations about the structure we picked and the transaction that we've struck. So it's not just a
regulatory approval of a rate case or something like that where we've got a lot of flexibility around our structuring of
this. We have a transaction to preserve and a structure of that transaction to preserve so there's really nothing I can
comment on there.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And just the middle of the next year is what we're thinking about still, here?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: There's a lot of discussion about that and what we've said is next year. It'd be nice if it was the
middle of the year. That's about as early as you could, I think, as you could reasonably project it could happen. But we
do expect it in next year, but I would hesitate to pick a time period at this point.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, thanks a lot. I'll let someone else ask questions.

Our next question comes from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, the categories have to do with the items that are part of the plant balance from an
accounting point of view. There's the plant itself, and that's the one that you can look at from a depreciation standpoint.
That's the value of the plant on the books that's depreciated every year. Since we took the impairment for a portion of
plant balance that will reduce depreciation expense going forward.
The deferred fuel or the fuel outage costs and the fuel itself also given the way outages work. If you think about it,
you're buying the fuel upfront and you have so much of it that comes out every cycle. And you have costs associated
with the fueling outage, get amortized over a period of time. Those are just shorter-lived assets.
So you allocate the impairment across the asset group of the fuel, the deferred outage costs, and the plant balance. Then
those will be ongoing as long those – what you've written off, you won't have to write off over the period of which
those would have been amortized. So the fuel and the outage costs have a short life. The plant, obviously, has a life
through the end of the license, so the depreciation expense goes down for the remainder of the life.
<Q - Leslie B. Rich>: Okay. And that's another 20 years because you have the NRC extension?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Correct. Correct.
<Q - Leslie B. Rich>: Ok, thank you.

Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien, your line is open.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Yes, hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Yes, we can
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. I'd be curious to get your perspective you mentioned it briefly earlier, on
the RFI in New York State regarding incremental transmission and power development. Just wanted to get, first, your
perspective on how these upgrades might change the need ultimately for Indian Point. Secondly, the timing of any such
outcomes. Again, you alluded to it, clearly it's sort of an initial look at potentially moving forward with these projects.
And finally what is your expectation of the outcome here? Clearly transmission and power upgrades being considered.
So I'll leave it to you guys.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: It's an excellent question. Certainly one that Rick, who's actually moved up to New York
and is very involved in, and John also we've and been following and been very involved in a lot of the details of what is
going on and what is likely to happen. So I'll let Rick kind of summarize where we come out on that one.
<A - Richard James Smith>: Okay, Julian, I mean, as you think about the Energy Highway objective, I mean, it's
everything that we think makes good sense for long-term utility planning. And I think you start with that. They're
looking at – they have a lot of generation up north, north of state, west of state that isn't fully utilized. A lot of wind
generation out west. And what they're looking at is trying to eliminate some of those constraints and try to give an
opportunity of some of that generation serving the lower part of the state.
And they're also looking at the long-term reliability of the electric system. And, as most states do in the Northeast, they
have a pretty aggressive policy around renewable generation, how that could be developed. So I think as it relates to
need, there's plenty of excess generation in the north and west and so that will drive a lot of transmission projects.
Makes a lot of sense also from – it's a little bit the intent of what the governor laid out, create more jobs. So you're
going to build a lot of transmission with their nuclear – their renewable portfolio out west looking at more sustainable,
environmentally-friendly generation. But two things that we think they've laid out as part of their intent is also to
maximize ratepayer value, adhere to market rules and procedures and maintain the overall reliability of the system.
I think that all plays well with the Indian Point unit, as has been laid out in the past; both the New York ISO, the CRA
study, Public Service Commission itself, Indian Point satisfies all those objectives very well. As it relates to timing, any

time you're – I mean, they're going through an RFI process. They just had another meeting about a week ago, I think it
was, and there's an expression of interest or supposed to be, filed by the end of May.
And then the task force is looking at potentially identifying some of those requests for interest to maybe take to the next
step, which would be they'd issue – and it won't be the task force. It's going to have to be, probably the utilities
themselves, request for proposals around particular projects. So as it relates to anything like that, that's going to take a
while to kind of work through that, work it back through the New York ISO process and the Public Service
Commission process. And then you eventually get to real projects, probably a couple years down the road. And I think
a lot of them probably will be transmission. So I think as the timing it's going to take a couple years to play out and I
think the outcome will be more transmission than generation. I think there is enough generation in the state it's just not
all in the optimum places.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Yeah, let me just – Rick could expand on it or even Mark could expand on that issue. From
a reliability standpoint, even though over the years we've developed – the industry's developed a number of devices that
can help, there is no replacement for local generation that is as good, if you're talking about reliability. You can have all
the energy, all the capacity, and when you're pushing it down wires, no matter how big they are, how many devices you
put on them, local generation is absolutely critical to maintain reliability. And this – you're talking about 2,000
megawatts optimally positioned in New York. And no plan that you're going to come up with is going to produce an
expected reliability level as good as one that includes Indian Point. It's just that simple.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. I appreciate the detail there. Maybe kind of looking a little bit, taking a
different direction, more directed towards Leo. I saw the refinancing in the quarter; January, obviously, taking some
more off the revolver. What is the expectation, as you stand here today, with regards to pushing more of that off the
revolver into long-term financing? Is it baked into your 2012? Is it another 2012 issuance or are we talking 2013 and
beyond at this point? And maybe, more structurally, are you looking to associate any kind of further refinancing with
any kind of transactions of any sort?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: As far as the parent company goes, if you go back in time prior to the spin-off announcement,
the nature of our term versus liquidity at the parent is pretty much in the same position now as it has been. So I
wouldn't expect major changes on that, all other things being equal, in terms of pushing more from the revolver to term
or anything like that. As it relates to transactions, when we look at the majority of the transactions that we've got teed
up – for example, the power plant acquisitions or even the ITC transactions, those are operating company financings.
So if you think about power plants at a specific jurisdiction, those jurisdictions do their own financing for those power
plants. And in the ITC transaction, when you think about the financing that we'll do associated with that separation, it
will be to alter the balance sheets to the right size of the operating companies themselves. So from a transactional
standpoint of anything that we've got out there right now, that's all related to the operating companies. And I think that
all other things being equal, the parent company's got the right mix of facility and term debt right now.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great, well, thank you very much for the time today.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Hi. Good morning. Wayne, you kind of mentioned this issue of the DOJ investigation
from a couple years ago and tied it into the Hinds transaction. Is it just the issue that those transactions need to be
approved by DOJ so that's how they might end up getting tied together?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Well, it's speculation and it's just speculating on logic in terms of you have one agency with
two things in front of them. And people sometimes tend to not want to let go of one until they see the outcome of the
other. We don't know that. All I'm trying to do is bring up the issue of we don't know really what's going on at DOJ and

whether they would somehow relate the two. We don't think they're related, but I wanted to make you aware of that
possibility that it could get delayed. Not necessarily because they are tied together, but because it's one agency with two
different things they're working on for one company.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah, okay. And then just secondly, on to New York, is there any schedule on the ruling
on the water treatment issues at Indian Point? Any update on the hearings for that, the wedge wire, the cooling towers?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Yeah, go ahead, Chuck.
<A - Chuck Barlow>: Yeah, Steve, this is Chuck Barlow. It will be a relatively slow summer. There will be a couple
of wrap-up type hearings on some issues that have already actually been tried. This summer, there is some briefing,
post-trial briefing, going on this summer. But the other issues that we have outstanding, such as what is actually the
technology that will be required, looks like it will definitely go into 2013 as we look at having and wrapping up that
trial. So we don't see the likelihood of any incremental decisions being made by the administrative law judges or any
final decisions being made on the water quality front before that.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. First of all, Gary, we'll miss you. Please keep in touch and good luck in all your
future endeavors.
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: Thank you.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Wayne, you made comments about the market cycles for power generation and how things
are tough now and they're likely going to be tough for a couple of years, but they're not going to be tough forever. And
I also think about your company's and your leadership history of being what I would call a contrarian buyer. Meaning
there weren't so many guys who went out and bought nuclear plants at a couple a hundred bucks a kilowatt back in the
late '90s, early 2000s. Are there – when you look at the merchant power markets today, are you seeing opportunities
that have the similar value creation potential to the ones you saw in the late '90s, early 2000s around nuclear? And if so,
are there specific either asset classes or markets that attract you the most?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Well, if I had the benefit of hindsight I could – 10 years from now I could tell you which
ones fit that description. When we bought the nuclear, we never expected the prices to be as high as they were for a
period of time there. We don't see that certainly happening again for really any asset class. Probably the most certain
thing when you look at it is environment regulations are going to get tougher.
Now probably not nearly as tough as EPA has outlined, which is just a point of view that is going to work its way – will
be played out in probably the courts over a period of time. And there will be assets that people don't view as having
much value that will probably have a lot longer life than people think. But I think, from our perspective, there's a lot of
opportunity because we have a number of companies that are feeling the pressure of these low prices and they're
looking to reduce the risk that they warehouse with these assets.
We do have the advantage of having really clean, well-located plants, and so I think there's opportunities available
without getting into any particular details. But to work with some of the other companies who have merchant capacity
fleets to develop a more robust kind of portfolio that would – rather than bet on any one particular kind of future. I
know that's not being very specific, but we're spending a lot of time on this and there's a lot of interest – I can say that,
with a number of other companies in terms of trying to figure out how they work their own way through this also. It's a
very uncertain time. I mean, you have to – it's not like one thing you're betting on. There's just a lot of different issues
that could swing it one way or the other.

things.

And we have time for one additional question and we'll go to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, good morning, guys. I guess just kind of thinking about the ITC transaction and as you
guys have had the chance to spend some time with the different commissioners and staff members, how are you maybe
verbalizing the value proposition of having ITC run the system? Obviously, there's real cost benefit to the MISO
involvement, as you guys have demonstrated, but with the higher cost of capital and that sort of thing, what value are
you guys trying to really sell them on to get them on board with the deal?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Well, I think I mentioned in the comments a lot of the advantages, but clearly the scale they
bring and the focus that they bring is unique. Maybe that's a leap of faith that they will find ways to do things that we
wouldn't necessarily, but, as you know, all of our state regulators have been – ever since the merchants came into our
territory in these very large numbers, they've been inundated with complaints.
And we've had various investigations and various requests for data and oversights and we've got processes to address
all those issues. Every single one of them we always come up that we're doing things exactly right, according to the
rules and all of that, but there's always that suspicion that because you're in the business that you're not; that somehow
something is being wrong or whatever; being done wrong. Some of us come from, at least partial backgrounds, like you
all do, in the trading business. In the trading business, oversight only goes so far. Separation of duties is everything.
For the Commission, the oversight with all this merchant capacity is so onerous and it never settles the question. And
so by separating the businesses, it ends any concerns that anybody has that there's anything going on here that is not in
the best interests of everybody or consistent with the law. They've heard that over and over again from all the
merchants and all the different parties.
Just the independence alone is what stakeholders want, that's what we're giving them. And then at the same time, there's
– we still think there's enormous upside of having a focus on that business. But I think the main thing that we are
emphasizing to them is that what the stakeholders want is independence. And in these hearings, they've tended to agree

<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay, thank you. Leo, just to make sure I understood on the tax treatment, the Louisiana

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yes. You're talking about the Gulf States?
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Yes, yes.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yes.
