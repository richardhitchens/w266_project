As a reminder, our presentation today includes certain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current
expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions
and estimates which could be inaccurate and which inherently are subject to risks. Please refer to the slide in our
presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K and any subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that
could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement.

And with that, let me turn the call over Denise.
Denise M. Morrison
Good morning. Thanks for joining Campbell's second quarter earnings call.
Six months into our strategic transition, we are focused on building a different company at Campbell. As we said last
July, implementing our new strategic direction will require substantial investment. We're confident that the course
we've chartered will position Campbell for future success. This morning I'll provide my perspective on our segment
performance and our progress.
Our U.S. Simple Meals and North America Foodservice businesses are tracking favorably, and we expect improved
performance in Australia and U.S. Beverages. We are slightly behind our expectations on net sales but projecting to be
within our guidance for full year 2012.
As a reminder, Campbell's primary goal is to create value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth. We
continue to make progress executing our growth strategies, and our focus remains on the consumer. Our three growth
strategies are: stabilize and then profitably growth North America Soup and Simple Meals; expand our international
presence; and continue to drive growth in healthy beverages and baked snacks.
As we told you last July, in fiscal 2012 we are increasing our investment in brand building and innovation for the
long-term growth of our business. Overall, to enhance our brand building efforts, this quarter we increased advertising
and consumer promotion expense by 6%, with gains across all of our portfolio. You will continue to see increased
advertising and consumer promotion in the back half of this year. Our innovation investments are also progressing, and
I look forward to sharing some of the early results with you at CAGNY next week.
Within the U.S. grocery trade, this past quarter dollar consumption softened dramatically, particularly in the last four
weeks of the quarter. For total Simple Meals, this softer consumption occurred across almost all categories, with 32
center-store categories experiencing declining trends for the four-week period versus full year to date. Our hypothesis
is that continued pressure on the consumer in the current economic environment increased after holiday spending
cycles, and the resulting decrease in personal disposable income has forced consumers to reduce discretionary
spending, including food. Overall, consumer outlay for total food and beverage was up only 1% in the 12-week period,
and the average number of units per trip declined 3%. Against this backdrop, I'll offer a brief perspective on our second
quarter results.
Our second quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectations. However, sales of $2.1 billion were slightly
lower than what we anticipated. As expected, our adjusted EBIT and EPS were down due to the marketing investments
we're making, inflation, and a higher tax rate.
Now, let me offer some perspective on some of our segment results. In U.S. Simple Meals, we're delivering on our
efforts to stabilize profitability. We had a modest profit decline in U.S. Simple Meals as weaknesses in sauces was
partially offset by stronger profits in soup. There were three drivers of our Soup performance. Number one, we're
achieving price realization via reduced promotional discounting and list price increases. As a result, we're shedding less

profitable volume. Number two, we're delivering and supporting meaningful levels of innovation. We launched 27 new
products this year compared with just three last year. And number three, we're driving advertising and consumer
promotion behind our big brands and consumer behaviors.
Our overall U.S. Soup business performed as expected with some puts and takes. Condensed soup and broth sales were
better than expected. Ready-to-serve soup sales did not meet our expectations. Increased list prices and the reduction of
heavy promotional discounting resulted in significant price realization. This created wide price gaps against branded
competitors that impacted our volume and market share. We believe that we can be more competitive in RTS and still
continue the momentum of profit improvement in the soup business.
Our strategy to increase brand building and reduce heavy discounting is working and drove the fourth consecutive
quarterly profit increase for U.S. Soup. We anticipate that sales trends in the second half will improve as the heavy
discounting is now behind us.
We achieved our largest net gains in soup distribution in more than four years. Total distribution points on shelf
increased mid-single digits. We recognize that we still have opportunities to build distribution in value channels. We're
setting up our U.S. Simple Meals for future success, and we'll talk more about that at CAGNY next week.
Before I leave Simple Meals, as you know, we've made some leadership changes at Campbell, and Mark Alexander
now leads our Campbell North American business. Mark has a proven track record of success. He has managed
businesses all over the world, including soup businesses in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
And now Global Baking and Snacking; Global Baking and Snacking turned in a similar performance as the prior
quarter but with slightly different drivers. We made a choice to increase marketing investments in our Pepperidge Farm
business. Our cracker business responded well, garnering gains in sales and market share. Goldfish sales increased
double digits. However, pricing contributed to softening in our cookie business during the peak holiday season.
In Bakery, industry consolidation has made for challenging category dynamics, including competitive pricing pressure.
Overall, we can compete with our position as a premium player with strong brands and the greater agility that our size
enables.
In Australia, consumers have sharply curtailed their spending this year and Arnott's had a tough first half. We started to
see stronger sales in January. We expect improved performance in the back half of the year, driven by a strong
promotional calendar and a robust set of new product introductions.
Turning now to U.S. Beverages; as you saw in the second quarter, in the first half of this fiscal year our U.S. beverage
business is not always without challenges. We had a significant decline in EBIT, due primarily to increased advertising
and promotion and cost inflation. We expect the rate of inflation to abate in the second half, and profitability will
continue to improve. And we also have a number of new product introductions slated for the second half.
We've had plenty of experience navigating the V8 business through cyclical upswings and downswings. And we've
learned the best way to maximize the health of this business is through brand building and innovation, but also to
defend what we've built. Recently, our V8 V-Fusion business has been pressured by new competition in the fruit and
vegetable segment. Our investments to defend it have led to earnings pressure in the short term, but this is the best
course for long-term success. And despite a weak shelf-stable juice category and intensified competition, V8 is
outperforming the category and gaining share.
We reiterated our annual guidance this morning. The guidance reflects the strategic transition we're making, including
investments in brand building and innovation, reallocation of existing resources to fund growth, and headwinds in the
first half in our U.S. Beverages and Australian businesses.
As I said earlier, we view fiscal 2012 as a year of investment for Campbell. We remain very focused on the superb
execution of our three growth strategies to create a meaningfully different company over time.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Craig for his analysis of our financial results and an elaboration of our expectations
for fiscal 2012.

B. Craig Owens
Thank you, Denise. Good morning. I'll spend a few minutes walking through the second quarter results and segment
highlights followed by a brief look at our first half results, and then I'll provide an outlook for the year and reaffirm our
full-year sales and earnings guidance.
For the quarter, we reported net sales of just over $2.1 billion, down 1% versus the second quarter of 2011. In
aggregate, there was no currency impact this quarter, so organic sales also declined by 1%. We reported a 2% decline
in organic sales in our first quarter.
We recognized some additional restructuring charges in connection with the program that we announced last June.
Excluding that impact, EBIT decreased 8% this quarter to $332 million, primarily due to significant cost inflation,
lower volumes, and increased marketing investment, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity
improvements.
On a segment basis, sales gained in the North American Foodservice division and U.S. Beverages were more than
offset by decreases in international Simple Meals and beverages and U.S. Simple Meals. Earnings fell across all of our
segments except for North America Foodservice. Earnings per share were $0.64 this quarter, a 10% decline as
compared with the second quarter of 2011.
The 1% decline in net sales reflected a decrease in volume and mix of three points and a negative impact of increased
promotional spending of one point, partly offset by an increase in pricing of three points. The majority of the pricing
gains have come from our list price actions in U.S. Soup and in our Baking and Snacking segment taken to partially
offset the impact of inflation.
With respect to promotional spending variances, higher rates of spending in Baking and Snacking and in our U.S.
Sauces business were partly offset by a reduction in our U.S. Soup spending. As many of you know, over the last
month or two we have seen a softening across many categories within the U.S. grocery trade. Our categories and
consequently our sales have been negatively impacted by this trend.
For the second quarter, our gross margin decreased by 100 basis points to 38.4% from 39.4%. This was primarily due
to cost inflation and unfavorable mix, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements. Overall, our
inflation rate in cost of goods sold was approximately 7% in the quarter. Our lower margin segments have
outperformed our higher margin segments, contributing to a negative mix impact. While we've implemented higher
prices and achieved productivity gains, these have not been sufficient to offset inflation and negative mix. Our gross
margin performance is below our own earlier expectations, primarily due to higher rates of promotional spending in
Baking and Snacking and in U.S. Beverages.
Our marketing and selling expenses increased 2% to $297 million compared with $291 million in the prior year. This
increase was primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses. Selling expense was lower. As part
of our new strategic direction, we're investing in brand building and in innovation to drive profitable sales growth for
the company. In the second quarter, we increased advertising and consumer promotion expense by 6%, with increases
across many of our key brands.
Administrative expenses decreased by $2 million to $152 million, reflecting the benefit of cost savings from
restructuring initiatives, partly offset by higher incentive compensation and benefit cost.
Below the operating earnings line, net interest expense fell by 16%, a decrease of $5 million, reflecting an overall
reduction in long-term interest rates. The adjusted tax rate increased to 33.7% from 27.1% in the prior year. The
prior-year rate benefited from tax credits associated with foreign earnings. Reflecting the higher tax rate, adjusted net
earnings were down by 13%. Adjusted EPS benefited from a 4% reduction in diluted shares outstanding, declining 10%
to $0.64 per share.

Second quarter segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown here. U.S. Simple Meals
sales declined 2%, reflecting lower sales in both U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. U.S. Soup sales fell 2% this quarter, as
volume performance was impacted by higher selling prices and decreased promotional spending. Our sales
performance was better than retailer takeaway, and this reflected the impact of movements in customer inventory levels
relative to the prior year. We ended the quarter with retailer inventory at normal levels and comparable to prior year.
Within the U.S. Simple Meals segment, sales of the U.S. Sauces segment decreased 2%. Prego Pasta Sauce achieved
6% volume driven sales gains, benefiting from increased advertising support and promotional activity. Pace Mexican
Sauce declined 7%, reflecting the impact of increased private label activity. And other Simple Meals brands also
declined.
Global Baking and Snacking sales decreased 1% due to declines in Arnott's. Pepperidge Farm had increased sales,
primarily due to crackers, led by the double-digit growth in Goldfish snack crackers, partially offset by a reduction in
cookie and bakery products. The performance of our Arnott's business was negatively impacted by higher promoted
and non-promoted price points at retail and a weak consumer environment. Although still down, the sales trend down at
Arnott's was much improved compared to the first quarter.
Within international Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales declined 4%, primarily due to declines in Europe and
Canada, partly offset by gains in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. In Europe, where there has been a
challenging economic environment, sales fell primarily due to volume loss in France and Germany.
Reflecting improved top line performance and outpacing the category, U.S. Beverage sales increased 4% versus prior
year. Gains were primarily driven by growth in V8 Splash drinks and V8 V-Fusion juice, partly offset by weakness in
V8 Vegetable Juice. Contributing to growth this quarter was the launch of new items, including V8 V-Fusion
Smoothies as well as higher levels of advertising to support the new campaign with Jackie Chan.
Sales of North America Foodservice increased by 9%, primarily due to volume driven gains in fresh chilled soups sold
at retail.
Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals decreased by 2% to $174 million this quarter. This reflected lower earnings
in U.S. Sauces, including incremental spending on Simple Meals innovation, partly offset by gains in U.S. Soup. For
the segment, lower volumes and increased advertising and consumer promotion expenses were partly offset by an
increase in gross margin percentage and lower selling and administrative expense. Our strategy to reduce the level of
promotional spending in U.S. Soup to improve profitability is working. We have now achieved four consecutive
quarters of earnings growth.
Earnings within Global Baking and Snacking declined by 12%, reflecting decreases in both Pepperidge Farm and
Arnott's, primarily due to cost inflation and increased promotional and marketing spend. This was partly offset by
higher selling prices.
Within international Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings declined 16%, primarily due to increased cost associated
with our market expansion investment in China and lower earnings in Europe and Canada. Operating earnings for U.S.
Beverages were down 21%, reflecting significant cost inflation, primarily in juice concentrates and packaging materials
as well as higher advertising and consumer expense, partly offset by productivity gains.
North America Foodservice continues to achieve strong growth, with operating earnings up 33%. Higher earnings have
been primarily driven by volume gains, higher selling prices, and productivity improvements, partly offset by cost
inflation.
U.S. Soup sales for the quarter decreased 2%. Within Soup, sales of condensed soup increased by 5%, with gains in
both cooking and eating varieties. Ready-to-serve sales, where price elasticity is most of it, declined 12%. RTS sales in
the quarter benefited from the introduction of Slow Kettle soups. Broth sales also increased on volume gains of
aseptically packaged broth and the successful introduction of our Swanson Flavor Boost product.
Before I move on, I want to comment on a topic that has received increased attention lately. As you know, Bisphenol
A, or BPA, is widely used in metal food packaging to help preserve and protect food and to maintain its nutritional

value and quality. We believe that current canned packaging is one of the safest options in the world. However, we
recognize that there is some debate over the use of BPA. The trust that we have earned from our consumers for over
140 years is paramount to us, and we've been monitoring and working on the issue for several years. Because of this,
we've already started using alternatives to BPA in some of our soup packaging, and we're working to phase out the use
of BPA in the lining of all of our canned products. The cost of this effort is not expected to be material.
The U.S. wet soup market share results from the latest 52 weeks based on IRI panel data and Campbell Soup's internal
estimates is shown here. Campbell's market share decreased 2.4 points to 60% as we focused on stabilizing soup
profits. The share loss was driven by ready-to-serve soup, as our market share from condensed was down only slightly
and broth was actually up. Other branded players gained 1.5 points in total, and private label gained nearly a point. The
overall category was down in dollars by 0.9% in the past 52 weeks. Our soup sales declined 4.7%, underperforming the
category due to anticipated volume loss associated with our reductions in deep discounting and our list price increase.
Other branded players increased sales by 5% during the period, while private label sales rose 6%.
Looking at our first half results now, reported and organic net sales decreased 1%. Excluding items impacting
comparability, adjusted EBIT of $750 million was down 7% versus a year ago. As with the quarter, this decrease was
primarily due to significant cost inflation and lower volumes, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity
gains. A 5% decline in adjusted EPS was less than the EBIT decline as we have continued to benefit from utilizing our
excess cash flow to repurchase shares. Diluted shares outstanding fell by 4%.
Cash flow from operations was $478 million compared to $483 million in the prior period. This decrease reflected the
impact of lower cash earnings, partly offset by the benefit of lower pension contribution. During the first half of the
year, we utilized our positive cash flow to repurchase 5.3 million shares at a cost of $173 million under our strategic
share repurchase program announced in June 2011 and our practice of buying back shares to offset those issued under
our equity-based compensation programs. Net debt was $2.6 billion, a decrease of $240 million.
Reflecting our expectation of improved sales performance in the second half of the year, we are reaffirming our
full-year guidance. We expect net sales growth of between zero and plus 2%, a decline in adjusted EBIT of between
7% and 9%, and a decline in adjusted EPS of between 5% and 7%, putting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.35 to $2.42.
We are now forecasting that our gross margin percentage will decline about a point compared to 2011. As I mentioned
earlier, this is due to higher rates of promotional spending in our Baking and Snacking segment and in U.S. Beverages.
Our guidance has not changed because operating expense, including marketing, is now forecast lower than our original
expectation. That being said, we're still planning significant increases in our advertising and consumer promotion in the
second half of the year.
Thank you very much. With that, I'll turn it back over to Jennifer to start the Q&A.

<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess my question revolves around your outlook. It sounds like a little bit more confidence
in the second half of fiscal sales doing a bit better. And yet, as I'm sure you're aware, a lot of companies are grappling
with the consumer and lower volumes, and you've made reference to that as well post the holiday, so that would refer to
just January. So I guess why exactly do you feel that sales can hang in there when it seems like the consumer is going if
other way and retailers are cutting back on inventory and the whole industry seems to be in the midst of really, really
tough times?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: There are a number of factors, Eric, that give us reason to believe that second half will be
better. First of all, in our U.S. Soup business, we are continuing with much higher levels of marketing, advertising, and
consumer promotion in the second half of the year versus where we were last year. In addition, we are now cycling a
period of time that does not include the heavy discounting that we've had in the base for the last four quarters. We also
have price realization on U.S. Soup that will come through versus year ago. In Australia, where we've had a tough first
half, we have a much stronger promotion calendar in half two and several new product launches. And we have already
seen evidence as recently as January that the performance of that business continues to get better.
In Beverage, our cost inflation comparatives improved. And we're also introducing new products and we're continuing
to support that business as well with advertising and consumer promotion. And I think the other thing in Beverage is
we're continuing to take steps in the supply chain to improve margins. So I believe across all the businesses – we're
taking into account that it is a tough environment and we're making the necessary plan changes to make sure we're
delivering despite that.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Just as a follow up and then I'll pass it on, Condensed seemed to be surprisingly strong in the
quarter versus the IRI data that we see and some expectations, but I'm wondering, is it a function that the price point on
condensed is so low given the – and the value that the consumer sees that that has really started to come through
because, obviously, Smucker, General Mills, and others – if they took the pricing over a certain threshold, it seemed
like the volume just collapsed coincident with that. And maybe condensed is the opposite because it's normally featured
during the winter at sometimes ten for $10 or things like that. So maybe you could just comment on that and I'll pass it
on.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: There's no doubt that condensed soup benefited from the fact that we have, with the
increased pricing that we've taken in the category of – and RTS especially, Condensed has come through to the
consumer as a better value. Coupled with a strong holiday on condensed soup, we did have a good quarter. So I do
think that it is a better value at this point. I don't know if you have anything else that you want to say, Craig.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I think maybe a little bit of the difference between the consumption numbers that you've
referenced and the sales takeaway in Condensed, we said in the discussion here that inventory movement, and it's really
prior-year inventory movement that was a little unusual, helped us a little bit in terms of shipments versus consumption,
and that was probably more prevalent in condensed than it was in RTS.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, thanks. We'll see you next week.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Okay.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was just trying to get your sense of the
overall trends in food volumes. There has been a lot being said about that. Most other companies are experiencing
volume weakness. Can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing from the consumer? So with all the insights that
you have into the consumer, what are you seeing in terms of their buying patterns, how they changed, and perhaps how
is Campbell reacting to that? That would be helpful.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We are, obviously, tracking 39 categories in the center store. And of those 39, 32 had
trends in the last four-week period that were much lower than the full year to-date trends, so there clearly is something
going on. And as I said in my opening remarks, I believe it's just post-holiday pressure. Consumers are making choices.
And one of the biggest discretionary budgets they have is their food budget. And so we believe that that is largely
responsible for what we're seeing. Basket size is down 3%, so units per buyer is down. And spending is down, so
they're clearly making different choices.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Have you made any changes to your strategy short term because this is a more recent event?
I know you have your long-term plans, which you've made clear to us. But have you made any changes recently given
the trends you've seen?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I would say that the most changes that we've made have been in the Australia business. In
the United States, we've been able to navigate this because this has been with us for a while.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I would separate big strategic moves, where I think Denise is exactly right, from the day to day
in the marketplace. We've seen in this past quarter, we've increased our promotional activity and spending a little bit in
Pepperidge, where we've seen category weakness in bakery. We're constantly adjusting the dials at a small level, but I
agree that we haven't made any big, significant strategic changes.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right. Overall, we're staying on course.

Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Investment. Please go ahead.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Hi, good morning. I wanted just to ask a little bit more about the advertising spend and the
plans here. So back at Analyst Day, you mentioned that there was the effort to do both an increase in the advertising
budget and in R&D, and I believe the sum total of that number was about $100 million. So far year to date, I think,
correct me if I'm wrong on this, Craig, but I think the number is still slightly down on advertising. So, Craig, Denise,
can you pull this together for me and tell me how you're tracking against that original goal?
And perhaps it has been my hypothesis that because the weather was so warm, maybe spending a lot of money on
advertising with the fourth warmest winter on record is not the best use, and maybe you delay it until next year. So can
you take this and give us an update?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Let me talk first about process that we used when we referenced that number and where we are
against that spending. We literally, in our annual planning process, identified $100 million, some of which we allocated
initially in the planning process, and some of which we actually kept back in a fund to be allocated as we went through
the year. And the use of all that $100 million was a combination of improving our brand building activities, particularly
against some of those brands where we felt like we had not been sufficiently funding them, and increased innovation
activity.
We said at the time that that amount would show up in all kinds of different parts of the P&L. Some of it is in trade
spend, actually, because that's where we expense slotting fees for new products. Some of it is in SG&A because it's
helping to support some of the new product platform teams that we've put in place. Most of it, of course, winds up on
the P&L in marketing and R&D. That program, that $100 million program, is very much on track. In fact, we're
spending maybe a little bit ahead of $100 million rate for the year. We're pretty encouraged by some of the results that
we see from it, and we're sticking to our guns there.

Now, in the rest of the P&L, as we've said in our guidance statement here, we're a little bit below our – as we forecast
the full year now, we're going to be below our original expectation in terms of marketing spend. We are benefiting, for
example, in R&D from the restructuring activity that we did toward the end of last year, where we took out some
resource and some spending that we thought wasn't giving us productive payback. So you've got ups and downs and
puts and takes across the P&L. It's fair to say that the incrementality of this $100 million is not going to be as great as
we originally thought it was. That was referencing back to my point that I made in the guidance statement that
marketing for the full year would be somewhat lower than our own expectation. But it's the difference between the
daily, weekly, monthly management of the P&L, our opportunity to find cost savings in various parts of the P&L
offsetting and being reallocated versus that $100 million program.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Denise, can you just maybe just make a comment on the winter weather and how that factors
in to how you spend against it because I'm just curious on whether or not you guys react to the weather and say maybe
we don't want to spend as much right now because it was so warm.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We're absolute advocates of global cooling. But actually, we acknowledge the fact that
the weather was warmer, but we also sell a lot of soup in warm weather climates. So we've got to deal with that, and we
are. I think where we're going, particularly with our soup business, is we want to increase usage of the product in some
positive need states, not necessarily the negative ones, like when people are sick or when they're cold. So we're not
going to use weather as an excuse. We're going to use it as just another environmental factor.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: No question in a seasonal business that it has had some impact. It has had some impact on our
European business. But I think Denise's point really is that in terms of resource allocation, we've tried to continue the
brand building activity that we think is sensible. And we're seeing some good results, particularly in our soup business
from the advertising itself.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I wanted to also give you a little bit more perspective on the $100 million. Just so that you
know, we spent the money on everything we expected to and we haven't held anything back. We are budgeting on
things that haven't come through yet. You'll see some of those next week. And we're going to continue to invest this
money when we're ready to spend it. But we feel really good about the fact that it's the right appropriation for the ideas
that we have.

Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Good morning. I just had two quick questions for you. I wanted to ask about the shift to
alternate channels. I guess I can see the consumption decline occurring in the IRI and Nielsen data. I guess I'm
surprised that people are really cutting back to that degree. But can you talk a little bit more about the alternate channel
performance and really as it pertains to Campbell, or maybe if you have a broader view on how that shift is occurring
for the consumer and what that means for you?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We know that alternate channels right now in the industry are performing about seven to
eight points above traditional channels. And that shift is occurring, again, across most of the food business. I would say
that we have opportunities in the value channels in particular, and that the IRI data is probably about 60% coverage for
us.

<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, that's helpful. And then my other question was just [ph] in reference maybe
(38:25) to Craig just to understand the retail inventories now are at the right level. Was that a benefit across the
business? Was it just for soup, if you have a little color on that, maybe how much it benefited the business?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yes, it was primarily within soup. And again, it's really last year that was unusual. We came
into the second quarter last year with pretty heavy inventory levels. And so in the year-over-year comparison, you saw
less takeout of inventory this year than you did last year. And yes, it's very much a soup idea and maybe a little of it in
the sauce business, but it's primarily a soup issue.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Was it a couple points of benefit to soup, or is that just too much?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: It's probably a couple points of benefit to soup.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: That's helpful, thank you so much.

Our next question comes from Ed Aaron with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Ed.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: You mentioned in your prepared remarks that condensed and broth were better than you
expected. RTS was maybe a little bit worse. Denise, I think I heard you mention that you expect to be more competitive
going forward on RTS. Were you referring entirely for your plans for more innovation and marketing, or did you mean
that maybe you went a little bit too far in managing your price points higher and have plans to course correct that a
little bit?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think the combination of the list price increases we took, the higher promoted price, and
then less frequency of promotion on RTS all at once created the result that we got. And we believe that we can still
work with the levers that we have to work with, improve the profitability of the business based on what we're cycling
last year, and be more competitive. And we are going to continue to increase our advertising and consumer promotion
on this business as well as the innovation.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Do your trade spending plans for the back half of the year, have they changed at all in
ready-to-serve?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Change versus what? Do you mean that we adjusted our trade? We're not going to go
back...
<A - B. Craig Owens>: We manage our trade spend pretty dynamically. So if you're asking if the total envelope
changed, I don't think we're going to get down into that level of detail on our planning. But we have clearly devoted
some more resource to RTS as we've come through the very end of this last quarter and start into the next quarter.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right, we will not go back to the heavy discounting, though.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Fair enough, thanks for taking the question.

Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Bryan.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: I just wanted to follow up on soup in general. And just as the year started, you had raised
prices on ready-to-serve and some of the other advertising and some of the new product innovation was going to
follow, so I guess two things. One, are we at a point now where you feel like you've got most of the resources in place,
meaning you're spending on advertising at a level that was commensurate with what you were expecting? I'm assuming
there's going to be some more news on the product front coming forward. And so what we're looking at now and going
forward is more reflective of what you were envisioning in terms of increasing the spend levels behind your soup
business to support the pricing.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, that's exactly the point we're at.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I think as we go forward, so again, we've just now cycled the previous year of less – deep
discounting. And the comparisons will get a little clearer as we come across into the third and fourth quarter, the second
half of the year.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: And that alignment has basically just happened very recently. Even going into this quarter,
you still weren't quite aligned on that, right?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: That's correct.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: That's exactly right.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: That's correct.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: And if I could, just one follow-up. The condensed performance, even if you shift out a
couple of points for inventory, condensed actually performed pretty well this quarter.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, it did.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: And that's even in the face of having some competitor price points on ready-to-serve that
were still pretty aggressive. So could you just talk a little bit about why you think that occurred? And has condensed
benefited also from the umbrella advertising on Campbell's?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, we believe that our advertising has been much more effective, particularly the
anthem spot that we have across the portfolio. And we've also introduced advertising on the icon condensed soups,
which we had walked away from for a while, and the emotional impact of moms love serving and kids love eating. And
that has been pretty effective for condensed soup. And as I mentioned earlier, we had a good holiday.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So you're starting to see – the messaging is beginning. You can show evidence or you can
see signs that as you turn the messaging on, you're actually starting to get consumers to respond to it.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, that's right. And what I failed to mention also is our Healthy Request business
continues to perform very well.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: I guess just from the outside, Denise, it's just very hard to look at fiscal 2012 as an investment
year when I'm looking at SG&A and it looks like it's going to be barely up this year. I know there are a lot of puts and
takes, but looks like R&D spending actually will be down. A lot of us thought that there was something big on the
horizon from a product perspective to revitalize soup. But with R&D not looking like it's up and Craig saying – I
thought I heard Craig say that one of the projects that you thought you were going to invest in you decided not to do.
So did something change in terms of the level of investment?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: First of all, Rob, a correction. No project has been cancelled. That's the important point here.
All of the new initiative spending has been funded. It has been funded at the level that we anticipated. In fact, we have
funded some new initiatives that we didn't even have fully baked and ready to fund versus the time that we talked to
you in July. What I did say is there's going to be less incrementality that's going to show up in the P&L because in the
base business, we've made some decisions as we've come through the year, in some cases to reallocate spending in a
different way, in some cases to take out spending that we didn't think was effective. So nothing has been cancelled.
With respect to R&D, I believe that R&D is likely to be up slightly for the year. But again you're seeing two things
going on. One is some new initiative spending is going into R&D, and the other is some resource that we took out of
the R&D spending line as we did the reorganization of the business last year in a way that we do not think has hurt our
innovation capability, but has simply gotten rid of some non-productive spending basically.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: I got you, so that was the low sodium, right?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Some of that, yes.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Yes, okay.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: It's also important to recognize that much of our innovation spending, for example, the
funding of our innovation teams, that expense sits in the marketing overhead line within marketing and not within
R&D.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: And that has R&D resources on it, our chefs.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Exactly.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay, but even the marketing and selling isn't really materially higher. So I guess really what
I'm getting at is, is this the level of investment – the $100 million is done, and it's not going to happen again in fiscal
2013, like there's not another $50 million or $100 million coming in fiscal 2013.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: No, you'll continue to see us invest, particularly in half two. And we believe that we've
gotten then the level of advertising in consumer basically to where we want it and we'll continue to shift mix over time,
but there won't be big slugs of money.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: But we benefit from the fact that it's now essentially in the base. As Denise said in July, we
felt like that our operating margin numbers had gotten up to a level that we just didn't think were sustainable if we were
going to do the kind of reinvestment in the business that we wanted to do. So adjusting the base essentially does give it
to you for the next year.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Absolutely.

<Q - Robert Moskow>: I got it. And advertising, what do you think advertising is going to be up this year, because I
think you started the year saying that you definitely – advertising had fallen to a level that was unacceptable the year
before?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yes, so I don't have a specific advertising number, although we are going to start in terms of
forecast. I think we are going to start being a little bit more visible in terms of our A&C spending as we go forward, so
we're working on that. A&C will be up. It was up 6% in this quarter, and it will be up for the year.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It will be up significantly more.

Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Hi there, very good news on the BPA front. Thanks for announcing that. I guess my
question is more of a strategic nature. Would you consider separating the Soup, Sauces, and Beverage business from
the Baking and Snacking business, or would it be that operational deleveraging – would that be too great and prevent
such a move from creating value? We've heard a lot of companies announce splits over the course of the last several
months. You yourselves sold Godiva I guess several years ago. Pringles has just sold for a great multiple and
Pepperidge Farm is a similarly strong brand. Is it something that you've considered, and what do you think the pros and
cons are around that kind of a decision?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: No, we are focused on three categories in the company, and we believe that operating as
one company is the best future for Campbell's.

Our next question comes from David Palmer of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Hi, guys.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Good morning.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: I believe Campbell's is already a pretty big spender on advertising as a percentage of sales. I
don't know if you disclose that, but I thought it was pretty high single digits. So perhaps you could describe why you
believe, not just quarter by quarter, but big picture year over year, why there will be a volume response from
incremental ad spend. And maybe this is the kind of thing that maybe you can get on a flywheel here of reinvestment
and stabilize the volume in your core soup business. And I guess related to that is do you think you have the product
and the marketing message where you want it, where you're going to have a pretty good ROI from this incremental ad
spend that you're talking about, particularly in the next half of the year? Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, the advertising levels, as you pointed out, are pretty robust and especially relative to
other simple meals. But it's not just the level of advertising, it's the quality, it's the messaging, and it's the news. And so
if you think about a certain amount of advertising on the base business to remind consumers to buy the product because

it's not necessarily top of mind all the time, but then you couple that with the innovation we're going to continue to
bring to the marketplace. And using the advertising lever to communicate that news and excitement, we believe that
over time that's the best way to build the business.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: I guess what I'm really getting at here is with your core business the volume has been going
the wrong way for a few years. I think folks are wrestling with is this a company that is over-earning until it stabilized
that business and what that reinvestment needs to be. Is it fair to think that you need to spend a lot more to get that
stabilized? And that's where I'm really getting at there with that question.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, we know that we can advertise the business for a longer period of time in the year
than we have been in the past, and that's part of what we're correcting this year. But we do think that where we're
arriving is the right level coupled with the innovation we're going to be bringing to market.

Our next question comes from Eric Serotta with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Eric Adam Serotta>: Good morning.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Eric.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Adam Serotta>: I'm wondering whether you can provide a little bit more detail as to what changes second
half versus first half in terms of the RTS business. I realize that the comps get easier, but you were down pretty
significantly against some comparisons that were not that great in the first half. Craig mentioned that you have some
room or some flexibility to adjust price points, but you're not going to do anything aggressive. Why should that get
materially better in the second half versus the first half?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We do know in the second quarter this year that the list price increases, coupled with the
higher promotion price points, created price gaps that were too wide, and so we've worked to adjust those. And we do
know that we didn't have enough promotion frequency in the first half, and so we're working on that as well. And so
with those insights, we believe with some modifications, we'll have a better outcome on RTS. The other thing is we
were very heavily discounting RTS last year in the base, and we're cycling that.
<Q - Eric Adam Serotta>: Okay. And within RTS, could you talk about which brands were your primary problem
areas? Is it still Select Harvest, or is Chunky seeing some weakness as well; and also trends in the microwave platform,
which your competitor effectively walked away from?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: We had weakness across the spectrum there, Eric, in microwaveable and Select Harvest and in
Chunky. One bright spot was the introduction of Slow Kettle has been pretty well hitting its mark, so that was a
positive. But honestly, RTS was weak across the portfolio.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: And we do believe that some of the benefits in condensed came at the expense of some
RTS.

Thank you. Our final question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: So I just wanted to focus on U.S. Beverages. Are you seeing any moderation? And
obviously, it's still competitive. But are you seeing any moderation in the competitive conditions there? And then as
you look out across the balance of the year, how do you feel about the sustainability of the type of top line growth that
we saw in that segment during the quarter?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I'm not expecting that beverage competition will get any easier. But that said, for the
investments that we've made in our beverage business, our products are up in sales and they've grown share in an
immensely competitive category. So we're going to continue to run our play. Where we do think things will improve is
in the profitability as the inflation that we've experienced in the first half starts to abate as we cycle the second half.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks, and a very quick follow-up; any initial thoughts on consumer receptivity

Before we conclude our second quarter call, let me leave you with a few thoughts. We continue to advance our three
growth strategies this quarter. Our U.S. Soup profits improved, which is important to us. Australia biscuits are
regaining their footing. On the other hand, while U.S. Beverage sales increased, profits were down significantly. So we
have some more work to do, but the first half served only to reinforce our conviction that brand building and innovation
are what is required to deliver the profitable sales growth we want, and that has our undivided attention.
The important point is that we're committed to building a different company at Campbell's, a company that creates
value by driving sustainable profitable net sales growth. And we're focused on executing our growth strategies and
have plans to improve our performance in the second half, with increased advertising and consumer spending, new
product innovations in U.S. Simple Meals, Beverages, and Global Baked Snacks, a stronger promotional calendar in
Australia, and we also expect inflation to abate in U.S. Beverages. And as we said last July, implementing our new
strategic direction will require substantial investment to fund a radically different innovation process and reinvigorate
consumer focused brand building. Thanks again for joining us today and have a nice holiday weekend. And with that,
Jennifer will now conclude our call.
