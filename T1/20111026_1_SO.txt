you want to follow along during the presentation.
Now, at this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning, Southern Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer.
Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before I get started with the normal text I want to recognize Glen
Kundert. This is his – it's unbelievable – 48th earnings call. And as most of you know he will be retiring later this year.
He is a wonderful friend and has contributed so much to our success. We just want to recognize that.
Now, Glen, most often in Southern Company when really important people retire, we name plants after them. I'm afraid
you're going get this call named after you. This will be the Glen A. Kundert Third Quarter 2011 earnings call. Sorry we
couldn't do better. We will in fact do more in the months ahead. I think we have three separate official recognition
parties for you. And look forward to seeing all of you on the call. If you can make it, please do. He deserves all of our
thanks and recognition.
Returning to the script. As you can see from the materials we released this morning we had a solid third quarter. Before
handing it over to Art for the financial review, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our employees for the terrific job
they have done this year serving our customers.
This has been a particularly active year across our territory with regard to storm activity. Not only were we faced with
the devastating tornados of April 2011, which claimed lives and left thousands homeless in Alabama, Mississippi and
Georgia, but throughout the spring and summer we have seen an unusual number of major storms. Our employees have
worked around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible during this challenging period.
We have likewise seen strong storm activity outside our service territory. And Southern Company has responded to that
challenge as well. In August we provided assistance to utilities hit hard by the effects of Hurricane Irene, which left
millions without power. A total of 740 Southern Power employees were dispatched to help with that restoration effort
in multiple states up and down the Eastern Seaboard. Just a few weeks later, our own territory was hit hard by Tropical
Storm Lee, and the same crews that had deployed to the Northeast returned home and reported without rest to support
that restoration effort, which lasted several days.
As we have faced and met these challenges, it has been our employees' unparalleled commitment to customers that has
made the difference. Our employees know that putting the customer first is what makes Southern Company successful,
and their actions speak louder than any words I can offer.
At this point I'll turn to Art for a discussion of our financial highlights for the third quarter and our earnings guidance
for the remainder of 2011.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. As Tom said, our third quarter performance was solid. In the third quarter of 2011, we reported earnings
of $1.07 a share compared with $0.98 a share in the third quarter of 2010, an increase of $0.09 per share.
Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our third quarter numbers compared with the third quarter of 2010.
First, the positive factors. Retail revenue effects in our traditional business added a total of $0.17 a share to our
earnings in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the third quarter of 2010. Most of this increase was the result of
regulatory actions at Georgia Power that became effective in January 2011.
Changes in nonfuel O&M spending increased our earnings by $0.03 a share in the third quarter of 2011 compared to
the third quarter of 2010. This effect is due primarily to the absence of a discretionary accrual to the Natural Disaster
Reserve at Alabama Power that negatively affected earnings in the third quarter of 2010.

Finally, a reduction in interest expense increased our earnings by $0.01 a share during the third quarter of 2011
compared to the third quarter of 2010.
Now let's turn to the negative factors that drove earnings for the third quarter of 2011. Weather effects reduced our
earnings by $0.07 a share during the third quarter of 2011 compared with the third quarter of 2010. Weather was
actually positive for the quarter, coming in at $0.03 a share above normal, but was negative when compared to the same
period in 2010, which came in at $0.10 above normal.
Income tax expenses in our traditional business reduced earnings by $0.01 a share during the third quarter of 2011
compared with the third quarter of 2010. Lower revenues at Southern Power reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share.
This decline in revenues is due primarily to the expiration in May of this year of a long-term capacity contract. This
decline was partially offset by opportunity market sales from this same resource.
Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the third quarter of
2011 compared with the same period in 2010.
In conclusion, we had $0.21 of positive items compared with $0.12 of negative items, or a positive change of $0.09 a
share over the third quarter of 2010. So overall, our quarter came in at $1.07 per share.
Turning now to our own customer data and the regional economy. Our sales data indicate that the southeastern
economy continues to expand but at slower rate than in our original forecast for the year. We had been expecting 2.2%
growth in retail sales. However, the expected growth in retail sales has not materialized, as reflected in our year-to-date
weather normal retail sales growth of 1.1%. We are now in the process of preparing our 2012 sales and economic
forecast and will provide an updated outlook for you during our January earnings call.
In the meantime, overall sales growth remained slow, driven primarily by the continued flat performance of our
residential and commercial markets. The still challenged housing market and low consumer confidence continue to
temper growth in these sectors, a situation that has been exacerbated in recent months by external events around the
world.
Industrial sales, however, are still growing, increasing by 1.6% in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the third
quarter of 2010. Based on third quarter results, industrial sales are at 95% of pre-recession levels. As a bullish signal
we note that August sales approached 97% of 2007 levels, indicating continued momentum.
The most significant increases for the quarter were in primary metals, up 16%; petroleum refining, up 12%; and
fabricated metals, up 8%. All major segments experienced year-over-year growth, with the exception of paper and
several housing-related segments. The auto segment in our region has shown continued improvement, producing 10%
more vehicles in the third quarter of 2011 than in the third quarter of 2010. Meanwhile, the value of all exports from the
region increased 18.5% in the third quarter of 2011.
We remain encouraged by the prospects for continued industrial growth in our territory. On the economic development
front we are actively working with our state governments on more than 300 potential new projects. Out of this pipeline,
30 realized projects representing more than 6,000 jobs were formally announced during the third quarter alone.
For example, Mercedes-Benz announced that in 2015 a fifth line will be added to its southeastern operations, bringing
with it an additional 400 jobs. This is in addition to the 1,000 Mercedes jobs previously announced for 2014 to build
that company's C class model. All told, Mercedes will bring a total capital investment of $2.4 billion to the region over
the next four years.
To sum up the current economic picture, the Southeast economy is rebounding, albeit slowly, and should be well
positioned for the future, reflecting strong fundamentals, such as diverse transportation networks, attractive labor
markets and low cost of doing business. The recovery will, however, continue to be challenged until the national
employment picture improves and consumers begin to regain confidence in their outlook for the future.

Turning now to our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2011, our estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.29 a share,
which means we expect to come in at the very top of our 2011 guidance range of $2.48 to $2.56 a share.
At this point I'll turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. In closing I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on where we stand on our five strategic business
priorities.
The first priority is to sustain and enhance our business model. We remain focused on providing superior customer
value in the form of industry-leading reliability, low prices and exceptional customer service. The outstanding values
Southern Company delivers can be seen in operational results achieved throughout our business. These results include
but are not limited to a peak season equivalent forced outage rate for our fossil/hydro generation for 2011 of about
1.3%, the second best in our company's history, compared to a historical industry average of around 7%.
A continued 10-year trend of improved performance for our transmission and distribution assets. Prices that remain
well below the national average. And customer satisfaction that is among the industry's best, most recently
demonstrated a few weeks ago when Southern Company was named the number one utility nationally for overall
customer satisfaction in the Annual National Key Accounts Benchmark Survey conducted by TQS Research.
The second priority is to be successful in completing our major construction projects, Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4 and
Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County, Mississippi, are progressing well. All targets related to cost and schedule remain
achievable.
The third priority is to engage in the national energy policy discussion. We continue to stress the importance of a
common-sense national energy policy that will contribute to a healthier economy and our nation's ability to generate
jobs.
Our concepts are simple: first, that the United States should take advantage of all of the arrows in the quiver, nuclear,
21st century coal, natural gas, renewables and energy efficiency; and second, that our industry should increase as a high
priority its investment in robust proprietary research and development.
We've been very clear in our conviction that this is the best way for the industry to go forward. Toward that end we
remain engaged in a variety of forms and are very encouraged by the constructive nature of the discussion to date. We
are especially gratified by the recent hearings in the U.S. House of Representatives concerning the reliability of our
nation's electric infrastructure and particularly the leadership shown by FERC Commissioner Philip Moeller.
Meanwhile, we have continued to diversify our fuel mix. Four years ago, 70% of our generation was coal fired and
approximately 10% came from natural gas. In the third quarter of 2011, approximately 50% of generation was derived
from coal, while gas production has moved up to 30%. We moved in this direction solely for the benefit of our
customers without additional regulatory mandates, which would have the effect of increasing energy prices and
reducing reliability.
My fourth priority is to promote smart energy. We remain offensively postured in the three components of this effort:
smart power, smart grid and smart choices. In smart power, we continue to pursue a three-pronged approach that
includes conventional, renewable and distributed generation. In smart grid, in addition to our efficiency gains we
expect to have nearly 4 million smart meters installed by the end of this year, on our way to a total of 4.6 million at the
program's completion. And in smart choices, we continue to assess which value change will emerge and where we
might participate in those markets.
The fifth priority focuses on our people. We believe we have the best bench strength in the industry. And we see that as
a major strategic advantage going forward. Even now we are working on robust succession planning that will carry us
into the next decade and position this company for future success.

As our business continues to grow and evolve, we will pursue the successful achievement of these five priorities, all for
the benefit of the customers and communities we serve.
At this point we are ready to take your questions. So operator, we'll now take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes
from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, I guess just can we talk a little more about kind of the demand picture right now in really
the residential and commercial classes? If you have more thoughts, you want to pontificate on why we just haven't seen
the usage recovery and if this is all economy or if there are some efficiency issues going on or what you think is kind of
keeping this from rebounding?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, Dan, this is Art. I really think it's more consumer confidence than anything else. So I
would point to the general economy. It's very tough to pull out energy efficiency out of those numbers and get a good
feel for that. I think the fact that we've had so many punches in the gut from all of these sovereign debt issues in
Europe, the downgrade of the U.S. debt, the stock market performance, housing values dropping, doesn't give
consumers a lot of good feelings to go forward on.
So I think everybody's being very conservative. They're paying down debts. Their whole mindset is very conservative
right now. I think that's what's driving usage.
You also have some in-migration issues into the Southeast. With the housing values declining, you got folks just not
willing to pick up and move, sell their homes, and real – or monetize that value.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, and one other point that's just interesting. Personal income growth for those that have
jobs is actually pretty vibrant. So I think this other issue of just a sustained kind of unacceptably high unemployment
level is something that has to resolve itself. Those that have jobs seem to be doing pretty well.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And I guess maybe a little further along those lines, if you look at the industrial load, you guys
are almost back to pre-recessionary levels. But clearly you've seen growth in the industrial base since then. If you think
about the resource additions that have happened since '07, '08, how far off are you off from that normalized utilization
rate for the entire industrial base?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: As I said, we're 95% for the quarter compared to '07 levels of industrial sales. So in the
month of August, we were 97%. So we're almost back to that breakeven point. But we've added a little capacity,
ThyssenKrupp being the big one to note, that we didn't have back in '07. So it's not a pure apples-and-apples
comparison.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And I think another statistic that I think we've mentioned in the past we continue to see
affirmed, is this idea that during the downturn, a lot of our industrial economy took the time to retool. And in fact we
think their production capacity efficiency has gained about 18% since the downturn. So you're going to have to eat into
that before you re-grow jobs in a significant way.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Do you think the efficiency gains is going to kind of – the 97%, 95%, 95%, 97% recovery
probably captures the growth you've had netted against the efficiency gains you saw out of your big customers? [ph]
Seems we're kind of at normal (20:00), like an honest normal number.

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I'm not sure I follow the question.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: All right. I'll follow up with you on that one. The other thing, Tom, I was wondering if you
could talk about just on Vogtle where the COL is at this point in time and your expectations for getting that resolved.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes. The simple answer is we see no technical reason why we shouldn't be able to get the
COL by the end of this year. As we know the rulemaking process with respect to the DCD has been submitted to the
NRC. Likewise, the regulation around the COL is progressing as we expected it to. And so we see these things coming
together by the end of this year. We see no technical reason why it couldn't happen this year.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.
Operator
Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Bank of America.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Hey, Tom. Just curious kind of your latest thoughts on what we may see out of the final
HAPs MACT thing. And just I know you push a lot for more time and for some changes. And there's been I guess
focus on reliability. And we now have a one-month delay I guess to deal maybe more with reliability issues. Just what
are you expecting to see?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Steve, that is an awfully good question but it's one of these unknowables. I'll talk around
the issue. It's pure speculation at this point. Certainly with the extra 30 days for EPA perhaps to digest the vast amount
of comments they got, we still have the 2015 deadline staring at us. And in fact, from the time you get a final rule till
the 2015 deadline it really shortens your period to react and put in place. So all the issues related to schedule remain.
You may know, too, that the EEI comments with respect to this rule really have 11 different points. Schedule is just one
of the 11. The others relate to more technical points related to how you measure effluence and what's the appropriate
regime in which for that to occur. So there's a whole lot going on here behind – other than schedule.
And I think the thing that I'm gratified with, as I noted in my comments, is the constructive nature of the discourse in
Washington. I know you don't hear that often. But we are particularly gratified by the notion that people do take
seriously the potential impact on reliability. And, in fact, we know that there is a FERC technical conference now
scheduled to deal with reliability in November.
So we'll see. I appreciate the question. I am reluctant to try and predict where EPA's going to come out on this thing.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: That's helpful color. I guess one other question just on – I guess two other questions. First
on sales growth, when we think about the impact if we have slower sales next year or the year after, I mean in the end
generally you're just focused on earning your allowed return, whatever investment you're making. Would this have any
meaningful impact on your capital expenditure plan? Or since most of it's for some of these major projects, it really
wouldn't impact that much?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, I think that's exactly right. I absolutely share that point of view. I don't think it has
much to do at all with our CapEx. If there is any impact on CapEx it's going to be the theoretical gas unit way down the
road. We're pretty well committed through '17 anyway. If you think about it, we've got Plant Ratcliffe at Kemper
County coming in in '14. We have the McDonough units coming in. We have Plant Vogtle 3 and 4 coming in.
Georgia's doing a solicitation in its IRP for some '15 and beyond resources. All that's pretty well spoken for. Any
variance is going to come in late in this decade.
And further, let me just say to everybody, too, while we have – we were predicting, remember, a recovery that we
thought would accelerate in the fourth quarter. We think it's still there. We just think it's further out in time.

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Steve, you may have some intermittent adjustments to growth in transmission and
distribution, investment. But...
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yes.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's more related to current economic growth and you could see some delay depending on
what the forecast were to say.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: One last quick question, just on equity issuance through your [ph] drip dribble (25:10).
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Where are you on that? How much have you issued year to date? Could you remind us
what your target was for the year?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, our target for the year was $500 million. Year to date we have issued $619 million, I
believe, is the number. We've done more. We've actually turned off our internal programs other than the stock option
program. And that's really where we picked up much more than we expected. Next year – and we'll give you guidance
in January on -- where we expect that to be next year.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Andy Levi with Caris.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Hi guys. Can you hear me?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: First I want to say Glen, congratulations, and I've expressed this to you before, but you're a good
friend, and you know I'll miss you. So I just wanted to get that out there.
<A - Glen A. Kundert>: Thanks, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Second, just on the COL, I mean I understand that you guys are in very good shape there and
things seem to be humming along. But can you just be a little bit more specific on what still needs to be done? Or
what's the process between now and year end or the first of January, whatever it is?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. So the DCD has been submitted in a rulemaking process to the NRC. So the
commissioners now have the rule. They now have a period of time in which they can comment on the final rule and
vote on it. There is a period that the different staff of the different commissioners will try and harmonize their
comments. Ultimately I think as the commissioners come to a consensus on approving the rule, we hope, then I think it
will move rather quickly.
Remember, the COL is a process, which has a 240, I think, 240, 270-day clock on it, which will culminate by
December 15th, I think. So what we expect to see, what we hope to see, is a vote that will be final by the
commissioners prior to that time with respect to the DCD. Then we have the COL. And then hopefully we get the COL.
Beyond that period, there are two administrative procedures we have talked about before, one of which deals with a
scoring process by OMB and one of which deals with a notice process in the Federal Register. Both of those are

administrative in nature, and we believe there is no technical reason why we couldn't be awarded the COL in
December.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay. And I guess it's just a matter of when a rule is a rule?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: When the commissioners vote on it. When it is affirmed.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: When it is affirmed, okay. And then just secondly, very quickly, just on O&M, obviously you
guys have done a great job on O&M this year and one of the reasons why I think your numbers are so good and offset
maybe a weaker residential/commercial side. Can you kind of just talk about that and whether we can – if sales ended
up being a little bit weaker than expected next year, whether we can anticipate the same type of cost management on
the O&M side?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, basically, Andy, what you've seen in the third quarter was the fact that Alabama had
booked that reserve last year and didn't book anything this year. So that's the biggest driver this year, year over year.
Otherwise, it's pretty flat.
A lot of our O&M is timing. We do a lot of O&M in the fourth quarter after we know what revenues in the third quarter
are. So that drives a lot of our numbers. So when you look ahead, we always like to think we've got some flexibility
around O&M spend. But then again, we still have to maintain customer service at levels that our customers expect. So
we judge that very closely.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I'll just throw two comments out. You know the old expression fix the roof while the sun
is out. When we have weather that generates higher than expected revenues, not only does that stress the system a little
more, we actually turn on O&M at that time, so we take advantage of those times in order to keep the system as robust
as possible. And the clear evidence of that is look at the operational performance of our generation fleet and our
transmission and distribution assets during this time. So we're on a wonderful kind of management practice of
maintaining an optimal fleet condition. So that's kind of a big deal.
And you always have to kind of look across years with Southern with respect to O&M. I wouldn't get too excited about
one year over another. And I think our O&M in '11 kind of compound average growth rate since '08 is about 2.2%. So
that's a nice good trajectory for us to follow.

Your next question comes from Jim von Riesemann with UBS.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Jim.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: How you doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Excellent. How are you?
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: I'm doing well. Hey listen, in your prepared remarks you touched briefly on some of your
construction projects.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: So I really have a twofold question. One is let's assume the COL gets signed and
everything is done at the end of the year. You're the first folks to go out and build new nuclear. How should we think
about what's keeping you up at night in terms of that project? What do we need to look for in terms of the positives as
well as the negatives from that? And then the second question is on the other question you mentioned, which is your
Kemper County. What are you seeing there in terms of cost pressures? Do you have any cost updates for us? I know

some others in the industry are having some fits and starts. And maybe what keeps you up that night on that project?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Perfect. We saw your note on that so we're reasonably prepared there. Let me first hit
Vogtle though. What's fascinating about Vogtle – we're not allowed to disclose kind of our forward projection for say
month-by-month construction expenditure projections. It's a trade secret under the contract. Okay?
But you should reasonably expect that it is a fairly stable line going forward. Okay? So it's not going to be particularly
lumpy. As we have already talked about in a variety of forums, the project, which is expected to be about $14 billion to
100% ownership, remember we own 45.7%, so we're $1.7 billion or so in on that. And we have essentially completed a
lot of the civil work at the site.
And, in fact, what you will start to see – it will be very visual once we get the COL. We're going to start to come out of
the ground with a lot of stuff. Those of you that haven't been at the site recently would notice a lot anyway. We've
actually done a lot of structures, but you're really going to see it pick up. You know that we've been going to school a
little bit on the project in China, [ph] Sanman (33:00), et cetera. And it's like building your house. Once they put the
walls on your house it looks like we're making tremendous progress. That's about what you're going to see in the next
year or two.
So what keeps us up at night? I mean, that's a fascinating thing. Before we decided to go forward here, we went back to
the stalwarts of Southern's past, so we pinged people like Bill Dahlberg and Allen Franklin and [ph] Paul Wright
(33:31) and a variety of other guys that had been involved in the big construction projects of the past. And one of the
things they said is as significant as this is to your company, there is nothing more important that you can spend your
time on.
And so one of the things I want to assure the financial community is that this has our priority focus. We have a Vogtle
executive oversight committee of me and Paul Bowers, the CEO of Georgia Power; Anthony Topazi, the COO; Art, of
course, the CFO; Steve Kuczynski, the president and CEO of Southern Nuclear; and of course Buzz Miller and his
guys. And we spend whatever time we need into whatever hour of the night there is to get involved. And we do that
regularly but I can tell you on a real-time basis, we are all aware of the progress in the issues.
You should also all know, and I've been very public about this, when you consider the magnitude and the timeframe
involved, the issue here is not that you have challenges but rather there will inevitably be challenges, and the question
on how well you manage this project is how well you get through the challenges, how well you manage the time,
material, process, management oversight. And I think we've done a heck of a job when you consider all the challenges
we've seen so far and how we're moving through them in an efficient, expeditious manner.
I guess that's it. The only other thing I would add is these are processes that we're putting in place. As we start to build
the plant there will be tests along the way of various systems that will have to be approved to nuclear quality. We get
that. We fully embrace it. We are accountable for it. And we are managing with our vendors to that degree of
performance. So it will be – I'm sorry for the long-winded answer, but it will be just an ongoing shirt sleeves rolled up,
hard-nosed, blue-collar effort to stay on top of this. I commit to you we are doing it.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: And then just on Mississippi?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. Since we saw your note we kind of anticipated this might be an issue. So we have
included a slide in the appendix that will be available to you I guess after the call.
Let's just kind of go through that real quick. I fully understand the question. I mean I get it. Edwardsport has had its
issues so what about Kemper. Well, I know they're both gasifiers, but that's about where the similarities end. They are
very different projects. I'll just hit a few of the major points. The types of gasifier is exceedingly different. Ours is our
own technology that we developed along with KBR. It's called TRIG. It's not the GE gasifier. The primary fuel type for
us is lignite; the other one is bituminous coal.
The maintenance of it will be significant. Ours operates – it's called non-flagging. It operates at a temperature below
where ash gets melted. And so therefore we think it has a much more robust operating profile and will require less
maintenance as it goes forward.

EPC management. You know, Southern has tremendous experience in self-managing projects of this magnitude. I
guess during this kind of big buildout of environmental and combined cycle projects over the last, say, five years or so,
really 10 years, if you go back to the inception of our environmental construction program, which has amounted now
over $8 billion, we have averaged over 15 million man hours per year, self-managed. 15 million self-managed. And we
have brought in all of these projects on time, on budget, with better functionality than what you normally see in the
industry.
Kemper will require about 8 million man hours over three years. So as a self-constructor engineer, we have fully
demonstrated our capability to handle projects of this magnitude. So we're not relying on a third party. We've
demonstrated we can do it. It's our technology. We get it and we think we'll be successful.
Underlying that concept is the notion that this is – when I talk about proprietary robust research and development,
remember we developed this. This technology really started back in the late 60s and 70s in liquefaction work. This
work morphed into gasification recently. And this technology that we're building has now run over 15,900 hours at our
Wilsonville research and development facility. And 2,300 of those hours has been on this Mississippi lignite.
Remember, too, that we started down the road on an Orlando project. Remember, too, that we're going to go to school
on the 120-megawatt Dongguan project in China. So we have the ability to go to school on somebody else and
understand the integration issues as we reach construction.
A few more points. We have a great big site, 3,000 acres, 165 acres for the footprint of the plant. It's a merit shop.
Construction management is probably half of what you see elsewhere. We have about 120 people deployed for that and
a lot fewer contractors, probably about 10 contractors on site at our peak.
So for all those reasons, we think that we're in awfully good shape and we have the same kind of oversight on the Plant
Ratcliffe Kemper County project that we do on Vogtle, and I am very confident in saying they are on budget, on
schedule; we believe all of the metrics are achievable.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Super. That was a complete answer. One quick question, maybe a 30-second response.
Gulf Power, we haven't heard much about it, but I know there's a rate case going on down there?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, probably not a lot to go on right now. They've had a few hearings but it's really a

2011. I know you made some macro comments earlier in your prepared remarks, but now that we're sort of most of the
way through 2011, [ph] any care to put a sum of the win guesses of (40:38) what the GDP would be for 2011? And
then maybe any [ph] sum of the win guesses (40:43) on where 2012 could look?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, Brian, the numbers that I've seen and the folks that we kind of pay attention to are
saying a little bit less than 2%, 2% GDP growth for 2011.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And that's basically where it is. That kind of matches what we're seeing on sales growth as
well. At least in residential/commercial.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We'll comment a lot more about – we go through all of our economic forums and
everything else with our major customers in '12. So we'll give you a full picture on that. But just remember, the
economy is still recovering. We still have a positive trajectory. It's just ahead of us a few more months than it was.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Okay. So are your comments on '12 going be given maybe at EEI or is that something we
should probably wait till first quarter to think about?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: First quarter. January call, yes.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We use that as a foundation for our guidance.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Okay. Great. And then one other question. I remember last quarter Southern Power
experienced a fairly large jump in utilization year over year from somewhere in the 30s percentile range to close to
50% in 2Q. Could you give us what the utilization numbers look like for 3Q 2010 versus 3Q 2011?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Oh, I don't know the '10 numbers, but the '11 numbers were like 75%.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Here it is. You're exactly right on '10. I thought it was about 35% to 40%. This year, third
quarter, you know, Southern Power's making more money off energy margins. Their capacity factor is up around 69%
in the third quarter. Year to date, 55%. Fascinating. Our baseload fleet, so our traditional integrated operation fleet, was
75%. And that's really what's driving this increase in gas-fired energy up to over 30%, is the fact that our combined
cycle units are now starting to look like baseload units. Fascinating stuff.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Right, right. Great. Thank you for the extra color. Appreciate it.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Okay. So about a year ago, a little over a year ago we got a conditional loan guarantee
from the United States government. You know that we can't disclose the conditions under which the draw will occur.
But we have described that the draws will begin to occur soon after we get the COL.
We remain confident of our position with respect to retaining the COL. Recall – as you can probably imagine, we have
had some conversations about this internally and in Washington. We are so different than Solyndra, right? This is a
corporate credit of Georgia Power company. So if Southern Company, I don't know what the exact number is today, is
a $37 billion market cap company, Georgia Power is half of that. So you're talking about something that is exceedingly
creditworthy.
Remember, too, that 100% of the benefits of the loan guarantee accrue to the customers of the state of Georgia. So this
is something that absolutely benefits the public and aids the renaissance of a national priority. We see very, very little
reason to believe why this will not go forward as we all contemplated.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: I don't disagree with any of that. But in that event, what would happen then?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Nothing. We would continue on. We would just lose some of the benefit. Remember, too,
just to throw this in the mix, give me the point of a commercial here, in the latest hearings that we had with the Georgia
Public Service Commission, really had been dealing with this incentive proposal that was brought out. It was made
very clear that since certification, the company has brought to the benefit of the citizens of Georgia over $1 billion in
value since certification. Part of that is these loans guarantees. Obviously there's other things as well. So we will
continue on if we have to. It would just be a shame that this national priority was not benefiting the citizens as it should
have.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Would you sort of answer a question focused on the PTCs similarly and maybe your view of
sort of how likely or not those are to survive?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Same answer.

Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Greg.
<Q - Jon Cohen>: Hey, it's actually Jon Cohen. Greg hopped off. So I'll ask on his behalf. But just a follow-up on the
question that might have been asked before about your gas fleet in the Southeast and how underutilized those plants are
now. So if you wanted to change your dispatch philosophy to run the CCGTs more as baseload assets, what would be
the process for that? I mean – and are you looking now at longer term RFPs or...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, are you talking about the – wait. Our fleet runs as a energy pool for the benefit of
our customers. Okay? So our customers always get the best Lambda possible. Okay? And when you consider that the
capacity factor of the integrated fleet, this is integrated regulated utilities, was up around 75%, and the Southern Power
fleet part of that pool ran at 69%, they are acting like baseload units. So if you think about the dispatch, they are being
dispatched way early, certainly in advance of other coal assets.
<Q - Jon Cohen>: And do you think you're pretty much maxed out now on how much you can run those assets? Or as
time as some of the coal contracts roll off that you could see even more coming from the gas fleet?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, you will see more coming from the gas fleet, especially if we see some of these
retirements in place that will be required if EPA has their way under the proposed rule. Art, what would you add to
that?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Just to say that McDonough is going to add 2,500 megawatts of gas and about two-thirds of
that next year and the other third in '13. So we'll have an increased gas capacity after those assets are in service.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And remember, too, the other issue that we raised, we are very bullish on natural gas. I
hope everybody understands that. And we look forward to using more natural gas in the future. If we shut down some
of our coal, and perhaps if we are required to, as a result of the EPA rules, convert some old, small coal boilers to
gas-fired with higher heat rates, we're going to need more gas pipeline infrastructure. Currently our firm transportation
in the Southeast is full. We're going to need more infrastructure built out in order to support more gas demand.

Your next question comes from Mark Barnett with Morningstar Research.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Hey, good afternoon guys. Just a couple of quick questions. You've talked enough about Vogtle,
but just a quick – with the task force vote out of the NRC this week, do you have any firmer idea about the impact on
maybe your existing nuclear fleet?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No, Mark. It's a little early for that. I think the rules that they are developing are going to
take several years before they're finalized. So it's going to be a little while. But we really – from our perspective, from a
high-level perspective, we don't expect them to be dramatically...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You know, there was an initial review on the 90-day report coming out of Fukushima.
And you'll be glad to know that none of our units were found to have any significant deficiencies per that report. And
certainly none of it really applies to any degree to Vogtle 3 and 4.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Yes, I know. Those are specific designs that some of your peers maybe operate.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay. And then the second I guess – you're looking at switching over to Southern Power.
There's a lot of talk around a couple of large solar projects on the block. And I'm just wondering when you're looking at
these various portfolios or specific individual projects, do you have a preference for either a specific project or more a
pipeline? Or how are you looking at your strategy there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think our strategy – we have pretty high bar for all of that, any new projects coming into it.
But it depends on who else is involved and whether or not we can get the Ts and Cs to match the requirements that
we've got going in. So we look at a lot of different projects. And some of them make the hurdle; some of them don't. So
we're always open to discussion.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We tend to like smaller bite-sized deals. We don't like the mega projects. We've kind of
budgeted among ourselves – this is – you shouldn't take this as firm, but it's just our own thinking – to do kind of 300
megawatts or less over five years. All right?
So that suggests something. So we would want to use that – to us an optimal bite size might be 50 megawatts or we
might do 100 at a time. But we like the smaller sizes and do kind of those things. We would keep the same mindset that
we have with our Southern Power fleet. That is long-term contracts. Our current average life of contracts is over 14
years. Creditworthy counterparties, no fuel risk, strong vendor relationships, et cetera.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay. I guess the last kind of unrelated question: obviously some of your peers have recently
called some rather large preferred issues. I'm just looking at your subsidiaries preferred. So are there any factors that

you'd like maybe want to discuss, considering you're looking at that maybe for following suit? Or why you might not
be thinking about calling any of those issues?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, we don't really comment on what we're looking at or thinking about. But we keep an
eye on our portfolio. And we'll take advantage and make announcements when it's appropriate to do so.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Xia's given us some interesting information on the debt portfolio.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, we've been lengthening the debt portfolio a little bit, beyond our normal term, trying to
take advantage of low interest rates obviously. On the other side of it, where we see we can draw down on some loan
guarantees, we've shortened the debt portfolio at say, Georgia and Mississippi to take advantage of those particular
opportunities.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Shortened it in anticipation of drawing down and going longer. In fact, I think the
numbers are a year ago we were 13.5 years, and now we're going to 14.5 and we think maybe 15.5 once we get the loan
guarantees in place. That's for the Southern debt portfolio. And we're reducing costs at the same time. It's actually a
pretty good time to be building big capital assets.

Your next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello Ali.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Hey, good afternoon, Tom. One question. You know, as you lay it out, you're going to end up at the
high end of your earnings for this year at say $2.56. That will be a pretty strong year-over-year growth for you, I think
8% or so if my math is right. So when we recalibrate going forward and start looking at 2011 as the starting point
longer-term, could you remind us of what kind of growth rate, EPS growth rate can the system support off an '11 base
longer-term?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, I'll just put the reminder out there. I think you saw it on the slide. We started with our
2010 guidance range of $2.30 to $2.36. And based on that growth rate, 5% off the bottom, 7% off the top, we thought
that that would describe our growth opportunities moving forward. To the degree that environmental compliance
required CapEx early in the period, we would grow more towards the top end of that range. If it's pushed out, if those
CapEx dollars are pushed out, our growth opportunities would fall towards the bottom end of the range, in other words
the 5% range. But it's all based on the reality that we established for you, that being the 2010 guidance range.
<Q - Ali Agha>: All right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, and just looking at the fourth quarter, so you're assuming – just go through that
versus history.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes. Ali, if you looked at last year we earned $0.18 in the fourth quarter. We've given you
guidance this year of $0.29. We think that's a much more normal fourth quarter. If you look back at '09 it was $0.31;
'08 it was $0.26. So this is a much more normal fourth quarter than what you would normally see.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Last year was abnormal.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And I guess related to that and Art, I think you alluded to that on the CapEx side, but underlying the
rate base growth that would support the earnings growth would be what? Across your portfolio?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, we've outlined the CapEx and until we update that in January, you would still go with
the CapEx numbers we gave you for $15 billion to $17 billion depending on your assumptions around environmental
compliance.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, we'll give you specific guidance in January as we always do. But we remain
absolutely convicted with the plan we've laid out and we think we can perform within those ranges.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. Tom, one last question. Coming back to your earlier commentary on what you're hearing out of
Washington, DC. But realistically in the end – you've talked about this on a couple of your calls the options in front of
the EPA/the administration, in dealing with HAPs MACT and similar rules, appear to narrow down to essentially
giving a timeline extension, perhaps three years or so, between the White House and the EPA. But realistically or
practically speaking is there anything else that we should or could expect with regards to these upcoming rules?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, sure. My quick commercial here again is why now? So on top of a challenged
economy, why do we want to increase prices and impact unacceptably high unemployment already? Okay? So the first
question you ask yourself is, why now? Why this rush?
The second question then is go to the EEI principles in which there are 11 points laid out. So beyond schedule, there are
things like, the EPA has introduced a brand new concept called condensable PMs that frankly isn't a PM inside the
plant that would condense and form a PM outside the plant. There are a number of issues that deal with startup, shut
down, when the plant will kind of not operate as well as we can. There's a host of issues around what is the PM
standard? What is the mercury standard?
There are a host of technical issues that aren't as simple to talk about but are as material as the schedule. And until we
know what those are – see, this is the point that people tend to whitewash in the discussion about this important rule –
until we know what those are, we can't tell you whether we're going to require bag houses on certain plants or not. And
so therefore until we see a final rule we really can't determine what is the optimum compliance strategy. So when
people say "should have known," they're all wet.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And so Tom, just to be clear, between now and December your sense is all of this is still on the table
and could change by the time the December final rules come out?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It absolutely is.

Your next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey guys. Congrats on a good quarter.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thanks.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got a couple of questions. One, just have you guys ever talked about what your earnings
sensitivity is to, like, every 1% change in expected demand?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, we do.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: If you don't mind my asking, what is that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, you want to know it?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Oh, I didn't know you wanted an answer to that. It depends on which class you're talking
about. For a 1% change in all of our customer classes would be about $94 million in pre-tax base rate revenue. And that
would translate into about $.075 plus or minus of earnings per share.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But all you're doing is math. In other words, we wouldn't just let that happen. We would
take a number of steps in order to hit the numbers that we put out to the public.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. Someone earlier asked a question about O&M. And I guess as we kind of were in a
little bit of a demand recovery environment where the recovery's taking a little bit longer than folks had thought, would
there be any issues keeping you from doing a – I think it was late '09 to early '10 where you did decent-sized O&M
reduction during that year. We've seen one or two of your peers announce something like that as well. Is there anything
that would keep you from doing that going into 2012, whether it's a test year for a rate case or whether there's some
other item both near-term or long-term that would keep you from doing it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. Listen, we, I think, do a dynamite job. The folks that run the system, the people that
run the plants, keep the wires up, do a dynamite job having this concept of essentially a flexible budget, where there's a
baseline of things that we absolutely have to do for reliability purposes, for safety purposes, a variety of other things.
There is always an increment above that, which deals with projects which are more of a nature that lends itself to
variability. Whether we do them in one year or the next. Do we do an outage in one year or the next or marginal plants,
things like that. So we have inculcated into our operational practices a certain amount of optionality into our spending.
We do not ever impact reliability or safety. And as a result, you can see that in our operational performance. We
operate like champs.
So this has just worked exceedingly well. The only way I theoretically get to that question is if you had a number of
years in a row where you couldn't exercise that kind of flexibility, but we've never seen that condition.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Last question. With Casper [CSAPR] kind of final rule out there and then revisions
that came out a few weeks ago, are you seeing a change in your negotiating position with the coal suppliers? And if so,
how?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, that's a fascinating question. Art, you want to take a shot at it?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Michael, I haven't picked up on any change. Now, we are kind of looking at which units are
going be on the margin from a HAPs MACT perspective and trying to decide what our coal contracting strategy will be
around those particular units. But I think Casper could also influence which units are being – which ones are going to
be more available than others.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, because what you're going to do with Casper is essentially changed the dispatch by
an energy add or essentially the cost of the allowance.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The other thing that's fascinating about that question is a point we've made in the past. It's
kind of a national energy policy point. And it is the United States can elect to reduce its consumption of coal, but coal
will still be consumed worldwide. We have seen a big increase in exports to people like China and India and a variety
of other people. The coal will be consumed. The question is, as a policy matter, will it be consumed for the benefit of
the United States citizens?
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Tom, one kind of a follow-up in terms of some of the environmental CapEx. When the
EPA put out the draft HAPs MACT there was the analytics that was imbedded in that that assumed that lots of plants,
especially PRB-burning plants, would be able to use dry injection and dry scrubbing rather than wet scrubbing. Just
curious for Southern Company's view on whether that is technologically as feasible as the EPA estimated.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, it's way off. No, it's not. Because remember when you add up all – you've got to add
up all the consequential effects of all the rules. When you use DSI you create particulate matter issues. So it doesn't

work.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Meaning that...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I don't think – on our fleet, I'm not even sure we're using DSI anywhere.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: So in other words that for large – I mean I can understand for [ph] ap coal (1:03:30) plants
that you're almost boxed into a corner and have a use a wet scrubber. For PRB-burning plants you assume that the
concept of using dry scrubbing as well as maybe bag houses, et cetera, to meet both Casper and MACT really isn't a
feasible outcome?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Correct.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's correct. And we have the research; we're the only group in our industry that has
deep research and development at a proprietary level that can assess these things. As well, we have a 1,600-person
engineering construction services group that knows and has technical expertise in almost every element of a power
plant. We know this stuff backward and forward. And I would put our technological expertise against anybody's.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thanks, Art. Much appreciated, guys.

Your next question comes from Carl Seligson with Utility Financial Experts.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Carl, how are you?
<Q - Carl Seligson>: Great, Tom. How about yourself?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Carl Seligson>: Good. I don't think there's any accurate way to measure energy efficiency, but I'd like to know
what you think you can do about it and how long does it take before – if your sales don't recover – you'd decide to do
something about decoupling or the like in any of the states.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Okay, first of all, we think decoupling is a dumb idea in a growing economic
environment. Right? Decoupling makes sense where in fact you're going to reduce sales.
<Q - Carl Seligson>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And here's my point. And I know you've been in the audience on some of my speeches, so
I think you just pushed a button that set me off here.
<Q - Carl Seligson>: That sounds right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But energy efficiency to us doesn't mean sell less. It means use our product more wisely.
And in fact what I want to do from a strategy standpoint is posture this company to play offense in an energy efficiency
environment. That is, if I can demonstrate that electrotechnologies can displace other worse forms of energy, then I can
in fact sell more kilowatt hours, so decoupling doesn't make any sense at all in that context. And in fact, our research
and development group now is devoting a significant – really it has been for really some time – a significant amount of
effort to developing electrotechnology applications that will have that effect.
So let's get more efficient and let's use more electricity. An obvious example is electric vehicles, right? We spend $1
billion a day on importing foreign oil, and we think you can charge your electric vehicle for the equivalent of about $1
a gallon. I mean let's do that.

<Q - Carl Seligson>: How about a subsidy to buy them?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You know, the United – that's an interesting question. But here's the issue. The United
States government has to get out of doing subsidies. We can't afford them. And that goes for renewables and a variety
of other contexts.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Ashar.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Hey, how are you doing, Tom? Tom, I guess as was alluded into one of the questions, as you were
talking, a headline went across the taper on 110 that they're going have some hearings on the nuclear loan guarantees.
Has that anything got to do with us or no?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I frankly don't know. I feel secure about our position with our loan guarantee.

Yes, I just want to again give Glen Kundert a chance to express his appreciation, but before he does I just want to say
thank you all for attending. We appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Glen, you have the floor.
Glen A. Kundert
Well, thank you, Tom. And I just want to say it's been great working with all of you in the financial community over
the last 12 years. Made some great relationships and have appreciated all of you. And I'm going to miss you, maybe not
miss the work so much, but I'll certainly miss all of you. And I'll look forward to seeing you during Utility Week in
New York.
