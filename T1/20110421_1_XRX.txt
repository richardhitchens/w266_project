MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by
Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She's joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox's Executives will refer to slides that are available on the
web at www.xerox.com/investor.
At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting
of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation there will be a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by
their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially
different than those expressed herein.
At this time I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.
Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide Three. Our results in the quarter reflect
progress in scaling our services business while maintaining our leadership in document technology. Steady revenue
growth and our sharp focus on operational improvements resulted in the 28% increase in adjusted earnings. This is the
last quarter that we need to report on a pro forma basis. You'll recall that we closed on the ACS acquisition in February
of 2010. So going forward, we have the benefit of a full year of ACS results in our year-over-year comparisons.
Our first quarter pro forma revenue increased 2%. We delivered Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.23 which was above our
guidance. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.19 per share. This includes $0.04 from the amortization of intangibles.
Cost and expense management remains a strength of ours, leading to a Q1 operating margin of 9.1%, a year-over-year
improvement of close to one point. Gross margin of 33% is within our range and reflects the results of more revenue

coming from services and a continued impact of currency.
The first quarter is typically our lightest in the year for cash generation. Due to some seasonal effects of our business on
working capital and the timing of accounts payable, we used $30 million in operating cash during the first quarter. We
remain very confident in our cash flow for the balance of the year and continue to expect to deliver $2.5 billion in
operating cash and $1.9 billion of free cash flow for the full year.
Our CFO, Luca Maestri will provide more detail on cash flow and our financials in a moment. First, I'll review a
summary of our Q1 performance and discuss how we're managing the impact on our business from the earthquake in
Japan. Then Luca and I will both take your questions.
So let's turn to Slide 4. In the past year, we transformed not only our business into a leading player in the services
space, but also our business model, with growth largely driven from an increasing annuity stream. 85% of our total
revenue comes from annuity and annuity was up 3% in Q1 or 2% in constant currency. Total revenue of nearly $5.5
billion was up 15%. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2% in constant currency.
Equipment sales were flat in the quarter. This was not surprising considering the double-digit growth rates we saw in
Q1 of last year as the economy was improving, especially in developing markets. Fast forward a year and we're facing
volatility in some Middle Eastern markets, stalling previous rapid growth in this region. With a series of recent product
launches and more to come in Q2, we expect to see an improvement in equipment sales later this year. For now, we're
being prudent in our planning considering potential product constraints from Japan. I'll talk more about this in a
moment.
First, let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of the metrics that fuel our annuity pages, MIF and signings. In our Technology
business, we focus on color page growth and machines in the field, or MIF. Many of you know that I always provide a
reminder of this equation. More MIF leads to more pages. More pages, especially color pages, generate more revenue
from supplies and technical service. MIF plus pages equals more revenue flowing through to our annuity stream.
For Q1 we saw continued growth in MIF, with digital up 2% and color MIF up 14%. Color is 32% of our MIF and 25%
of pages. Total digital pages were down 5%, the result of declines in transactional black and white pages. Yet within
total pages, we had a 7% increase in higher value color pages. We're focusing our investments on creating more color
pages through affordable office color printing and more advanced digital production printing.
As important, we continue to grow our distribution network, including four recent acquisitions that expand our access
to small and mid-size businesses. Three are in the U.S. and one in the UK. In our Services business, signings totaled $3
billion and were up 3% on a trailing 12 month basis. Keep in mind that the trailing 12 month and year-over-year
compares can easily be skewed by big deals. That's the nature of the services business and was the case this quarter. In
Q1 of 2010, you recall that we signed the $1.6 billion 10-year California Medicaid contract. The size and duration of
the deal creates a tough compare for this year.
That said, I am very pleased with the success of our signings this quarter. It's $3 billion of revenue that benefits us over
the length of multi-year contracts, and many of the wins were the result of cross-selling with ACS. Notable deals in the
quarter include a $200 million contract to manage IT services for MGM Resorts International; reducing document
devices from 2,700 to less than 900 through managed print services for the workforce provider, Kelly Services;
managing clinical and technology applications for clients who use Allscripts remote hosting services. Since Allscripts
is the most used solution for electronic health records, this is a significant deal valued at $500 million over the next ten
years and reflects increasing demand from healthcare providers for IT support.
In addition, we're continuing to win government contracts for transaction and claims processing, as well as
transportation and parking services. Our growth in services was driven by an 8% increase in revenue from our BPO
offering, 4% from document outsourcing and 1% from ITO. That's strong performance across the board, along with a
29% increase in our total pipeline. We're also scaling our Services business through acquisitions.
In Q1, we announced an expansion of our Call Center business in Europe by acquiring Unamic. And through our
acquisitions of CredenceHealth, we're strengthening our portfolio of software solutions that serve the healthcare

market. In summary, our progress in services and technology reflects our differentiation in the marketplace and the
benefits of our diverse portfolio.
We continue to hold a number one revenue share – revenue market share position for document technology and the
breadth of our services offerings, as well as our global account relationships, give us the competitive advantage. So it
was a good start to the year.
Before I hand it over to Luca, let's turn to Slide Six for a review on how we're responding to and impacted by the tragic
events in Japan. Most important, we are relieved to learn that our people, the Xerox employees in Japan and our
colleagues from Fuji Xerox, are all safe. And since Fuji Xerox's major manufacturing and operation site are in Tokyo
and regions south and west from where the earthquake hit the hardest, our facilities were not damaged. We do business
with a number of other partners and vendors in Japan and we are working with them on a daily basis to comprehend the
impact on our supply chain.
Our number one priority is fulfilling customer orders and maintaining the uptime of their Xerox systems. That means
alternative sourcing for components and materials, often at a higher cost and it means more expensive distribution
methods like airfreight to avoid the long delays in many ports.
As a result, we're seeing increased supply chain costs. But we are focused first on our customer needs. Our employees
in Japan and our colleagues in Fuji Xerox are doing an incredible job managing the complexities of this very
challenging situation and we're extremely grateful for their perseverance and tremendous support.
Based on our analysis of the situation, we expect to see some product constraints toward the middle of the second
quarter impacting the pace of installs for Xerox and Fuji Xerox and we don't expect to see a full recovery until later this
year. So from a financial perspective, there are potential Q2 headwinds in three areas: equity income from our 25%
ownership of Fuji Xerox, supply chain costs, and equipment sale revenue due to possible product constraints.
Considering there is still much uncertainty, we're providing a broader range than usual for our earnings expectations in
the second quarter. We expect that over the course of the year, we will minimize the impact on cost and revenue.
Therefore, we remain fully committed, we remain fully committed, to delivering on our full year expectations. We
maintain a 24/7 focus on managing the situation in Japan and I do feel that we're in a better position than most.
Above all, we're doing what we can to help our colleagues in Japan recover and rebuild. With that, let me turn it over to
Luca. I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?
Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Ursula and good morning, everyone. As Ursula said, we are reasonably pleased with the overall results for
the quarter and continue to see opportunity for further improvement ahead of us. Revenue growth on a pro forma basis
was 2% in Q1, which was good performance, but under our full year range of 3% to 5%. We expect to accelerate
revenue growth as we move through the year because of our significant signings in 2010 and as we begin to realize
greater synergy revenues. Therefore, we remain confident in our ability to be in the 3% to 5% range for the full year.
Operating margin in the quarter was 9.1%, up nearly a point year-on-year on a pro forma basis and a very good start to
the year. As anticipated, we saw currency and the mix of business impacting gross margin, but this impact was offset
by disciplined expense management. RD&E and SAG ratios improved quite significantly thanks to restructuring and
synergies and we're well on track for our full-year objectives of $270 million of restructuring savings and over $120
million of cost synergies.
On the gross margin front, we expect improvement over the year. We will continue to implement restructuring and
synergy initiatives and we see now reduced headwind from currency. Equity income in the quarter was $34 million,
which reflected a strong year end for Fuji Xerox. The $34 million includes $11 million in Fuji Xerox restructuring,
which we did not adjust out this year. Adjusted EPS was $0.23 and grew 28% year on year. The only adjustment to
reported EPS was the amortization of intangibles and GAAP EPS of $0.19 was an improvement of $0.23 year on year.

As Ursula indicated, going forward we expect equity income to be affected by the events in Japan, especially during Q2
and Q3. We also continue to assess the direct impact on our operations, and we'll provide an update on this during our
investor conference in May. As a result of the uncertainty from Japan, we are providing a range for Q2 EPS which is
wider than unusual.
Let us turn now to Slide 8 for a review of our segments, starting with technology. Technology revenue was flat in Q1,
at $2.5 billion about 46% of our business. Importantly, segment margin of 10.7% was up over a point year on year,
with benefits from restructuring more than offsetting the negative impact from currency. Overall good performance
despite some headwinds in the entry category caused by lower installs and equipment revenue. Entry and install
performance is weighted heavily towards the developing markets and the results in Q1 were in part affected by
disruption in the Middle East. Looking forward, we anticipate trends to improve, although Q2 will face a difficult
compare, given the 56% install growth that we had during Q2 of 2010. On the product side, we are in the midst of a
refresh of our lower end multi-function product line, which we expect will help entry performance.
Mid-range continues to show very good growth, thanks to a strong color portfolio, which delivers industry-leading
quality, productivity and price value. The product line will also be strengthened by new product announcements in Q2.
In high end, the color press 800/1000 continues to perform well and is the driver of our color install growth. As we go
through the year, we will have more product launches, such as the already announced ink jet production system, that
will build upon our leadership in the segment. In summary, solid overall performance in technology during Q1 and we
expect this will continue throughout the year.
Moving onto services on Page 9, Services revenue was up 40%, or 5% on a pro forma basis. Growth was driven by
BPO, which was up 8%, and document outsourcing up 4% with good sequential improvement. ITO revenue was up
1%. BPO's 8% growth had strong contribution from HR services, from customer care volumes and new business ramp
in transportation. This growth more than offset declines in government services associated with lower unemployment
claims volume and contract runoff.
BPO signings were $1.25 billion, with good momentum across all lines of business. ITO had very strong signings,
which more than doubled year-on-year and also had strong pipeline growth. We expect this positive trend in ITO to
continue as new contracts ramp during the year.
Document outsourcing also had a very good quarter, with strong signings up 42% year-on-year in addition to the
revenue growth of 4%. Overall signings grew 3% on a trailing 12 month basis, which represents a deceleration given
the ten-year $1.6 billion California Medicaid deal that we singed in Q1 of last year.
In total, our Services pipeline was up 29% including synergies. Segment margin of 10.3% was up seven tenths of a
point and reflected the positive contribution from restructuring and synergy savings. In summary, positive results in
both our technology and services segments.
With that, let us move to the cash flow slide on Page 10. Cash from operations is seasonally weakest for us in Q1 and
this quarter was further impacted by the timing of accounts payable. The accounts payable timing will work itself out
through the year, and we remain committed to achieve $2.5 billion in operating cash flow for the year.
Earnings contributed $289 million to cash flow, strong performance but not enough to offset working capital usage of
$584 million. Let me make a few comments on working capital. The accounts receivable movement is in line with prior
Q1 performance and reflects the tremendous effort that is made each Q4 to drive collections.
DSOs actually improved year-on-year, reflecting our focus on cash generation. Inventory performance is also in line
with our expectations and reflects the building back of inventory after the high Q4 sales period. Accounts payable was
a greater use of cash than normal, but broadly expected given our seasonal timing of payments.
CapEx was $111 million for the quarter, and we're well positioned relative to our full year outlook of $600 million.
That was flat for the quarter and our cash balance was a $1 billion.
Slide 11 provides more detail on our debt and cash flow expectations. Beginning with debt, given our borrowing
capacity and objective to optimize funding costs, we intend to call our 2027 trust preferred securities during the second

quarter. These preferred securities were issued in 1997, have a par value of $650 million and carry an 8% coupon. This
action will help reduce interest expense and will be cash accretive by the end of 2011.
In our second quarter, we expect to report a $34 million pre-tax charge as a discrete item, which represents $24 million
on non-cash carrying value adjustments and a $10 million cash premium. We are raising our year end debt target by
$650 million, the face amount of this security to $8.6 billion. Just to be clear, to this transaction our liabilities remain
unchanged and this action has no impact on the level of available cash or on the timing of cash deployment.
We also remain committed to maintaining a solid investment grade rating. When looking at our debt balances, it is
always important to keep in mind that the vast majority of our debt is in support of our financing business. We have
$8.6 billion of debt, of which $6.3 billion can be associated to the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers,
which assumes a 7-1 leverage of our finance assets of $7.2 billion. These finance assets represent a committed revenue
stream from our customers.
As I said before, we remain confident in our achievement of cash from operations of $2.5 billion and we expect to have
$1 to $1.2 billion of available cash this year. We are fully committed to using over 70% available cash towards share
repurchases, beginning in the second half. In summary, we had a solid quarter, in spite of some fairly challenging
external circumstances. Our annuity based business model and our market leadership position are strong assets which
we would continue to leverage to grow earnings and return value to shareholders.
Back to you, Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. We're a full year into our acquisition of
ACS and fully realizing the benefits of being the world's largest enterprise for business process and document
management. We continue to expand our offerings through products and services that give our clients more flexible
choices and give us a competitive advantage while strengthening our annuity streams. We continue to expand our
distribution channels, reaching more and more customers, especially small and mid-size businesses, on a global basis.
And we continue to operate our business effectively and efficiently helping to offset margin pressures from revenue
mix and currency.
As a result, in Q1 adjusted EPS increased 28%. Revenue was up and we improved operating margins. Generating
significant cash flow is imperative to our business and a key focus for our leadership team. This year, we expect $1
billion to $1.2 billion in available cash for acquisitions and to buy back stock. For the second quarter, we expect to
deliver adjusted earnings of $0.23 to $0.26 per share and we remain committed to delivering full year adjusted earnings
of $1.05 to $1.10 per share.
With that, I thank you again for joining us today and now let's open it up to your questions for Luca and me.

kind of curious as to sort of where you think everything nets out in terms of what customers are doing and their
willingness to print and that. Then I had a couple follow-ups.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think that what we're seeing from page
trends is a continuation of the trends that we saw in the beginning and all through 2010 and 2009. So – with a little bit
of a hiccup in this quarter driven a little bit by the Middle East. So this is what is happening. In black and white,
particularly high end production pages, we continue to see a decline of those pages. That's pretty much what we expect
and it's kind of in our business model and our business thinking today. That decline has not significantly accelerated,
but it is definitely continuing. It's a big piece of our page volume.
We're at the same time seeing a pick-up, an increase, in color pages. And we're seeing an increase in the average price
per page, because as we mix towards color, the price per page actually trends upward, which is good.
We're seeing an increased importance of the low end of our business, so the printing trends in small and medium,
mid-size businesses, and we're responding to that by increasing our product intensity there and our distribution there,
primarily through acquisitions. And so – and then overriding that, we had a pretty big stall in activity and therefore in
pages in the Middle East which we expect to come back as that region settles down, which it is beginning to do.
So as we work our way through 2011, we'll see continued growth in color, continued growth in average price per page,
a decline in high-end black and white pages and a stabilization and a growth in the low end pages, which will bring our
trends pretty much in line with what we expect them to be.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Okay. Great. Then Ursula, if you could talk a little about geographic trends in terms of
demand, what you're seeing in the various regions and any color you can shed on sort of what Fuji Xerox is seeing in
terms of demand in Japan. I know it's a tough situation right now, but is some business getting back to normal, or how
should we think about that? And then also Europe and some of the other regions.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me start with the other regions and I'll end with
Japan. In the developing markets, which was a high growth area for us, it remains a growth area for us. We, as you
know, we had difficulty – we and everybody else had difficulty – in the Middle East area. It's a pretty big – it's good
area for us. We're strong there. We have high share there and we were impacted by the downturn. We didn't lose
position in that marketplace. So as the economy improves, we'll participate in that area, so no problems there.
From a DMO perspective as well, developing markets, Russia is a big area for us and we had huge growth in Russia in
2010, end of 2009. We're seeing that this quarter actually slow a little bit, but we don't expect that to be a continuous
trend. I think that BMO will, excluding the Middle East, will continue to be a growth area for us. So pretty good, those
territories pretty good.
Europe, we talked to you before about Europe responding better than the headlines would anticipate that they would
respond. So our position in Europe, from a market share perspective, the penetration of color, products, from our
services penetration, the winning of deals, all that is very good. Europe, as you know, is a lower margin region for us so
we're focused on continuing to win across the board technology and services and continuing to focus on our costs and
expense in that area so that we can have a good – continued good business model. But Europe is strong.
U.S., I have to say has a little bit better output than it had in previous quarters. Our equipment sale revenue in the
United States is definitely picking up across the board. We're strengthening in all segments, primarily driven by the fact
that we have increased penetration and performance in the low end of the business and we continue our strength in high
end, particularly at color.
We do have a product gap right below the very high end in color, right above the mid-end in color that we will fill in
the second half of the year. That should help us to even turn that around a bit, particularly in the post-Sale side. But
U.S. better than it was in the past, still a little bit tepid, but improving for us.
Japan, it's hard to tell, Shannon, and I'm not trying to be evasive at all. We are in constant contact – when I say
constant, it's like annoyingly constant probably for the people in Japan – with them on how they're doing. And their
transparency is cloudy, so our transparency is cloudy as well.

What I can say is that our post-sale stream, which is very important, it is 85% of the total revenue and on the equipment
side, 70-plus percent of the revenue. That is not impacted at all. It's the first thing we focused on is to make sure that we
can get that supply stream assured so that we don't have any customers who have already bought the technology down
or waiting for us. We have that pretty well secured in both Japan and in the U.S.
The part that was affected for Fuji Xerox was not a high business area for them, or for anybody it seems like, at all. The
big issues are how they supply to the rest of Japan and to the rest of the United States and to the rest of the world,
particularly the United States.
So in Japan we're seeing not a lot of transparency. We were able to get through the first quarter well, both Xerox/Fuji
Xerox. We're pretty sure we'll be able to get through from the equipment side the first half of the second quarter. We
think we'll have some problems in the second half of the second quarter, but we're also pretty confident that we'll be
able to work through those throughout the year and so I – without having detailed transparency to all that's happening
in Fuji Xerox, I'm confident that we'll be able to manage it on a Xerox income perspective.
Fuji Xerox, it depends. I think that they're coming up, they're doing okay. They're dealing with it. Rolling power
outages, all of these things kind of contribute to the uncertainty, but if they perform, which we expect that they will,
like they did in the first quarter, our first quarter, we will be able to make it through the rest of the year, I think, without
any hiccup on an overall basis from a year perspective. If you think about what happened there, it's kind of an amazing
statement. As I said when I was speaking earlier, I think that we are definitely better positioned than most. I'm pretty
sure of that, even though we haven't seen what the other Japanese competitors or manufacturers are saying about their
results.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Great, yeah. No, I think it's going to – next week will be interesting when Cannon and others
report. So thank you. And then Luca, if you could possibly just talk about some of your initial thoughts on what you've
seen at Xerox opportunities. You've been there a few months now. It'd be great to get your take on it.
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. I think probably the word
to summarize my thoughts is execution. When I look at some of the commitments that we've made, we need to execute
on those commitments. From an operational standpoint, we are in the midst of a large restructuring program which we
have announced but we need to execute now. We are doing a very important synergy activity with the combination of
ACS and Xerox and both on the revenue end and on the cost side. And we've got a number of new products that we
need to launch on cost, on time, on quality.
And then we've got a lot of financial commitments. We talked about EPS growth. We talked about cash generation. We
talked about debt repayment and, of course, the share buy-back. Those are commitments that we are fully committed to.
And we will execute again.
And then from an overall business perspective when you look a bit longer term, the key for us is revenue growth. It
needs to be profitable. That's why we're so focused on these revenue opportunities that we've got with a combination of
Xerox and ACS. And then that's why we continue to be focused on acquisitions. That's why we continue to be focused
on refreshing our product portfolio. And international growth is important for us and that's why we are focusing on
places where maybe traditionally we were not as focused as we are today.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: All right. Great. Thanks. Just two pretty important things I want to clear up. Last quarter on your
slide deck, Slide 10, you said cash flow from core ops of $2.8 billion. And this time on Slide 11 you're saying $2.5.
Now I think you're trying to say the same thing, because there's some receivables, some from the financing division,
that are floating around. And I just want you to clear that up, because I think that some folks today think that these

slides don't match up and that there's $300 million less in free cash flow for the year. And I'd like you to clear that up
right now.
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: I'll clear it up. My purpose was
to simplify the chart and really what should matter to investors is cash from operations, which has always been $2.5
billion. The number has not changed and it's not changing. At a certain point we talked – kind of as a subset of cash
from operations – we talked about cash from core operations of $2.8 and then we said that there would be a use of $300
million from the growth of our finance asset portfolio.
But cash from operations is what matters. It's $2.5, it was always $2.5. And then how that translates into available cash,
that also has not changed. It's one to $1.2 billion. And you just go from the $2.5 of cash from operations, then we go to
our CapEx of about $600 million. And then we talked about that reduction of $600 million and dividends of $300,
right? So, that's the math. Nothing has changed. We just kind of simplified the chart and really the metric that matters
to us is cash from operations.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Okay, and then on top of this, there's $300 million in finance receivables that will roll off that are
not included here?
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: That's correct and we're going
to – well, no, it means that our receivables related to the finance assets are going to grow by $300 million and therefore
cash from core operations, before our finance asset portfolio, has to be $2.8, because there's going be usage of $300
from the finance assets.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Okay. No. Okay. Then I got it. Great. I misspoke, but when you exit. Okay. I got it.
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: So nothing has changed 100%.
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Nothing has changed.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: And the basic cash flow is still the same and you just simplified it.
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Nothing's changed.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Now, Ursula and Luca, a question for you. When you mentioned the cash flow in your speech,
Ursula, you said that it was strong and it was a big focus and it's absolutely coming back. When you mentioned what
you're going to use it for, you said acquisitions. But in your slide, it says majority going to share repurchases. I assume
you meant the majority going to share repurchases and then a minority going to acquisitions. I just want to be clear on
that.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Actually if you – I think I said exactly what
you just said, which is that we'll have $1 to $1.2 billion. We'll use 70% of that, or the majority of that, for share
repurchase and we'll then make acquisitions. On this cash statement, on this cash discussion, $2.8 million to $2.5
million to $1 million to $1.2 million, 70% of the $1 million to $1.2 million for share repurchase and acquisitions. The
vast majority of the $1 million to $1.2 million is share repurchase. Nothing has changed.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Right.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Nothing has changed.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: And it can start in August, right?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It can start in the second half of the year, which is
what we said. You're not going to pin me down to in August, second half of the year. On the call, I want everyone to be
confident of the following things. One, that we will generate the cash. That's what we do. We've done it for as long as
I've been here and Luca has not changed one step in that. Actually, he's put additional focus on it. We'll get $2.8. We'll
use $300 million for finance receivables. We'll get to $2.5. We'll use CapEx, et cetera, et cetera, get to $1 million to

$1.2 million. We'll take 70% of that and we'll buy back shares as soon as we can start doing it. And then the rest of it,
we'll use for acquisitions, for dividends, for whatever we can think of that's really great with the rest of the cash that we
have.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: And then just a nit, Luca, on modeling. Should we use a 29% tax rate going forward? And what
should we model for equity income? Should it just be something around $30 million a quarter or $20 million to $30
million a quarter net of restructuring charges for Fuji Xerox? Thanks. That's it.
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: The guidance for the tax rate is
31% for the rest of the year. So 29% in Q1 was just an outcome, but we continue to see about 31%. And obviously the
equity income for Fuji Xerox is a question mark also for us. So maybe we can compare notes, but yeah 20% to 30% is
the number.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. Great. Thanks. Ursula and Luca, I was hoping that you might be able to give us some
idea of how to think about gross margin here over the next quarter or two, given the puts and takes that you talked
about during your prepared comments. On the one hand, it seems like you're going to have some extra costs associated
with air freighting equipment and expediting stuff out of Japan. On the other hand, currency is moving back in the right
direction, and my understanding is that you typically go back and renegotiate your supply contracts with Fuji Xerox
with a one-to-two quarter lag and recoup some of the negative impact of currency over time. So how should we think
about gross margins over the next quarter or two?
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: So I would say this quarter was
affected by – half a point was currency, right? And then the rest was this shift of our mix of revenues towards services
that carries lower gross margin. Going forward, I would say that we should be seeing an improving trend on gross
margins.
You're absolutely right. I think freight will be a headwind because of the situation in Japan. But using today's rates, the
currency headwind is mitigating significantly. There is a lot of volatility in FX these days, so every day is a different
story but as a trend, currency should be much less of a headwind.
And typically – I mean Q1 is the weakest quarter that we have, right? So with a bit more activity, that will help gross
margins as well. So those are the big variables there. But we've said all along, 33% to 35%. We believe that we're going
to be in that range for the year.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And Rick, if I just may on Fuji Xerox contract, we
do generally – we continually negotiate with Fuji Xerox and hedge currency with them and so on. But Fuji Xerox today
is a little different than they were 12 months ago, obviously, so they're scrambling. I don't expect that we'll have
massive shifts in costs to Fuji Xerox that will help us mitigate this headwind. With that, I think that we'll still be in 33%
to 35% range that we talked about.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. Great. And then I guess one follow-up for you, Ursula. You referred to the fact that
you did expect production of black and white pages to continue to decline. It looked like black and white pages were
down high single digits in the quarter, backing into that from the other data that you provided. Does this weaker page
growth change your view at all regarding the sustainable growth rates for the core business? And do you still think that
pages can grow at some point as we get deeper into an up cycle?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I think -

<Q - Richard Gardner>: Or is this the new norm for us?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No. I think that what – first of all, I think that we
should wait – I have to wait another quarter to see more data. This quarter, while the results were very solid for the
company, we had some interesting signals this quarter – or interesting inputs that I don't consider normal And I'd like to
be able to see our way through those a bit before I make a prediction or update my prediction.
So without an updated prediction, I would say that black and white pages are – will not accelerate significantly, the
decline of them, and that color pages will not accelerate significantly from the way that we were thinking about them in
the past. So I think that we'll get through this first half of the year, maybe the first three quarters of the year, and be able
to see that there's not a lot from how we look at the business that's changed substantially.
The Middle East and Japan and the affect of that on how we can fulfill needs and how customers buy, et cetera, is
something that I want to see a little bit more clearly, so I'd wait until quarter two. Color pages continue to grow. I think
that's good, digital pages in general. Color pages are now about a quarter of the pages that we generate. It's 33% of the
MIF. I think that'll continue to grow. Our total digital MIF is growing. So I think that there's nothing that would say that
it would fundamentally change. But I think we need another quarter to see how this all works out.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Hi, Ursula. I had one for you. I wanted to broaden the capital allocation question. And that is
as you look at the next couple of years, philosophically, how are you thinking about the longer-term allocation of
capital between the buckets of M&A and then buybacks and dividends? And particularly within the context of M&A,
trying to understand how you think about the capital allocation between, say, the core Xerox business, the previous –
the legacy business, I should say, and then the new services business? Because clearly the growth trajectory – you're
having great results on ACS, and the core Xerox business is having a little bit of trouble here with the economic cycles
in Japan. But just want to understand longer term, how do you think about that allocation process?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's a good question. So for the – for 2012, our
focus 2011, 2012 is going to be on buying back shares. So most of the capital that we get – well for 2011, obviously,
we'll start it later this year and in 2012 we have a pretty big chunk to go in buying back shares. So for the near term,
that's the focus, obviously.
But we generate more cash than we need to use in buying back shares. So clearly after that, we'll continue our M&A
cycle. We're doing that today. We've bought five, six companies so far this year. So we'll continue doing that and then
we will clearly, I think, tail end of this year start speaking to the Board and the Board and us will considering what the
heck we do with the dividend.
So, that progress will continue 2011, 2012. And as we get beyond that, we'll have to see. We'll continue to generate a
significant amount of cash, $2 billion plus, and we'll have to invest it. And we'll buy back shares in a reasonable sense,
but after a while it gets kind of – you run out of energy on that one. So we'll switch to M&A and to dividends.
As far as allocations towards core and our core business, the Technology business and the Services business, we are –
our Technology business CapEx is fairly well defined. It's around $300 million plus or minus a little bit, and I don't see
a significant shift, growth or a significant decline, in that.
So I think that as we move forward on CapEx, the way that you can think about it, and the way you should think about
it on capital allocation in general, is more and more will go towards services. Our R&D is going to shift more and more

towards our services. Our acquisitions clearly are more in the services space et cetera, et cetera. So you'll see a shift in
our capital allocations towards the growth in services, but we will not walk away from the Technology business until
it's worthwhile to do that.
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Just to add on acquisitions. The
acquisitions that we make for, call it traditional Xerox, are very much focused on distribution, right. And those
acquisitions have worked very well for us, and it's very important for us to broaden our coverage, both here in the U.S.
and overseas. We made probably the largest acquisition that we made here in Q1 is a company in the U.K., distribution
company in the U.K. Very, very important for us to continue to do that, because it helps us offset some of the negative
trends that you see on the technology front. So I think it's very balanced and it's not different from what we were doing
in the past.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: One last point here.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Yeah. I guess I'm surprised at – go ahead, Ursula?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And that's that we do play – we have an advantage
that we have Fuji Xerox who will continue to focus more heavily on investing in the technology side from an R&D
perspective than Xerox does and Xerox will as we go forward. So we get to play a very good harmonized game here
where we can utilize the expertise in Fuji Xerox to continue to fuel our technology R&D. We help them do that
obviously, but – and we'll spend a little bit more time focusing on our services. I'm sorry, go ahead.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Right. I guess I'm surprised to see you continue to invest more in the distribution space, given
what I think is just a tremendous opportunities on the other side, the services space specifically.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I tell you – I mean, I would be – if I were
you, I'd be really nervous if we didn't try to figure out a way to cover more of the small and mid-sized business growth
around the world. I mean, that would be walking away from easy – "easy" money. Our big gap, we cover the high end
marketplace very well with our technology and our distribution. We do it extremely well, but as you know, that part of
the market is not growing as quickly as the small to mid-size business and it is significantly more focused on
margin-lowering activities than the small to mid-size business. So what – our distribution expansion is all around
covering a place where our share is probably half as much as our share in the high end of the business.
So the reason why we're continuing to invest is because it's business smarts to do. I mean, the technology that we have
applies there just as well as it does at the high end. And don't misinterpret my comments. I'm not saying that I'm going
to not invest in services. I'm shifting quite a bit to services and expanding our investments there. I just don't believe it's
prudent. We don't believe it is prudent to walk away from this very lucrative technology segment way before you have
to.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay. Well, thanks for that answer. I just wanted to ask about, then – my final question is just
on OpEx. As you think about absolute dollars of spend in OpEx, if I look at say June and September, what does that
number look like? Is it flat, down, up?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Probably flat. I think it's probably throughout the
year tending upwards, tending upwards, because our revenue in the third and fourth quarter in particular is growing,
will grow. It will grow at a pace higher than it did in the first quarter and than it will in the second quarter. So as our
revenue grows, our OpEx will have to grow to support that growth.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay. All right. Well, many thanks. I'll cede the floor.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Ursula and
Luca, could you maybe talk through some of the interplay that we're beginning to see between services signings and
services revenue growth? I guess those dynamics, particularly as the signings of – the growth has sort of come down to
the low single digits where it is now. What should we expect through the year on each of those metrics? And I guess
ultimately, maybe you could look towards – I mean, maybe not 2012, I know you don't want to give guidance, but I
guess what ultimately should we think of as sort of normalized signings growth rates when things settle in?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. So I'll start and Luca can jump in if he has
anything to add. So first of all, most important metric is revenue and we're really pleased with our overall revenue
growth, the combination of new business signings – which is really important so you get new business that adds onto
the revenue that you have – and the annuity revenue that we have, that we will continue to get – we have and will
continue to get from already committed signed contracts is exciting there and you saw the growth in revenue there,
BPO up eight. Document outsourcing a really good rebound, up four and ITO up one after a strong first quarter of
about 5% growth. So, we – across the board, we're happy with revenue. That comes because we signed things
previously. And if you could – the way that you should think about signings is that we have – as I said – I didn't say
this yet.
We had a uptick in ITO signings that was fairly dramatic, doubled our signings in ITO. We had an uptick in document
outsourcing signings that was very dramatic, the year-on-year increase upwards of 40%. So it will continue to drive
revenue. Our signings are very good. BPO signings were very strong. You have to think about the fact that we signed a
$1.6 billion, ten-year contract in 2000 – this is a rich man's problem to explain. You have a signing like California
Medicaid and then I have to explain the fact it's not growing as much. I have no problem with that. So signings in BPO
and ITO and document outsourcing, all good. The pipeline of signings is mixed very well.
The pipeline is mixed very well. So signings on the go-forward should be good across the board, ITO, BPO, and
document outsourcing. And our synergies pipeline is up. Synergies – pipeline is up 29%, which includes synergy
signings. So, I think if you look at signings across the board, we are very pleased with them. We continue to win in all
the segments that we focus on. There will be compares that are difficult in certain quarters, because we did greater the
previous quarter, but at net, pure dollars, doing extremely well.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: And I guess – Ursula, I appreciate that. That's helpful, because signings is something I think
that you folks are going to increasingly become focused on. Is there any way that we can think of what a normalized
signings growth would be? Or over time, should we think of the signings growth approximating the revenue growth?
Just so that when we see it move around – or should we expect it to move around simply because of the nature of the
verticals that ACS is attached to and maybe they're more prone to mega deals? I guess should we expect the kind of
movement that we've seen the last few quarters? Is that normal just, so that we know it's normal, or should we expect
some kind of approximation eventually through revenue growth?
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Ananda, I think you know well
signings is not a perfect metric, right? There is a lot of variability within the numbers. Think about the fact that we
participate in some many verticals and the duration of these contracts can be extremely different. You go from a threeto
five-year contract and then, our transportation business, sometimes we talk about a 50-year contract, right?
So, obviously when you sign a very long-term contract, then you skew the numbers. So you need to expect some kind
of volatility there. Think of our ITO business this quarter. It was up more than 100%. Obviously, it's that type of stuff.
So it's very difficult to give you a normalized rate. Of course, you know in the very, very, very long term, it should
approximate revenue growth, but particularly when you talk about quarter comparisons, it's going be moving up and
down a lot.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Next question, please. Thanks, Ananda.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Ireland with JMP Securities.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Doug.
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: Hi, Ursula. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about any impact you saw in the
services business in the budget delays and some of the uncertainty around government budgets. Has there been any
impact there?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We're really pleased with our government
business. It's about – it's a big piece of our BPO business, as you know. It's about 40% of the BPO ITO business and if
you remove transportation, it's a little bit lower than that. So we're pleased with it. It is something that we focus on
assuring that we win. Now, have we seen impact? As more people are employed, the less unemployment there is.
So we have definitely seen volume decline, slower volumes, in our service of the government from an unemployment
perspective. And we've seen a little bit of lower volumes, or a little bit lower revenue as some of the contracts that we
won are now ending. Not ending that we lost them, they're ending because they ended, the service is done.
But the way that we manage this business is that we actually mix it across the board. So while that's going down
slightly, we have to actually increase, and we have increased, our signings and our revenue on the commercial side.
The answer is yes, a little bit, but not any way that would have me consider government being anything but a very, very
lucrative and extremely important portion of our business. But yes, we've seen some downward turn there, but not
significant.
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: Thank you. The other question I had is a little bit more theoretical. Could you give us a sense
of the assumptions you're making about the printing business that drive your investment in distribution? I mean, are
you looking at this purely from a market share gain in cutting off distribution of competitors and getting higher
consideration with the same win rate? Or are you looking at a longer-term growth opportunity? I'm just wondering
what's driving that decision-making.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, so I think that you should look at it from a
purely financial perspective. And obviously the next, the step right before the revenue and profit potential of the
business is you have to get share. So – let me back up. Big thing here is color. If you didn't have a black and white
business, let's suppose there was no history in black and white, everyone in the world who is competing today would be
competing to get a position in this color page market, because it is lucrative, because it is growing. So our investment
here is in distribution, in R&D and it's pointed heavily towards color across the spectrum, low to high. That's it.
At the same time, we have a black and white business that we still have to service. It's not growing, but it throws off
cash and it's reasonably profitable. So the way that we look at it is running after the part of the business that is growing
and that is profitable and that's exciting, and keeping hold of, for as long as is reasonable, the part of the business that
customers still want, but at a lowering demand rate. So that's the shift that we're making here. And in order to service
that, we need to actually have distribution. We have to have products that serve the customers' needs.
You shouldn't think about us investing a whole lot of money in black and white R&D or black and white
manufacturing, because that's not what we're doing. Most of our investments in R&D, and one of the ways that we can
make this shift and in some ways downturn in R&D, is by focusing our energies on the parts of the business that are
growing.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Hi. Thanks very much. Ursula, just a follow-up to an earlier question on deal trends in the
services business, especially for BPO and ITO, can you give us some color in what you're seeing in terms of sales
cycles and also in the pricing environment? And then just as a follow-up for Luca, also on services, can you help us
think about margin progression as we go through the year? Specifically as you ramp some new services revenue
opportunities, how should we be thinking about the lag between when you start recognizing those revenues versus the
up-front costs associated with that? Thanks very much.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Sales cycle, I'll do it relatively quickly and then
this will be the last question for the group. Sales cycles, I think what you can think about is not a significant change in
trend from previous discussions that I've had. But let me remind what they were. For very – there are different
segments of our business in the BPO space and in the BPO space, if you think about government, the sales cycles are
generally long – when I say long, a year, a year plus, kind of sales cycles. The deals are generally larger.
And our win rate in these long sales cycles, large deals is very good. We have over half the states, for example, in
Medicaid, et cetera, et cetera. So you'll see long sales cycles, difficult, challenging sales cycles that you have to stick
with and that we can – that we win. And it's actually a good business, a difficult one, but a very good business.
In some of the ITO spaces, the sales cycles are shorter, significantly shorter, a quarter or less, and the deals are smaller,
obviously. We have two that we signed this year, this first quarter, that are longer and bigger than historically, but
generally ITO has some walk-in takeover deals and they have some shorter cycle deals. So you see the spectrum of
them.
Document outsourcing is definitely in between those two, not short, not as long as some of the healthcare, BPO type
deals, but they're in the middle of it. So you see them across the board, different durations of selling before you actually
win. And the alignment between how long it takes to sell and the size of the deal is pretty much one to one. Because a
long sale cycle deal is generally a lot bigger.
Pricing, what we see is that the going pricing for a new deal is generally attractive, very attractive. It remains attractive
through the contract. Renewals are generally at a lower pricing than the old – than the first time in, for sure, almost
everywhere. And what we find is that what supports this lower pricing is our intimacy and knowledge and the
customer's intimacy and knowledge of us. So we can actually still extract good margins, equal margins or improving
margins, the longer we are with a customer, because we actually know how to actually streamline the operations we
give to them.
One of the things that we do, for example, is to never make the margins get too high, because the customers would
actually feel disappointed and think that we were actually not sharing the benefits adequately with them. So whenever
we get a really wide margin spread, we would go to a customer and renegotiate it before the contract was up. So
margins, pricing on a new deal is lower than pricing on the old – on a renewed deal is lower than pricing on the old
deal. Margins should be the same, and if we're really good at how we manage it, a little bit of growth in the margin
portion. And then, Luca?
<A - Luca Maestri, Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: So from a ramp-up perspective,
keep in mind we've got a very, very diversified portfolio of services, right. So a lot depends on the mix of the portfolio.
In places like ITO or customer care, the ramp-up is fairly quick. In other places, within BPO or transportation, for
example, we're talking about much longer ramp-up periods, up to 18 months. And also the profitability of the different
lines of business is different. So the net outcome of this is very influenced by mix.
We do expect – you were asking about okay, how do we think about gross margins for the Services business for the rest
of the year. We do expect the margin to be more or less where we are right now, maybe a slight improvement, because
we continue to work on both on restructuring initiatives and also in synergies also on the services side. It's no longer
related to technology. So flat to slightly up for the year.
