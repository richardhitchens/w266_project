O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, List. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Regions Financial. Fourth quarter results
reflected continued progress toward achieving our primary goal of returning Regions to sustainable profitability.
In the quarter Regions' reported earnings were $36 million or $0.03 per share profit, which included elevated credit
costs that were partially offset by our decision to preserve our capital position by recognizing approximately $333
million of investment security gains. On an after-tax basis the impact of security gains amounted to approximately
$0.16 per share. Credit costs, including provisioning, OREO and marks on loans held for sale, were an estimated $0.37
per share after tax.
Notably, our core business performance this quarter included solid growth in middle market C&I loans of $1 billion or
5%, strong low-cost deposit growth of $1.1 billion or 2%, and an increase in our net interest income and margin and a
$47 million or 6% rise in adjusted non-interest income. Additionally, loan loss provision matched net charge-offs of
682 million. Although challenges remain, we are encouraged by signs of economic recovery, generally improving
credit quality metrics, and our continued success in profitably expanding our customer base.
We are recognizing an improving economy in most of our markets, but we expect the southeastern economy to recover
at a somewhat slower pace, particularly in Florida, where housing remains a serious concern and unemployment
continues to stubbornly hover near 12%.
We expect to continue to make steady progress towards our goal of returning Regions to sustainable profitability, while
also aggressively working through problem assets and reducing our more stressed loan portfolios. We did sell $405
million in distressed loans and foreclosed property in the fourth quarter, and our investor real estate loans at period end
totaled $15.9 billion. We have taken a strong stance and subjected our loan portfolios to rigorous internal and external
reviews. We have a solid understanding of the risk of our portfolio and are confident in our ability to successfully
resolve the remaining problem assets.
Furthermore, early- and late-stage delinquencies are down again, and internally risk-rated problem loans have now
declined for the fourth quarter in a row, a precursor, we think, to additional improvements in non-performing loan
inflows. In fact, fourth quarter gross non-performing inflows, while still elevated, were down approximately $400
million or 29% from the third quarter level. Total non-performing assets declined over $300 million linked quarter or
7%, marking the third consecutive quarterly decrease. Investor real estate continues to drive non-performing loan
inflows at 56% of the total non-performing loan inflow this quarter.
As a result, we remain disciplined and cautious in our continuous assessment of credit quality, which has led us to
classify a number of credits as non-performing due to identified weaknesses even though they are current and paying as
agreed. With that in mind, approximately 37% of business services non-performing loans at year end were current and
paying as agreed, an increase from 36% at September 30.
Income-producing investor real estate accounted for 29% of fourth quarter total non-performing loan inflows compared
to 23% a year ago. Although we're devoting considerable time and resources to working through credit issues, the
majority of our associates' focus is on profitable growth in our core business. In the fourth quarter alone average
low-cost deposits grew $1.4 billion, bringing the full year 2010 increase to nearly $7 billion. This further improved our
deposit mix and lowered our overall deposit cost. And for the second consecutive year I'm proud to say that we again
achieved a strong year in new checking account openings, with 996,000 opened, right at our goal of 1 million new
accounts.

At year end, CDs represented 24% of total deposits, down from 32% in the same period last year. Our overall costs of
deposits have declined 51 basis points from 115 basis points a year ago and a total 64 basis points for the fourth quarter
of last year. During 2011 we expect our deposit mix and costs to continue to improve.
As to loans, commercial loan production totaled $14.4 billion, of which 4.9 was new loan production, a 50% increase
over the same period in the prior year. We experienced solid C&I loan growth in the fourth quarter. C&I period loans,
primarily middle market, were up 5% or $1 billion linked quarter. Notably, C&I increases were more broadly
distributed across our footprint as 14 of 20 markets increased C&I outstandings in the quarter, and at the top of the
company we have increased C&I outstandings overall for six straight months.
This did not come from line utilization. Line utilization remains at historic levels, just slightly above 40%, as
commercial customers are still not yet building their working capital. But we are seeing loan growth from capital
expenditures, mergers, acquisitions and industries with high capital needs, such as healthcare, transportation and oil and
gas. And importantly, much of our loan growth is attributed to taking market share from competitors.
In the fourth quarter we experienced a 5% growth in line commitments, and our sales pipelines remain strong.
Consumer loan production was $3.2 billion, with $2.6 billion in mortgage production and importantly $143 million of
all the lending production. Consumer loan outstandings continue to decline, as individuals are still paying down debt,
but we are starting to see positive signs. Mortgage production for the year was $8.2 billion and as I mentioned $2.6
billion for the fourth quarter alone. In the fourth quarter we did reduce investor real estate $1.6 billion, bringing full
year 2010's decline to approximately $6 billion. Additionally, aggregate loans outstanding were also impacted by the
fourth quarter, by the sale of approximately $965 million in residential first mortgages, which David will provide
further detail in a moment.
Looking ahead, we continue to leverage our strength as a top small business lender. By emphasizing our branch-based
small business lending to preferred industries, staying focused on increasing sales of existing products, and introducing
new consumer product solutions, we expect to see positive results from changes in our consumer and small business
model. Furthermore, we should see middle market C&I loans continue to grow this year as we benefit from our strong
franchise, active calling program, broad-based product capability and superior customer service. Nonetheless, total
loans outstandings are likely to be challenged in 2011 due to the ongoing de-risking strategy of our portfolio.
Fee income is another area where our growth strategies are paying off. Our 2010 mortgage production of $8.2 billion
was the second best in Region's history. Morgan Keegan achieved results of 12% over third quarter and 9% over the
same period a year ago. Assets under management were up to $157 billion, are 3.5% higher than third quarter and 7.9%
over prior year period.
We also experienced a record quarter in interchange and ATM income for the year of $368 million. Debit card income
is up 18% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by an 8% increase in cards and a 13% increase in spending
levels. In addition, our new checking account customers are electing to have debit cards 87% of the time, a record level
of penetration for this product. In fact, despite a tough operating environment, we have achieved year-over-year fourth
quarter growth in virtually all of our fee-based businesses.
Nevertheless, depending on ultimate regulatory changes related to interchange fees and the timing of their
implementation, we face additional fee income challenges in 2011. We are working to develop mitigation strategies to
rationalize our business under these proposed rule changes. These changes obviously will impact the way we charge for
banking services. But as always, our business requires that we deliver value to our customers in terms of service,
products, features and pricing. We are trying to better understand both the intended and the unintended consequences of
these changes. But we know our business and we will promptly make the necessary adjustments.
In summary, we're encouraged by an improving economic environment this year and strongly believe we have the
appropriate strategies in place to capitalize on quality revenue growth opportunities while continuing to limit operating
expenses and eliminate non-essential spending. Regulatory challenges will present revenue headwinds, but we're
already taking steps to mitigate the potential negative impact. Our customer focus is resulting in incrementally
profitable business and increasing market share. Although credit costs are expected to remain elevated in the near term,

they should begin to diminish during the year. Our capital and liquidity positions are strong. All in all, we expect
continued progress towards our primary goal, returning Regions to sustainable profitability.
Finally, I want to thank Regions associates for their hard work. Their attention to service quality and loyalty continue to
pay off in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. The company's success on this front has been validated by Gallup,
which has identified Regions as a top-decile performer in customer loyalty. According to J.D. Power and Associates,
Regions ranks among the most improved retails banks in customer satisfaction and in the top five in customer
satisfaction in the country among primary mortgage servicing companies, and Regions also ranked fourth in the 2010
U.S. Small Business Banking Satisfaction survey.
Independent research by TNS ranks Regions' brand favorability the highest of 11 major banks tested within our
company's markets. Additionally, Prime Performance recently recognized Regions as a top scorer in the category of
friendliness and best overall satisfaction with service among all large and regional banks, which favorably positions
Regions to gain market share.
By adhering to our strategy of focusing on the customer, we are continuing to build a stronger company, which will
result in long-term benefit to our stakeholders.
David?
David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice
President
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results on Slide 1.
As Grayson mentioned, our fourth quarter earnings amounted to $0.03 per diluted share. Pre-tax pre-provision net
revenue or PPNR totaled $824 million, including several non-core transactions, which are reflected in the supplement
on Page 10, and included $333 million in security gains, a $26 million gain related to residential mortgage loan sales,
$59 million in leveraged lease termination gains, which were offset by a similar amount of tax expense, and a $55
million loss related to the early extinguishment of debt.
Adjusting for these items, our adjusted PPNR was $461 million, 2% higher than the prior quarter and 19% higher
compared to the same period a year ago. On an annual basis, adjusted PPNR was 4% higher for the full year 2010
versus 2009. Within PPNR, net interest income was up $9 million, and the resulting net interest margin improved four
basis points to 3%.
Adjusted non-interest revenues totaled $795 million, up 6% linked quarter, reflecting strong revenues at Morgan
Keegan. Increased debit card volume and fee-based account growth helped somewhat offset the negative impact from
Regulation E. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased $49 million or 4% third to fourth quarter, negatively impacted
by an increase in professional and legal fees and incentive-based compensation.
Regarding credit quality, the level of non-performing loans declined over $200 million or 6% linked quarter. This
represents the third consecutive quarter of declining non-performing loans. The provision for loan losses declined $78
million to $682 million and essentially equaled net charge-offs. Our allowance to net loans ratio increased seven basis
points to 3.84%.
Let's now take a more detailed look at our credit results, beginning with NPL inflows. The inflow of non-performing
loans declined to $947 million in the fourth quarter, 29% less than the third quarter's $1.3 billion. Our early- and
late-stage delinquencies are down again, and our internally risk-rated problem loans declined for the fourth consecutive
quarter. These asset quality indicators serve as an important barometer in estimating future inflows of problem loans.
And as a result, we expect future NPL inflows to continue this downward trend throughout 2011.
Income-producing commercial real estate continues to drive NPL inflows, accounting for 29% of fourth quarter's
migration. As a reminder, income-producing CRE credits can be more easily restructured and should ultimately result

in lower loss severities than our land, condo and single-family portfolio, which together totaled $3.2 billion as of year
end. These portfolios contributed approximately 28% of fourth quarter's NPL inflows.
A substantial portion of our non-performing loans continues to be current and paying as agreed. Thirty-seven percent of
our total business services NPLs that remained as of year end were current and paying as agreed, up from 36% in the
third quarter and 23% from a year ago.
Now let's look at our overall non-performing assets. As you can see, non-performing assets declined 7% this quarter
from 4.2 billion to 3.9 billion and have now declined three consecutive quarters. We sold over $405 million of NPAs
this quarter at a discount of approximately 25%, with $96 million consisting of OREO and the remaining $309 million
from non-accrual asset sales.
Moving on to net charge-offs, net charge-offs declined $78 million linked quarter, $682 million, for an annualized
3.22% of average loans. At year-end 2010, our loan loss allowance to non-performing loan coverage ratio was 101%,
up from a year earlier's 89% as well as the prior quarter's 94%. The continued decline in gross migration of
non-performing loans and the continued decline in non-performing loan balances will be key indicators in determining
our provision expense in future periods.
Turning to the balance sheet, Slide 5 breaks down this quarter's change in loans. Ending and average loans were down
2%. However, again this quarter we saw strength in our middle market C&I loan portfolio, as average and ending loans
increased 3% and 5% linked quarter, respectively. Much of this loan growth was attributable to taking market share
from our competitors, as is evidenced by growth in line commitments, which increased from 25 billion in September to
26.3 billion or 5% at the end of the year. And as Grayson stated earlier, our customers' utilization rates have not
returned to normalized levels but continue to persist at low rates of approximately 40%. In fact, 25% of our Business
Services customers with a commitment have zero outstanding balances.
Ending investor real estate declined 9% and has been reduced 27% this year. We will continue to de-risk this portfolio
in 2011 and are still targeting to reduce this portfolio to 100% of the bank's risk-based capital, which currently
approximates $14 billion. The linked quarter decline in residential first mortgage portfolio is due to a $965 million sale,
which I will discuss in a moment.
Moving on to deposits, ending and average deposits were relatively stable third to fourth quarter, but the mix continues
to improve, with average low-cost deposits up 2% compared to a 7% decline in average time deposits. For the year,
average low-cost deposits rose 11% compared to a 27% decline in time deposits. Our shift in funding mix to low-cost
deposits is favorably impacting our total funding costs as well. In fact, our total funding costs declined 11 basis points
to 0.91% in the quarter.
Taxable equivalent net interest income improved $10 million or 1% linked quarter and increased $97 million or 3% for
the full year 2010 versus 2009. The net interest margin improved four basis points during the quarter to 3% and was up
28 basis point year over year. Deposit costs declined another six basis points to 0.64% in the fourth quarter and have
declined 51 basis points in total this year. Pricing opportunities remain to reduce deposit costs, as we have
approximately $13.5 billion of CDs maturing in 2011, and of that we have $4.8 billion of CDs maturing in the first
quarter that carry an average rate of 2.28% and will be re-priced at lower market rates.
We continue to experience improvement in loan pricing, as evidenced by this quarter's five basis points rise in loan
yields to 4.34%. We remain disciplined when pricing new loans, ensuring we are appropriately paid for the risk we are
taking, and believe that going forward, widening loan spreads will be a key determinant of margin improvement. That
said, the margin will face some headwinds in the near term. As a result of the ratings actions during the fourth quarter,
we became more defensive from a liquidity perspective and continued to maintain a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 88%.
Excess liquidity impacted the margin by 11 basis points this quarter compared to eight basis points in the prior quarter.
During the fourth quarter we executed sales of $8.1 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, resulting in $333
million of security gains, the proceeds of which were reinvested in similar securities with slightly longer durations. And
as previously noted, we also sold $965 million of residential first mortgages in the fourth quarter and reinvested the
proceeds in Ginnie Mae securities. Both of these transactions allow us to preserve capital. As a result of the securities

repositioning, the sale of mortgage loans and increases in longer duration deposits, the balance sheet in total remains
asset sensitive. However, the impact to our net interest margin from our investment portfolio repositioning and the
other activities for the first quarter is estimated to be between 5 and 10 basis points lower.
Let's now shift gears and look at non-interest revenue and expenses for the quarter. Adjusted non-interest revenues
increased 6% linked quarter, driven by solid interchange income due to increased debit card volume and fee-based
account growth, and an increase in Morgan Keegan revenues, which reflected strength in investment banking and
private clients. Non-interest revenue was negatively impacted $13 million by mortgage servicing rights valuations.
Regulation E negatively impacted service charge revenue in the second half of 2010 by approximately $57 million,
which is in line with our estimate last quarter of between 50 and $60 million.
We began migrating accounts from free to fee eligible last May, and by March 1 of this year all of our new and existing
checking accounts will be fee eligible. This, along with our mitigation efforts and interchange income growth is largely
offsetting Regulation E's effect. Importantly, we have implemented these changes while still growing low-cost deposits.
Excluding the impact of the Durbin amendment, which is not yet finalized, we expect 2011 core non-interest revenues
to increase somewhat over the 2010 level.
Excluding the $55 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, fourth quarter adjusted non-interest expenses rose $49
million or 4% linked quarter due to a $21 million linked quarter rise in professional and legal fees and incentive-based
compensation. Expenses related to other real estate owned and loans held for sale continued to be elevated and
amounted to $75 million in the fourth quarter versus $70 million in the third quarter. However, in 2011 these costs are
expected to gradually improve versus fourth quarter 2010's level.
We fully recognize that in today's environment we must remain diligent in our efforts to manage expenses, especially
since we continue to forecast a low growth, low rate environment for an extended period of time. Consequently, we
constantly review all areas of staffing and have eliminated approximately 700 positions in 2010. We also review
occupancy and discretionary expenditures for opportunities to improve productivity and efficiency. We expect our core
non-interest expenses in 2011 to be slightly down from the 2010 level.
Let me now discuss our capital and liquidity. As part of our capital planning process we recently concluded our capital
plan for our Board and regulatory supervisors. Our current Tier 1 common and Tier 1 ratios stand at a solid 7.9% and
12.4%, respectively, and on a Basel III pro forma are 7.6 and 11.4%, well above the respective 7% and 8.5%
minimums required under Basel III. Let me also point out that our capital ratios at the bank level remain healthy as
well.
When evaluating our capital ratios we primarily manage the Tier 1 common ratio, because we believe that risk-based
measure is the most appropriate one in assessing our capital. Our liquidity at both the bank and the holding company
remains solid.
In summary, we believe that fourth quarter results demonstrate that we are making solid progress in executing our plan
to return Regions to sustainable profitability.
With that, operator, that concludes our remarks, and we can open it up for questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Kevin St. Pierre>: The third quarter 10-Q, you had identified $1 billion of potential problem commercial and
investor real estate loans, and then looking at the NPL inflow slide, Slide 2, is it correct that about 700 million of those
went on NPL status?

<Q - Kevin St. Pierre>: I'm looking at the NPL inflows by type, Slide 2, the left side.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: So restate your question
again, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin St. Pierre>: So in the Q, you had identified approximately – it said approximately as of September 30,
2010, you had approximately 1 billion of potential problem commercial and invested real estate. So...
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: That's the 947 million is
equivalent to that $1 billion that we stated were the potential problems.
<Q - Kevin St. Pierre>: So the 947 is the number now?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: 947 is the actual number
that migrated into non-performing this quarter. The $1 billion was our estimate of those loans that were current, paying
as agreed. They were accruing loans that had the potential because of some risk that we saw in them could migrate in
the future quarters to non-performing, so the 947 came out of that $1 billion.
<Q - Kevin St. Pierre>: Okay. So predominantly all of them flowed into non-performing.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: That's correct.
<Q - Kevin St. Pierre>: Okay. And can you update that $1 billion number for December 31?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: What we can tell you is
that – and we will have that obviously disclosed in our Q when we finish our calculation, but if you look at our
early-stage delinquencies and you look at our late-stage delinquencies, you look at our internally risk-rated problem
loans that we're saying all of those are down, which gives us confidence that our migration is trending down. We have
not come up with a final number of what will be in the 10-K at the end of the year yet.
<Q - Kevin St. Pierre>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin of FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just regarding the NPA inflows, they were
down linked quarter, but if I recall correctly third quarter had a change in policy on the NPA side, which contributed to
some of that growth. I guess were there any changes at all in NPA policy this quarter or any kind of 4Q clean-up?
Because we were kind of expecting a lower level of NPA inflows.
<A - Barb Godin>: Well, there was really no – this is Barb Godin. There was no clean-up this quarter and even last
quarter. It wasn't a policy change, it was just a more rigorous review of what was actually in our portfolios to make sure
that we have identified everything where there was no guarantor support, as an example, that we decided that we would
move those into non-performing loans. That's the reason you saw the spike last quarter. But not this quarter.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Okay. Thanks very much.

<Q - Marty Mosby>: Good morning. David, congratulations on hitting your 3% net interest margin goal. You've been
working on that a while. What I was wanting to ask was as we've gotten to this benchmark and now we're talking about
maybe giving some of it back, how are we seeing that as you get into the first half of next year? I mean, are we really
seeing a 10 basis point compression? And what are some of the sources for that?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yes. Thanks, Marty.
You know, what we said was we became much more defensive in the fourth quarter on liquidity given our ratings
action that we're taking. And we still continue to be more defensive than we normally would be with regards to
liquidity. You know, just excess cash that we have costs us about 11 basis points, as I mentioned, in the fourth quarter.
That's up from the 8 basis points in the third quarter. We do believe, as we continue to have our improved migration
that we talked about in terms of problem assets and sustainable profitability, that the need to be defensive with regard
to liquidity will subside, which will give us the ability to put the excess liquidity to work in a more meaningful manner.
Also, if you look at our investment portfolio, it's pretty much all agency guaranteed, and I think what you'll see is some
repositioning out of that over time into other asset classes. But today liquidity was taking precedent over earnings. So
we hope, maybe during the first half, you'll still see pressure there, but it should lighten up towards the back half of the
year.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: And Marty, this is Grayson. I think the other thing, within everything that David said
around liquidity in the securities portfolio, I think you have to add to that two things. One is what we've seen in the
fourth quarter is some of the best loan production that we've seen in quite some time with our commercial loan
production up 47% over prior year and our consumer loan production up over 8% over prior year. That hasn't translated
yet into balance sheet growth, but it's a very positive sign. As well as the assets that are on our books that are in
investor real estate and are moving off of our books quite rapidly, the rates there are much less advantageous than the
rates of the new business that we're putting on the books, as well as we're re-pricing our book as it renews. We do think
some of the actions we took in the fourth quarter will temporarily harm or compress our margin, but we do plan to earn
our way back over time.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And I guess just following up to that, you mentioned the wider loan spreads. How are you being
able to accomplish that when you've seen the competition and we're really starting to see the commercial industrial
especially across the board, a lot of the banks competing in that same kind of group?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, obviously there's a lot of competition
in that particular segment. What we've seen is an awful lot of competition in the upper end of commercial C&I. Where
we have been most successful is in the commercial middle market and in small business and in some of our specialty
lending functions, in particular energy, healthcare and asset-based lending. We still are seeing opportunities to make
loans at rates that we believe pay us for the risk we're taking and are at the spreads that we feel are fair and appropriate
for both us and the customer.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And David, the last thing on this topic and then I'll let you move on to the next question, is, with
your new kind of deposit base that you have, what are you really – what are you kind of estimating now as your
long-term core net interest margin once you get the benefit of the liquidity going away, the non-performers going
down, and you get the rate sensitivity as rates move higher? Kind of what's the goal that you'd for the long term be
shooting for? Thanks.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: We've talked about, as
things settle out and we get to normal, whether it be liquidity, the marketplace, that we could be in that 3.20 to 3.50
range in terms of margin. The question is, when will all that settle out, when we can get back there and get our balance
sheet positioned the way we want. We've talked about moving more from the business services to consumer, and that
takes some time, getting our excess liquidity to work. When all that happens, we think we can get back to those – that
margin range.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: But we believe those are reasonable targets
for us to have, and we just have to reposition our balance sheet in order to achieve that.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hi, good morning. A couple questions. One's on the reserve ratio, obviously remained relatively
strong, high in the quarter at 3 84. But you've got NPL inflows and balances coming down, so I'm wondering how you
think about that reserve and when we should expect to see some reserve release start.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Betsy, obviously our perspective is that we
want to stay very disciplined as we look at our allowance methodology. And as we see improvement in our credit
metrics, it's obviously playing into that process and into that methodology. We are being careful not to run the risk of
premature release of reserves. But as our credit metrics improve, we would expect the process to take that into account.
But we're being disciplined at this juncture.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: And then as we look at the CRE portfolio, I know you're in the process of de-risking runoff on
the portfolio, but what do you think the right size is for your organization?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I would tell you that that perspective is
evolving. We clearly have come out and said that we want investor CRE to be no more than 100% of risk-based capital
or $14 billion. If you look at it we're at $15.9 today at period end, and it continues to come down fairly rapidly. We
have substantially reduced our exposures, and if you look at land, single-family and condominium, at the end of last
year we were at about 5.6 billion. We're at about 3.1, 3.2 billion today, just down over 44% in 12 months. And we will
continue to de-risk. We are still making commercial real estate loans. The demand for that product is fairly limited and
is much better underwritten and much better priced, but it's not sufficient today to sustain the level of commercial real
estate loans that we have. We will expect that to improve as the economy improves, but it's quite, quite candidly, we
could see our commercial real estate loans drift below that targeted level of 14 billion.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay. Thanks.

<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Thanks, good morning, everyone.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Can you provide us with some details around the high brokerage and I [investment]
banking revenues, really the Morgan Keegan business in 4Q, and how we should think about a good run rate going
forward here?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think, you know, in large part it's
going to continue to be driven by the economy and the performance of the markets thereof. As you saw in our
businesses there, we're seeing good growth and the strongest growth we're seeing is coming out of our investment
banking revenues. As you may recall, about a year ago we combined all of our investment banking activities into one
single leadership in Morgan Keegan, and they continue to show progress as that market has improved. Our retail
brokerage has as well improved.
Fixed income, which has been one of the best performing units within Morgan Keegan, revenues are down slightly
there but still very, very strong. And our trust business, while not a high growth business, has been a very good

performer from a margin perspective and has been very efficient in their operations. We believe Morgan Keegan still
has the potential to grow from here, but it's going to – I think when you look at the growth we saw in assets under
management, 3.5% quarter-over-quarter, that was very strong. It'll take favorable markets to sustain that. But I think
that – I think we've got a team that's focused on growing that business fairly substantially over the next several quarters.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: As I think about Morgan
Keegan in total say if the economy continues to improve, you'll see some downward pressure on the fixed income, but
the private client investment banking, as Grayson mentioned, and the consistent performance and trust will serve to
mitigate that. So we're looking for that continued expansion really in investment banking, which showed great promise
in the last – in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: And just as a follow-up, I don't know if Matthew Lusco is on the call or not, but I'm just
wondering if there's going to be any changes to how you recognize NPLs or severity valuation in the fourth quarter, the
current changes made or the changes made in 3Q, is that really kind of go-forward process at this point?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think that, you know, when you look at our
processes around managing credit risk, and I'll ask Barb Godin to speak briefly on this after I make a few comments.
You know, today we continue to make process improvements in all of our processes in terms of managing credit risk.
But the primary issue is just continued focus on execution, making sure that we're executing our processes in a way that
give us confidence, our Board confidence, and our regulators confidence in sort of where we stand from a credit risk
perspective. Barb?
<A - Barb Godin>: As you mentioned, in the third quarter we took a very critical eye to all of the assets that we had in
nature, that they were appropriately risk rated. We understood the guarantor strength behind all of the loans. And you
saw that increase in the third quarter. But that kind of discipline has carried on clearly into the fourth quarter and I
anticipate that discipline will carry on forever, quite frankly, as we look forward. So I really don't look to any large
changes to say that we're going to be doing anything significantly differently as we think about the future.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Barb and Grayson, thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Hi, guys. So I kind of feel bad asking a question on interest rate risk, because all quarter
long we're so focused on the credit, and obviously things are moving in the right direction there. But we did get a big
move up in interest rates, and what's interesting is I think your balance sheet's very well positioned from rising
short-term rates, but like a lot of other banks, you do have exposure to rising long-term rates. So I'm just wondering
how you're thinking about that as you manage the securities book in terms of whether it's trying to hedge some of that,
adding floaters, and then just generally the size of the securities book going forward.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: You're right, it has been
– it's been tough this past quarter managing that interest rate risk, but as I mentioned earlier, the liquidity was much
more important to us, and that's what the investment portfolio is. We continue to be asset sensitive, perhaps down a
little bit from the third quarter, but still asset sensitive. So if rates rise we will benefit from that.
Our goal is not to continue to grow our securities portfolio, but as we continue to be successful in the deposit gathering,
that gives us some opportunities to – you saw our pre-payment of FHLB that we did literally right after the end of the
third quarter, and I think we disclosed that in our third quarter 10-Q. But we can continue to put – as we grow deposits,
we can be pretty aggressive with the rates there, and our long-term goal is not to grow our investment portfolio,
obviously put it to work in loan growth. You heard Grayson's comments in terms of we really have seen some terrific
loan growth in the commercial middle market space.

So we will look for opportunities to put that cash to work better. I think the construct of the investment portfolio is
important – and we have most of it in agency-guaranteed mortgage-backs, residential mortgage-backs and we're
looking at playing back into some other asset classes that would give us a little better yield for that. So that's kind of the
global comments, I would say.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: And then I guess on the net interest margin, a little bit as a follow-up, you gave I think
pretty explicit guidance to first quarter NIM down maybe 5 to 10 basis points and then gave us some of the pluses and
minuses from there. Should we expect the first quarter to be the bottom and then kind of flat to trending up from there
or maybe more in the back half of the year?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: No, I think you'll see a
little bit of a reset there in the first quarter, and we should be able to hold kind of where we land in the first quarter
throughout the year.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately on expenses, and you've talked about continuing to
manage them and obviously the environmental stuff, it is what it is. But just more broadly speaking, is there more that
you can do in kind of the underlying expense of the company? When I look at the salaries and benefits, they've been
flat the last three years, so a lot has been done. I'm just wondering how much more there might be out there.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, listen. This is Grayson. I don't believe
that managing expenses is ever over. There's always opportunities that we have to try to be more efficient, and
obviously with the revenue headwinds that this industry is facing, and this institution in particular, we have to find
ways to be more efficient. We consolidated 122 offices last year and reduced 700 positions out of the company as well
as reduced a number of discretionary spending categories by some fairly large amounts. We continue to do that.
I really don't look at expense reduction as a program, but it's a discipline that you have to have every day in the
business, and we continue to look for opportunities to reduce our expense, and you will see that over time. Obviously
the environmental expenses are the biggest opportunity we have. As the credit metrics improve, you'll see the benefits
from those expenses starting to moderate.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Good morning.
<Q - Kenneth Usdin>: Looking at the adjustments that you made on the pre-tax pre-provision side, 461 versus a
charge-off still in the 680 range, just wondering if you can help us understand how you expect that gap to narrow over
time. And at what point do you think you can get back to kind of that core break-even as far as pre-tax pre-provision
covering net charge-offs?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yes, a couple things.
Obviously the biggest one is a continued decline in the credit migration of problem assets, which will result in lower
non-performing loans, which will result in a lower allowance need, and therefore – I forgot who asked the earlier
question, maybe Betsy, in terms of when can we provide less in charge-offs. So I think you really have to look at that
migration as being a key indicator. We're feeling better in terms of the trend for migration and the ultimate declines of
non-performing loans. You can see our chart where we're having more move to accrual status there and also cash
collections are increasing. We do think we're going to have better opportunities to restructure some of those loans and
get those out of non-performing in time. And, again, as the non-performer comes down and the need for the reserve
comes down we'll provide less in charge-offs.

The other component, the other side is really working on the PPNR, and we're looking at for new credits that are going
on the books, making sure we're being paid appropriately for the risk that we're taking. And that has been a big plus for
us, as you saw our improvement in loan spreads of five basis points. We continue to have ability to re-price deposits in
terms of the CDs that are maturing as I mentioned earlier. So we'll continue to have pickup on that front as well. And
then from a non-interest revenue standpoint, we think we'll be stable from an NIR standpoint throughout the year. So
really, turning credit that enables us to provide less in charge-offs and then increasing incrementally our PPNR is how
we'll get to that level.
<Q - Kenneth Usdin>: And do you think that's something that can happen this year? I'm thinking about it more so in
terms of before we contemplate a reserve release, just in terms of your ability for PPNR to exceed just net charge-offs.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we have to be careful not to give
guidance on that issue. But I would add a couple of thoughts to it. As you look at our charge-offs for the quarter, I
would direct your attention to two components of that charge-off. One is valuation charges, our collateral valuations; if
you look at it over the past several quarters, it's continued to trend downward. It's been a substantial part of our
charge-offs. Not that real estate values have bottomed in all of our markets, but obviously the pace of decline has
slowed, and there seems to be some stabilization coming into many markets. And those valuation charges should
continue to moderate if the economy continues to go along the same line we are today.
The other component I would tell you to look at is the distressed loan note sales and foreclosed property sales.
Obviously a big part of our charge-offs have come out of our aggressive stance on de-risking our portfolio. We did 405
million in distressed note sales and foreclosed properties this past quarter. There are a substantial amount of charge-offs
that comes with that. We fully expect that strategy to moderate as our inflows moderate and it's – we have to see that
happen first. And when we see that, then I think there's an opportunity for us to have those two components, PPNR and
charge-offs, cross.
<Q - Kenneth Usdin>: Okay, great. My second question is can you just update us on what the level of the DTA was at
December 31? And then how you guys think about capital planning with regards to the DTA as far as how you think
about capital levels that you'd like to live out going forward?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Okay. We have at the
end of the year about $1.4 billion in DTA. That's up about $275 million from the level in the third quarter, and that's
primarily due to we had deferred tax liabilities that actually offset DTA in the third quarter related to our unrealized
gains in the securities portfolio. So since we realized those, that DTL went away, which increased our deferred tax
asset.
Right now we disallow about $400 million in capital from the DTA. That's down slightly from where we were in the
third quarter. We do believe that that $400 million will come back to us. It's about 40 basis points of Tier 1 common.
We believe that's just a matter of time before we can take that into our capital calculation, but in terms of our planning,
you know, we think our Tier 1 common right now is pretty healthy at 7.9. We clearly are still a whole TARP, and at
some point we will be in a position to repay that. We look at what our Tier 1 common we think needs to be from our
own management standpoint as well as what our regulatory supervisors believe, but it's 40 basis points left to come
back into capital.

<Q - Kevin FItzsimmons>: Grayson, we're getting to go the point obviously where by the end of the first quarter the
regulators are supposed to be done with their stress tests, and there's been a number of SCAP banks that have already
come out and repaid TARP and raised capital. Can you help us, just how you look at that tradeoff between, if you are
on the cusp here of the next few quarters of improving and getting back to core profitability, how do you look at that
tradeoff between raising now and getting out of TARP versus choosing to wait longer if perhaps that amount that you
might have to raise is more than you think you're comfortable with, but having that stigma of being the last TARP bank
of the SCAPs left with it? And is that even a stigma that is relevant for competitive reasons? If you could just give us
some sense of how you look at those tradeoffs. Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Kevin, again, our positional TARP
repayment really has not been modified. We still believe that the best strategy is for us to be prudent and patient. We
have discussed at length our capital plans with both our Board and with our regulatory supervisors. We feel very
confident in the plan that we've put together, and we believe that we're executing along that plan. We do believe it's in
the best interest of this organization and our shareholders for us to continue to focus on returning to sustainable
profitability and getting into position with credit where both our Board, our shareholders, and our supervisors feel
confident in repayment and repayment on terms that are more favorable.
So we will continue to be patient and prudent. We're working through that. And I do think that obviously with the
activities going on around us that we watch those very carefully, understanding how those decisions are being made. I
do not think that TARP is a competitive problem. We're not seeing issues with our customers, either on a consumer or
the commercial side. The bigger issue with our customers is service, product and making sure that they've got trust and
confidence in this organization. At the end of the day, most of the stigma around TARP is internal with our people and
external with our investors. And so we're trying to be balanced in our approach but remain patient and prudent in that
regard.

<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Good, thank you.
<Q - Christopher Mutascio>: David, you mentioned on the loan sales, the problem loan assets that were sold, they
took about a 25% discount on the loss on those. Is that discount to the carrying value of those loans?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: It is.
<Q - Christopher Mutascio>: And if that's the carrying value, that seems like a fairly substantial hit for at least I
would think some of those were already in the held for sale portfolio. So what does that mean for future sales? Do we
have 20, 25% hits coming from problem loans that might be disposed of in future quarters?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yes, I don't – all of
those didn't come from held for sale. I think we have also a chart that shows kind of what our held for sale...
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: They came from foreclosed properties, held
for sale and a few non-performing loan asset sales.
<A - Barb Godin>: That's right. This is Barb Godin. We took the larger hits from those coming from the

<A - Barb Godin>: That's right.
<Q - Christopher Mutascio>: Okay. Going forward, in terms of loan dispositions, do you think – will you see the
same type of trend where you're starting to see sales of loans from the non-available for sale portfolio?
<A - Barb Godin>: No. In fact, we want to ensure that what we are selling is going to be coming out of the held for
sale portfolio. And the change that we're making clearly is that we're seeing an inflection point in the market where
right now we believe it's in the shareholders' best interest and it makes more economic sense that we actually spend
more time around the restructuring of these loans versus looking for sale opportunities.
We'll always have sale opportunities, they'll always come along, and we'll address those when we balance that against
is it better for us to hold that asset now and look for a better outcome in the coming quarters. And again, as you look at
what we have coming in for example from income-producing properties, there's much more opportunity than there has
been in the past for restructures of those loans.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: As far as loan sales go, our priority would
continue to be to sell out of our other real estate owned than our held for sale portfolio.
<A - Barb Godin>: Right.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: If you look at our chart
on the back of the – on the supplement on Page 23 you'll see we generated gains on our held for sale, and that's just
trying to get the marks exactly right. You'll see we do have some write-downs during the quarter, they've been pretty
negligible, and we've generated some gains each quarter. So what that tells us is that our marks that we take when we
move things to held for sale are pretty accurate.
<Q - Christopher Mutascio>: That's the color I was looking for, so thank you very much. If I can ask one follow-up.
David, you broke even with some gains this quarter, but the book value per share was down about 5%, or the tangible
book value was down about 5% because of the OCI impact. Given the balance sheet restructuring, if you will, on the
investment securities side that you took during the quarter, could we see some modest deterioration in tangible book
value if interest rates continue to rise because of any further hits you take in the OCI on the new investment securities
portfolio?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Well, without giving
you explicit earnings guidance, I would tell you if you just looked at that, the impact of that, clearly if the tenure is
going up, everybody is going to have more risk in terms of unrealized gains either deteriorating or generating
unrealized losses, which would put pressure on your tangible book value. But we had a pretty wild swing in the tenure
this fourth quarter, and we don't see that – we see that change moderating some as we go through the first quarter. So
we think the risk of having a tremendous reduction, if you will, in tangible book value from that alone is far lower than
it was in the fourth quarter.

quarter-over-quarter growth, how much of that do you think is seasonal due to inventory investments?

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I would say that clearly there's a
seasonal aspect to our business and generally the fourth quarter is a good quarter for our commercial lending business.
But when you look at comparing our rates to the same period last year, as I mentioned a moment ago, our commercial
business excluding investor real estate is up 50%, and even if you include investor real estate it's up 44%. So while
there's a seasonal aspect to it, we're seeing a real shift in demand.
And it really, again, as I mentioned earlier in my presentation, it's really not about increased line utilization. We only
saw very minor improvement in line utilization. We're right at 40%. Most of it was really around capital expenditures
for equipment, in particular technology, also in acquisitions of companies and/or properties. And again, most of the
growth we saw the three segments that I pointed out was healthcare, energy and also asset-based lending.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: So it sounds like you think the growth rate for this category in 2011 can accelerate from that 5%,
even though you think there was a little bit of seasonality in that.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: We think that opportunity exists, depending
on what assumptions you make about the economy. If the economy continues to trend at a very – in a positive light as it
has in the last few months, then I think that there's obviously upside opportunity for us in that particular segment.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: Okay. Great. And then just one other question. You guys don't provide the loan yield yet for the
individual categories. Can you give us a feel for what happened to C&I loan yields quarter-over quarter?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: We haven't been giving that guidance.
David, you want to make a comment on that?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yes. They are up. We
gave you guidance in total. We just haven't broken it down by quarter, but in that particular segment, they're up fairly
close to what we told you in terms of total loan portfolio.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Nomura.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey Brian, good morning.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Good morning. How are you? Just circling back to the NIM issue. I guess one of the questions I
get a lot and I hear you on the asset sensitivity, the excess cash, the NPA drag, but a lot of banks have similar issues
and you're the last of the big banks that's kind of at 3% or I guess a little below next quarter. I mean is it just that you
have these issues in outsize proportion or when you benchmark yourself relative to all the peers is there something else
that is wrong right now?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Well, this is David,
Brian. You know, I hear you that everybody else has similar issues, but I think we have probably more excess liquidity.
That's 11 basis points. You know from a credit standpoint, non-accruals and interest reversals, that's about 16 basis
points for us, and it's been in that range just about all year. I think one of the key things we wanted to talk about and
will do over time is changing our mix of business in our loan portfolio, which is more – or
largely concentrated on the business loan side versus consumer side.
And I think with the exception of one or two others, they have a bigger consumer book than we do. So we're going to
look to move that. We think the ability to forecast losses in the consumer is a little easier than on the commercial side.
So you can price for that better. And I think the overall yields there will help yields will help us. Our consumer book is
really made up of two things. The one to four family and then also the HELOC book, and our HELOC book is about 90
basis points below where our peers are. Over time we'll get that out; as people refinance their mortgage we can get the

rates up on our HELOC book.
<Q - Brian Foran>: That's helpful. And then I guess that was really my only question. Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the other issue, following up on that
same question, I think the other factor that you have to place in there is that the mix of fixed rate loans, the variable rate
loans, and we went into this cycle with a lot more variable rate than our competitors and have paid a price for it.
Certainly as we move forward we're going to come closer to peer. But it's really on the lending side. The deposit mix,
obviously our deposit costs were too high a year ago. We've moved that more to peer levels. But our loan yield, still we
haven't gotten to the peer level. Part of it's mix and part of it's pricing and we've made improvements on both.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Actually if I could ask one follow-up, on the performing non-performers, is there enough
experience so far to tell us what the difference in ultimate charge-off rates is on non-performing non-performers versus
performing non-performers? Are there any stats you can give that help us kind of think about how much lower the loss
experience should be on that 37% of the NPAs that are current?
<A - Barb Godin>: Yes, this is Barb. We don't have enough history to give you anything that is percentage wise. What
I can tell you is just anecdotal experience, and what that means is we're able to look at those performing
non-performers in a very different light; i.e., there's much more opportunity for us to restructure them and get them
back to accruing status. So the numbers will come of themselves in due course. But I do see them as a much better
quality non-performing loan, if there's any such thing.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners.
<Q - Christopher Marinac>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just want to ask a forward-looking question about TDRs. And
do you think that the TDRs would come down or trend down the next quarter or two?
<A - Barb Godin>: Yes. I think TDRs are going to probably stay relatively stable as we look forward, and again
remembering that on the TDRs any change that we make to a loan, be it on the consumer or the commercial side, we
automatically are flagging it as a TDR. So I don't really see a lot of change on that.
<Q - Christopher Marinac>: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And just Grayson, real quick, on the Morgan Keegan side
do you have any thoughts or I guess goals on offering leverage for having more dropdown to pre-tax income when you
have sequential quarter pickups of revenue like you did last quarter?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I'll tell you, we've got John Carson and
the team at Morgan Keegan are working hard at trying to improve not only top line but the bottom line. We've made
improvements there and will continue to make improvements there. As you are well aware, we did an awful lot of legal
expense in that group over the past year. That seems to be subsiding somewhat. But we are anticipating a better bottom
line out of that group in 2011.
<Q - Christopher Marinac>: Great. Thanks very much.

Your final question comes from the line of Chris Gamaitoni of Compass Point.
<Q - Chris Gamaitoni>: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just with regard to gaining market share, could you go into a
little description on who you're gaining market share from, peers of size, and in what markets?

<A - John Turner, Jr.>: I think as the large banks are focused on that higher-end corporate customer, the commercial
middle market seems to be opening up for us. So I think that the competition is a little less in that commercial middle
market and small business in particular versus the large corporate. That's where you're seeing really tough competition
among all the players, and that's where the spreads are getting tight. And as we had mentioned on previous conferences,
that we want to be paid for the risk that we take, and we're not going to sacrifice yield just to book production. So being
able to stay in our space that we think we have a competitive advantage for in that commercial middle market, taking it
from the bigger players is where we're seeing it.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: And I'd tell you from looking at the numbers
as well as travels around our footprint, we're seeing strong growth. As I mentioned, it's not in one particular place. I
mean, literally out of our – we divide our franchise up into 20 markets and literally had growth in C&I in the fourth
quarter in 16 of the 20 markets. And the four markets that didn't grow were relatively stable. So when you look at it
from a geographic standpoint, we saw especially strong growth in Texas, and in Tennessee and in Georgia were three
markets that we saw strong growth.
And in two of those markets, Texas and Georgia, we have a fairly limited presence there. It's a good presence. It's a
good set of bankers, but we don't have dominant share in either of those markets. Tennessee we have a very dominant
share and did very well there, but there's some industries located in Tennessee that gave us particular advantage, in
particular healthcare. And so we're seeing growth widespread across the franchise, and when you look at who we're
taking that from, it's varied market by market. There is still some disruption in the market that we're taking advantage
of as events unfold.
But as David said, part of it is we've focused a little bit lower down in the middle market and the lower end of C&I and
into small business in particular, which is not – the competition has not been as stiff there.
<Q - Chris Gamaitoni>: All right. And then just a quick separate follow-up. How much allowance do you have
against your consumer TDRs and what's the re-default rate been on that portfolio?
<A - Barb Godin>: The re-default rate, which is 22%, averaged 60 or more, and we generally have not provided
guidance to this point on how much we have established by way of a reserve against those specific TDRs.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: But the TDR balance is
predominantly made up of residential loan assets, and the recidivism rate as Barb indicated has been 22%, and it's held
pretty steady at that level for some time now.
<A - Barb Godin>: Absolutely has.
<Q - Chris Gamaitoni>: All right. Thank you.
