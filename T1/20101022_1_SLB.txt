Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earning
per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.70 per share. This is an increase of $0.02 sequentially and $0.05
compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $0.30 of restructuring and merger-related
charges and a $0.98 gain on our investment in M-I SWACO. These items are more fully described in our earnings press
release. As a reminder, we will continue to incur merger and integration related charges during the next few quarters.
The third quarter results include one month of activity relating to the merger with Smith. This transaction was dilutive
to our Q3 results by just under $0.02 per share and it's estimated to be dilutive to our Q4 earnings by approximately
$0.05 per share. We issued 176 million shares in the Smith transaction and, due to the timing of the close, only
one-third of these shares are included in our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for Q3. The full 176 million
shares will be reflected in our Q4 EPS calculation.
During the quarter, we continue to feel the effect of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We
estimate that the moratorium resulted in a reduction of our Q3 earnings of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share. The
earnings effect of the moratorium in Q4 is estimated to be approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share.
Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services third quarter revenue increased 2% sequentially while
WesternGeco revenue increased 1%. The legacy Smith businesses contributed $810 million in revenue to the quarter.
The growth in Oilfield Services revenue was largely attributable to the continued strong activity and increased pricing
in U.S. land as well as the impact of three months of Geoservices activity in Q3 as compared to one month in the prior
quarter. These increases were partially offset by reduced IPM activity in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket and a
full quarter's effect of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico.
Oilfield Services pre-tax operating income of $1.1 billion increased 3% compared to the prior quarter while pre-tax
operating margin increased 15 basis points, to 19.9%. The increase in margin was primarily driven by the strong
performance in North America. International margins were down slightly to 21.4%, primarily due to the decline in
activity in Mexico/Central America.
By area, Oilfield Services sequential pre-tax operating margin highlights were as follows. North America pre-tax
operating margin improved 704 basis points to 17.4%. U.S. land margin improved significantly by almost 9 percentage
points as a result of higher activity and better pricing. However, this strong performance was tempered by the effect of
the deepwater drilling moratorium. Latin America margin declined 302 basis points to 14.9%, due to the decreased
activity in Mexico/ Central America. Europe/CIS/Africa margin was essentially flat at 18.3%, while the Middle
East/Asia margin declined slightly by 84 basis points to 30.3%. Sequentially, WesternGeco pre-tax operating income
decreased 14% to $40 million, and pre-tax operating margins slipped 145 basis points to 8.3%. The three Smith
segments contributed $84 million of pre-tax operating income to the quarter's results.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 21%, representing an
increase of over 3 percentage points compared to last quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the fact that we
generated a significantly larger portion of our earnings in North America in Q3, as well as the impact of the Smith
merger. As you know, Smith is a U.S. company and, as such, has a higher effective tax rate than Schlumberger. The
ETR is expected to experience at least a similar crease again in Q4, due to the inclusion of Smith for an entire quarter,
combined with the effects of the continued positive momentum in North America.
We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion of cash and investments on hand and short-term debt of $1.9 billion. Net debt
was $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter, as compared to $766 million at the end of Q2. This increase reflects the
assumption of $1.8 billion of net debt from the Smith merger.
Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $824 million of CapEx and $463 million of pension plan
contributions, and $396 million of stock repurchases. Although we were blacked out for one month during the quarter
pending the Smith shareholder vote, we repurchased 6.8 million shares at an average price of $57.91.

We expect to be aggressive and opportunistic with our buyback program going forward. During the quarter, we
launched a program to buy back certain notes of both Schlumberger and Smith. The program continues, as you may
have seen yesterday in a separate press release. This ongoing initiative will help us to realign our capital structure
following the merger.
Oilfield Services CapEx is now expected to reach approximately $2.5 billion in 2010, while WesternGeco CapEx is
expected to be approximately $315 million. CapEx for the legacy Smith businesses from the acquisition date through
the end of the year is estimated to be approximately $260 million.
And now I turn the conference over to Andrew.
Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Simon. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I have a few comments to add on the quarter's results before
turning to the outlook for the rest of the year. As Simon has said, the sequential revenue increase was largely driven by
strong improvements in U.S. land and Canada which more than offset a sharp decline in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as the
deepwater drilling moratorium took full effect.
Favorable activity coupled with robust pricing power for pressure pumping and the effects of our restructuring efforts
lead to a major improvement in our margins. Our North American team under Paul Kibsgaard's guidance has made
major improvements in efficiency and utilization across the country. The sequential margin improvement was very
satisfactory and we exited the quarter at a high point for both revenue growth and margins.
Outside North America, activity was mixed. Solid improvements were recorded in Asia, Russia, the North Sea, West
and Southern Africa, which offset continued weakness in North Africa and the Gulf of Guinea. Latin America
performed well in all GeoMarkets except Mexico where budget constraints, weather and security concerns led to major
reductions in IPM activities. Higher exploration activity is beginning to result in better technology sales. New
technologies continued to underpin our results as the quarter's highlights clearly show. While a number of these have
already seen growing market penetration, such as the ACTive family of real time coiled tubing services, others, such as
the unique PowerDrive Archer high build rate rotary steerable system, are just entering field service.
This particular technology can eliminate the need for a pilot hole in horizontal well drilling by building angle much
more sharply than other rotary steerable systems. Other new technologies were unveiled at the Society of Petroleum
Engineers technology conference in September. These included the unique Wireline Dielectric Scanner multifrequency
dispersion service which has already run 250 jobs in 20 countries during its introductory phase. This technology
enables the determination of residual oil saturation in carbonate reservoirs, hydrocarbon volume in low resistivity or
low contrast shaly and laminated sand formations and hydrocarbon volume and mobility in heavy oil reservoirs.
In Testing Services we announced the Quartet high-performance downhole reservoir testing system, that allowed
clients to isolate, control, measure and sample, reservoir tests in a single run, using a downhole assembly, only one
quarter of the length of conventional technology configurations. In software solutions we announced the release of the
Merak Peep 2010, the cornerstone of the Merak suite of economics, planning and reserves management software. This
new release which delivers a complete refresh of the application, allowing customers to proactively respond to complex
operational conditions and rapidly answer business challenges, was developed in collaboration with 15 oil and gas
companies majors, nationals, and independents.
We also reported a significant number of new contracts in regions across the world, including China, Brazil, Libya,
France and Russia. Many of these were based on previous strong performance of certain technologies is in the field,
while others were supported by the growing capacity for integration across the Schlumberger technology portfolio. The
recent realignment of our portfolio within the three product groups following the acquisitions of the both Smith and
Geoservices is already supporting further integration, particularly in drilling services.
In addition, to these contract wins and new technology introductions, I would also like to mention that we have
successfully begun operations in the Red Sea for wide azimuth seismic acquisition. Wide and multi-azimuth has now

been contracted in five large basins outside the Gulf of Mexico. First, it was the North Sea, and this year we have shot
in West Africa, and are now starting in both the Red Sea and Brazil. We will soon shoot in the Mediterranean. The
spread of wide or multi-azimuth is helping to absorb the extra capacity coming out of the Gulf of Mexico and the new
build boats entering the market. In the majority of these regions, the industry is looking for reservoirs in complex
geometry in deepwater.
In other areas, we announced the signing of a letter of intent to swap certain assets in Russia to build critical mass in
drilling services. Under the terms of the agreement, Eurasia will acquire a number of Schlumberger-owned drilling rigs
while Schlumberger will acquire a range of Eurasia service assets, including directional drilling,
measurement-while-drilling, well cementing, and drilling fluids. Further, both companies have agreed to enter into a
strategic alliance upon completion of the transaction whereby Schlumberger will become the preferred supplier of
drilling services to Eurasia Drilling for up to 200 rigs for a five-year period. This agreement not only increases the
market for our services across the rig fleet of the largest Russian drilling company, it sets the development for
fit-for-purpose, bottomhole assembly technology as drilling intensity increases in Russia in order to sustain
hydrocarbon production.
Turning now to the future. We expect the fourth quarter to show continued strong activity in North America on land,
but we do not expect any rapid return to deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico despite the lifting of the
moratorium. Further clarification of the new rules and liabilities under which activity will be conducted will be
necessary before any major increase in activity takes place.
Our restructuring efforts will continue to deliver margin improvement in U.S. land. Outside North America, the delays
induced by the knock-on effect of the Macondo well are now being reabsorbed. This and the recent strength in oil
prices gives us some optimism that the rate of recovery overseas will accelerate slightly. The normal seasonal declines
in Russia will be present in the fourth quarter, and the future of Mexico operations will remain uncertain until next
year.
WesternGeco will show improvement in the fourth quarter, due to increased Gulf of Mexico multi-client sales. We are
very pleased with the rapid progress that is being made on the integration of Smith and M-I SWACO. The integration
teams and the area coordinators are rapidly identifying both revenue and cost synergy opportunities that augur well for
2011. The enthusiasm among the employees of all companies is obvious and constructive. The integration of
Geoservices has also progressed and we have increased market focus of Geoservices technologies by the separation of
their mud logging and slick line businesses within the Schlumberger technology portfolio.
Recent robust demand increases, as well as predictions of higher demand in 2011, will continue to support oil prices
and activity absent any further deterioration in the world economy. Further demand increases for natural gas will be
necessary to sustain the current level of North American gas drilling activity beyond a certain point in time.
And I will now turn the call back to Greg. Greg?

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Brad Handler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Brad.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Maybe I could ask for a couple of comments on WesternGeco. Couple of things in your
comments, Andrew, sounded encouraging including both soaking up assets, the wide and multi-azimuth comment as
well as your comments on the fourth quarter and multi-client sales. Could you elaborate on those, please? Do you have
a better view for pricing improvements now in 2011 as a function of better asset utilization and, again, on the data side

as well?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, let me answer the data question first. I mean
nothing is ever sure on Gulf of Mexico multi-clients until the quarter ends, but the level of inquiries is encouraging.
And, as we have mentioned before, I think that some of our customers are going to spend a little bit of the money they
didn't spend on drilling in improving their data portfolio. So that deals with Q4 multi-client, Brad.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: What I'm trying to communicate is that the spread of
wide or multi-azimuth outside the Gulf of Mexico is going to soak up capacity. I don't think -- or I don't know whether
that's going to be sufficient to move pricing in 2011, but it -- I think it is going to be sufficient to absorb capacity,
which seems to be becoming a fear that you hear around the community. I actually think that there will be enough work
to absorb most of the boat capacity. If, of course, work starts again in the Gulf of Mexico, then it would have an almost
immediate effect, I think, on pricing. But I'm not going to predict that at this stage.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Sure. Okay. Maybe just as a simple follow-up, obviously the fourth quarter is seasonally a little
softer in marine acquisition. But the contract announcements in Brazil, Egypt, et cetera, and your new vessel, are those
enough, perhaps, to offset it? Might you have more of a flattish quarter in marine in fourth quarter?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Just hang on a second and we'll try and help you
there. No, there will be a seasonal dip. There will be a seasonal dip, perhaps not as bad as it's been in some times in the
past but there will be a seasonal dip in Q4 which you know is essentially the North Sea.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Right. Right. Okay. Well, very helpful. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Boyd from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel Boyd>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Daniel Boyd>: Andrew, can you just give us a little more color on the charge that you took in Mexico? Was it
due to just purely a restructuring down there or is it a write-down of prior profit essentially due to some project-based
accounting?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, we don't use project based accounting, Dan. We
only recognize revenue when PEMEX accepts the stages of the wells that we've drilled. And, therefore, there's no
element of profit in the charge we took. Simon, would you like to describe what the charge was?
<A - Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer>: Most of the charge relates to the early termination fees to the drilling
contractors. We don't own the drilling rigs. We do have a joint venture, as you know, for some of the rigs, but this is all
mostly the early termination fees for the rigs. So we don't recognize revenue on a percentage of completion or any of
that nature. It's mainly early termination fees, as I said, and some restructuring associated with the severance.
<Q - Daniel Boyd>: That's very helpful, given some of the other stuff we've seen. As a follow-up, unrelated, Andrew,
you mentioned Russia quite a bit in the press release. You recently did the deal with Eurasia. At the same time, there's a
number of NOCs talking about spinning out their service divisions. Can you talk about Schlumberger's strategy there,
the growth outlook in general but then also what do you see as the opportunity through all this for Schlumberger to
potentially take some share?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, you know, the Eurasia transaction is very
much what -- a phrase I don't like, but I'm going to use it, a win/win transaction, because we could never build a 200 rig
fleet in Russia of the quality of Eurasia's. And, as you know, following the Smith transaction, our objective is to sell

more drilling services.
And Eurasia's objective, as often the rig owner is the general contractor, is to improve their performance. So what it
does for us is to give us access to 200 rigs whereas before, including the side track and workover, we had about 30.
And what it gives to Eurasia is access to our expertise in drilling services and, on certain of the wells they drill, access
to the high-end services.
And in terms of the divestitures in Russia, we will, I think, participate but extremely selectively, because after 15 years,
there is willingness and there is capital in Russia to grow a domestic service industry. And part of that is the --
consequence of that is companies like Eurasia and Integra. We will participate where we can draw technology
advantage through the participation. But I doubt we will go any more into acquisitions to acquire market share.
<Q - Daniel Boyd>: And just a follow-up on that, did I hear that correctly, that you feel the offering that Smith has, has
a large role in Russia?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The offering that Smith has and the offering that
Schlumberger has and the offering that we have through certain companies we acquired previously in Russia, in the
drilling services business has application, yes.
<Q - Daniel Boyd>: Great. Thanks. I'll turn it back over.

Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: A question I had for you, Andrew, is on the North American and international front, you clearly
made some significant headway on the restructuring process, maybe to a greater degree than most may have
anticipated. In your mind, and in your business plan here, is the rate of change on North America now just bound to
slow, given the magnitude of ramp up that we've seen? Or do you still expect substantial improvement in your
operating margin performance over the course of the next few quarters?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think – I don't think we can do that sort of
improvement every quarter because this is the first quarter that they got the full effect of the restructuring. But we do
anticipate that we will have further improvements in the margin performance in Q4. I think that we will probably see
them through the first quarter and beyond that, I don't know. And -- because it will not only be a question of our
restructuring, it will be a question of what happens in the market.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, and then I was just curious on the revenue synergy front, there really hasn't been much
discussion on that recently, and I'm sure you guys are kind of working through all your opportunities at this point. I was
just wondering if you might be able to give us some glimpse as to where a starting point could be for revenue synergies
and, if not, when you think you might be able to give us some elements of quantification on that?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We had revenue synergies in September. But they
were – obviously, one month they were very small. Now, we have named area coordinators. So each of the
Schlumberger geographical area has a coordinator who reports back on a weekly basis, and the identified opportunities
for revenue synergies make us extremely optimistic that this is going to be -- go a little -- quite quickly, Kurt. So I don't
-- I don't have a good -- I can't announce a number, but when you look at the quantity of opportunities that they're
sifting through, it's -- it looks pretty good.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. Great. Thank you, Andrew.

Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan, please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Thank you. On the North American side, is the restructuring complete now? Is this simply
just about execution from here on out? And basically what do you need to do now? Is this about building up your
presence in certain regions? And I guess a follow-up, how are you viewing this market now as you did last cycle? How
are you going to be approaching this over the next couple of years?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You are talking about North America?
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Yes, I am.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. So, look, on the restructuring we're not
complete but the bulk of it's done. I mean, we still have certain facilities that we're closing, certain consolidations that
are going on between areas, certain procedures in equipment utilization, but the bulk of it is over. But it still will
contribute a bit in the fourth quarter to margin improvement.
And how am I viewing this cycle? So, I think that this cycle -- obviously the volatility of gas prices is being dampened
by the liquid rich shales, where the activity has been migrating over the last few months. There's a ceiling to that. I'm
not quite sure where it is. And the ceiling is governed by the fact that however much liquid you have in it, you still need
to get some money for the gas. So – and that means that the shales that are going to be drilled are going to be not all the
shales, they're going to be the liquid rich ones. So I think the volatility will be dampened but fundamental economic
principles have not gone away, and at some stage, activity will moderate. But please don't ask me when it is, because I
don't know.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: I wouldn't do that. One other follow-up question on your -- on the WesternGeco side. I just
wondered if you could just expand a little bit on the multi-client seismic activity in the Gulf. You mentioned you get a
lot of inquiries. But I'm just wondering, are operators preparing for a lease sale in the spring? I believe a majority of
that business comes from the E&Ps, so I'm just wondering how concerned are you about their future in the Gulf and
what that means to the WesternGeco business model as it pertains to the Gulf?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So when we look at the multi-client inquiries that
we're getting today, they are coming from companies who I'm pretty sure -- I'm almost certain will be drilling again in
the Gulf, which gives you an indication of their size.
I think that the E&P presence in the Gulf going forward, and you are quite right to point out that the independents
played a large role in multiclient, is undecided at this stage because I don't think it's the rules and regulations
surrounding the drilling practices that are going to be important. It's what is the final solution to the liability that
companies have to assume going -- in future lease commitments that they make or drilling commitments that they
make.
So we don't know today what the ultimate size of the multi-client market is going to be. What is true is a lot of our
multi-client traction is coming through technology. The prefunding we're getting from multi-client at the moment is
very healthy, but it's based as much on technology as it is on the fact that we're shooting certain areas.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Along those lines, are you moving vessels out of the Gulf?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, we are down to where we are. You know, we
have permits for the vessels that are shooting and we don't anticipate moving any more out at this stage.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Andrew, I'm going to ask you a question that I asked you on the first
quarter call and that relates to the roadmap for international margins, if you will, between now and over the course of
next year. And keeping in mind price activity and mix. So give us a roadmap as to how you see international margins
unfolding, assuming that oil prices stay above $80 a barrel.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's important to analyze a little bit why
margins have not improved significantly this year.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And I think that the first thing you can say is that
Mexico has dampened margins for Latin America, but virtually everywhere else in Latin America margins have
progressed.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You look at ECA, Europe/CIS/Africa. The North Sea
had healthy improvements. West and Southern Africa, a lot of projects were delayed by Macondo but they started
towards the end of the third quarter, so that will improve. The Gulf of Guinea, by which I mean everything from Ghana
through Nigeria down to Equatorial Guinea, is being dampened by Nigeria and then, of course, North Africa has not
been good. And so the slight decrease in margins in ECA is really large due to the weakness in North Africa and the
Gulf of Guinea which was too much to offset the improvement in the North Sea, Russia and West and Southern Africa.
It's sort of clear.
If you look at MEA, the only reason our margin declined is because we took all the mobilization costs for the BP
Rumaila project in Q3. If we had not had that cost, the margins would have been flat with Q2. So I -- if you go forward
into next year, I think that the deepwater activity improvement next year, because of the rigs coming on and because of
the Macondo -- there will hopefully not be a second Macondo effect, deepwater will improve more than it did this year.
We are already seeing, to some extent, a renewal of exploration programs in areas other than the traditional areas in
Africa. And that is helping.
And in the Middle East, if you leave aside Iraq, there are a number of other projects that have very healthy margins
going forward. So overall, we've got delayed this year by some extraneous events and some activities that didn't
happen, but if oil prices stay where they are, I don't see why margins shouldn't progress next year.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: And with regards to what drives margins next year, do you see any prospect of pricing
improvement?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Internationally
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Yes, sir.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Technology mix pricing improvement, yes.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Okay. And last one for me, we didn't mention anything about Russia and I'm just curious as to
your outlook for Russia next year?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think Western Siberia will be a lot stronger and
Sakhalin will have a bit of a pause because some shift in operator activity. So overall, I don't think you can -- you may
get the same margins but it would be difficult to get improvement, I think, because -- just because of our mix.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Got it. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Barclays, please go ahead.
<Q - James Crandell>: Morning, Andrew.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Jim.
<Q - James Crandell>: First question, Andrew, is about Iraq. How do you expect Iraq now to unfold over 2011 and
2012 and do you think it's important to have a significant presence in the country on the ground floor?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think the first part of that question is that
everyone has a significant presence now. Everyone has equipment there. Everyone is doing call-out work. It's not
necessarily in big contracts. And I think that the real question is really how much of the project activity -- how much of
an appetite you have for the project activity.
And frankly, based on our experiences in South America, we are being quite cautious, because the terms and the
conditions that the operators signed, as you know, are quite tight. And, therefore, they're trying to reflect on to the
contractors the same tight conditions in the form of performance which they are through very tight terms and conditions
asking for high levels of liquidated damages. And in a country where you don't have a great deal of control over the
logistics or the security, high levels of liquidated damages linked to performance are not necessarily a good idea. So on
big projects, we will be cautious; for everything else, we will be aggressive.
<Q - James Crandell>: Okay, and the follow-up, Andrew. Brazil seems like it will be your number one business
opportunity in the world over the next two, three, four years. Can you give me a sense of magnitude on the increases in
business you expect there? And have you noticed any change in the types of bidding that's gone on there in your major
product lines over the last six to 12 months?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, not really. There are one or two IPM-type
opportunities with -- not with Petrobas but with the others. The activity with Petrobas I don't have to describe to you,
and the internationals has been very strong. But, of course, they're waiting to see what the final form of the new
hydrocarbon law is going to be before they invest a lot more. But overall, it's probably one -- it's probably this year, our
highest growth rate, I think, Brazil, of any part of the company, except North America. And I don't see any reason why
that won't continue.
<Q - James Crandell>: Yeah. Okay. Good. Thank you.

<Q - Alan Laws>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Alan.
<Q - Alan Laws>: I'm going to ask you about the share repurchase, I guess. The share repurchase was down in 3Q.
You've mentioned a number of times that you'd look to be aggressive and opportunistic in their repo, following the
acquisition or whenever actually during the process that you're allowed to be active. I know you had a blackout there
for about a month. But two things really, is there an amount of the 11 odd billion that you paid for Smith that you
would want to repurchase. And two, your share price is sort of in the same range as when the Smith transaction was
announced. You have the cash, the debt markets seem accommodating. Is there any consideration or appetite for a mini
tender offer here?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Can I just say we're examining all of the above.
Everything you mentioned we're looking at. It is true that in Q3 we were blacked out for a month because we couldn't
purchase while the Smith -- what was it, the reason?
<A - Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer>: The shareholder vote.

<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: For a month in advance of the Smith shareholder
vote. And I don't think I have a fixed portion of the Smith purchase price that we should repurchase. I think it's to the
extent that all the different methods that you mentioned produce an accretive result, Alan.
<Q - Alan Laws>: Perfect. That's what I like to hear. My second question, which is clearly not a follow-up, is that
Smith was kind of hoping to move down its D&E suite of services into the international arena. When you look at the
combination of what have you today, does this still make sense as a growth strategy? I guess did you have that aspect
of the market already covered or are the Smith tools adding to your capabilities to service a broader range of the
market? Essentially, are you becoming a D&E category killer now?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So firstly remember that we were somewhat
surprised that we were able to keep the PathFinder, right?
<Q - Alan Laws>: Yeah.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: But actually the issue that we've had in our own
drilling and measurements over the last five years is coping with the growth, and the addition of PathFinder allows us
to deal with parts of the growth that we absolutely probably couldn't address through our own drilling and
measurements.
So, yes, the Smith strategy of expanding the PathFinder offering overseas is not dead. It's the markets we're going to
address with it that may have changed and please don't ask me what they are.
<Q - Alan Laws>: All right. That's good. Thank you very much for the answers.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Morning.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Bill.
<Q - William Sanchez>: My first question, Simon, is for you. I know you outline here this morning the dilutive impact
of Gulf of Mexico, roughly $0.04 to $0.05, and also you gave us the Smith impact of about a nickel. I'm just curious,
we appreciate it on a stand-alone basis but isn't there some overlap, if you will, in those two numbers? In other words,
the Gulf of Mexico dilution includes also dilution from the Smith acquisition as well or should those truly just be two
independent numbers as we think about the fourth quarter estimate?
<A - Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer>: It's a good point you're raising. Actually, it is two independent numbers
except for the number of shares that are now issued, right? So the earning per share or the cents per share is a bit
higher, right? But it is two independent numbers. The dilution from the Smith activity includes the impact of the Gulf
of Mexico on Smith, which is the M-I SWACO and some in the tools. So it is two independent numbers.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay, and I guess just looking at the SWACO margin as a whole for the quarter, when you
consider that most of the North American exposure that SWACO has is offshore, so you really don't have the U.S. land
offset there, if you will, the fact that you were able to do flat sequential margins in that business, Andrew, was there
something in the international arena that kicked in that we should be aware of going forward as we think about
SWACO's contribution, especially to 2011?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm afraid I can't think of any individual event. There
was a much stronger North Sea in Q3. But actually SWACO has done an excellent job on land in the U.S. I know their
traditional exposure was very much offshore, but they have taken a considerable position in U.S. land over the last
year.

<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. If I could just ask one more here, as we think about fourth quarter and the impact of
direct sales, Andrew, anything there we should be aware of, especially in the Eastern Hemisphere market and a
potential positive effect on margins?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, there will be the traditional year-end
completions, artificial lift, the biggest margin effect we will get is through the SIS software sales, but we do not sell --
remember, we don't sell Wireline or D&M equipment, so we won't have any of those sort of sales.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Thanks. Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: A couple of questions on strategy, if I may. First on technology. You've talked the last few
quarters about the commercialization pipeline and new products and you identified a few of the technologies in your
release and in your comments. Can you talk about where we are with respect to the rollout? And secondly, what --
what's driving the uptake of the technologies in a market characterized by a lack of general inflation? Which can often
be an accelerant to uptake.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So actually in the pipeline, when I look at our
pipeline now, Michael, the true acceleration is the back half of next year. So we have a normal number of products
filtering into the market now. The true acceleration is the back half of next year.
There are a number of things driving the uptake. So first is, Q3 we saw more exploration and, therefore, a higher
quality mix in what we sold. Oil -- at $80 a barrel, oil companies are a little less stringent with their engineers in
allowing them to buy some extra technology. And some of the technology, particularly things like PowerDrive Archer,
fairly dramatically reduces the operator's cost. So there's no one reason, Michael, but those are the three that I would
identify.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Okay. And if I think about the Archer in particular, in a -- having come through the
downturn, and the appetite for just absolute costs versus performance tends to shift. We're definitely -- it sounds like we
are seeing a shift back in terms of willingness to spend more to get more productivity as opposed to a focus on absolute
cost. Is that a fair characterization?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think that's fair.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Okay, second question, if I look at the comment on the OGX arrangement, I think that sort
of this business model approach that you have in projects like this is truly unique and different. If I think about what
growth in that market -- or that opportunity set looks like over the next few years, is the constraint more Schlumberger's
appetite for risk and finding the right type of projects or is it really in educating the client in terms of the value
proposition of what you're doing in that kind of arrangement?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So firstly, obviously, post Macondo the assessment
of risk has become a much more important criteria before going into the execution of those types of projects. So, I
mean, we actually have had an ongoing program since Macondo to not only review all the – the products and services
of Schlumberger that provide barriers to influx, but also reviewing, obviously, all the IPM projects where we have
responsibility for it. So risk is a consideration but not something that's going to stop us doing it. It's more a question of
the type of customer, educating the customer, and getting the customer to accept that we have all the competence
necessary.

So the OGX arrangement is probably the most advanced one of those that we have. We have others where we provide
probably the same degree of supervision, but we don't take the same degree of responsibility or risk. And so, actually, I
think that the extent to which that market grows, Michael, is going to be a function of the type of operators that spring
up. And we have a similar project in Middle East/Asia, which is basically where we're acting for a consortium of local
companies who've decided they want to be in the E&P business. But I really think it's going to depend on how the
client base evolves.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: If I could just ask one follow-up on that. If I look at the portfolio of some of the -- BP, for
example, in terms of the review, post Macondo, of – call it the proliferation of potential daughter companies, I would
imagine that that would invite a pretty interesting opportunity set?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. I mean, we are seeing private equity look at
this. But the risk profile for private equity is difficult to manage.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Okay. Thank you, Andrew.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Urban from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Wanted to dig in a little bit on the reorganization you're undertaking along product lines. And I
was just wondering if that -- one, what's driving that? And two, is that something that you were looking at prior to the
Smith deal or is there something unique about the portfolio of assets that you have acquired that's pushing you in that
direction?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, look, you -- this is a slightly structural question.
When we set up the GeoMarket system 12 years ago, we actually had about seven product lines at the time. And
therefore, to shift responsibility for management from product line to geography was not -- it was not impossible to
shift a large part of the responsibility. We now have 15 product lines, and therefore, no human being is capable of
intelligently managing 15 product lines. And we've learned a lot about how the geographical organization works. And
whereas it works extremely well for bidding of services, it is not so strong for the bidding of products, because when
you sell products, you need to base your pricing off the manufacturing costs.
And therefore, the shift back to groups and segments represents the recognition that this is a much larger company, and
it needs a different management style if we are going to carry it forward intelligently. It does not in any way detract
from the ability of the GeoMarket system to provide a sound, intelligent customer interface locally around the world
and, secondly, to run the lowest cost support operation possible for those 15 different product lines. That's the basic
underlying theory.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Makes sense. Along those lines, how are you balancing the two? In other words, there are some
risks in going too far down that path and thinking in kind of a -- somewhat of a silo mentality. And one of the
advantages that Schlumberger has always brought is the whole is more than the parts.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The GeoMarket managers bring that together.
<Q - Michael Urban>: So that's still very much intact?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Okay, that's all for me, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robin Shoemaker>: Thank you, Andrew. I wonder if -- going back to North America for a moment, we have
seen tremendous activity in the shale plays, as you indicated, in the liquids rich. In the dry gas areas, we're seeing some
decline in activity. What is your view of the potential for pricing to be weaker going forward in the dry gas shale plays
versus the liquid rich?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, at some point sufficient capacity will come on
to bring down pricing across the hydrocarbons spectrum. It doesn't matter whether it's dry gas or liquids. It's a question
of at what point, in my opinion, the capacity in the market overtakes the demand --total demand. And I don't -- I mean,
I'm going to stick my neck out now and say I don't think that's going to happen till in the second quarter or third quarter
of next year, but there is a risk it will eventually happen?
<Q - Robin Shoemaker>: Okay. Another question I had was you've mentioned this year that a great deal of your time
has been devoted to the Smith acquisition.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Robin Shoemaker>: I wonder if you could share with us, going forward, what would be your highest priorities
for your time and attention across all the challenges you face?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think that Smith will continue to be a priority
for at least another year or 18 months. We've kept the integration team well staffed. We are managing closely the
relationship between the Smith companies and the Schlumberger companies, and progressing quite rapidly across the
integration, but it -- like any problem that is basically a human one, it requires a great deal of attention and a lot of
communication. So I will continue to watch that. And then the obvious other one is ensuring that the passage from me
to my successor goes smoothly.
<Q - Robin Shoemaker>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Kieburtz from Weeden. Please go ahead.
<Q - Geoffrey Kieburtz>: Thanks very much. A couple of small questions for Simon. When you talked about the tax
rate in the fourth quarter, are you saying that there's going to be another 300 basis point increase in the fourth quarter?
<A - Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer>: That's correct, Geoff, yes.
<Q - Geoffrey Kieburtz>: And would that then be the reasonable run rate for 2011, obviously subject to mix profit
contribution?
<A - Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, subject to mix and some restructuring that we will start undertaking
in 2011, yeah.
<Q - Geoffrey Kieburtz>: Okay. Could you elaborate a little bit on that, what restructuring -- is this a continuation of
what you've got underway, or is there additional restructuring?
<A - Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer>: No I didn't mean a – well it's more the restructuring for the Smith
companies that we acquired, and this ...
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It takes some time, Geoff.

the WesternGeco charges, can you elaborate at all on your..?

<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, so firstly the Q charges, first generation Q,
which now we have unique in the field, it's very obvious that that is going to be obsolete very quickly. So we're biting
the bullet on what remains of the net book value and spare parts for first generation Q. And electromagnetics, we
downmanned our vessels. So the essential of that charge is the termination of the lease on the vessel, as well as an
equity investment we had in another technology that we don't want to continue.
That does not mean we have exited the electromagnetics market. We can still bid and we can reman a vessel as
necessary. And we have stayed very much in the land acquisition market for electromagnetics, as well as the processing
and interpretation.
<Q - Geoffrey Kieburtz>: All right. And in terms of technologies, you highlight this Wireline Dielectric Scanner, I
may be making this a bigger thing than it is, but is this part of your thoughts, Andrew, about the development of gas
shales in particular, moving out of brute force and ignorance?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No. No, this is not gas shale. This is a technology
that has been around for a long time, but until fairly recently, it was almost impossible to build the antenna and the
electronics to put it into service.
<Q - Geoffrey Kieburtz>: Okay.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: If we're highlighting it, it's because probably it is
likely to be the most successful wireline tool we've introduced for a long time.
<Q - Geoffrey Kieburtz>: Okay, all right. Could I ask you to elaborate a little bit on the brute force and ignorance
topic? Do you see changes going on?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think that, actually, I was a little premature with
that remark. I think that as completion technology improves, the economic effectiveness of brute force is still there -- in
the U.S. -- not overseas, but in the U.S. And probably a technology change is going to be dependent on other things. I
mean it's going to be dependent on water usage. It's going to be dependent on somebody coming with a really good
sweet spot identifying suite of logging-while-drilling, but it's still somewhere away, Geoff.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Becker from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas Becker>: Thanks. It looks like you guys are going to have a modest decline in oil service CapEx relative
to previous expectations. Is this a function of reallocating some capital post the Smith acquisition or is there another
driver there?
<A - Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer>: Are you referring to fourth quarter?
<Q - Douglas Becker>: Essentially just the 2.8 billion for Schlumberger oil services going down to 2.5.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't think -- has it gone down, Simon?
<A - Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer>: No, as a matter of fact, in the Q4 we don't – maybe as compared to what
we previously announced we did go a little bit down, yes.
<Q - Douglas Becker>: Yes, yes, just relative to what was previously announced.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's nothing to do with Smith. It may be to do with
the Macondo effect and it may be due to the fact that some of the restructuring we've been doing is leading to much
greater operating efficiency of our equipment.

improvements there. Others have specifically mentioned Norway as an area of weakness. Any thoughts on what might
be the cause of the divergence?

And your final question today comes from the even of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Thank you. Couple of questions. One is on the deepwater completion and the second one will be on
the deepwater exploration in 2011. First, one of your competitors have argued that they are introducing a deepwater
completion tool that's cutting rig time by 60%, 70%. Do you see this as a major threat to your deepwater position? Or --
or how do you intend to respond?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, actually, I'm quite surprised that it's seen as
such cutting edge because I think BJ, through the OSCA acquisition, has a very similar system and so do we. So, they
may have -- there may be something I just don't know about this, but we don't see any reason for it to be a huge
competitive threat to us or others at this point in time.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Second question is on deepwater exploration outside the Gulf of Mexico and outside Brazil. There
seems to be quite a lot of initiatives kicking off next year.
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Could you share with us your view on 2011 as a deepwater exploration year?
<A - Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Don't ask me to quantify it, Ole, but every indication
would be that it's going to be a much stronger year. And as you say, there already projects opening up in new provinces
