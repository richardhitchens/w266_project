materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties,
which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press
release and on our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Please note that on today's call, we will also be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross
margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP financial
measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation posted on the
Investor Relations portion of our website at dell.com, and in our press release included in our 8-K filing today. I
encourage you to review these documents. Also, please note that unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages
refer to year-over-year progress.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Michael.
Michael S. Dell
Thanks, Rob. We're pleased with our results in Q3 and year-to-date. This is a new Dell, and we are much better
equipped to give our customers a clear path to productivity-enhancing solutions. We're growing Enterprise Solutions
and Services, including developing and acquiring key IP and sales capability, and the result is growing earnings and
cash flow. In Q3 our Enterprise Solutions and Services business grew 8% to a record high $4.7 billion and increased
13% excluding third-party storage hardware. Enterprise Solutions and Storage now account for 46% of our gross
margin dollars.
Our improved profitability and cash flow have enabled us to move forward with strategic investments, both organic and
inorganic. Innovation in both hardware and software is fueling our new product pipeline. We're now investing in R&D
at an annual run rate approaching $1 billion. Dell now has 5,000 patents granted or pending around the world and has
over 20 R&D labs globally. We've made five acquisitions since the beginning of this year. This is enhancing our
capabilities as an Enterprise Solutions provider with a focus on server, storage, networking and security. This year,
we've also increased the number of sales resources, focused on Enterprise Solutions and Services by about 30%. This
along with our approximately $1 billion commitment to deliver Enterprise Solutions and cost-based delivery options is
making a real impact on our business.
Finally, we delivered revenue of $15.4 billion for the quarter. We're choosing not to participate in low-value
opportunities, which have put short-term pressure on revenue growth, but have been a real driver of our expanded
margins and growing earnings. We continue to believe that increasing our share of industry profits is the right strategy.
Our year-to-date GAAP operating income is 7.6% of revenues and our year-to-date GAAP EPS has increased 68%.
Now Brian and Jeff will provide more details on all of this.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Michael. I'm pleased with the progress we're making this year on our financial and strategic priorities. Our
year-to-date results are a strong indicator of our progress towards our stated goals, especially in a tougher economic
environment. We've clearly made progress in driving to more consistent profitability and expanding our cash flow
generation.
For the third quarter, our GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, or 7.4% of revenue, and we delivered EPS of
$0.49, which was up 17%. Consolidated revenue was flat at $15.4 billion, and down slightly versus the second quarter.
This was below our view heading into the third quarter, but I'm pleased with the tradeoffs that we made in the quarter.
We grew in the right places, specifically in Enterprise Solutions and Services, while continuing to migrate away from
lower value-added segments of the Client and S&P [Software and Peripherals] businesses.
As we expected, the pricing environment was slightly more aggressive in the third quarter, but our teams executed well
to maximize our profitability. In addition, we faced challenging demand dynamics in certain parts of our business,

namely Consumer in developed countries, U.S. Federal, and our Public business in Western Europe.
Let's take a closer look at the third quarter P&L. Our key performance metrics are provided for your reference on pages
6 and 7 in the web deck and as a reminder I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures for the balance of the call.
We delivered 23.1% gross margins, up 310 basis points year-over-year and 40 basis points sequentially after
normalizing for the favorable vendor settlement included in the second quarter. OpEx was 14.7% of revenue, up 230
basis points and flat sequentially. On a dollar basis, OpEx was down $39 million sequentially or 2%, which was in line
with our revenue decline. Given the more uncertain macroeconomic backdrop we reduced discretionary spending and
reduced general and administrative expenses across the business. We continue to make investments in sales, marketing
and R&D, and we're comfortable with our investment trajectory in these areas.
Going forward, we'll be closely monitoring productivity to be sure our investments here are delivering on our return
expectations. You can count on us to be prudent with additional investments until we see an improvement in the
broader economic environment.
Operating income was up 80 basis points to 8.4% with OpInc dollars up 10% to $1.3 billion. Interest and other
expenses were $70 million. Our tax rate was 19.3%, and it was driven by an increase in earnings in lower tax
jurisdictions. And earnings per share increased 20% to $0.54 per share.
Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 31 days. Inventory increased one day relative to the second quarter. Days
payable decreased two days from the second quarter, driven by linearity within the quarter and quarterly seasonality.
Days receivable was flat sequentially.
In the quarter, we generated $851 million in cash flow from operations, and have now generated $5.2 billion for the
trailing four quarters. We ended the quarter with $16 billion in cash and investments, and we repurchased $600 million
in stock in the third quarter, and now have repurchased $2.2 billion, or 142 million shares year-to-date. As we close the
year, we'll continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, balancing cash needed for key organic and
inorganic investments with repurchase activities.
Now let's take a look at our lines of business and regional performance, which you'll find detailed on pages 11 through
14 of our web deck. As I mentioned previously, we've had record revenue in our Enterprise Solutions and Services
business. Server and networking revenue increased 13% with accretive margins and rising average selling prices. There
continues to be a lot of momentum in server virtualization. Customers are partnering with Dell to provide
mission-critical services and solutions around the server resulting in competitive differentiation, richer configurations,
and continued strong profitability. This is particularly evident in our small and medium business, which had server and
networking growth of 18%.
Total storage declined 15% while Dell-owned IP storage increased 23% to $388 million led by a refreshed EqualLogic
solution suite and our Compellent fiber channel SANs. The favorable mix shift in our storage business continues to
drive significantly improved profitability, and this will continue.
Dell Services revenue grew 10% to $2.1 billion, and now represents 14% of our business. Our transactional services
business increased 10% as we saw very strong attach rates of Dell premium services. The outsourcing business grew
9%, and our projects increased 15%.
Total value of new services contracts signed is $1.9 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Services backlog increased
11% to $15.5 billion, led by contracted services backlog growth of 12%. These leading indicators continue to position
us well for strong services' long-term growth going forward.
Our Desktop revenue was down 6% while our notebook revenue was down 2%. Client gross margin dollars are up over
20%, driven by a focus on high-value products and solutions. Our Software and Peripherals business continues to be an
example of an area where we're enhancing our profitability by exiting portions of the business where the solutions are
not strategic, or are lower value-added. Revenue for the quarter declined 2% to $2.5 billion. However, gross margin
dollars increased double-digits. Our focus on disciplined pricing is also evident in this space. A good proof point for
this is our displays business, where we saw revenue increase 5% with gross margin dollars increased 46%.

Growth markets continue to be a key driver for the company. Revenue for these geographies grew 11% in the third
quarter and is up 14% year-to-date.
Turning to our segment level performance, which is detailed on pages 16 through 19 of the web deck, large enterprise
revenue was up 4% to $4.5 billion, led by Enterprise Solutions and Services growth of 11%. Services revenue increased
14% as we continue to expand our vertical expertise and develop solutions relevant to our customers' business needs.
We remain focused on strategic business opportunities, and are not chasing those that are non-strategic with price.
Operating income as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points to 9.8% of revenue, and we delivered $441
million of operating income in the quarter. Our Public business delivered revenue of $4.4 billion, which was down 2%.
The primary drivers are continued weakness in U.S. Federal and Western Europe. For U.S. Federal, we experienced a
normal end-of-the-fiscal-year revenue ramp in September. However, in October, which is the first month of the Federal
fiscal year, we saw a slower spending pattern that was softer than historical norms. The pipeline of opportunities
focused on government productivity continues to be good, but deals are not closing at the rate that we've seen in
previous years.
Despite the overall revenue decline, Services revenue increased 7% to a record level for the business and Dell IP
Storage revenue is up 35%. Both of these are good examples of this productivity focus. Operating income was $463
million, or 10.6% of revenue, which is up 40 basis points from the previous year. Small and medium business revenue
grew 1% to $3.7 billion. Client growth was slower than expected as we saw muted spending in medium businesses in
both the U.S. and Western Europe.
There continues to be industry-based channel inventory challenges, particularly in Europe as competitors aggressively
move product out of the channel, we did not match the level of pricing aggression in most cases. SMB had a very
strong quarter in Enterprise Solutions and Services with revenue of $1.1 billion, an all-time high and up 18%. The
improved mix is resulting in continued strong operating income performance. SMB delivered $386 million in operating
income or 10.4% of revenue.
Despite facing growth challenges the Consumer business expanded margins both sequentially and year-over-year and
reduced OpEx spend from the second quarter to deliver $76 million of operating income or 2.7% of revenue. Consumer
revenue declined 6% to $2.8 billion as the Consumer European business stabilized, Asia-Pacific had very strong
growth, but the Americas business had a decline as we continue to exit low-value segments of the consumer space that
aren't profitable.
The migration to higher-value products has proven to be effective. Our high-end consumer notebook line, XPS, grew
revenue 207% overall and is now approaching 20% of our total consumer notebook revenue and 30% of our consumer
notebook margins. For three quarters the consumer business has delivered operating income of 3.3%, compared to
negative operating income for the first three quarters of last year.
Our Global Commercial Channel business grew revenue in the third quarter, and we now have close to 100,000
partners in our partner program with over 2,000 of them at the preferred and premiere levels. This has proven to expand
the reach of our solutions to the broadest set of customers and provides them with more choice and flexibility. We
continue to build a very strong reputation in the channel, exemplified by receiving CRN's award for best mid-range
servers for the second consecutive year.
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff Clarke to discuss the end-user computing business and operations.
Jeffrey W. Clarke
Thanks, Brian. In June we shared three initiatives that are our primary focuses for end user computing team. First,
strengthen our core. We have massively simplified our offerings with a dramatic reduction in configurations, simplified
our supply chain and enhanced our online ordering process and achieved more than a 30% reduction in supply chain
costs since the end of fiscal 2009. We have grown our pre-configuration offerings from 19% of client shipments at the

beginning of FY '11 to approximately 40% today. We are now shipping 60% of eligible units on the ocean in
consumer, small and medium business on our way to a 70% exit rate by year-end. And systems going through contract
manufacturing have averaged greater than 70% this year, up from 53% at the beginning of fiscal '11.
Second, we are also delivering a broad range of solutions and services. In addition, we have deliberately reduced our
exposure to the low end of the Client business, redirecting those resources and OpEx to higher-value opportunities. For
example, the revenue mix of services and S&P tied to the system is up 50 basis points. We have exited over $2 billion
of low-value Client across our business, and premium products gained share year-over-year for the fifth consecutive
quarter. These two initiatives have allowed us to maintain operating margins a little above 5% throughout the year.
Third, over the coming year, we will closely work with key partners like Microsoft, Intel, Google and ARM suppliers
to introduce new and innovative solutions that will resonate with our core commercial and prosumer customer base.
Turning to the topic of hard drives, we want to express our concern for those affected by the tragic flooding in
Thailand. As all of you know, the flooding has significantly impacted the hard drive supply chain, but the complexity
of the issue and the current state of affairs in Thailand with the floodwaters are still receding makes it very difficult for
the industry to pinpoint the magnitude or duration of shortages. So, that puts the industry in an allocation environment
at least through Q1. Last month, we made strategic purchases of inventory and pulled in supply from our hubs. This
drove an increase in our end-of-quarter DSI.
We also have teams working with the impacted suppliers to manage our hard drive supply chain and qualify new
sources of supply. Our goal is to mitigate any impact to our customers and Dell, and our teams will be working
throughout the quarter to do just that. We have worked through various forms of industry supply shortages in the past
and each brings different variables into play, but we have found our operating model has proven to be very adaptable
and effective at managing through these situations in optimized manner.
With that, I will turn it back over to Brian to provide a business outlook.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Jeff. Let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. I'd like to remind you that every six years we have
a fourteenth week in the fourth quarter to effectively align our calendar and fiscal years. For this fourth quarter, we
believe the fourteenth week will be worth approximately three percentage points of revenue growth, driven primarily
by the transactional businesses. Our relationship-driven businesses have historically showed little benefit from these
dynamics.
We're pleased with our year-to-date non-GAAP operating income performance, as we delivered $4 billion of operating
income, which represents growth of 39% year-over-year. We're committed to the strategy we communicated at the
analyst meeting in June, and we're trending above our outlook of 17% to 23% full year non-GAAP operating income
growth. The teams are aligned and incentivized to sustain pricing discipline and maximize operating income and cash
flow. Given the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the complexity in working through the hard drive issue, we
are trending to the bottom of the range of our revenue outlook of 1% to 5% full year growth.
We'll continue to be very diligent in managing operating expenses. We've invested significantly over the past several
quarters in key strategic areas of the business, and we've tightly managed less strategic spending to enable this. Given
the scale of these investments and the weaker demand environment, you can expect that we'll moderate incremental
investments and focus on driving productivity from our recently added resources as we head into FY '13. We anticipate
interest and other to be around $70 million in expense in the fourth quarter, and we expect our fourth quarter tax rate to
be between 17% and 19% on a non-GAAP basis.
We're on track for another outstanding year. With our third quarter results, we've delivered $8.9 billion in operating
income over the past two years. And for this fiscal year, we're on track to exceed the long-term value creation operating
income target of 7% on a GAAP basis. We've made significant progress in building a more diversified and competitive
set of enterprise-focused businesses that now represent almost 50% of the margin of the company. We look forward to

providing you with an updated outlook for FY '13 in February and continuing to update you on the progress that we're
making.
With that, let's open it up for Q&A.
Robert L. Williams
Thanks, Brian. Just a quick reminder to limit your questions to one with one follow-up. Kristin, can we have the first
question?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much for taking my question. These are more questions regarding our – a
question regarding the HDD shortage. So, I'm not sure who wants to take it. But I'm curious as to how much is baked
into your guidance, and if you're hearing from any of your vendors on changes of length of contract or pricing
regarding the HDD shortage?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hey, Shannon. It's Brian. I'll take the first part then Jeff can take the second. The outlook
that we provided fully contemplates what we know now. And so we've incorporated everything we know, and how we
think we're going to manage through that in the outlook that we provided for the fourth quarter and the total year.
<A - Jeffrey W. Clarke>: And, Shannon, I think your second part of the question was what's changing in terms, and
how different individuals are working with the hard drive supply base, is that correct?
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Correct. It's if there's any change.
<A - Jeffrey W. Clarke>: I think from our point of view, nothing's really changed. We've had strategic partnerships in
place with long-term agreements with our key partners. We've managed this as a strategic commodity. It's clearly an
important area given our Storage and Enterprise business, as well as our Client business. We've committed to those
partnerships over the long run and in these times of crisis they tend to pay a dividend.
With specific to the crisis at hand, we've acted, I think, very decisively and promptly. Within 24 hours of being notified
of a potential flood situation we pulled in all inventory from our hubs into Dell warehouses in Dell locations. So, we
moved within 24 hours the potential of this occurring into the strategic inventory that Brian made reference to earlier
and the impact to our DSI for the quarter.
Within 48 hours we actually had a risk management team in place that began the process of how we manage our
business. The ability to manage business continuity with the solid processes and skills that we've developed over the
years we put in place. Matching supply with customer needs, understanding how to shape demand, understanding the
availability of the parts coming in with pending needs of our customers and balancing that continuity of supply with the
needs of our different business units, that's how we responded. We continue to do that today and I'm optimistic that our
team is working through the situation at hand, which is a difficult one at best. But we're in a position where we think
we can mitigate the impact to our customers for the quarter.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. And then just one follow-up. Does this change at all your thoughts on timing for
Ultrabooks or SSD adoption?
<A - Jeffrey W. Clarke>: Well, I think it will be pretty obvious when you see the response by the industry. SSD attach
rates will go up. They're low single-digits today so I don't expect that to be a huge aid in solving the shortages that are
in the disk drive industry today. And we'll have an Ultrabook that will be later – will arrive late in the fiscal year.

Your next question is from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America.
<Q - Brian Woonhyung Cho>: Hi. This is Brian Cho in place of Scott. It looks like your operating margin in the
fourth quarter could come down more than 150 bps quarter-over-quarter. Could you provide us with more details on the
drivers behind that, please?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: You say operating income levels?
<Q - Brian Woonhyung Cho>: Yes. Operating margin.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Operating margins, yes. Well, look, I think we've been consistent throughout the year as we
look at the dynamics that we see and have been somewhat conservative in how we're playing our outlook as we move
forward. We've delivered strong gross margins. We've shown that we're going be prudent with our OpEx investments
and I think we've tried to capture the uncertainty that exists in the market – [audio difficulties] 25:00
<Q - Brian Woonhyung Cho>: Hello?
Operator
Mr. Craig, your line is still open. I believe that question has been withdrawn. Your next question is from Keith
Bachman with Bank of Montreal.

question. So, let's just go ahead and go to the next question.

<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Hoping you can comment on your outlook for IT spending growth heading into next year.
You flagged some areas of caution. Do you think we're looking at a flat to down IT spending environment in calendar
'12?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think IT spending is still an enormous driver of productivity, and we would expect a
reasonably healthy spend environment. It's certainly – we're indexing our solutions and activity around those things
where there is strong appetite. If you look at our business, the Enterprise segment is growing very nicely. Services are
growing very nicely. Servers and Networking, we had a 13% increase in the quarter. Very strong growth in
Networking, 43% without Force 10 acquisition and 83% with; Servers, which is a very core part of our business, was
up 12% and Services was up 10%. So, we feel in a $3 trillion industry there's plenty of opportunity for us to grow and
grow our profits.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: So my follow-up would be around consensus expectations for calendar '12 suggests earnings
will be down for Dell, yet you seem pretty optimistic about growing your higher margin product areas. So, is the Street
or is consensus missing something about your outlook for next year? Or can you help us kind of circle the square, if
you will? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Chris, I mean, we haven't provided an outlook for FY '13. We intend to do that for
you in February just like we have in the past. And until we do that, not going to comment on what consensus is right
now.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. HP faced tremendous organizational uncertainty this quarter, and I think
at the surface, it would really seem that it was ripe for Dell to gain share. But it appears that the company lost share,
particularly in PCs, and revenues were flat year-over-year. Now, I fully understand your desire to focus on profitability
and not participate in low-value segments, and I heard when Jeff said that you appear to have walked away from $2
billion in business in the Client area. But I guess the question is, how much more unattractive business do you have in
your portfolio that you actually want to de-emphasize going forward? Because that's going to continue to put a drag on
your revenue growth. So, how do we think about how much more unattractive business you have? And how long until
you're kind of through that, and we can see you growing at a market rate or better?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Toni, I think this is something clearly we've been doing for a while and I think as we
work through the portfolio, it's fairly broad-based. I mean, it's Client, but there are other areas, too. One of the areas
that we'll continue to work through is third-party software. I think that's an area that we have a fair amount of revenue
today with relatively unattractive margins, and we'll work through that over the next several quarters. I think
low-margin Client continues to be a place that I don't think we're going be very aggressive. There may be some selected
opportunities there where we can see strategic benefits, but I think it's going to continue. I'm not going to give you a
view on when we stop because I think it's going to continue for a while.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: But is the implication of that ultimately, if you're going to be walking away from chunks
of your business, we should be thinking about Dell growing at below-market revenue rates. I appreciate the focus on
operating profit and you've shown an ability to grow operating profit very strong and above-market, but the implication
on the top line is we should be expecting you to grow below margin, is that correct? Below market, excuse me.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, look, I think you've got look at the individual pieces. I think there clearly are areas
where we we're going to see above-market growth and as the business mixes up, and that Enterprise Solutions and
Services portion of the business becomes bigger, as we grow share in the higher priced, say, higher value area of the
Client space, I think those are all places we should grow faster than the market. So, I'm not going to give you a
longer-term view, but I think we can grow the company, and I think there are clearly places where – that's where we're

making investments for the future.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And then my follow-up, please, if I may. You've been a little coy about saying whether
you actually expect any impact from HDDs in Q4. So, could you comment on whether you expect an impact? And is
the bigger risk to revenues or to margins because of the shortfall? And what's your rationale in your thinking?
<A - Jeffrey W. Clarke>: Look, Toni, I think one of the challenges we're working through is the situation is quite
dynamic. It changes every day. The floodwaters haven't receded yet. Our risk management team is in looking at the
Tier 2 and Tier 3 supply base from base plates, motors, actuators, bearings, top covers, et cetera, and we're also
working with each of our partners to understand what our recovery plans look like or their recovery plans look like
from building to equipment overhaul to reinstall to re-qualification. It's a very dynamic world out there in this – with
this hard drive situation.
Our view is, given the nature of how fast we acted, how promptly we pulled in inventory, how we manage our
business, which you'll very well know, but for everybody else, 70% of our business is still direct. We can manage
lead-time availability. We know what customers have an urgent deployment and an urgent need and match up that
supply so we don't miss key customer deliverables. That's how we're managing through the current situation. We've
prioritized our businesses, we've prioritized our customers, all the things that you'd expect us to do to mitigate the
impact to our end users.
I know that's not answering your specific question on how we're positioned. The team, we believe we're in good shape
to mitigate the impact to our customers for the quarter. The financial outlook that Brian gave actually has our look of
availability and supply and our ability to deliver it to our customers.

The next question is from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Hi. A couple of questions. First of all, on the Server business, I appreciate it grew
year-on-year, but if you look over the last four quarters, it really hasn't grown sequentially, so you are coming up
against difficult comps there. So, could you speak about how much – first of all, just in the revenue growth outlook
how you think about that over the next year or so?
And in addition, I think you've been exiting some of the lower end Server business as well, and how much more
potential margin improvement there is.
And then for Brian just a specific question, you mentioned a sensible caution, let's say, on OpEx going forward. Could
SG&A go, for example, back down to levels we saw close to 11%, or is this going to be just a very minor adjustment
depending upon the environment? Any clarity there would be helpful. Many thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I'll take the OpEx point and then maybe Michael can comment on Servers, and what's going
on there. I think we continued to invest in the quarter. We made incremental investments in selling, in R&D, in many
cases, aligned with some of the acquisitions and new technologies that we're developing internally. That will continue.
I think we've done a good job of basically managing effectively G&A and managing discretionary spending in this
environment, and in some cases, moderating some of those investments in line with what we're seeing in the demand.
So, I think that's how we're going to continue to manage it quarter-to-quarter. We'll continue to make progress in
making these investments. And I think that's the disciplined approach we're taking to OpEx spending in this
environment.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Okay. If you look at our revenue growth, it's been pretty consistently – it's actually been
double-digits every quarter for the last five quarters except for the second quarter where it was 9%. So, we've been,
20%, 16%, 11%, 9%, 13%.

With respect to units, we talked earlier about in the Client business how we are prioritizing profit share over unit share.
I would say in Servers, this is even more true, and I would tell you that the unit measurements are almost to the point of
being irrelevant. And the reason is that there are many different types of servers. There are $500 servers, there are
$5,000 servers, there are $50,000 servers, and if you want to sell a lot of units you sell $500 servers, that's not the way
you grow profits and earnings. That's not what we're focused on. We're focused on how do we capture the value, which
are the higher revenue, higher margin, more intense workloads?
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Yes, just on enterprise storage, it looks like your Dell-owned IP revenue was down
sequentially, but it sounds like you're happy with the acquisitions that you've made there – Compellent, EqualLogic, et
cetera. Can you elaborate on the lack of revenue momentum that you're seeing? I thought you expected it to bounce
back this quarter, and when do you expect to see the head count additions, which have been substantial, translate to
more meaningful growth in storage?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, it was okay. It wasn't completely up to our expectations. There is some room for
improvement there. Growth in Dell IP storage was 23% year-over-year, and it's now 84% of our overall storage
business. We had good demand for Compellent. We launched a whole new product cycle in EqualLogic. There's
definitely more to do here, and you're right, we have put a lot of new people into the organization, and they're
becoming productive, and we still remain very optimistic about our ability to grow that business.

Question is from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me back in. The first one I have is on Services. It looks to be
the standout performance there. What's the trajectory as you look out going forward, and what's the driver of that in
terms of the various segments of – within the context of Services? In particular, backlog was – it looks like flat
sequentially and yet even Services was up about 4% sequentially. So, just hoping you could offer a little bit of color
there and I have a follow-up, please?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I think – we continue to make progress with the Services business as we talked about.
We completed the majority of the integration work with Perot Systems and Dell Services over the last couple quarters. I
think the team's made some nice progress. We've had very strong new Services contracts signings over the course of
the last 12 months. We talked about $1.9 billion. I think the team's also done a nice job improving profitability. And we
saw sequential nice improvement in overall profitability within the Services business. Backlog, I think, quarter on
quarter was up $100 million.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right. Right. Yes.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: And was up 11% year-over-year. The deferred balance on the transactional services side
continues to move up I think a couple digits in the quarter. So, overall I think the Services, again, was the highlight for
the quarter.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: So Brian would you – yeah, I'm sorry, Michael, go ahead.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: To put it in perspective, you go back a couple years ago, the Services backlog was $5 billion,
$5.5 billion. Now, it's $15.5 billion. We have really changed the business pretty substantially. We've got 14% of our
revenue in Services. It's growing nicely. We've changed the conversation with our customers and made a lot of progress
towards this solution focus that we've been telling you about.

<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Well, my follow up, Michael, then perhaps is for you. On – the desktop numbers
continue to lag in terms of year-over-year growth in revenues, and just wondering how you can comment or if you
could comment rather on, are you seeing inflections in terms of the upgrade cycle that companies are interested in
because of the economic cycles? And is that showing up in the desktop numbers? And then how should we think about
Win 8 next year in terms of that upgrade cycle?
<A - Jeffrey W. Clarke>: Hey, Keith (sic) [Brian], this is Jeff.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey W. Clarke>: So when we look at the deployment of Windows 7 in corporate, and where it is relative to
the install base, I believe last month was the first month we've seen the Windows 7 outpace Windows XP in our
deployments out of our factories. It shows that there's continued movement and the refresh is well underway. Most
estimates have the refresh of Windows 7 in the install base in corporate less than 50%. I think our estimate is
somewhere right around 40%. So, there's still quite a bit of corporate refresh on the desktop and the notebook and then
business to migrate to the new operating system, which is Windows 7.
Then we have Windows 8 coming out next year, which we think is a tremendous upgrade opportunity around the touch
interface. When I look at the opportunities of our XPS products, potentially new, mobile products that will be out by
the Windows 8 timeframe, there's an expansion opportunity that Windows 8 enables around the touch interface and
closing the competitive gap that exists today.
<A - Robert L. Williams>: All right. Next question?

Next question is from the line of Maynard Um with UBS.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi. Thank you. On product gross margins, they look like they're down sequentially albeit on a
GAAP basis. And I would have thought they'd be up as you walk away from lower margin business. So, can you just
talk about why that is, and should we assume, because of that, when your – when you say you're tracking ahead of your
op income guide, should we be thinking about tens of basis points rather than 100-plus basis points or is there greater
expansion, margin expansion, gross margin expansion opportunity in product next quarter?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Maynard, again, I think we're talking about operating income. I think the reality is
there are moving pieces within gross margin. As you know, in the second quarter we had – we talked about the benefit
from a supplier settlement that affected our margins. I think obviously that's one of the elements moving around. I think
we've driven very consistent to sustain margins for the last year on the product side and in total. Again, part of that is
making constant trade-offs around growth versus margins and I think we'll continue to balance that. So, I think you can
expect more of the same. That's really how we're going to manage it. And I think as you think about fourth quarter
heading into next year, that continues to be a priority to focus on that profit and not necessarily focus as much on the
unit shares.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: And if I could just follow up on your revenue guidance, can you just parse out how much of
your guidance at the low end is comfort on the HDDs because of the inventory you've drawn down from the hubs
versus your ability to actually procure drives from the drive manufacturers? Thanks.
<A - Robert L. Williams>: I don't think we can parse it for you that finely. Next question.

<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. Thank you. I'm not sure if you can answer this one either, but I was hoping that
maybe Brian, you could talk a little bit about puts and takes on the gross margin for the fourth quarter. And in
particular, typically consumer mix is a negative for you in the fourth quarter, but I thought you might be diverting a
little bit more HDD supply to your more profitable businesses.
Also I'd be interested to get some commentary on the net impact on your bill of materials from the safe HDD issue
because on the one hand, drive prices go up, but every other component probably comes down at an accelerated rate.
And then also, some comments on competitive pricing as well – impact on gross margin? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think that was five questions, Richard.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yeah, pretty good, Richard.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Yeah, well, they all affect gross margin. That's the common thread.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I'll give you some of the pieces. Again, I think we've done a good job of managing a
lot of these elements over the course of the last year, year or more longer. I think as you look at the fourth quarter, you
just hit some of the points. We've highlighted the fact that the pricing environment has tended to be slightly more
aggressive than what we've seen over the last few quarters. I think that will – obviously, we're watching that, and we're
trying to make sure that we manage for profit and there are places where we haven't necessarily jumped into some of
those aggressive pricing dynamics.
I think when you look at component prices, clearly, we would expect the price per drive on the hard disk side to go up.
We're seeing that, and I think the reality is that when you look at the overall aggregate component cost for the quarter,
there's enough other deflation in other components that's going to more than offset that is our current view. So, we
should see net deflation, albeit relatively small, within the quarter. That's how we're thinking about it right now.
Consumer mix has traditionally been a bit of a headwind in the fourth quarter. I think given how we've been managing
the Consumer business and the kind of business that we're taking in Consumer, I'm not sure that's going be the biggest
challenge we have. So, a lot of we think sustainable improvements in the supply chain, as Jeff talked about, that will
continue to contribute. And you put all of those things together and again, we're trying to manage consistently and
sustain high margins, and that's I think what you can expect in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. And then I guess a quick follow-up then, it doesn't sound like gross margins should
be down a lot sequentially this year. Is that a fair assessment?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think that's sort of the net of everything I said, yeah. Jeff?
<A - Jeffrey W. Clarke>: Richard, I'll just explain -
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Jeffrey W. Clarke>: I'm just going to add to what Brian mentioned. As the hard drive situation unfolds, and
we've had our risk mitigation team in place now for well over four weeks, we've been able to adjust pricing to reflect
the costs. So, we've been able to reflect the value of this strategic commodity in our products across our storage arrays
to our servers all the way down into notebook and the desktop. And you've seen that in our Consumer business, in our
Small and Medium Desktop and Notebook business.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: And I think, Richard, you hit the point, which is, in higher supply chain, including the
OEMs, are fairly focused on protecting their highest-value customers, and I think that will play out across the quarter
and over the next probably few quarters.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah, great. Thanks for answering that last question in such detail because that was
mine, but I want to ask a second one. The repurchase rate, $600 million, what are you thinking about for fourth quarter
and beyond? And any other thoughts about capital allocation, and how you're thinking about things? Some of the
companies in the space are also doing dividends of late. So, those – that's my follow-up, is going to be what you're
thinking of a dividend, so capital allocation, repo in the 4Q and your thoughts on the dividend?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Ben, no real change in our messaging around capital allocation. We continue to focus
on strategic investments, organic and inorganic, to really help drive the strategy and transformation of the company.
And then secondly, returning capital to shareholders with a share repurchase program. The target that we gave – we've
been giving for a while is 10% to 30% of free cash flow. I think we did more than in the first half, driven by really
higher cash flow generation and our ability to raise capital at favorable terms at the time. I think we'll head back as you
think about the second half in total and aggregate, back into that 10% to 30% of a free cash flow number. So, that's how
we're thinking about it.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Robert L. Williams>: Touch on the dividend question at all?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, it's not something we would talk about right now, and I think one of the challenges
that I think we'd have to face into is really U.S. liquidity and the dynamics that, that gives us around cash availability to
do something like that. So, we'll continue to look at that.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Yes, thank you. As it relates to the price aggression you saw in the October quarter, was it
largely a function of some of your PC peers defending their market as they made strategic decisions and worked
through some of their inventory or was the price aggression more broad across the Enterprise segment as well? And
then also was it specific to any geographies?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes. I think we highlighted it a bit in the talking points – clearly, the channel in Europe –
there were some challenges in terms of moving inventory through that channel and I think we concluded we weren't
going to match pricing in that space, and that effected our growth. I think that there were other areas. As you look at,
for instance, mid-range storage, as you look at – as Michael highlighted – higher volume Server opportunities, those are
all places we've seen more aggressive pricing.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: And then just as a quick follow-up, Brian, you had commented on OpEx earlier, and it sounds
like you're trying to rationalize some projects in this macro environment. But do you think we can actually see OpEx
continue to come down sequentially? Understanding that fourth quarter has the extra week, and so there'll be a little bit
of a blip in 4Q, but beyond that, do you think that you can bring operating expense down sequentially as you rationalize
some of those projects?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I don't think we can commit to that. I think we continue to make investments and I think
you're going to see some areas where we increase OpEx and other areas where we continue to reduce and take cost out
of less strategic areas. So, it'll be a bit of a mix. Clearly, have the 14th week that will put pressure in the fourth quarter.
No question on that.

Your next question is from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Thank you. A quick follow-up on HDD supply and a question on networking. Brian or Jeff, is it
fair to assume that F Q1 could be more of a challenge from a supply standpoint than the January quarter?
<A - Jeffrey W. Clarke>: Our view of the situation is the challenge in supply is through the first half of next year.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Fair enough. Maybe an update on Force 10 performance and anything you can say about your
willingness to expand your networking portfolio in general either organic or inorganic.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yes, feeling really great about the Networking business. We had 43% growth without Force 10.
83% with the addition of Force 10. And the real play here for us of course, is changing the conversation from a Server
conversation to Server, Storage, Networking, and Orchestration Software and the whole datacenter and given the
number of Servers that we sell there's a lot of pull that we can drive in our networking business and certainly, our
ambitions go beyond switching and you'll have to stay tuned for future announcements.

We'll now take our final question from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot for sneaking me in. Just a question on the extra week that you guys talked about.
What sort of impact will that have on OpEx and EPS line in the Jan quarter?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, really all the information we gave was that we would expect some incremental
revenue, and we basically said 3% of incremental revenue would show up as a result of that. That's recognizing that the
transactional business likely will provide incremental revenue during that period. We don't expect a big impact from
the relationship business. There are some other dynamics likely playing out. One would be the Chinese New Year
timing. And that impacts on the supply chain, as well as Asian customer demand during really the 13th week of our
quarter. We think also has some impact. Not going to provide any real input in terms of the OpEx dynamics, and what
we're going to see in other parts of the P&L.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Got it. And then can I just follow up? Given the direct business that you guys have at least on
the consumer side, can you just talk about what you see in terms of so far into the early year-end Christmas sell through
in North America?
<A - Robert L. Williams>: I didn't – can you repeat the question please?
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Yes. I was just wondering if you look at the direct part of your business, the direct model, can
you start with what you're seeing in terms of U.S. consumer spending heading into holiday season this year?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I don't think, Amit, we have any real view that's different than typical sort of
seasonality we would expect to see. There's nothing exceptional here.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yes. The one thing that we're focused on as we focus on the higher profit areas of the Client
business is XPS, and we continue to introduce new products there. We had 207% increase in our XPS notebook
business this last quarter and stay tuned for future product announcements.
<A - Jeffrey W. Clarke>: And new product launches.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yes. We just launched XPS 14z.
