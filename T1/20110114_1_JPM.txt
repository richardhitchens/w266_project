MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth quarter 2010earnings call. This call is
being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call.
We will now go live to the presentation, please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan
Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go
ahead.
Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, operator. I'm going to take everybody through the earnings presentation. It's available on the website, as you
know, and we'll take questions after the presentation. And finally, take a note of the slide in the back of the presentation
regarding forward-looking statements.
With that, let me start on page one. We generated $4.8 billion of net income in the quarter, $1.12 per share. That's on
revenues of $26.7 billion. For the full year, you see we generated $17.4 billion in net income. That's up 48% over last
year, $3.96 per share, and revenues slightly under 105 billion. Our full-year return on tangible common equity was

15%.
We're highlighting a number of significant items in the quarter. It is not every action in the quarter, but I just want to
walk through these quickly and make sure we have clarity around them. The first is we added a net increase in RFS to
loan loss allowances of what equates to $0.14 a share reduction in earnings. And just quickly, that $930 million pre-tax
does not include a one-time adjustment. I'll talk about it when we get to home lending of $632 million release of
reserves. That corresponds to an increase of net charge-offs which is basically a wash, but I'll get into more detail later
on that.
Card, we reduced our loan loss allowances by what equates to $0.30 a share increase in earnings. We also took an
increase in litigation reserve, predominantly mortgage related. That reduced earnings $0.22 a share. And additionally,
at the end we recognized a $1.2 billion pre-tax or $0.18 a share after-tax gain in corporate, and that's largely related to
the repositioning of our securities portfolio. And in addition, that's going to have a negative impact on NII in successive
quarters. Broadly speaking, very solid performance across most of the businesses, but I will talk about each of those in
turn.
And then finally, just a note on our common ratios; Tier 1 common ended the year at $115 billion. We had very strong
Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 9.8%. And you see here our estimated Basel III ratio of 7%, which, as you know, is the
minimum requirement for Jan. 1, 2019.
James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
This is Jamie. I want to interrupt for one second. So Doug, I just want to reiterate. A lot of you have raised the question
that reserves came down by $2 billion. On this page, you see them coming down by approximately 1 billion. And the
difference is the $600 million, which we have accelerated charge-offs which are already recognized in reserves and
reserves taken down. And then there's another $400 million, which is all various wholesale related type stuff. There's a
little confusion out there about where that came from, but the $600 million obviously is a timing difference. It didn't
affect income. Charge-offs were accelerated; reserves were taken down.
Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer
So with that, I think we've covered most of page two and three, so let me dive into the Investment Bank on page four.
You see circled net income of $1.5 billion. That's on revenues of $6.2 billion in the quarter. IB fees of $1.8 billion; we
continue to be ranked number one in fees, but it is an increasingly competitive market, and you see that in results.
The results also reflect a record in debt underwriting for the quarter as well as for full-year 2010, and also record
Investment Banking fees in Asia for 2010. The league table results you'll see are on page 20 in the back. Revenue of $4
billion in fixed income and equities; that's up 8% year over year. It's down modestly quarter on quarter, and that's
largely based on continued solid client flows and normalized trading spreads.
One quick note on DVA, which was effectively flat for the quarter; fixed income markets excluding DVA would have
been down $377 million quarter on quarter, essentially flat year over year. Equity markets excluding DVA would have
been down $141 million quarter on quarter, flat year over year. And that really reflects the negative impact of DVA to
revenues in the third quarter.
Credit costs here, a benefit of $271 million, so that's part of that $2 billion allowance that you saw in total. That largely
reflects a reduction in loan loss allowance related to net repayments and loan sales. Expenses in the quarter of $4.2
billion, that's up significantly year over year. That's primarily due to higher performance-based compensation year over
year. The comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter is 30%. And there's also an increase in our non-comp expense, and that
includes litigation reserves taken in the quarter.
Full year, if you looked at comp-to-revenue ratio, it's 35% excluding the UK bonus tax. And that's largely consistent
with our prior guidance of 35% to 40%. It's up from 33% in full-year 2009, in part because of higher head count. And

going forward, we really expect full-year comp-to-revenue ratios to continue to be in that range of 35% to 40%.
Final number circled here on the bottom of the page, end-of-period loans of $56.9 billion; that's up 6% quarter on
quarter. And we're beginning to see that new business activity build; and as a result of that, some increasing demand in
loans as the market for credit and the economy generally pick up.
Page five, Retail Banking; this is the consolidated results for the fourth quarter, $708 million of net income on $8.5
billion of revenue, and I'm going to review each of the segments in detail on the following pages.
So if you turn to page six, you see, you see Retail Banking net income of $954 million. That's on revenues of $4.4
billion. Revenues are down 2% year over year, and that largely reflects lower deposit related fees, full-year impact of
NSF OD fee changes. And that's offset by our continuing build-out of the retail branch footprint. Deposit growth was
3%. Year-over-year checking accounts were up 6%. Year-over-year investment sales up 4% year over year. And as you
know, we built 154 new branches; 70% of those branches are in California and Florida. You'll note here, by the way,
credit costs here include a loan loss allowance reserve release of $100 million in Business Banking, again, part of that
$2 billion number.
Mortgage Banking and other consumer lending, you see circled net income of 577 million. That's on $2.8 billion of
total revenue. Revenue here reflects strong mortgage banking origination revenues, higher production volumes, almost
$51 billion in the quarter, $56 billion in total originations. And you also had improved margins year over year.
We're separating out now repurchase expense. You see that number of $349 million. And remember, that's a
contra-revenue item. The number is down $300 million year over year. It's down $1 billion quarter on quarter. And
that's largely the absence of reserve builds, but we end the year in RFS with a total repurchase reserve of $3 billion.
Expenses in the quarter of $1.7 billion, that's up almost $400 million quarter on quarter, $600 million year on year. And
that largely reflects higher default related costs, but it includes an impact of the estimated cost over time associated
with the foreclosure delays from the affidavit issues. We took that cost in the fourth quarter. Credit costs in this
segment also benefited from an allowance release in auto finance of $150 million as the trends there improved.
The real estate portfolio on page seven, this is the consolidated result. Lower revenues here of $1.3 billion, that's
largely based on continued loan runoff. Our balances declined year over year $29 billion as we continue to run off the
Washington Mutual portfolio, losses in the portfolio for the quarter of $823 million. And the total credit cost number of
$2.3 billion; I think it is helpful if we cover that in detail on page eight, so I'll turn to that now.
So there's a lot going on here. I'm going to take a little bit of time here on this page. Home lending net charge-offs as
reported is $1.750 billion, and you see that on the left. Now that includes that $632 million adjustment that I referenced
at the beginning Jamie talked about. That's related to the timing of when we take charge-offs on delinquent loans. And
so what we've effectively done is accelerate our net charge-offs for delinquent loans, and we've correspondingly
released the $632 million number in our reserves. So it's essentially a shift in geography from reserves to charge-offs,
but this doesn't have an impact on our results for the quarter, but that $632 million is picked up as part of our total
company allowance release.
If you really look at the underlying fundamental picture, absent the changes in accounting for the fourth quarter, you
see the circled number of $1.15 billion, which is basically flat to modestly improved over the third quarter. And it's
largely in line with the delinquency trends we've seen over the second and the third quarter. You see in the specifics,
home equity losses are flat and the mortgage portfolios are showing some modest improvement, and you can see more
detail of those trends on page 18 in the appendix.
So given the reductions quarter on quarter in the losses and the fact that delinquencies are basically flat to slightly
improved, we've taken a reserve release in the home lending portfolios of $950 million in the quarter, and you see that
as the last bullet on the right.
We're also, as a result of the last three quarters, changing our outlook. You see our outlook, quarterly net charge-offs of
$1.2 billion plus or minus, and that's really based on current delinquencies and the severity outlook that we see today.

Page 4 of 23
The last change on this page, you look at the PCI [Purchased Credit Impaired] performance on the bottom right. And
remember, for PCI we're using lifetime loss estimates for the portfolio. And as we've previously told you in our third
quarter call, the estimates assume an improvement in delinquencies and I think given our last several quarters of actual
experience. As a result of that, we've increased our estimates on remaining lifetime losses for the portfolios. And the
result is we're taking a $2.1 billion incremental impairment in PCI, and that is predominantly related to home equity.
So with all those actions, we thought it would be helpful to just summarize the reserve positions around mortgages in
general, and so we're doing that on page nine. And maybe I can try and give you the key takeaways from our
perspective going into 2011. The first is on the agency side. Between the $5.6 billion that we've taken in both expense
and reserves and $1.2 billion plus or minus guidance that we have for 2011, we believe we've got a pretty good chance
here of being done on the agency repurchase side. And this is certainly consistent with the analysis that Charlie
presented to you all in the fall.
James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And that they do.
Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer
And it is certainly consistent. In fact, a number of you think that we're more than well reserved on that topic.
On the private label side, based on our current circumstances, we have significant reserves. And you have to remember,
private label exposure, there are very significant differences in the nature of the reps, the warranties, the quorum rules
than for the GSEs. So to give you some perspective on what we think that means, if you're in the range of the private
label repurchase exposure that have been recently published by a number of analysts on this call and you follow what
we've taken in mortgage related litigation reserves during the past year, you should feel pretty comfortable with where
we are going forward into 2011.
On the real estate portfolio side, $9.7 billion in reserves in real estate portfolios excluding PCI; basically we have more
than two years of coverage based on our annualized fourth quarter net charge-off rate. And through the year, we've also
added $3.2 billion to our purchase credit-impaired reserves. So based on those current conditions, we believe we're
really well reserved going into 2011.
Page 10 is just an update on the foreclosure process. I'll give you three key takeaways. First to remember, we really
continue to work very hard on avoiding foreclosures. It is not good for us or the borrower or the economy. And there
are a number of facts here, and I'd just highlight we prevented more than two times the number of foreclosed assets
during the course of the last 24 months. When we do foreclosures, obviously, those mortgages are very often
delinquent for many months at the time of foreclosure. The homes are often vacant. They're not owner-occupied. And
oftentimes, owners there don't qualify for modification.
Having said all that, as you know, we suspended our foreclosures in September and October. And since then, we've
really enhanced our process. We've retrained personnel. We've revised our processes and added additional quality
controls. And as a result of that, we have been resuming our foreclosure proceedings across the country.
Page 11, we'll turn to Card Services for the quarter; net income of $1.3 billion on revenues of $4.2 billion. This is really
the first quarter since the first quarter of 2009 that we're breakeven. We made $61 million on a pre-tax pre-loan loss
reserve income basis.
Credit costs are, again, the big story in this quarter. They're down significantly to $671 million. You see the two circled
numbers at the bottom of the page. Our charge-off rate was 7.08% for the Chase portfolios excluding WaMu. That's an
improvement of 100 basis points quarter on quarter. It's also lower than our prior guidance of 7.50% plus or minus, and
that's largely due to continued improvement on credit as well as the improvement in the economic environment.

Page 5 of 23
Thirty-day delinquencies declined to 3.66%. That's down almost 50 basis points quarter on quarter. And based on that
decline in delinquencies, we're taking a $2 billion pre-tax reduction on our loan loss reserves because of the lower
estimate for future losses.
Just a quick moment on outlook for charge-offs; Chase and WaMu, both those portfolios, we expect to see charge-offs
improve in the first quarter. And losses for the Chase portfolio we expect to see below 7% in Q1 '11.
$4.2 billion worth of revenue, quickly, that's flat quarter on quarter, down year on year. That's largely down on lower
outstandings. 100% impact this quarter in the run rate for the CARD Act, and that has been offset by positive sales
volume, excluding WaMu up 10% year over year, 8% quarter on quarter. And note here, we really believe we've
outpaced the industry growth, and as a function of that are really improving our market share as more people take their
Chase cards out of their wallets at the store.
On the balance side, we're reiterating the balance guidance I gave you in the third quarter. That's $120 billion plus or
minus by year end for the Chase portfolio.
Page 12, the Commercial Bank, just a quick moment on full-year comments for this business, not on the page. We had
record revenue of $6 billion for this business this year and record net income of $2.1 billion. On the page, you see
circled net income of $530 million. That's on record revenues for the quarter of $1.6 billion. That's largely better
spreads, higher Investment Banking fees, actually record Investment Banking fees for this quarter for this client set.
And that has been offset by lower average balances quarter on quarter, year over year.
Credit costs of $152 million; that reflects trend of continued charge-offs in our Commercial Real Estate segment. And
that has been offset by improving strength in our C&I portfolio; 60% of the net charge-offs in the quarter are real estate
related. And if you look down at the bottom of the page, one other credit statistic to highlight, NPLs are down
significantly to $2 billion, down almost $900 million quarter on quarter.
Last number circled here, loan balances of $98.9 billion. That's up modestly again in this quarter after last quarter's
improvement as well. We do continue to see some positive signs of activity in the middle market. Balances are up 11%
year on year, and some of that is driven by demand, some by new client growth for the year. We added 1,600 clients
approximately in the middle market, 400 new clients in the quarter. But a word of caution, utilization rates across the
Commercial Bank continue to remain flat through the last quarter of the year, in the low 30s.
Page 13, Treasury & Securities Services, you see circled net income of $257 million in the quarter. That's up year on
year slightly and quarter on quarter. Revenues of $1.9 billion, same story on revenues; we're continuing to see pressure
from a lower rate environment. And that has been offset by growth in our assets under custody. They ended year at
$16.1 trillion. That's up almost $1 trillion year over year; as well as we saw an increase in our trade loan balances as we
continue to build out our international footprint. Expenses in the quarter are up $79 million or 6%, and that's largely
reflecting the same theme of that ongoing investment primarily related to the international expansion.
Asset Management on page 14, again, a little full-year commentary; it was record revenues for the year of $9 billion.
That was based on record long-term flows of $69 billion. And that was really a function of very solid investment
performance across the complex. For the fourth quarter, you see circled net income of $507 million in the quarter.
That's up year on year, up quarter on quarter. And net income is actually at its highest level since the fourth quarter of
2007.
Asset Management had record revenues in the quarter, $2.6 billion. That's up almost 20% year on year and quarter on
quarter. That's based on strong net inflows into those products with higher margins. We did have outflows in liquidity
products of $25 billion in the quarter, but that was offset by $23 billion in long-term product inflows. That, by the way,
is the seventh consecutive positive quarter of long-term inflows in AM. We also had positive effects obviously from a
higher market as well as strong fourth quarter performance fees.
We also had a significant increase in our mortgage production business. We did $7.8 billion in mortgage production in
Asset Management this year, $3.4 billion in production in the fourth quarter. You see expense growth higher; that
reflects higher head count, performance-based comp, and some continuing investments in technology across the

platform.
One last comment on the head count side, we've added 500 people to our front office across the globe in Asset
Management, a little under 40% of that internationally during the course of the year.
On page 15, you see Corporate Private Equities, private equity gains of $178 million in net income. Remember, that's
going to vary quarter on quarter, realizations and market value for the portfolio, but it was a solid quarter for Private
Equity.
Corporate loss of $149 million in net income, that's really three factors at work. The first is NII is down quarter on
quarter. It's down year on year, and that has largely the repositioning of the portfolio that we've been talking about
through the course of the year. Second is we did have security gains as a function of that repositioning of $1.2 billion
pre-tax. But again, that's going to pressure NII going forward. And then the third is we took that $1.5 billion pre-tax
increase to litigation reserves predominantly related to mortgage matters in this quarter.
One quick note on guidance here is excluding Private Equity and excluding non-recurring items, we still believe that
net income for Corporate should be $300 million plus or minus on a go-forward basis each quarter.
Page 16, fortress balance sheet; I really covered the top of the page. The one comment that I would add is that given the
expected growth in our capital positions both through 2010 and forward, we remain hopeful that we're going to be able
to return capital to our shareholders both through an increase in the dividend as well as share repurchases when
appropriate. And we obviously wait on the results of the FCCP process to get back to you on that. We've addressed all
the guidance issues in each of the lines of business.
So with that, operator, why don't you open up for questions for Jamie and I? Thanks.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John McDonald>: Yes, hi. Good morning; Doug, a question on net interest income. The run rate looks like about
$12 billion this quarter, $48 billion annually. What are the puts and takes for 2011 when we think about the net interest
margin and NII at the top of the house?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: So NIM is down about 13 basis points quarter on quarter.
That has been a function of the repositioning we talked about, a little less positive effect from dollar roll financing. We
expect NIM to be flat to minus five basis points in the first quarter of this year.
The broader question on NII in general, you're going to have offsets between – what we've shared with you is runoff in
our portfolios in RFS and Card. And those are things that we've been – that's WaMu related in large part, and we
planned to do that. And that's offset by what we see as beginning trends in growth in our loan portfolio across
wholesale.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The corporate NIM will be down quite a bit, the dollar
amount, but we've given you the guidance in that.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And Card will be down $500 million or $600 million
as it runs off. And the home equity – the runoff from mortgage is about $700 million. Those will be disappearing next
year.
<Q - John McDonald>: Is it your hope that new growth will offset the runoff and you can have the balance sheet or
earning assets be flattish or even up this year?

<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We don't really know yet because it's hard to tell. But
Card, what we said is it will start to grow maybe late in the year because most of the runoff will be gone. But the
mortgage stuff will be running off for years.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay, and then a question on...
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We may or may not replace it, and corporate is
completely discretionary. We've decided to reduce the exposures in some of the portfolios there, reducing corporate net
interest income.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: John, the one other comment I'd make, as we run off these
portfolios, it's also going to be liberating capital for us.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Right.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: So that's the other thing to keep in mind.
<Q - John McDonald>: Right. Yes, you've been pretty clear about that. I guess on the put-backs, Doug, when you say
that you have a good shot at being done on the GSE side, does that mean that you'll likely use the reserve to absorb
future realized losses, or do you just mean that you probably won't do any more reserve building?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: I think early in the year, we'll be probably be charging and
expensing that stuff. But a lot of you have done your own numbers showing that we're probably fully reserved. So once
it's really determined that we're fully reserved, we'll probably be hitting that against the reserve.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay, and then just one quickie on the private label, the litigation reserve.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: What he means is we'll still probably give and take a
little bit. Obviously, there's a little bit to play out here.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay, that's fair. A quick question on the private label; are you able to add to the reserves for
private label even if the claims haven't come in yet based on your own estimates, or are you only going to add litigation
expense based on what you currently see as claims coming in?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's got nothing to do with claims coming in per se.
We can make our own judgments about how we're going to go about handling it. Most of the securities litigation – you
all, again, have done your own estimates in that, and those range from for us $3 billion to $10 billion or
$12 billion or something like that.
I think the way to look at it is we and maybe uniquely have put up litigation reserves for it. And we don't know what
the ultimate number can be. We can be higher or lower. We're not saying we're done, but it's going to be years before
this plays out. And this litigation is going to be fought almost securitization by securitization. There's almost no other
way to do it. Very high – you've got causality. The reps and warranties are low. You've got to do it loan by loan. This
could be a long, ugly mess. The important thing is it's not going to be life threatening to JPMorgan, and it will be years
before we know the ultimate outcome.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Thanks, good morning.

<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hi, good morning, a couple quickies and a couple of just strategic questions. So on the
mortgage originations, you obviously had a nice pickup Q-on-Q as the applications closed this past quarter. Could you
give us a sense of how far through that pipeline you're and what the outlook is for mortgage originations over the next
quarter or two?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Betsy, I did not check. They have to come down
because the originations have come down, and I just didn't look at the pipeline. I'd be surprised if there were $50 billion
of closed loans this quarter.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay, so you think you got through most of what the spike in apps you had?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I would think so, yes.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Usually it's like 60 days, and the last month was pretty
low.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay. On loan demand, I know it's hard to predict what's going to happen over the course of the
next year. But could you give us a sense as to how loans came in relative to expectations in 4Q, and was there any
incremental change throughout the quarter? One of the reasons I'm asking the question is because obviously you had
the long end of the curve move up. Does that incent people to get into C&I in any material way?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Are you referring to any particular segment here?
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Card and Commercial.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, so the Commercial Bank loans have been up.
Middle market, other loans, remember, we also bought a portfolio. But the middle market has been up every quarter the
last three or four quarters.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Sure.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Not because of utilization, just more loans, and we
think that's a very good thing. It could be a little bit of market share, but I anecdotally hear from other people that
there's loan growth there too. So our early indicators are that we will continue to see loan growth this year. And early
indicators are people requesting it and industrial production and inventory numbers and all the things that can drive
loan demand.
In Credit Card, yes, there's going to be a seasonal drop in the first quarter, and I've got the number. That's going to be
4% – 5%. Plus, for us you can add $3 billion in runoff, so the driver can be something like $10 billion in the first
quarter, so the runoff is a couple billion dollars a quarter after that. But underlying that, we're actually seeing some
growth now. So you might actually see net growth by the fourth quarter in Credit Card.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay. And then separately on regulation, rule writing is obviously in process. And I just wanted
to see how you're thinking about protecting your revenue and profit in the derivatives business.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The rules haven't all been finished yet, but we are
obviously preparing. We're going to be a great derivative house, okay, so if you want to go to us and go through a
clearing house, we will be prepared, and it's possible volumes will go up. We gave a number like a $1 billion loss of
potential revenue, but we don't really know. We've seen a lot of things that go to clearing houses and volumes go up.
Spreads can change a little bit, but it might be a net plus. So you can assume that we are building rapidly to make sure
we are the best out there in the new world.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: It's just because one of the questions on your business is that you're benefiting from a credit
spread, relative credit spread benefit because your rating is higher. So how do you protect for that in an environment

where you go to an exchange and the rating isn't worth as much?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's a very good point, which is one of the reasons
there are issues about exchanges where in effect you socialize the credit. You socialize both credits. You socialize the
credit of the company that might have been providing credit and the credit of the company getting credit. So that is why
we look – that piece will be a possible small negative. But we don't know how it's all going to sort out. We're not quite
sure what the margin rules will be for end-user exemptions, and we'll see. Remember, a lot of the end-user exemptions,
the reason they wanted to do business with JPMorgan is we would give them the benefit of their credit and they get the
benefit of our credit as opposed to an exchange, where neither happens.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay, all right. And then last on the Durbin piece, Durbin obviously came in, in the last quarter.
Does it change how you're thinking about your deposit pricing changes that are underway? Is there anywhere else you
think you can make it up?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me just make a statement about Durbin that part of
what happened in Durbin was this notion that retailers pay zero for cash and zero for checks and they were paying 70 or
80 basis points for debit card. But the fact is that cash costs retailers – and there have been a lot of studies done on this
– 30 to 70 basis points. They've got to process it, handle it, move it, insure it, bank it. They need registers, and there's a
lot of defalcation – what's that called? Checks cost also 70 basis points for all the same basic reasons. As a matter of
fact, the guaranteed check, which is the equivalent to a debit, like you get your money right away and it's guaranteed
and you're not taking the fraud or credit risk, is $1.20, 1.2%, if you want to go guarantee a check. So that was a false
premise.
The other false premise is that somehow in a fixed cost business, you can price to variable cost and survive. No
business in the world can price to variable cost and survive. And so this debit thing has enormous benefit for
consumers. Even for retailers, it was faster. And how this happened is completely beyond us. We have to figure it out.
You can't price your products at variable cost and survive as a business. So we're going to have to figure out a way, and
we want to do it that's consumer friendly and fair. But of course, the consumer has got to pay, and they weren't paying
for debit before.
So we don't exactly know. We're going to test a whole bunch of things. Remember, we might not just charge for
checking. You might charge for debit. You might just have higher deposit balances. And you're right, you might keep a
little bit more spread. So that's all going to sort out both in the competitive sense and a legal sense as we figure out how
to deal with it. Our biggest concern right now is to do it in a way that's as consumer friendly as possible. We also think
it will have the adverse consequences of making a portion of current bank clients unbanked. You will not be able to
profitably serve them. And, my current estimate it has to be about 5%, and I'm not sure that was a good public policy
issue either.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: 5% of your customer base?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the general banking customer base may be
pushed out of the banking system.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay, thank you.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You're welcome.

<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: First of all, just a comment; that outlook page that you used to do was actually pretty useful,
even though yes, you do go through of the different units, so I'd be a fan of putting it back in.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Okay.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: A question, first of all, on the litigation reserve; is it fair for to us assume that that $1.5
billion that went through Corporate is largely for private label mortgage, or is there some expectation of foreclosure
settlement in there?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's largely for private label mortgage and mortgage
related type of stuff. And foreclosure settlement, we don't have any more foreclosure settlement, but there was
hundreds of millions of dollars of higher cost that we either expensed or accrued for the delay in foreclosures because
of the affidavit issue.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: That's in the mortgage business.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: That's within RFS?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, correct.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. And separately, within the Investment Bank, there was about a $700 million or so
swing in the non-personnel expense from the third quarter to the fourth. Reading the press release, it sounds like maybe
a lot of that is litigation reserve building as well, or did I misinterpret that?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You read it right, and that number obviously will
normalize and go back to – the non-comp number will go back to a more normalized $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion
quarter.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, and should we assume that a fair amount of that is for mortgage stuff as well?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, the whole budget stuff, the detritus of the storm.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. And also speaking of swings in the Investment Bank, there was about an $800 million
swing in credit portfolio revenue versus the third quarter. That probably doesn't have any provision impacts, right,
because it's just a revenue number. So I was just wondering if you could help us understand that swing.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So remember, the credit portfolio is a hard one. On a
normalized basis, it should earn about $200 million or $300 million a quarter, and think of it as NII. But in addition to
that, there's hedging and hedges and up or down, so it swings all over the place. We try to manage that economically,
not for steady GAAP revenues.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's fair. The fixed income VAR had a notable decline in the quarter. And again, that
really continued a trend, so it's down quite a bit for the year. Is that just a decline in volatility of some instruments? Is it
that you've actually reduced risk? And is that reduction mostly in rates or credit or where?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You're right. Most of that – I think the largest part of
that is just dropping, more volatile quarters from last year.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: That's right.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So that number is coming down for no reason other
than you're changing the data set that goes in the calculation, which is one of the reasons I personally never paid that
much attention to it because it changes without any good reason. There was no conscious effort to take down risk, et
cetera. That's done by desk, and I don't think there was any particular area where it was dramatically different than
others. There are a couple that are coming down, but it's usually the traders making decisions on that particular book.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, and the final question I have for you is just looking at the AOCI. It had a negative $2
billion swing in the quarter. I wouldn't make a big deal out of it, I guess, because it's still more than it was a year ago.
But is that mostly due to what happened in the treasury market in the quarter?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, and we also realized $1 billion of gains.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Right.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: If you realize gains, it reduces AOCI because that
would have been there. Remember, we did that early, and we're doing that to protect – not just to protect AOCI, but if
you look at our interest rate exposure where causally, if long rates go up, it will help us; and if short rates go up, it will
help us a teeny bit. So we positioned the company for raising rates and I think we did it a little bit early, saving...
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: You were talking about it a year ago or more.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Right.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hey there. So I think we all are now in agreement that you're pretty well reserved on the agency
side. I'm curious. It might be a moot point, but I'm curious. Is the waiting on the WaMu decision in the way of a
potential settlement and just putting it behind you on Fannie and Freddie?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, we had settled most the GSE stuff. The GSE
put-back rep and warranty issue had already been settled regarding WaMu. That had been done sometime a year ago or
something.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, then I'll rephrase. Is it of any interest to proceed the settlement route or a moot point given
your reserve position?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's a moot point. But if they wanted to settle all at
once, it would be fine with us.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Got you.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's getting more and more developed. The loss curves
are getting more developed. They know their own numbers. We know their numbers. Look, both Fannie and Freddie
are working with us. They're giving us files. We look at the files, return them back. We're just trying to get it all behind.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: And we should hear any day based on who is on the hook for WaMu?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: So the bankruptcy settlement...
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Who is on the hook for WaMu for what?
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: On the private label potential liability going forward.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We think they are.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: So do I, but we're waiting on a judge, right?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's a different issue. There's a whole bunch of stuff
going on with WaMu to settle and finalize all this stuff. Then there's the private label. WaMu is about a third the
private label. We think that they're responsible for that piece. Again, the analysts, you all have done estimates on this.

And between our reserves and even some of your estimates, I guess it's going to take a long time to resolve. And so my
opinion is it's going to be resolved. It may be more. It may be less, but it's not going to be terrible for us, whether or not
WaMu takes their one-third.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I agree. Jamie, I wanted to ask you this.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We want to put it behind us, but the big piece is now
it's going to go on for years. I don't think this stuff will be – we'll be talking about this every quarter for the next three
years.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I hope we have better things to talk about, but I hear you.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I hope that people get more and more comfortable that
while we're talking about it, it isn't going to be something that's going to change the future of JPMorgan. It's just going
to be a few adjustments and a few quarters up or down when this is all resolved.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good. The second question is related to the stress tests and the capital plan that you just put
forward. I'm curious on the stress test that both you just performed and the one that's being performed now versus the
last stress test, if you can articulate what the major differences might be. In other words, last time, I think they took a
very harsh look on trading. It didn't pan out that way. How do you see the adjustments this stress test versus last?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I would say it's similar, and higher unemployment and
home prices going down. And we do this ourselves anyway, by the way, and stress testing, market results, and stuff like
that, but a lot more detail, a tremendous amount more detail. In any event, even under highly stressed environments,
JPMorgan has been retaining an awful lot of capital. We are looking for ways to use that capital.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I think your comments were over the next three years of $40 billion to $50 billion versus $30
billion in the highly, highly stressed.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, and whether they come up with similar numbers
or not, I don't know. But the fact is we're going to have plenty of capital. And we also think that 7% Basel III is plenty
of capital. In fact, I think the stress test will confirm that, not just on us, but all the banks. That's what capital is for, to
deal with stress. And for the most part, I think banks will be able to deal with a lot of stress at 7% Basel III. We're
starting to add capital on top of capital at this point.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I hear you. All right, thanks.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I remind you that 7% Basel III is more akin to 11%
Basel I. The first stress test on Basel I was 4%.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: By the way, before I let you go, do you feel like you're making progress with Washington on that
front specifically? Because I feel like initially other companies might have said it's 7% and there might be a buffer on
top and you add a little bit on the edge on this one, and I think a lot of people agree with you; but just curious if you
made some progress.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Look, no. I think the regulators will look at the issues,
and this is a world, global issue because a lot of regulators overseas think it should be a lot more. Some think it's
sufficient. I hope America takes a rational position and a leadership position. That's what I hope. We don't have to do
what everyone overseas thinks should be done. We need to take a leadership position in the United States that we think
is appropriate. And personally, I think 7% is plenty. I think you could make many arguments why some of the big
companies were stabilizers in this storm as opposed to systemic risks in the storm.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: All right, thank you both.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Good morning.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: What are you doing to manage your exposures in Europe in light of what's taking place there? And
what impact did Europe have on your current quarter results? I see that EMEA revenues were down 7% in the
Investment Bank linked quarter. But just more generally, what's the impact and what are you doing to protect yourself
or maybe to potentially capitalize?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, so we disclosed at one point that our net
exposures were $20 billion in the gypsy countries. That number is down substantially now. But the important part is
that we also continue to do business there with sovereigns, with corporates, with governments, with institutions because
we have a lot of clients. And so we're letting the client side do that. And obviously, those exposures could come back
and haunt us at one point, but we're not going to stop doing business in those countries. The business is just down a
little bit. I don't think there's any mystery to it. And are there opportunities to get from it? Yes, I think the opportunities
come from continuing to service our clients, not running. That's the real opportunity; that people know you're there for
the client in good times and bad times.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And what about acquisitions? What's your general appetite and what would be your appetite in
Europe if there was a Bear Stearns or a WaMu type situation there?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I wouldn't count on something like that. We believe
the highest use that we can ever do is organic growth. And if something came up that really made a tremendous amount
of sense, then our obligation is to go look about it and think about it, but I'm not sure that will happen.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: You seem sanguine about Europe or you don't seem too alarmed by what's taking place there.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Are you talking about for us or for the system?
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Talk about both then. It seems like what could happen to the system will impact you, right?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We are going to continue to do business in all those
countries. We have clients in all those countries that rely on us. We want to be there for them. We're not a fair weather
friend. Could we lose money from that? Absolutely, we could be making a mistake, but that will be okay. Okay, a bank
is supposed – we're supposed to be there for them in good times and bad times.
I personally think that Europe will muddle through this situation. They have demonstrated, and I think the regulators
and the leaders have demonstrated that they are going to fix this. It's a little bit of fits and stop-and-starts. Obviously,
there are some disagreements, but you've seen a lot of very strong statements that they're going to get through this, and
I would bet on that. I think that's the likely outcome. And we're not betting the company, but I do think that's the likely
outcome. I do think over time, they've got some serious structure issues that they have to fix.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then lastly, what was the impact of Europe on TSS this quarter, and can you just elaborate on
why TSS had such good linked-quarter growth?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't think Europe had any effect on TSS at all. I
know we did much better in trade finance.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: We did better in trade finance. Linked quarter, we get a little
bit of an impact from the ADR business, which is up quarter on quarter, and a little better impact from assets under
custody, but I'm not sure. We can get back to you on the specifics for Europe. But in general, that's the
quarter-over-quarter change.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. I guess, as you've mentioned, Jamie, the litigation on the private label is years
away. And you pretty much – you had that $1.5 billion was plus or minus the level that you had in every quarter this
year. Is that something that we should be looking forward to in 2011, or do you feel good about where that is right
now?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I feel pretty good about where it is right now.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: That's good.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We've got to react to circumstances. But more likely
than not, you'll see nothing next year for that category.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Got it.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We like to keep our balance sheet clean and just move
on, and so we've moved on.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great. And secondly, you probably are going to be the only one that can truly say that they're
at the 2019 capital levels.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I just want to make a comment about litigation
because I did mention before about the detritus of the storm. I think it's also reasonable that after we've had a storm like
this that the litigation follows years later, so I'm not saying there won't be other litigation.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Right.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: My experience has been that things will – and you've
seen tons of it. Some of it is completely frivolous, but some may not be. I can't say that there won't be any litigation
expenses next year of size.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: But not at the $1.5 billion quarterly level?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I hope not.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Yes. Secondly, you're, saying that you're at the 2019 Basel requirements already and you've
still got runoff portfolios there. And yet you talked about pulling down some discretionary parts of your balance sheet.
What could cause you, particularly now with a somewhat steeper yield curve, to start rebuilding that? How should we
think about that in 2011?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I guess we're going to have normal business growth in
2011, which will use some the balance sheet. And we're still waiting for final guidance from the regulators on what the
capital requirements are going to be, et cetera. Listen, we can build the balance sheet much quicker if and when we feel
it's appropriate.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Right.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: But I will add, Moshe, there are some things. There
are components of our balance sheet that we plan on running off that were part and parcel of some of the mitigating
actions as the impact of Basel III takes place. So there are going to be some assets that we will change over time
because they're very high utilizers of RWA on a Basel III basis. And those will come off balance sheet regardless of
whether we're building other components of the balance sheet.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Right, I wasn't referring to those. I was referring more to WaMu runoff portfolios and other
pieces of your mortgage business that are still in the rundown mode.

<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We can always make a portfolio decision to put assets
on the balance sheet to create more NII. That's why I always talk about excess capital as earnings in store. You can use
it whenever you want, just use it wisely and use it at the right time. We don't want to do that and have huge unrealized
losses.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Right.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We're actually trying to protect ourselves from that.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: As a follow-up to that, obviously, a few things have to happen even after the Fed makes
pronouncements on dividends with respect to stock buyback. Could you just talk about your thoughts as to the
regulators and stock buyback at this stage?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: They have said that when they finish all this work,
which will be on...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Late March, March 21.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: ...late March that they will be giving companies
guidance on capital, so that capital to me is dividends and stock buyback. At that point in time, if we have a little more
guidance on the ultimate outcome of what the capital needs to be, like it's going to be more than 7%, our board will
take the appropriate action. I'm hopeful to be able to do the dividend right away.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Jason Goldberg>: Thank you. In the Investment Bank, it looks like non-performing assets were up a little over
$1 billion linked quarter, any in terms of color in terms of what's driving that?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's just too large an asset to move to non-performing.
And remember, non-performing has specific reserves against it, so we're not worried about that at all.
<Q - Jason Goldberg>: And then I guess secondly, and I know it has been talked about on the call, but in the last
several years we've seen a drop-off in trading in the fourth quarter and then a nice rebound into the first quarter.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, we noticed that.
<Q - Jason Goldberg>: Obviously we're only two weeks into the first quarter of this year. But can you just give us any
sense of in terms of how you're thinking about the thick line, near term, just given the volatility in those types of
earnings?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Do you mean how trading is doing so far this month?
Is that what you're saying?
<Q - Jason Goldberg>: That and just your near-term expectations.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't know. You guys can guess as much as we can.
So far, the year started off pretty good. And look, your can have a very good year in trading and Investment Banking
this year. But your guess is as good as my guess, so use your own.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul Miller>: Thank you very much. Hey, Jamie, on the dividend, a lot of people expect you – you've been
talking about raising your dividend. But how aggressive do you think you can be? I know the Fed is talking about a
30% payout ratio. Do you think you can get to that quickly, or will that take a couple quarters?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Why don't we just wait and get the guidance from the
Fed about what it's going to be? What we have spoken about is that we would like to get eventually back to 35% of
normalized earnings. If the Fed gives guidance that they want it to be at 30% of normalized earnings, then we have to
limit it to 30% of normalized earnings. They are our regulators. Remember, me, I don't care if we pay dividends at all
so we can use it for some other purpose down the road.
<Q - Paul Miller>: And then the other issue is that there's a lot of discussion and there are a couple articles out there
about dropping servicing fees to zero and restructure the mortgage industry along with it. What is your thoughts on
that, if you have any?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Again, I would defer that. The Treasury is putting out
some guidance on the GSEs. If you change servicing, that changes how you price mortgages and how you account for
mortgages, so it's not going to change the mortgage business per se. You're still going to originate and service
mortgages. It will just change the asset on the balance sheet and accounting. So I'm not worried about it. I would just
prefer to wait to see all the guidance that comes out from the government and how it all sorts out.
<Q - Paul Miller>: Wouldn't that help you guys out, though, on your Basel capital rules? Because if something like
that went down the road that MSR would be a lot lower than it is today?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, but it's still under the...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: It doesn't have a big impact on our Basel III capital.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Because it counts up to 10 or...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: 10% and 15% in total for a number of items, and we're not
very far off that.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Basically, we would probably restrict MSR to 10% of
the balance sheet if that were the case unless it was really, really profitable, in which case we'll take the capital charge
and put it back on.
<Q - Paul Miller>: Okay, and then just one other tidbit question on the HELOCs. On the $600 million acceleration,
was that all – was that more referring to WaMu, or was that across the board?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That was across the board.
<Q - Paul Miller>: Across the board, okay. Thank you very much, gentlemen.

<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: If I could just look at expenses at the top of the company, if I back out the $1.5 billion
litigation in Corporate and then several hundred million of mortgage, foreclosure, all that stuff in RFS, and I think
several hundred million also in the Investment Bank, you basically get a run rate of expenses in the $55 billion range.
How are you thinking about that level going forward outside of the Investment Bank? I'm asking because you've been
investing heavily in a lot of your businesses. And I was trying to get a sense of how much more investment spend is
needed and how that might track going forward.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't think it's investment spend. I think the way you
should look at these expenses will grow with our businesses over time. It's not like we have massive additional
expenses that we have in addition to that. There are a lot of expenses which will eventually go away. You mentioned
there was a little over 300 million from the affidavit in this quarter. There's 300 million of foreclosure expense.
Obviously, a lot of the mortgage charge-offs will reduce dramatically over time – that's not through expense. And there
was obviously the litigation stuff which hopefully won't be reoccurring. I look at it by business. It's very hard for me to
look at the aggregate.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay, and then just separately, you went into some detail on the balance sheet
repositioning of the securities book. I guess one thing that's interesting is if I look at the size of your securities portfolio
and guess at where the yield is going to be, it's a fairly low yield. And if I compare it to your long-term debt, you're not
really making any money on it. And I know that's not a perfect way of looking at it, but it's probably the only bank I
cover that would scream like that. I guess the question is, are all these securities that you have on the balance sheet, are
they needed for liquidity? Or over time, can we start seeing more efficiency to the balance sheet, which it might be
smaller but higher NIM and free up some capital?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So some of that was moved to what I would call
spread product, which has the exact effect of what you're saying, but it protects you in a rising rate environment, which
we thought was a wise thing to do. That portfolio is used to both reinvest excess deposits and to balance all the
asset/liability management in the company. And right now, we're asset sensitive, and we just think that's the right place
to be. Can we change it, reduce the size of that portfolio? Absolutely, those are big portfolio decisions, which we try to
make at the appropriate time. You really can't look at it relating to the long-term debt. I think long-term debt is – a lot
of it is swapped and a lot of assets are also swapped.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: I guess I'm looking at the debt, and you're growing a lot of your core funding quite nicely.
The balance sheet is not growing all that much, and there are still pretty big chunks of long-term debt that over time I
would assume run off. And I don't know what the plans are on reissuance there would be.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We have almost $20 billion to $30 billion of
maturities each year.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, we'll be in that zip code of plus or minus $30 billion.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Right now, we're playing for good organic growth.
We don't know the capital rules. It is possible when that comes out, we won't issue all that debt. It is possible that we'll
do other things with the balance sheet and figure out how to – but all of it was done to protect the company and to make
good money for the shareholder.

any momentum in DC to mitigate that risk going forward.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, I'm not going to give you a specific legal. I'm just
going to say that every state is different. And the facts, the way we see things, are different. And we said right from the
beginning that you're going to see a lot of state differences, local differences, court differences, and we've built that into
our thinking.
<Q - Matthew Burnell>: But you don't think that there's a push in DC to have a more broad or a more comprehensive
way of thinking about that going forward?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: There might be, but I hope if – but it's going to be the
same kind of thing as how did you finish and properly process foreclosures. And I don't think this one thing changes
the mess. It's a big mess. It has cost us a lot of money. I personally think we're all along the way or more through this
whole thing. And unfortunately, the only way to do it right is name by name by name. There is almost no other way to
do it properly. Person by person, home by home, are they occupied? Did they lie on their forms? Are they entitled to a
HAMP? Are they entitled to a modification? We do as many as we can.
There's a lot of paperwork. The paperwork is different in every single state. There are mistakes made. And I remind
people that the affidavit process is not the foreclosure process. There are multiple checks and balances. And there may
be mistakes made in the foreclosure process, but they're very few. And boy, we find them and we try to make up for
them right away. And obviously, this issue has been heavily politicized. And in some cases, mistakes were made and
they're being pointed out and they should be fixed.
<Q - Matthew Burnell>: Okay, thanks, and then a quick administrative question. I notice that U.S. non-interest
bearing deposits were up about 10% quarter over quarter. Is that largely corporate deposits coming in, or is that also
consumers?

bearing deposits up about 10% from September 30th at 242 billion.

And then I know you said you wanted to test a lot of things related to Durbin. Is there any – in your mind just right
now, and I know there's a lot to learn, but is there any real way to make up much of that lost Durbin revenue, or do you
expect that most of that will just be lost? Thanks.

<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Right, and the full run rate effect of that is already in
the numbers.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: And we told you that's $700 million in net income, and that
was full run rate in 3Q and now 4Q.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Right. And then on the Durbin, you can't run your
business where you're charging things at variable cost. In some ways, you're going to have to look at ways of repricing
the business, and that may not come from the price you see. It may just come from higher – you have to keep higher
deposits on balance to have reduced fees. It may come from checking account fees. You've already seen a lot of people
around the country eliminate free checking. But I think ultimately, most of it will get repriced into the business. It's
very hard to run a business where you can't charge for your products.
<Q - Edward Najarian>: So you do think that you've got a good shot of getting a good chunk of that revenue back
through your pricing strategy?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, and we're very conscious of doing it right, like
design the right products for the right people. I think I said before, it may drive some clients out of the business into the
non-banks because there may be no way to reprice those clients because you can't collect the fees because the accounts
are too small. And remember, for a whole bunch of clients, it may not matter that much at all. They already have high
balances; they're already quite profitable. So we'll have to figure it out. We're doing a lot of thinking and a lot of
testing. Remember, it's effective...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: July.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: ...July, so we still have a little time to figure it all out.
<Q - Edward Najarian>: Okay, and then in terms of overdrafts, should we think about 3Q and 4Q as the trough and
maybe a reasonable growth rate off of the 4Q number as you get more impact from customers opting in?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, I would think of it more as just the run rate going
forward
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Run rate is normal. Customers are going to get careful
how they do things. We're not looking for it as a growth item, but just another item in the income statement.
<Q - Edward Najarian>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: I just want to go back on that. Our first two quarters next year

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Yes, just if we could go back to the trading environment a bit. This is the third quarter in a row
of sluggish trading revenues industry-wide, and I wondered. Do you think – is it just the lingering impact of concern
about Europe and so on, or is there something structurally different in the world? That is things like less
mortgage-backed, less non-agency mortgage securities out there, so less trading opportunity there, and less CDS writers
and therefore, less opportunity there, is it something structural or it is the overhang of euro concerns?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't think it's structural, and I don't think it's an
overhang of euro concerns either. I think it's the ebbs and flows of trading. Rate was very strong earlier in the year and
I know came down a little bit. The last couple weeks in December are almost always low. Credit has been very strong
all year and I think it was a little slower this quarter. It's just going to – trading changes. That's the way it is. I don't
think it's either structural or Europe.

<Q - Richard Bove>: Hi, I apologize for my voice. On page 20 of the handout, you show a pretty sizable decline in
market share and rank in each one of quite a number of your Investment Banking positions. I'm just wondering what
happened there.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the first answer is that I think we had – I'm not
going to call it artificial, but we had a bump up in '09, which I think we've told our shareholders we expected to come
down a little bit in 2010 because the competition has come back full force, which I think is a good thing, Dick. We
knew it was going to happen, but it happened. So I think that's part of it. Over time, we gained share. And then in some
other areas, equity, a lot more done in China, A-shares, which we can't do, though we just got a license to do it. M&A,
a couple of deals we had didn't happen. We're comfortable with our franchise. We think we have a fabulous Investment
Banking franchise, and we will defend it.
<Q - Richard Bove>: The other question is on the balance sheet. If you take a look at Citigroup or Bank of America's
cash position and their net Fed funds position, they seem to be overloaded with cash. Whereas on your balance sheet, if
I net out the Fed funds position against your cash position, you don't seem to have as a goal driving up the liquidity on
the balance sheet, so I'm wondering. What is the difference in philosophy between the two companies of the two groups
of companies?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: First of all, we feel like we have a lot of liquidity. I
know everyone is showing their liquidity ratios, these new liquidity numbers, but I'm not sure they're all equally done,
nor are all businesses the same. So if you had a big retail business, you may not feel the need for that. If you're in a big
wholesale funded business, you might feel the need for a lot more of that. So we feel fine where we are. If we wanted
to drive the number up, we can easily do that at no cost to the company, but I'm not sure why that would help us.
The other thing I look at, which is important, is if you look at our balance sheet, there's a $300 billion portfolio, mostly
very high quality stuff. There's a lot of short-term assets in repo. And we have, what is it, $1 trillion of deposits and
$700 billion of loans. We look at that as a very stable funding source. That's true in almost every single business that
deposits are in excess of loans. That's even true in middle market.
<Q - Richard Bove>: I hope you convince these people in the regulatory area that the industry now does have an
excessive amount of capital relative to any time in its history, and it's just a ridiculous position. But thank you very
much.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I just saw your report that came out. And between
capital and these LCR ratios, the LCR hasn't all been issued. It isn't finished all either, but there are some serious issues
about how they look at certain types of deposits and certain types of revolvers.

trading has been soft the last couple of quarters. But if we compare your fixed income trading revenues the last couple
of quarters to pre-2009, they've been really, really good. How do you think about more of a secular outlook as far as
fixed income trading, where it was for JPMorgan, and where it's going for JPMorgan?

world-class trading business. And I think you can go back several years ago. That wasn't completely true. We had
extremely volatile results. We weren't strong in a lot of areas. Now we're strong in a lot of different areas. We've

always had some historical strengths. We're still building the commodities side, which we're going to continue to build.
If you look at shares, if you look at Greenwich reports and other people who report shares, our shares have gone up
dramatically in trading. I'm talking about over years now. I'm not talking about over quarters.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: The last thing I'd remind everybody too is in '09, which was
record revenues, that's in part because spreads blew out quite significantly. And so we're looking at aggregate numbers
here where volumes are up, spreads have normalized, and revenues on a historical basis are pretty solid.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Does that answer your question?
<Q - Jeff Harte>: Yes. And then secondly, you mentioned the selling of non-performing loans. Is maybe an
acceleration of that activity or more sales more a function of finding better bids or deciding to sell at lower prices?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Again, we are purely economic, so we're not going to
sell something just to sell it. Sometimes you think it's worth X. The buyer think it's worth a little bit more than X.
Sometimes they're better able to handle it. They're more local. They're more capable, et cetera. So I wouldn't read
anything into that other than it's the normal pruning of what we do and how we look at our exposures, and I don't think
it had any material effect on the numbers this quarter.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: No. In fact, it was net positive.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Right, but not materially.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: But not material.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Right.
<Q - Jeff Harte>: Okay, I think as much from an environmental standpoint if there's risk appetite, there are more
aggressive bids out there.
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, I think there's a little bit more risk appetite. As
the year progressed, there was more risk appetite for people to take on things like that.

Your final question comes from the line of Carole Berger with Soleil.
<Q - Carole Berger>: Yes, just one technical because Glenn asked my questions, of course, but why the change in the

<Q - Carole Berger>: Okay. Jamie, would you like to give us a preview or a plug for your Analyst Day in February?
<A - James Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, our folks are working hard. If you have questions
and stuff you want answered, just send them into Lauren. But you're going to hear from every business, and we're going
to talk about the future, the growth opportunities, obviously balance sheet, returns, targets. We're going to try to cover
the whole shebang for you.
We feel great about the company. If you look at the underlying results here, we're growing. We've got a lot of
businesses. They're all doing quite well. They've done well through this crisis. We never stopped making money. We
never stopped investing. We never stopped marketing. We never stopped helping clients around the world. So this

some truth to that. But also during the course, some of these things will be resolved and we'll go on. They may have a
negative effect, positive effect. There are always unintended consequences, but there's a chance some of those will be
positive, too.
<Q - Carole Berger>: Thank you.
