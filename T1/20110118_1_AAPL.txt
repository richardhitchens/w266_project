Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the outstanding results of our December
quarter. The performance of our business was extremely strong, as we sold more Macs, iPhones, and iPads than in any
previous quarter in Apple's history. And as a result, we're thrilled to announce all-time record quarterly revenue and
earnings.
The quarter concluded with $26.7 billion, an increase of more than $11 billion over the prior December quarter's
results, representing growth of 71%. The robust revenue growth was fueled by record iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales.
Operating margin was over $7.8 billion, representing 29.3% of revenue. Net income was $6 billion, which exceeded
our previous quarterly earnings record set in the September quarter by $1.7 billion and represented 78% growth over
the year-ago quarter's earnings. These results translate into earnings per share of $6.43.
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new
quarterly record with sales of 4.13 million Macs, representing 23% growth over the year-ago quarter. That's almost
eight times IDC's most recently published estimate of 3% growth for the PC market.
We experienced strong sales growth in each of our geographic segments, with over 50% growth in both the
Asia-Pacific region and Japan. The growth was fueled primarily by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, which
was launched in October, as well as continued strong sales of MacBook Pro. Customers love the new thin and light
unibody design of the MacBook Air, and the impressive responsiveness and reliability of its solid-state storage, while
MacBook Pro continues to provide customers tremendous speed and high performance graphics at an excellent value.
We ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.
We opened the Mac App Store on January 6th, bringing what we've learned from iOS apps to Mac users to make
discovering, installing, and updating apps easier than ever. The Mac App Store is available in 90 countries and features
more than 1,000 free and paid apps in categories like education, games, graphics and design, lifestyle, productivity, and
utilities. We've been very pleased with customer response, with over 1 million downloads on the first day alone.
Moving to our music products, we sold 19.4 million iPods, compared to 21 million in the year-ago quarter. We
experienced continued strong sales of iPod touch, which grew 27% year-over-year and accounted for over 50% of all
iPods sold during the quarter. IPod share in the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest
monthly data published by NPD. And iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based
on the latest data published by GfK. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel
inventory.
The iTunes Store generated another strong quarter, with revenue exceeding $1.1 billion thanks to strong sales of music,
video, and apps. We were extremely pleased to bring the legendary music of the Beatles to iTunes during the quarter
and to introduce movies to the iTunes store in Japan. And as we announced a few weeks ago, iTunes users are now
renting and purchasing over 400,000 TV episodes and over 150,000 movies per day.
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to have sold 16.2 million iPhones, compared to 8.7 million in the
previous December quarter. This represents 86% year-over-year growth, compared to IDC's latest published estimate of
70% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the December quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone
handset and accessory sales was $10.47 billion during the quarter, compared to $5.58 billion in the year-ago quarter, an
increase of 88%. The sales value of iPhones alone was over $10.1 billion, which yields an ASP of about $625.
At the end of the December quarter, we had iPhone distribution through 185 carriers in 90 countries. We continue to
experience very strong year-over-year growth in all of our segments, with sales in the Asia-Pacific region and Japan
both more than doubling year-over-year.
Enterprise customers continue to embrace iPhone, with 88 of the Fortune 100 companies and almost 60% of the
Financial Times Europe 100 companies now testing or deploying iPhone. Strong employee demand and custom app
development are fueling deployments within the corporate sector.
Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone to their approved device lists worldwide. Most recently, Fortune 500s like
Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels Midland, DuPont, Staples, Starbucks, and Genworth Financial and Global 500 accounts,

such as Nissan Motor, BBVA, Standard Chartered Group, and Denon have made iPhones available to their employees.
We ended the quarter with about 3.5 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 250,000. We
continued to have a sizable backlog, and believe we could have sold even more iPhones if we had been able to supply
them. And we're thrilled to begin working with Verizon next month to offer iPhone 4 to its more than 93 million
customers, as well as to new customers who want iPhone 4 on Verizon.
Turning to iPad, we continue to be thrilled with its momentum and customer interest. We sold 7.3 million iPads, a
sequential increase of over 3 million, with distribution in 46 countries by the end of the December quarter. We
continued to see great enthusiasm for iPad from consumer, business, and education customers.
Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment remains strong, and the response to the product continues to
be significant. Enterprise CIOs are adding iPads to their approved device list at an amazing rate. Today, over 80% of
the Fortune 100 are already deploying or piloting iPads, up from 65% in the September quarter. Some recent examples
include JPMorgan Chase, Cardinal Health, Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels Midland, Sears Holding, and DuPont.
Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $4.61 billion. The sales volume of
iPads alone was over 4.4 billion, which yields an ASP of about $600. We increased the supply of iPads during the
quarter and expanded both the number of countries, and the number of channel partners carrying iPads. Channel
inventory increased by about 525,000 units from the beginning to the end of the quarter to support increased sales and
channel expansion. And we ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks.
Combining iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, we reached over 160 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of
the December quarter. In November, we launched iOS 4.2, which brings over 100 new features to iPad users, including
multitasking, folders, Unified Inbox, Game Center, AirPlay, and AirPrint.
The App Store continues to be incredibly successful, with over 300,000 apps available and well over 9 billion
downloads to-date. We continue to be very pleased with iAd, which combines the narrative quality of TV ads with the
interactivity of digital to provide a new kind of advertising experience. During the quarter, we expanded iAd beyond
the U.S. to Europe and Japan, and provided iAd Producer to marketers.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which had a record-breaking quarter. Retail revenue almost doubled
year-over-year to $3.85 billion, compared to $1.97 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 95%. IPad sales in our
stores were very strong in the first holiday quarter. The stores also delivered a record Mac quarter, selling 851,000
Macs, compared to 689,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 24%. And about half the Macs sold in our
stores during the December quarter were to customers who have never owned a Mac before. International retail store
sales were particularly strong, with our average international store volume exceeding our very productive average U.S.
store volume. Additionally, our four stores in China were on average our highest traffic and our highest revenue stores
in the world.
We opened six stores during the December quarter, bringing us to a total of 323 stores worldwide as of quarter-end,
with 87 of them outside the United States. With an average of 321 stores open during the December quarter, average
revenue per store was $12 million, compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 69%. Retail
segment margin exceeded $1 billion for the first time, and more than doubled from $481 million in the year-ago
quarter.
We hosted a record 75.7 million visitors in our stores during the quarter, compared to 50.9 million visitors in the
year-ago quarter, an increase of 49%.
Total company gross margin was 38.5%, which was about 250 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this
difference was due to better commodity costs than we had planned. The remainder of the difference was due to the
leverage on the higher revenue and lower other product costs, including freight, warranty, and phone support.
Operating expenses were $2.47 billion, and included $247 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was
$136 million, ahead of our guidance, primarily due to the positive impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on net
assets.

The tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, below our guidance of 25.5% due to the one-time benefit of the retroactive
extension of the R&D tax credit from January 1, 2010. We expect our tax rate for the remaining quarters of fiscal '11 to
be about 25.5%.
Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities, totaled $59.7 billion at the end of the
December quarter, compared to $51 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of $8.7 billion. Cash flow
from operations was $9.8 billion, an increase of 69% year-over-year.
During the September and December quarters, we executed long-term supply agreements with three vendors, through
which we expect to spend a total of approximately $3.9 billion in inventory component prepayments and capital
expenditures over a two-year period. We made approximately $650 million in payments under these agreements in the
December quarter and anticipate making $1.05 billion in payments in the March quarter.
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking
information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $22 billion, compared to
$13.5 billion in the March quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38.5%, reflecting approximately $50
million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.35 billion, including about $250
million related to stock-based composition. We expect OI&E to be about $50 million. And we expect the tax rate to be
about 25.5%. We are targeting EPS of $4.90.
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record-breaking results and customer response to our products. We look
forward to expanding the reach of the iPhone in the United States with the addition of Verizon, and we remain very
confident in our strategy and new product pipeline.
And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton, Director, Investor Relations
Thank you, Peter. Also joining us for Q&A are Apple's COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler. And we ask that
you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. And Katy, your line is
open. You may want to check your mute button.
<A - Nancy Paxton, Director, Investor Relations>: Could we go on to the next question and circle back?
Operator
And your next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Thank you very much. I had a question for you with regard to availability of iPhones,
especially with the Verizon launch. I think you had mentioned that there was a backlog that you weren't able to meet in
the December quarter. So, I don't know, Tim and Peter, if you could talk a little bit about what you're doing to ensure
that you have sufficient quantities of iPhones and any changes you've made to ensure more component availability.
<A - Tim Cook>: Yes. Hi, Shannon, it's Tim. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we made a very bold bet taking
iPhone capacity for the September quarter with the new iPhone 4 in the lineup to 14 million. And as you may
remember, we sold over 14 million that quarter in total iPhone, so it was a fantastic quarter. And that was up from a

previous number that was in the eight-ish range. We were able to step that up in this past quarter to over 16 million, as
Peter said in his opening remarks, and so we were able to increase over 2 million. And we obviously have continued to
work on increasing this further. But as with all good things, it takes some time to do that.
Relative to Verizon, we are thrilled to offer the iPhone 4 to Verizon's 93 million customers, as well as any new
customers who want an iPhone 4 on Verizon. And we're going do everything possible to get the iPhones into as many
hands of those customers as possible.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Okay, great. And then I just had one follow-up. With regard to the Mac App Store, which has
clearly just started, so I'm not sure how much you'll talk about it, but we've noticed your bestselling apps tend to be
Apple software based, Apple software apps. So, how should we think about the Mac App Store, any initial thoughts
you have on it and initial things you've seen? Thank you.
<A - Tim Cook>: It's just getting going, but we are thrilled to have reported over 1 million in a very short amount of
time, and so we're very happy with the start of it.
<A - Nancy Paxton, Director, Investor Relations>: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
And next we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, first question for Tim. How comfortable are you right now
with the availability of iPhones and iPads? And if you still see shortages, how quickly do you think they can be
addressed early this year?
<A - Tim Cook>: Katy, let me take each one of those separately. On iPad, we increased dramatically last quarter. We
sold 7.3 million. The previous quarter we were in the low fours, as you know. That did get us into supply/demand
balance and also, allowed us to expand to 46 countries or to a total of 46 by the end of the quarter, which added 20
during the quarter. And we're confident enough to add another 15 countries during the month of January that will take
us over 60. And so we feel very, very good about the progress that we've made here.
Relative to iPhone 4, I also feel very, very good about what we've been able to do. However, it's not enough. We do
still have a significant backlog. We're working around the clock to build more. I feel great that the demand is so high.
But at this point, I'm not going to predict when supply and demand will meet. We believe the reaction and results from
the Verizon customers will be huge, and so I don't want to give a prediction right now regarding when supply and
demand will cross.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: And then, Tim, one of the most impressive metrics is the sequential on your growth in
Asia-Pacific. Could you just talk about what's driving that, and what plans you have in place going forward, to sustain
that growth?
<A - Tim Cook>: Yes, that's a very good question. First of all, let me say that of the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia,
India, China, we several years ago identified China as our top priority, and we put enormous energy into China. And
the results of that have been absolutely staggering. To give you some numbers there and some specifics, we look at
Greater China as a region. And Greater China, just for clarity, is Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The
revenue from Greater China for Apple for last quarter was $2.6 billion, which was up 4x from the prior-year quarter.
And to further just to put an exclamation point by that, we did a little over 3 billion for the entire year of fiscal year '10.
So, we're very, very proud of the team, and the results that we've gotten there.
Korea has also been a very, very good market for us. We had an outstanding Q1 there, primarily driven by iPhone and
iPad. And there are several other Asian countries during extremely well. Japan is not in the segment that you're looking
at. But Japan by itself, the revenue was up 83% year-over-year. And if you're familiar with the Japanese economy, and
the growth there, to grow 83% on the base that we're doing is stunning. So, we are placing more and more resource in
these areas and continue to look for expansion possibilities throughout Asia.

Operator
From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.
<Q - Gene Munster>: Good afternoon, and I'll add my congratulations, and a question for Tim in terms of the
long-term business planning. There have been a lot of questions in terms of how far out you guys actually plan, and I
was wondering if there was any insight you can give us in terms of what your long-term business plan is in terms of
product roadmap. Obviously, you can't share what that roadmap is, but how far out you guys go in retail stores, and so
forth. Is it a one-year plan? Is it a five-year plan? Any sort of insight would be helpful.
<A - Tim Cook>: Gene, that's a part of the magic of Apple, and I don't want to let anybody know our magic because I
don't want anybody copying it. What I would tell you is that in my view, Apple is doing its best work ever; that we are
all very happy with the product pipeline. And the team here has an unparalleled breadth and depth of talent and a
culture of innovation that Steve has driven in the company, and excellence has become a habit. And so we feel very,
very confident about the future of the company.
I would also note for those people that haven't thought about it is we've done outstanding in our Mac business. We've
had 19 quarters straight of growing faster than the market. But we still have a relatively low share of a very large PC
market despite having great momentum there. And so it would seem like there's enormous opportunity still there. We
have relatively low share in the handset market. The handset market is well over 1 billion units a year, and the
smartphone market is growing faster than a weed. And so there's enormous opportunity here and we have incredible
momentum in that space.
The iPad just got started. It's a new category. We sold almost 15 million through the first three quarters, and we believe
the market is huge. IDC I saw this morning is predicting it to quadruple in two years. I don't know what to predict in
terms of specific numbers. However, we believe it's a huge market, as we've said before. And so we're in some great
markets, some fast moving markets. We have the best products we've ever done and an incredible product pipeline. We
feel very, very confident.
<Q - Gene Munster>: Okay, that's helpful, and just a follow-up for Peter. In terms of iPhones, you mentioned that if
not for production constraints, you could have sold more. Is there any way to help us back into how many more?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Gene, you can't run the experiment
both ways. Demand for iPhones has just been incredible. We could not make enough in the quarter, and we would have
loved to have ended with more channel inventory than we did.
<A - Nancy Paxton, Director, Investor Relations>: Thank you, Gene. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Citigroup, we'll hear from Richard Gardner.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Thank you, and congrats. I was just hoping that you could talk about what components were
better than you thought in terms of price during the quarter. And then, Tim, if you could give us your thoughts on the
commodity environment going into the March quarter given that flat panels are below cash cost for some providers;
what are you looking for going into the March quarter, please? Thank you.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, Rich, in terms of the
go-forward in March quarter, and what is embedded in the guidance that Peter gave earlier is that we expect a favorable
pricing environment for DRAM where supply exceeds the demand still. Some prices for raw materials, such as key
metals is currently increasing due to the anticipated strengthening of the worldwide economy, and it remains to be seen

whether that continues.
The bulk of the other commodities, from NAND flash to batteries to HDDs to ODDs to LCDs and most other
commodities are generally in a supply/demand balance. And so we would expect this group of commodities to fall in
prices consistent with their historical trends. In terms of what we saw last quarter, frankly, speaking, in most areas we
saw a favorability, and it was a key part of us overachieving our guidance gross margin.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay, thank you. And actually, Tim, if I could follow-up, can you talk about which
component areas you're making long-term commitments in on supply? Thank you.
<A - Tim Cook>: It's something I don't want to give out, Rich, because I view it as a competitive – something I just
don't want our competition knowing. But let me talk about it in general, and hopefully that will suffice. From our point
of view, on the design side, we design components where we believe we can innovate beyond what's available in the
market. And the most recent example of this is the A4 chip. But with the A4 chip, we didn't feel like we had to invest in
the fab itself and build a fab because we felt like there were good options in the market for doing that, but not good
options in terms of buying a design, and so we really focused on design.
On the operational side of the house, as you probably remember, we've historically entered into certain agreements with
different people to secure supply and other benefits. And the largest one in the recent past has been, we signed the deal
with several flash suppliers back at the end of 2005 that totaled over $1 billion because we anticipated that flash would
become increasingly important across our entire product line and increasingly important to the industry. And so we
wanted to secure supply for our company. And we think that was an absolutely fantastic use of Apple's cash. And we
constantly look for more of these.
And so in the past several quarters, we've identified another area and come to some recent agreements that Peter talked
about in his opening comments. These consist of both prepayments and capital for process equipment and tooling. And
similar to the flash agreements, they're focused in an area that we feel is very strategic. And so I'd prefer not to go into
more detail about what specific area it's in. But it's the same kind of thinking that led us to those deals that led us to the
flash deals.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton, Director, Investor Relations>: Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Bill Shope.
<Q - Bill Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. Guys, in the past your bill of materials for key devices has generally come
down at a rate that allowed for fairly healthy gross margin expansion over time. And I'd say this has generally been true
for iPod refreshes in the past, iPhone refreshes. Is there anything different about the iPad that we should consider going
forward, that would make it difficult for margins to follow this historical pattern? And did you see some of this in the
most recent quarter as well?
<A - Tim Cook>: Margins consist of a number of different factors like, which direction the commodity markets are
going, where the product is within the product lifecycle, as well as the value engineering that we do, and the
negotiating, and so forth we do. And so I don't think that you can take a single product out by itself and speak about it
with any accuracy. As you know, we don't guide at the product level on margin. We're confident with the guidance that
Peter provided on gross margin in his opening comments.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And I would add to that that we
have always aggressively worked to lower our costs. I think we have a good track record in this regard. And we
shipped a lot of iPads in the December quarter and at very strong gross margin, so I think we were quite happy with our
progress.

<Q - Bill Shope>: Okay, that's helpful. I understand. On the iPad side again, now that you've had the opportunity over
the past few weeks to see more detailed specs and in some cases the price points for all the countless tablet devices
coming in 2011, can you comment how you're currently viewing the competitive landscape for the iPad and if that has
changed at all over the past few months?
<A - Tim Cook>: If you look at what's shipping today, there's not much out there, as you know. And generally
speaking, there are two groups today that are at least on the market today. The ones that are using a Windows-based
operating system are generally fairly big and heavy and expensive. They have very weak battery life. They require a
keyboard or a stylus as the input device. And from our point of view, and what we've seen, customers frankly, just are
not interested in them.
Then you have the Android tablets. And the variety that are out shipping today, the operating system wasn't really
designed for a tablet. Google has said this, and this is not an Apple view by any means. And so you wind up having a
size of a tablet that is less than what we believe is reasonable or even one that would provide what we feel is a real
tablet experience. And so basically, you wind up with a scaled-up smartphone, which is a bizarre product, in our view.
Then you've got a third group – and so those are the two that are shipping today. And frankly, speaking, it's hard for me
to understand it. If somebody does a side-by-side with an iPad, I think some enormous percentage of people are going
to select an iPad there. Those are not tablets that we have any concern on.
The next-generation Android tablets, which are primarily what you mentioned in terms of the CES,
there's nothing shipping yet, and so I don't know. Generally, they lack performance specs. They lack prices. They lack
timing. And so today, they're paper. We'll assess them as they come out. However, we're not sitting still, and we have a
huge first-mover advantage, and we have an incredible user experience, from iTunes to the App Store and an enormous
number of apps and a huge ecosystem. And so we're very, very confident with entering into a fight with anyone.

From Sanford Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. You've said on previous earnings calls that the move to iPhone
non-exclusivity in regions of the world has had no impact on your ASPs. Can you comment on whether that is still the
case today, and whether we should expect any impact in the migration away from U.S. exclusivity?
And related to that, there are several large carriers globally that the iPhone is still not offered in. Can you talk about
some of the reasons why that isn't the case? Many of them are CDMA-based. And given that you now have a
CDMA-based offering, is it unreasonable to expect that we should see more CDMA carriers going forward?
<A - Tim Cook>: Hi, Toni. It's Tim. Relative to the ASP, I generally would not do this. And I want to be specific that
this comment isn't related to the U.S. or any specific carrier or any specific region. But to specifically answer your
question, I don't envision the overall iPhone ASP decreasing from the December quarter that we just completed to the
March quarter that we're currently in. And as you know, as our longstanding practice has been, we don't comment on
after that period of time.
Relative to other carriers, we're always looking and assessing in every country who we should be doing business with
and exploring different deals and arrangements, et cetera. And so we'll continue to do that. What I've said before is as
we continue – we have seen this in every case literally that we've done is where we've moved from an exclusive carrier
arrangement to a dual or multi-carrier arrangement, our growth has changed significantly and our market share has
increased. And so that doesn't mean that would happen in every country, nor does it mean that we're just out doing that

in every country. We look at each one individual because each market has its own individual characteristics and
parameters and technologies.
On the CDMA phone specifically, I don't have any specific thing to announce today other than we're truly thrilled to be
working with the Verizon team. They have built quite a company and earned a great deal of respect from their
customers. And some of them have waited a long time to get iPhone. And we're very, very happy to give them iPhone
and to any other customers that are non-Verizon customers who wish to buy an iPhone. We're also very happy that
we've signed a multiyear non-exclusive deal with AT&T. And so we're very happy that we will have shortly a
dual-carrier setup in the United States.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: If I can follow up on that, given your previous comments on China, and the importance of
that country strategically for you, and the investments that you're making in stores, et cetera, can you maybe use that as
a case study for why you're only in one carrier there? I think you've said that there are no longer any exclusive
conditions that you have in place globally with any carrier. So, can you talk about other either impediments or
hindrances beyond technology, of which CDMA is one, that may be limiting your ability to sign important carrier
agreements in potentially very important and strategic areas for the company?
<A - Tim Cook>: Toni, I've generally found people really want to do business with us, and their customers very much
desire to have the iPhone. And so I don't really see a lack of desire. I don't want to comment about any specific country
because I view any conversations that we have going as confidential in nature. It is true, as you said, that we are not
under a contractual exclusivity now in any country of the world. The last one was the United States, and so we have
moved away from those.
I can guarantee you that we always are looking at opportunities to grow. Of course, in the very short term, I would also
remind you that we're constrained on iPhone 4, and we're working around the clock to get as many of these out to our
existing partners as we can.
<A - Nancy Paxton, Director, Investor Relations>: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?

We'll go to Brian Blair with Wedge Partners.
<Q - Brian Blair>: Great, thank you, congratulations on a great quarter. Can you maybe give us your updated thoughts
on the Mac side, and maybe specifically address the impact of iPad? With the tremendous iPad units this quarter, the
cannibalization question is going to come up. And I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that, if we could.
<A - Tim Cook>: That's a good question. What we saw in the Mac this quarter was what we grew 23% at the
worldwide level, and that is, compared to a market growth of only three. And so we grew almost eight times the market
rate of growth, which is I think stunning. And every region outgrew the market, so it wasn't just one region.
Asia-Pacific led the growth with a whopping 67% year-over-year increase. And that's almost 10 times what the market
did there, to put it in context. Japan grew at 56%, which is about six times the market. And Europe, and the United
States both grew in double-digits despite both markets contracting overall. And so we did significantly better than the
market in every major region, and we're very proud of that.
Now was there any cannibalization by iPad? Honestly, I don't know for sure. But yes, I think there is some
cannibalization. But I also think there's a halo effect. As we've seen on the Mac by the iPod some years ago, I think
there is a halo effect from Apple product to Apple product. And of course, we have introduced millions of people in
Asia to Apple through the iPhone. And we're now introducing many more through the iPad, and I think some of those
decide to buy Mac. And so when you look at the Mac growth in Asia at 67%, and you look at the Japan growth at 56%,
and you look at the U.S. and Europe growing at double-digits against shrinking markets, if this is cannibalization, it
feels pretty good.

The other point I would make is that if the iPad or tablets do cannibalize the PC market, keep in mind that we have a
low share of the PC market.
<Q - Brian Blair>: Right.
<A - Tim Cook>: The other guys lose a lot more, and we have a lot more to win because of that. And so honestly,
cannibalization is not something that we are spending one minute on here. The iPad teams are building the best iPads
for the future, and the Mac teams are building the best Macs. And I can tell you that both groups believe that they can
continue to grow and do great stuff. And I believe that.
<Q - Brian Blair>: And that's a great way to look at it. One of the things that interesting to me is I see this trend of
you're bringing a lot more of the functionality from the tablet side. You're bringing it onto the Mac side. It was talked
about earlier that the Mac App Store that's now on Mac OS X. And then as we're getting teaser shots of Lion, it looks
like the next OS is also taking even more design and UI elements from the iPad side. So, maybe if you can just talk
about that a little bit; are these two platforms really merging into one? And is this the future of computing as you see it?
Or is it just – are you just grabbing one or two aspects of tablets and bringing it into the OS X?
<A - Tim Cook>: I think one of the – part of the magic of Apple is that there's not high walls between these product
groups. They like each other, talk to each other. They're of the same DNA. They want to build the best products in the
world. And so if one has a great idea, there's not a not-invented-here in the other group. And so one of the key learnings
from the iPad was that people love instant-on; they really love that. And so the MacBook Air incorporated that.
And that's just one simple example, but there are tons of examples throughout all of our products where something
started on one and went to a different one. And it's not always in the same direction either. It could start on the phone,
and then flow forward. It could start on the iPad and flow, and so on, and so forth. And so it's a part of the way we run
the company. And I think Steve said it great when he said if the Mac company were a separate company, and the iPad
company were a separate company, what would the Mac company build to compete with the iPad?
<Q - Brian Blair>: Sure.
<A - Tim Cook>: And I think the answer is the MacBook Air. And I think that's a phenomenal insight and I think a
great way to look at it. And it's not that the groups are competing. They're sharing and coming up with these incredible
products that people really want.
<A - Nancy Paxton, Director, Investor Relations>: Thanks, Brian.

From Bank of Montreal, we'll hear from Keith Bachman.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Hi, guys. It actually relates to what you were just talking about. Tim, do you have data that
you've gathered on the phone and/or the iPad on new to the brand? You typically talk about Macs in the stores, you're
getting 50% new to the brand. Do you have any data related to the newness of the brand? I would assume it's
substantially higher than that, but I wanted to hear a little bit about that; and, depending on that outcome, if you talk a
little bit about how you think these products, in particular, the Pad in emerging markets, may help to continue to drive
share opportunities for you?
<A - Tim Cook>: Yeah, I don't want to share – do we collect it? Yes, of course, we do. The numbers for iPhone are –
there's many sets of numbers there now because we've been shipping iPhone for a while. Any product that you ship for
a while looks a little different at the front end or in the early adopter cycle versus when you get into the mainstream.
Now, iPad went through that cycle quickly and moved to mainstream and enterprise and all the rest in record time. But

nevertheless, that data needs to settle some even before internally we put a lot of weight in it.
But the bulk of your question doesn't need specific numbers to make a point. If you look at our Asia-Pacific business,
the revenue growth was 175% or so. And so this is incredible, and the size business in Asia that we've now built is
massive. To do $2.6 billion in China in three months, where just two years ago, we did less than $1 billion in the whole
year is phenomenal – actually for the year before. And so I think we are – it's clear that we're introducing a lot of
people to Apple who previously had not been introduced to the company, and I think that helps across the product line.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Can I ask a follow-up, Tim?
<A - Tim Cook>: Yes, sure.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: In the U.S., I'm just trying to understand how you see the tablet market more broadly having
greater penetration rates, say, in established markets versus emerging markets. Typically, the notion is that tablets in
many cases are more about consumption versus creation. And I just wanted to hear your thoughts, not on growth rate,
but on absolute unit opportunities between the established markets, and the emerging markets.
<A - Tim Cook>: I think that the tablet market is – the opportunity is so large, it's large everywhere, honestly.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay, all right, fair enough. Thanks very much.
<A - Tim Cook>: I think it's huge, yes.
<A - Nancy Paxton, Director, Investor Relations>: Thank you, Keith. Could we have the next question, please?

And we'll go to Barclays Capital's Ben Reitzes.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Yes, hey, a question for Peter. I just wanted to hash out the revenue outlook. Your sequential
decline of, I guess, 17% is a little more than last year's, but you have Verizon now for the iPhone. So, what
components, I guess other than iPod, are expected to contribute to the big decline, if intuitively, maybe iPhones have
some support from Verizon?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Ben, I'll answer your question a
couple ways. First of all, we're working hard to increase supply of iPhones. Tim has talked about that, but that will
come over a period of time and not necessarily overnight, as we said.
In terms of the sequential guidance this year, let me start by saying we are thrilled to be giving you guidance for 63%
revenue growth year-over-year, which will translate to 50% earnings growth. So, the business is performing extremely
well. We're shipping the best products in Apple's history, and customer response has been tremendous. But as I said in
my prepared remarks, we increased the iPhone, and the iPad channel inventory by about 775,000 units, and this will
have a bit of an impact on the sequential compare that you referred to.
In terms of the products, for Mac, we just reported the highest Mac sales ever, and we've outgrown the market for 19
consecutive quarters. We would expect to see a sequential unit decline, which is typical for us after the holiday season.
For iPod, we would also expect to see a large sequential decline, which is also typical for us after a holiday season. For
iPhone, we would expect to see a significant year-over-year increase. And for iPad, this will be our first experience
going from the December to March quarter, so we'll see. However, it was clear to us that the iPad was a hot holiday gift
item, which fueled the 75% sequential growth that we saw in the December quarter. And given this, we would expect a
sequential decline in the March quarter. So, that's what's gone into our thinking, Ben.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Thanks so much, and then just a follow-up for Tim. Last call, or one of the last calls, Steve had a
lot of comments around Android and perhaps some of its disadvantages versus your platform. Is there any other
observations you'd like to make now that we have had a few more months to see the market develop further; and with
Verizon and even more tablet sales on the horizon, the feedback that you're getting from developers; or anything else

you'd like to add on the battle with Android, updating Steve's recent comments from last quarter?
<A - Tim Cook>: If you look at the iPhone portion, we had record sales of iPhone with 16.2 million units sold in the
quarter. As Peter said, we believe we could have sold more had if we had more supply. From the market estimates that
we've seen, it's suggested we grew faster than the market. Obviously, we're working around the clock on increasing
supply. We're continuing to expand countries and carriers, and I've talked a little bit of that with Toni's questions. We're
getting enormous enterprise traction, with 88% of the Fortune 100, which is mind-blowing, I believe, 83% of the
Fortune 500, 60% of the FT 100. So, the enterprise traction is gaining.
We have the highest customer sat ratings in the industry versus Android or RIM or any – we have the largest App
Store, with over 300,000 apps. We've now sold over 160 million iOS devices. This is huge. And we fundamentally
believe that our integrated approach delivers a far superior customer experience than the fragmented approach. And
you can see this in a variety of ways, from the fragmentation of the number of App Stores out there that people are
going to pull their hair out because they're going have a variety of updating methodologies and a variety of payment
methods and slightly different derivatives. You can see from surveys people are doing to see who is on the latest OS.
And you'll notice that the iOS is always off the charts on the percentage of people that have the latest version versus the
other guys. We are launching with Verizon next month. We believe there's a huge pent-up demand there. And we think
that that will help us in the U.S.
And so I think I probably just repeated much of what he said before. But the net-net is we think that our integrated
approach is much better for the end user because it takes out all the complexity for the end user instead of making the
end user a systems integrator themselves. I don't know about you, but I don't know very many people that want to be
system integrators, either a consumer or somebody in the enterprise. And so I think that the more iPhones that we can
get out there into people's hands, the more people love them, and I think we've got a very bright future.
I think the same thing about iPad. It's the same set of issues at the end of the day. The difference on iPad of course, is
that we have a – we've been running three quarters without any significant competition of any type. And I think that the
customer sat ratings on the iPad are also off the charts. So, I don't know if any of that is new. I doubt that it is, but I
think we are in a very good position.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Okay. Thanks, Tim.
<A - Tim Cook>: Yes.

We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Peter, I want to see if you can give us a little more insight
on the iPad gross margins going forward. Just given Tim's comments earlier about the bounty of underachievers out
there, at least in the early goings, should we assume then that Apple can really improve the future set with the next
generation and hold pricing stable?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'm sorry, Mark, that's not a
question I can answer. We don't talk about future products. But I can tell you that in terms of what we're shipping
today, we are always aggressively working to lower our costs. And I think we have a good track record in doing so.
And our gross margins were stronger than we thought for the December quarter. And I've provided guidance for the
March quarter; it's 38.5%. So, we feel very, very good about the performance of our products and our cost of products.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Okay, and then my follow-up. Tim, I apologize if this question has been asked. I fell off for a
moment. I want to come back to the MacBook Air. Just given the initial success here and momentum, can you give us
any insights in terms of how you're looking at that platform now? Is it a premium tablet? Is it more of a notebook still?
I just want to get a sense of – is this a one-two punch in terms of the iPad, with the MacBook Air giving you double

coverage, if you will, in both notebooks and in tablets?
<A - Tim Cook>: The way that we look at it is the Mac of the future is shipping today. And it was a phenomenal part
of our growth on the Mac last quarter. It had gotten off to an unbelievable start. The customers love it. They love the
precision of it. They love the thinness, the weight, the instant-on. The list is long of things, and so we're really happy
with how it's doing out of the starting blocks. And as you know, we've only been shipping it for less than 90 days. And

We'll go to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason Maynard>: Hi. There's been a lot of talk about this consumerization of enterprise technology. And
obviously, it's being driven by a focus on your iPhones and iPads at work. I know you said it's big share gains within
your statistics. But I was curious if you think there are still some barriers around maybe developer training at the
corporate level or security, things that just naturally need to get worked through before you see the penetration numbers
even increase further or start to see a wider swath of employees use iPhones and iPads in business.
<A - Tim Cook>: I think that the consumerization that you speak of in the enterprise is one of the megatrends that are
occurring. I think the most forward-looking CIOs are coming to the realization that the productivity of the person, the
creativity of the employee is materially more important than everyone using the same thing. And the ability to write
apps in a simple and straightforward manner for the phone or the iPad through the SDK [Software Developer Kit] is an
incredible thing. And you can wind up literally running your whole business off of an iPad or an iPhone.
And so I think the list of ideas and places that people can go there were unimaginable just a few months ago. And so I
see an enormous potential there. The numbers are already incredible. And think about this. The iPad started shipping in
April, and we're already up to 80% of the largest companies deploying or piloting the product. This is unheard of at
least in my dealings with the enterprise over the years. Generally enterprise is much slower, much more cautious, and
uses things that have been on the market for a long time. And I think to everyone's credit, they've seen the value of this
from a productivity and creativity point of view, and they're really moving fast. And so I think we're just scratching the
surface right now.
In terms of inhibitors, the iPad has a huge advantage because, as you probably remember, as we went to various
different iOS releases, we always put in a huge chunk of enterprise features. And so this isn't something that we just
started focusing on. We started focusing on this before we shipped the first phone. And with the synergy that exists
with the iOS between the different products, other products get the advantage of it, not just the product that it ships on
initially. And so I think there's a huge play here for us.
