MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2011 NYSE Euronext Earnings
Conference Call. My name is Deanna, and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to
turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at NYSE Euronext.
Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen C. Davidson
Thank you, Deanna. Good morning and welcome to the NYSE Euronext Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 earnings
conference call. Before I introduce today's speakers, let me remind you that comments on the call may contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These statements are
based on NYSE Euronext's current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NYSE Euronext's
actual results to differ materially from those in the statements.

environment. Michael Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer, will then review the financial results for the quarter and
provide you with preliminary guidance for 2012. We will then open the line for your questions.
We are incorporating slides for the call today, which are available for viewing on our website and Duncan and Mike
will refer to the slides during their remarks.
With that, let me turn the call over to, Duncan.
Duncan L. Niederauer
All right, thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks as always for joining us. Before I get into the details
on slide 3, let me just tell you what we're going to try to accomplish this morning. I thought I'd start by saying a few
words of about the merger prohibition announcement from last week. We'll move quickly into what we've
accomplished in 2011 and I think the most important focus this morning will be to outline for our plan for creating
value for shareholders in the quarters to come.
So, let me just dispense with the merger first, if I may. It is our view and it was our view, and I think it continues to be
our view that the proposed merger was a great opportunity to accelerate our strategy. It was a great opportunity to
create long-term value for shareholders and we also believe that it would provide substantial benefits with regard to
capital efficiencies for the capital markets community.
However, given the narrow market definition that the Commission chose to use when evaluating the transaction; it was
my view that the industrial logic of the transaction would have been significantly compromised if we agreed to meet
the Commission's demand for remedies and we were not going to violate the trust that the shareholders placed in us
when they voted to support the deal this past summer.
So the deal is done; it's behind us and I want to be very, very clear about that. I'd like to close that remark by thanking
the shareholders, the customers and most importantly our employees for their patience and support during this process.
I'm still glad we tried, but unfortunately the outcome was not what we hoped for.
So now let's move onto 2011. I'm extremely pleased to share our full-year 2011 results with you, which as you can see
were characterized by a 6% increase in revenue, a 21% increase in operating income and a 19% increase in both net
income and earnings per share. The results were driven by strong trading volumes, continued cost discipline and more
meaningful contributions from new initiatives.
We beat our cost guidance for the year as costs declined 4% on a constant-dollar constant-portfolio basis and we were
well below $200 million in CapEx. While we fell short of our target of 15% revenue growth in our NYSE Technologies
business, we did achieve double-digit revenue growth under challenging market conditions and the uncertainly for
clients that was created by their proposed merger.
On the business front, we made significant progress in growing our NYSE Liffe US business with the launch of interest
rate derivatives and the migration of the MSCI Emerging Markets and EAFE stock index futures to our exchange.
Open interest in these products has nearly doubled since the migration and open interest across the entire exchange
surpassed the 1 million contracts mark in December.
Our approach to semi-mutualization has also paid off in our NYSE Amex options business, where we worked with our
partners to continue to grow the business in 2011. Together with NYSE Arca Options, we grew our market share to a
record 28%, which was number one in US equity options.
We were also the global leader in IPOs in 2011, with three times the total proceeds raised by your nearest US
competitor who is ranked number eight globally. We continue to make progress in 2012, with big wins in the tech
sector, as well as continued momentum on the transfer side. Since the beginning of 2010, we have had nearly three
times the number of companies transfer to the NYSE, as opposed to away from the NYSE.

Our strategy in the technologies business continued to make strong inroads into Asia in particular with our acquisition
of Metabit and the deepening of our relationship with the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Overall as you look at slide three, if you look at what we accomplished in 2011 and then remember that we also moved
a transformational cross-border exchange merger further than any other, the ability to have done both is a testament to
the team here and our relentless focus on execution that has become a hallmark of our company.
Outside of the post-trade arena, where we slowed the building of our own clearinghouse, we really did not miss a beat
last year. Now with 2011 behind us, the key is what are the next steps in the evolution of our company. The next
several slides that I'll walk through will address the measures we are going to take to grow the company, guided by our
community strategy that has accelerated our growth the last couple of years. A more detailed presentation of these
efforts will come on April 2 at our Investor Day.
Please turn to slide four. On slide four we highlight and affirm our community strategy and give you the three pillars
that will drive multiyear earnings growth for NYSE Euronext, assuming only modest improvements in the underlying
operating environment. If you look back to 2009 and 2010, those were the years when we were finishing our global
technology harmonization and building out our data centers as part of our capital markets community strategy. All the
work that we accomplished during that time set the table for 2011, where we saw a step up in earnings power and
delivery. Despite the challenging near-term outlook for trading volumes, we remain optimistic about the future.
We have within our control several levers that we can pull to drive earnings higher, again, with just modest
improvements in the operating environment. These levers are the three pillars of our equity story we are laying out for
you today and again greater detail will be provided at the Investor Day in a few weeks.
If you look at the right side of the slide, the first pillar is focused on targeted growth opportunities. First, we will be
rolling out a series of organically grown new products and services, while continuing to focus on market structure
innovation in our core markets. Our portfolio of post-trade services will be a key priority in 2012. We have a solid
clearing footprint in both Europe and the US, which we will now build on to improve our existing businesses and to
create new service opportunities.
Next, we are expecting NYSE Technologies to continue its double-digit growth trajectory with enhanced managed
service capabilities and expanded connectivity and data offerings. And lastly in the targeted growth opportunity area,
we are looking to NYSE Liffe US to accelerate its growth with the possible addition of new partners and an expanded
product portfolio.
The second pillar is cost efficiency. Looking back to our merger with Euronext, since that time we have pulled out over
$600 million from the cost base. This has involved hard decisions about our organizational construct, as well as
changing the way we do business; this rigor will continue.
Next, we will continue to examine our investment portfolio and exit those that are loss-making and/or not expected to
achieve the anticipated level of revenue generation as we prioritize our set of growth initiatives. We are also examining
our infrastructure to be sure that we are optimally structured for our current and future operational needs.
The last pillar of our story is strategic capital deployment. Over the past several years, we have returned approximately
$2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We're pledging to continue our shareholder focus
with the recently announced $550 million repurchase program.
We have several stakes in other companies that, in our opinion, have limited strategic benefit or have not lived up to
our expectations. We will continue to examine opportunities to harvest these investments and reallocate the capital to
other, more attractive opportunities. Lastly, over the past year, we have seen some interesting opportunities on the
M&A front, but we emphasize our hope for merger. We'll now begin to look at potential complementary strategic
M&A opportunities going forward.
In the next few slides, I will focus on the first pillar of our growth story and Mike will provide some further granularity
on the other two pillars when he gets into his remarks.

Please turn to slide five. Slide five shows our strengths and opportunities and illustrates the compelling targeted
revenue initiatives we have underway. You should recognize this slide, which we first introduced at our shareholder
meeting last April. While the DB merger would have helped us fill this chart out, we believe that we have several
compelling opportunities on our own in many of these areas.
On the right side of the chart we show a sample of high potential initiatives that both enhance our areas of strength and
move us beyond our core business. In addition to new product opportunities in derivatives and continued market
structure innovation in our core markets, shown as number six on this chart, we have some key initiatives in areas of
strength that include number three; we will continue to build on the success we have achieved by partnering with our
clients on NYSE Amex and NYSE Liffe US.
Number four, we are enhancing our connectivity for NYSE Technologies through the expansion of our network of
liquidity hubs around the globe.
Number five, we are looking to make investments in issuer services similar to our acquisition of Corporate Board
Member and our minority stake in the receivables exchange, which we believe further enhanced our listings brand.
And lastly, number seven, we are focused on enhancing our managed services capabilities for NYSE Technologies.
There are also some initiatives that we believe will extend our capabilities beyond our core business. Number one,
which you all know will be a key focus for us in 2012, we'll be completing the development of a post trade solution for
our European derivatives and cash equities businesses. And number two, coming back to the US, we will be launching
new products in NYSE Liffe US and NYPC. The next one of which, which we've just announced will be a future based
on DTC's GCF Repo Index. We hope this will continue to round out and NYSE Liffe US and NYPC's capitally
efficient value proposition.
My next several slides will go into more detail on some of these opportunities. Please turn to slide six. Slide six focuses
on our post-trade portfolio, which as I just said, will be a critical area for us in 2012. As I said earlier, we have a strong
clearing footprint in both Europe and the US, which we will now further develop to improve our existing business and
to create new service opportunities. Our immediate focus in 2012 is in Europe where we will, firstly, enhance our
current derivatives post-trade services with attractive new solutions, completing the build out of NYSE Liffe Clear,
which I'll focus on in a minute. Secondly, part of the effort will be to develop new OTC clearing capabilities in
collaboration with our users. And thirdly, we will review our European cash clearing options to make sure we select
arrangements for the future, which offer stability, capital efficiency and innovation for our customers.
A second area of focus which I just mentioned will be NYSE Liffe Clearing and our overall derivatives platform. We
made significant investments in NYSE Liffe Clearing through 2011, rolling out a new clearing processing engine, the
Universal Clearing Platform which delivered significant performance improvements to our customers. This technology
investment program will continue through 2012 as we roll out new technology interfaces to improve customer service
and latency.
While some of our standalone post-trade plans were put on hold in 2011, we have already relaunched our project to
convert NYSE Liffe Clearing into a full-service CCP. These plans involve expanding the service to clear all of our
European derivatives products and to deliver many of the operational and capital efficiencies for customers, which we
envisioned in the merger. We will also develop the OTC clearing capabilities which I referenced earlier and we will
complete the removing of the reliance on third-party providers by introducing new in-house solutions for treasury
management services.
We look forward to engaging with users to develop a full service UK-based clearinghouse, which will offer operating
and capital efficiencies, provide innovative solutions across listed and OTC markets and provide an unrivaled level of
customer service. With legislation beginning to crystallize on the new mandates, which will be imposed for central
clearing of derivatives, now is the right time in our opinion to be working with users to develop competitive clearing
solutions that will meet their needs. The current derivatives clearing arrangements with LCH.Clearnet expire in the
middle of next year.

On the European cash clearing side, we are accelerating the review of the strategic options available for clearing our
European cash markets. These markets are cleared by LCH.Clearnet in Paris with the current arrangements due to
expire at the end of next year. No decisions have been taken on cash clearing and all options will now be reviewed with
a view to promptly identify the most efficient, stable, secure and commercially appropriate solution for the future, for
our clients and for us.
And lastly on this slide a minute on New York Portfolio Clearing. NYPC was created last year to deliver unique capital
efficiency to the market by evaluating and margining a clearing member's risks on a portfolio basis across related cash
and derivative positions. There are a number of expansion opportunities under active consideration for NYPC, as I
noted earlier. More to come in this important area on April 2.
Please turn to slide seven. Slide seven is an update on the NYSE Technologies business, which grew revenues by more
than 10% year-over-year and will be a significant contributor to our future growth. We remain committed to the $1
billion revenue target in 2015 and committed as well to the margin of 25% to 30% in that business. Our strategic vision
for this business is to become the facilitator and enabler of the capital markets community and the roadmap to achieve
this vision is focused on four key tenets that will guide us as we innovate.
We executed against each tenet in 2011 by introducing new products and services in each arena. On the right hand side
of the table, we show a handful of the significant deals that we signed last year and these wins in our mind validate the
strategy we are pursuing. Let me briefly walk you through the four key tenets.
First, building out the network. We recently opened new liquidity centers in Chicago, Toronto and Tokyo to give
customers the ability to access new markets with unparalleled speed and reliability. In 2011, we also expanded our
safety network into Mexico and the UK, increasing direct connectivity to new markets and new participants. We
acquired Metabit, which provides industry leading access to financial markets across Asia, accelerating our efforts in
that region.
Secondly, we are extending our data services footprint. We rolled out the SuperFeed product in Europe connecting 30
markets to the access centers in London and Frankfurt. SuperFeed provides immediate access to our exchanges' data
but also the data from a range of key global markets across the safety network.
Third, it's about building out the service platform. Two major initiatives were successfully launched in 2011 to
reinforce our leading position as a service platform provider. We launched the Capital Markets Community Platform,
the most secure, reliable and scalable financial services cloud computing environment in the industry, and we created a
vendor neutral platform driven by the financial services technology community by open-sourcing our MAMA
programming interface.
Lastly, we continue to be focused on attracting other market venues. In 2011, we successfully deployed the first fully
hosted MTF and ATS solutions, confirming this as an important product for future growth and consistent with where
we think our model can go. Add this to our successful partnerships in Tokyo and Warsaw, and you can see why we
believe that NYSE Technologies is poised for future double-digit revenue growth.
Please turn to slide eight. On slide eight, we show how partnering with our clients has helped grow our derivatives
business. First, NYSE Liffe US 2011 was a key year for NYSE Liffe US with our launch of its interest rate futures
complex and the much anticipated launch of NYPC, which was recently named the most innovative clearinghouse in
North America during 2011.
The platform gained momentum from the launch of interest rate futures as well as the successful migration of the MSCI
linked index futures. Since this migration in June of 2011, as I mentioned earlier, opened interest in ADV in the MSCI
products has nearly doubled led by the Emerging Markets Index product. The platform success in 2011 culminated with
our crossing the 1 million contracts of open interest milestone in December, this was led by Eurodollar futures, where
our open interest now represents 10% market share. 2012 will be a critical year for this venture and we are working on
several new initiatives, including launching new products such as options on futures, connecting new clearing members
and adding new partners.

These efforts should accelerate our progress. The platform plans continue its innovation theme during 2012, as noted
by our January 4 press release announcing that NYSE Liffe US has obtained the exclusive license to list futures based
on DTCCs GCF Repo index futures. Market feedback since that announcement has been overwhelmingly positive.
Finally, Risk Magazine recently named NYSE Liffe US; Exchange of the Year, so we're excited about the prospects for
this venture in 2012 and beyond.
Next to me turn to NYSE Amex Options. We have been very pleased with the growth of the NYSE Amex US equity
options business and the support of our partners. We have seen Amex market share grow from under 6% in the fourth
quarter of 2008 to north of 15% in the fourth quarter of 2011. This growth has been possible in part due to our partners,
who now hold 47.5% of the venture.
Several key achievements have been instrumental to success in this venture. While we opposed the Qualified
Contingent Cross Order type when ISE first proposed it, given the SEC approval and our acknowledgment that we need
to be competitive in the market, we launched a similar product and the early returns have been very positive. Another
key addition this year was the complex order auction functionality, which allows customers to seek rapid price
improvement electronically. Lastly, Amex complex order book volume was up over 350% year-on-year. While we're
pleased with our growth in this new space, further expansion remains a significant opportunity for us in 2012.
Lastly for me before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to slide nine. On slide nine, we attempt to address a number of
the elements in the macro environment that have created uncertainty. Here we depict the various clouds on the horizon,
many of which we believe may also come with a silver lining. With a focus on those elements of our business model
that we can control combined with solid execution of our strategy, we are optimistic that these clouds will not
materially impact our business in the near term and may actually afford us with some new unexpected opportunities.
First, in terms of derivatives reform, we have always supported regulatory efforts that bring transparency and better risk
management to the markets. We support these efforts because it makes sense for our markets and will significantly
reduce systemic risk. Both EMIR in Europe and Dodd-Frank in the US encourage derivatives to move toward a cleared
environment and we have been actively involved in the dialogue in both regions. But the overhang of these reforms is
causing uncertainty, changes in our clients' business models and underinvestment.
However, as banks look to reduce costs, we believe we are well positioned to serve as a major provider of outsourced
trading infrastructure to the sell side as they reinvent their own business models. And with capital becoming an
increasingly scarce and valuable resource, capitally efficient clearinghouses like NYPC are poised to offer a lot of
value to the end users.
Next, we all know we are operating in a lower volatility, lower growth environment, driven by the lingering effects of
the financial crisis which is keeping rates at or near zero. This type of environment dampens volumes and results in
even greater internalization in the US cash markets as we've witnessed in early 2012.
On the flip side though, more stable markets means companies are better able to raise capital in the public markets,
which is good for our listings business as the pipeline loosens up. It also highlights the benefit of our diversified
revenue model. If these lower volatility conditions persist, 2012 promises to be a very good year for capital issuance.
Uncertainty continues to persist around the euro as well and that is naturally taking a toll on investment and growth in
Europe. However the silver lining here is that spikes in volatility drive volume and the evolving landscape may also
present new product opportunities for us in cash and particularly in derivatives. Tough for capital formation, but good
for transaction volumes.
Lastly the financial transaction tax has received its fair share of headlines in recent months. We view the likelihood of a
transaction tax as initially envisioned at the Eurozone or EU level as increasingly unlikely. Currently there are
individual tax proposals being floated in France and Germany and we may even see unilateral action in other countries,
notably Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. In France there is a reasonably strong likelihood that some form of stamp
duty tax will pass. However, we believe the impact will be muted by the fact it would be limited in scope and would
exempt liquidity providers and market makers.

In short, this is a politically charged issue, and we expect it to stay in the headlines in the near term, but in the final
analysis, we place a low probability on the implementation of an FTT in Europe that would severely impact our
business.
With that let me turn the call over to Mike for a review of the financial results. Thanks.
Michael S. Geltzeiler
Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full-year
2011. This quarter there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.43 a share and our non-GAAP
EPS of $0.50 a share. As previously communicated, fourth-quarter 2011 results include a $25 million pre-tax charge
related to our settlement with French tax authorities on the BlueNext VAT matter.
In terms of P&L geography, a gross $42 million was recorded on the SG&A line, with an offsetting $17 million
recorded on the non-controlling interest line, reflecting the payment made by our 40% joint venture partner CDC.
In the quarter we also reported a $46 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, which included $38 million
related to the merger. For 2011, a total of $85 million was spent on the merger. We are in the process of finalizing
residual costs related to the merger, and will communicate this on our first quarter call. Lastly, we benefited this quarter
from being able to take a tax deduction for merger related costs, now that the merger has been prohibited.
Our review of our financial results from this point forward, will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs,
the BlueNext tax settlement and a discrete tax item.
Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter and full year. Versus Q4 prior year,
revenues were up and expenses lower, driving a 13% increase in operating income and a 9% increase in EPS. EPS at
$0.50 of share is below the unseasonably strong $0.71 recorded in the third quarter of 2011. The full-year 2011 EPS
was $2.48, up 19% versus 2010.
The operating environment began to change in Q4 as volatility lessened and trading volumes declined at an average of
17% across all our trading venues from Q3. This trend continued into January of this year. Fortunately, our diversified
portfolio enables us to weather these periods better than was the case a few years ago.
For 2011, 48% of our revenues is attributed to trading volumes. In the quarter, we grew non-trading related revenues
both versus Q3 and prior year as well as from continued cost discipline. Q4 operating margins increased to 34% and
full-year margins climbed 5 percentage points to 38%. This is driven by incremental margins that were greater than
100% in the quarter and for the full-year.
NYSE Amex Options continued to perform well in the quarter with market share of 15% for Q4 our highest level of
quarterly market share. For the quarter, the pre-tax profit attributable to the non-controlling interest on Amex Options
was $9 million based on the 47.5% stake in the business held by our partners.
For the full year, higher Technology Services revenue, stronger trading volumes in European cash and US equity
options, combined with strong increases in US average net revenue capture and a 1% decline in reported expenses
drove double-digit increases in operating income and earnings. We generated $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA from the
full-year 2011, the highest level of EBITDA generation since 2008. Diluted share count was down slightly due to $100
million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter.
Slide 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our derivatives segment. Derivatives accounted for 32% of our
consolidated net revenues and 42% of our operating income in 2011. Net revenues decreased by 1% in the quarter but
rose 4% for the full-year. Global derivatives volumes increased 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 15% increase
in US equity options which offset a 3% decline in European derivatives.
Revenue capture for the quarter was slightly favorable for NYSE Liffe versus both Q3 and prior year quarter due
principally to product mix and volumes whereas capture for US options was lower. As a reminder, beginning

December 1 we modified pricing for the trading of individual equity options in index futures and options on NYSE
Liffe, Amsterdam and Belgium. These ADVs represented approximately 10% of total NYSE Liffe volumes in 2011.
We expect this pricing change to decrease NYSE Liffe's overall capture by an annualized 3% to 4%.
As, Duncan indicated, global derivatives continues to be a major area of focus for future investment and growth. Our
Liffe US and NYPC businesses were still very much in investment phase for 2011, both reporting sizable losses. In
2012 we are planning incremental investments in building out our European clearing capabilities and in new product
and service offerings.
Similarly, slides 14 and 15 show the financial performance for our cash trading and listings segments. Cash trading and
listings accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues and 47% of our operating income in 2011. Cash trading
and listings net revenues were $315 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 up 2% versus prior year, but down 11%
compared to the third quarter of 2011.
European cash ADV of 1.6 million transactions increased 13% from the fourth quarter of 2010 levels, but decreased
17% from Q3 levels. In US cash equities, volumes decreased 5% to 2.1 billion shares from last year and decreased 18%
from strong third quarter levels.
Market share was down slightly in Q4 for US cash and was 65% in our four European markets, compared to 72% in the
prior year. That said, European share was stable quarter-on-quarter.
Listings revenue increased $5 million year-over-year and was up $24 million for the full-year 2011. IPOs slowed in the
fourth quarter, however the pipeline is strong.
Revenue capture for US cash increased to $0.039 per 100 shares handled for Q4, well above the $0.033 recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2010. Since the second quarter of 2010, we have linked tiers over all US consolidated volumes. We
moved the inversion at the highest tiers on Arca and benefited from sponsored access rule changes.
Revenue capture for European cash decreased to $0.58 from $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $0.64 in the third
quarter of 2011. The decline in capture was driven primarily by a reduction in fees at auction and lower trade size,
which began in August and continued through December. Pricing in basis points is up slightly versus Q3.
Slide 16 details the financial performance of our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. This
segment accounted for 20% of our net revenues and 13% of our operating income in the fourth quarter. Information
Services and Technology Solutions revenue was a $127 million in the fourth quarter an increase of $13 million or 11%
from Q4 prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in safety and collocation revenue and growth for
managed service sales to TSC, Warsaw and SIGMA X.
Revenues for this segment have grown sequentially every quarter this year. For the year our Technology segment grew
revenues 10% and expanded margins from 20% to 26%.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. Like the intense focus on the merger, we made
excellent progress this year on reducing our operating expenses. Q4 expenses were favorable to our prior guidance
attributed to tight cost management, a stronger US dollar and a one-time savings realized from a real-estate transaction
in Europe.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were down $9 million versus last year on a reported basis. 38% of our expenses in
Q4 were denominated in either euros 18% or pounds 20%. After adjusting for FX and the impact of the transactions
such as NYSE Blue JV and the acquisition of Corporate Board Member and Metabit, fixed operating costs were down
$16 million or 4% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
At the end of 2011 which reported this cost $12 million below 2010. However, excluding the impact of foreign
exchange and changes to our portfolio, our expenses were $70 million or 4% below prior year levels, which puts us
well below the commitment we made to you in early 2010 that our expenses will be less than $1,650 million on a
constant dollar, constant portfolio basis in 2011.

Slide 18 reconciles our cost evolution since 2007 merger with Euronext. Over this period we saved over $650 million
on a constant portfolio basis. About two-thirds of this savings was reinvested through business acquisitions or new
business startups.
In 2012 and 2013 cost efficiency will remain a priority. We see further opportunities to leverage resources efficiently
for the benefit of the group with a goal of achieving a community premium for the company. As, Duncan mentioned,
there are a number of target areas we will be seeking greater efficiencies. We will provide greater transparency on this
at our Investor Day.
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of December 31, 2011. The company ended the year in a strong balance
sheet position. The combination of EBITDA growing 15% and debt declining $300 million reduced our leverage ratio
to 1.6 times down from 2.2 times at the end of 2010. This is the lowest level of leverage since NYSE and Euronext
merged.
Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter compared to $61 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year,
capital expenditures were $170 million, well below our full-year guidance of less than $200 million in capital spending.
We executed $100 million in stock repurchases during the fourth quarter as part of our $1 billion share outstanding,
repurchasing 3.7 million shares at an average price $29.96. A total of $550 million remains on the existing share
buyback authorization and these repurchases will be funded out of cash on hand and cash from operating activities
through 2012. Repurchases at current stock price levels are highly accretive.
We see our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation as a major enabler for future earnings growth. With the
merger now prohibited, we are in the process of developing a multi-year plan to grow earnings and strategically grow
earnings and strategically reposition the company. We will dive deeper into this plan on our Investor Day on April 2.
On slide 20, we are providing some preliminary guidance for 2012. First, let me discuss revenue. Duncan discussed our
growth priorities earlier in the presentation. We are targeting another year of double-digit growth for NYSE
Technologies and we expect margins to improve from the 26% level achieved in 2011. Over the past two years, we
have invested heavily in our US futures business, Liffe US; we expect the financials in this venture to improve in 2012
and by 2013 to turn profitable.
Now let me turn to costs. On a constant dollar basis, exclusive of new business initiatives and incremental M&A, we
are guiding that fixed expenses for 2012 will be below the 2011 costs of $1,666 million. This includes absorbing
incremental variable costs associated with higher Technology revenues.
As, Duncan mentioned earlier, one of key 2012 priorities will be the build out of our post-trade capabilities in Europe.
We will provide more guidance on the costs and benefits of this initiative once we finalize our plans. The incremental
expenses and capital spending is expected to have a favorable rate of return, once we can report the clearing revenues
and rationalize cost repayment for LCH to handle risk management and treasury functions for Liffe clearing.
Turning to capital, we expect CapEx in 2012 to be above last year's $170 million, but still below our maintenance level
of $200 million, due in part to incremental capital spending to build out our clearing capabilities.
Our $550 million buyback will become effective after today's earnings. We expect to complete the buyback in 2012.
We are confirming our long term financial policy of targeting debt levels between 2 and 2.25 times EBITDA.
Lastly on taxes, we anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% for 2012.
I'll now turn the call back to Duncan for some concluding remarks before we open the line for questions.
Duncan L. Niederauer
All right, thanks Mike. So just to summarize, the results for the quarter and full year 2011 were solid, driven by strong
volumes, continued cost discipline and increasing contributions from our non-trading businesses as a result of our

diversification efforts over the past few years. We're pleased with the progress we're making on our strategy to create a
global capital markets community that will empower our clients to innovate and collaborate.
And as we move through 2012 we are not sitting still waiting for the operating environment to improve. We are
focusing on those levers within our control to execute against our community strategy and to expand our ability to
generate underlying earnings per share growth. As we've said, this will be accomplished through a mix of targeted
revenue generating initiatives, accelerated cost efficiency efforts and strategic capital deployment.
As we talked about, we've already executed it recently, $100 million of stock repurchases at a price just below $27 and
our announced $550 million additional share repurchase program will begin immediately.
So with that, we're happy to open the line for questions. We'll have time to take a few questions and then as always
we'll make ourselves available to the analyst community throughout the day. So thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from the line of Rich Repetto, Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Yes, good morning. Duncan, Michael, Larry.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: And first, thanks for doing the detailed walk through the standalone strategy. And I guess
my one question, I'd focus sort on the capital return, Duncan and Michael. If you look at the $550 million buyback and
you hint that your target leverage, if you just took 25% more up on the 1.6 EBITDA, it'd be another $500 million.
So I guess the question is, if that's 14% – 15% on the market cap, how do you evaluate the timing? I guess you laid out
the buyback, but the timing of increasing leverage and how do you evaluate M&A versus a peer exchange, special
dividend or increasing the buyback?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: So, Mike why don't you start with sort of the timing of the buyback, and just let's
dispense with that first and then I'll try to address some of the – what the other opportunities might be in terms of other
capital deployment possibilities.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Sure. I mean, as I mentioned on the call, we do expect to complete the buyback in 2012
the $550 million is 8% of our market cap. And yes, we agree with you that with our target leverage ratio, your math is
pretty good that there is about $1 billion of capacity. And as I mentioned – we would be buying back those shares, the
cash that we generate this year beyond the dividend that we pay out.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Right. And I think Rich to add to that obviously as you point out, we're also in a
position not only to do the buyback and maintain what we think is a healthy dividend, but we're also in a position to
grow the company through strategic M&A. Now, I don't say that to startle everyone, as I've said publicly, I don't think
that – it's obviously not as easy to get these mega cross border mergers done as the industry may have thought a few
years ago.
And, if we all look back on 2011, I think everyone is going to say – well, much anticipated consolidation was met with
much unanticipated resistance, but I think as you correctly point out, given how strong we ended up 2011 on the
balance sheet side, there is a lot more we can do than simply the stated share repurchase program. And we'll be as
transparent as ever about what some of those other options are as they are presented to us.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Okay. Thank you.

And, the next question will come from the line of Niamh Alexander.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the heads up on the
additional detail regarding April and you're already signaling to us that the expenses should be lower in 2012, but the
operating environment is still very difficult. And do you think you can actually grow your earnings without an
improvement, because I'm just concerned about the impact of the deleveraging in Europe and even the number of
terminals are coming down. Help me understand where you can drive the growth.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: I am sorry. I mean, one of the things just so we get the message clear is, we don't really
want to be focusing on the next quarter or the quarter after that. So we agree the current operating environment just like
that, with difficult low volatility. I think the message of our slide and that's why our focus is on two years is, as Duncan
indicated, sort of in a normal operating environment.
We can look at that $248 million and there are several levers. We have significant growth initiatives that are either in a
loss making mode that we think will be making money as well as, new initiatives, the clearing. We definitely believe as
we did this year that we can reduce costs year-over-year and of course we have accretive opportunities do deploy our
capital. So we're focusing on those things, we're not focusing on January's volumes were lower than last year. We don't
believe at this stage that there's any indication of what January 2013 will be, et cetera.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes. And I think that's what we also tried to focus on, on slide nine, because we know
there were plenty of uncertainties in terms of some macro clouds already and now for the whole industry that's a bit
compounded by this low volume, low volatility environment that we've started the year off on. It's hard for us to
imagine that that situation would worsen. We do remind everybody that a healthy chunk I think more than half at this
point of our revenue, you could argue is not transaction related and we think there is a lot of other opportunities.
Having said that, we're not delusional; the near-term operating environment's looking pretty muted.
I can't predict what the catalyst will be, but it's hard to imagine that these clouds of macro uncertainty won't start the
part pretty soon here.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Thanks, Niamh.

And the next question comes from the line of [ph] Rob Rachel (48:38), CLSA.
<Q>: Hi, good mornings guys.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning.
<Q>: So, you guys posted I guess a 29% pre-tax margin this quarter, with that included debt expense, which is about at
least 10% below your closest peers. So my question is how can you guys guide to flat expenses when the pre-tax
margin is so far below the peer level?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: This is Mike again. So I mean for the fourth quarter, our margins were 34%, our
operating margins, for the year as I mentioned for 2011, we – our margins improved 5 percentage points to 38%. We do
agree that there is – we should continue to focus on margins that said, you do need to look at our business is not that
comparable to all of our peers in the sense that we have a growing technology business that as we mentioned we'd be
very pleased with 25% or 30% margin for that business. You have a little bit of mix issue there as well.
And when we have a number of growth investments we've made; I mentioned Liffe US is a sizable loss position that
isn't obviously our desired end result. So we think we – I hear what you're suggesting from the last time I looked at it

we were I think the only exchange that's actually year-on-year bringing cost down and are guiding for lower cost
year-over-year. So I think we've done a decent job historically on cost and we sort of understand that margin
improvement is a priority.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes. And we understand the benchmarking analysis we do it ourselves. I think some of
it's attributable to the portfolio mix and I think what we're not going to do is overreact in the near-term and shutdown
some initiatives that are still in investment mode right now and give up prematurely. At the same time, as we hopefully
outlined in our remarks, we'll continue to be vigilant.
We think there is a number of investments that we've made and we're not alone in this with it – maybe have not
materialized I think you can't be too wet for them, you have to be disciplined on those. And then there is also a number
of other investments I don't think affect the margin but minority investments that were sort of in vogue in the industry a
few years ago that in some instances you have difficulty confirming the initial hypothesis. So I think you'll see us
continue to do things there that hopefully will free up more capital for investment and more profitable endeavors.
<Q>: Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Thank you, Rob.

And the next question will come from the line of Roger Freeman, Barclays Capital.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hi, good morning. By the way, one silver lining of the beer marketing guys is
something you get to keep your management team in place that you've assembled there, so. I guess my question would
be around the catch up that we see here, it sounds like CapEx came in a bit lower last year I was surprised it's going to
hold; technology deals from customers some were put on hold pending the merger outcome. A lot of senior
management time and resources were putting on the deal that are freed up now. So was just trying to think about what
kind of sort of near term pickup and pooling some of the things that you can execute quickly on?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Right. So I'll start with that and then maybe Larry can add to some of that as well. I
think that – we did manage that post the data center build we thought maintenance level CapEx would come down to a
number south of $200 million and I think it did. I think you're right, Roger I think it would have been a little higher last
year if we had continued to invest in the completion of the build out LiffeClear. I still think it would have been under
$200 million but it would have been a little bit higher. So I think we're trying to reflect that as we sort of look at what
the CapEx for 2012 looks like.
I do honestly believe having stayed very close to some of the big banking customers in terms of their needs to reinvent
their business, that in fairness to them, as they were thinking about a big outsourcing decision in 2011 and looking at us
and saying, okay, I understand the value proposition. Can you tell me with certainty where your data centers and where
your hubs are going to be in 2012 and beyond; I think it would have been disingenuous of us to represent that, that was
a certainty given what was going on with the merger, the various technology platform discussions that were being held.
So I think it was an easy decision for them to put off for the time being, and I think we now need to revisit with them
and I think that's one of the reasons among several that we think the technology business – double-digit revenue growth
is pretty easily achieved in 2012, as far as we can tell, given that we know some of those decisions were put on hold.
And lastly, as I've said to some of you before, yes this was certainly a drain on a few of us; a few of us were back and
forth to Europe quite a bit. At the same time, our strategy was to involve as few people as possible in executing the
merger and what I mean by that is my philosophy was to take a meaningful percentage of a handful of people's time
instead of a very small percentage of a lot of peoples' time. So I think people like Mike and Larry have been able to
stay very focused on the task in hand which is why we feel better about going into 2012.
So I do think you're right. There are a lot of near-term opportunities whether it's around clearing or the technology
business or just a return rigor on capital deployment which we obviously largely put on hold last year even though we

were generating a ton of free cash flow, that I think get us pretty excited about 2012.
Lastly, I share your excitement and keeping the team together that is one of the side benefits and we had a team led by
Larry that has been focusing on what would happen if the merger weren't approved, and that's why I think we've been
able to be a week after prohibition, able to give you guys as much information as we've given on the call this morning.
Leibo you want to add anything for that on the last part of that?
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Actually pretty well said. The only thing I would say is that I wouldn't expect other
than on the clearing side that we postponed other expenses. So there shouldn't be expense – it's not that our expenses
are artificiality low because of the merger, it's really just a clearing project, which we should be able to give you a little
bit more clarity on as a separate item anyway.

And the next question will come from the line of Alex Kramm, UBS.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning, Alex.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Just coming back to that last point on clearing, I'm hoping that you could talk about that a little
bit more. You said a little bit about it in your prepared remarks, but obviously you're now back to building this out
yourself; but you also said in particular on the cash side and I think there was new, that you're evaluating other
alternatives and obviously, there are a lot of clearinghouses out there, independent ones, so maybe you can talk about
that?
And then on the derivatives side, obviously during the whole process with DB1, you even talked about LCH a little bit.
So, I know you can't be too specific, but is that something that could still make sense given also the regulatory form.
And then just lastly, sorry to drag it out, but you obviously worked very closely with DB1 in the process and you're
very excited about the capital efficiencies and so forth. Are there things that you can do with DB1 going forward? I
know that you have a good relationship – a better relationship with them that could accelerate growth areas? Thanks.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Sure, so we'll decide after the call whether Alex just violated the one question rule, but
we'll call that a four-part one question that had four parts.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: It's one question.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: That's okay. We count it as one question. So firstly on the derivatives side, I think
remember as far as we got with LiffeClear, it was really everything but the – some of the treasury and risk management
function. So a big a part of that build out was already done for our derivatives business. So I don't think it's – I don't
think it's a big lift from here and I take full responsibility for having put that project on hold in 2011. Some of our best
people are already reengaged. They have been for a few weeks now, and off they go. So, I think we'll be able to give, as
Larry said a lot more clarity on some of the milestones for that – the timing of all that et cetera.
On the cash side, as we've said before, I don't think it's nearly as strategic, but that doesn't mean it's not important
commercially to us. Those of you who have been with us for a while will remember that going back a few years ago,
the cost of those services provided to us were quite high, which meant it was quite high for our customers, because it
was a just pass-through.

So while we've reduced those costs significantly the last couple of years, I do believe that they are still priced – our
provider still prices them above the market. And I think we have some work to do there to either strike a commercially
viable agreement with them or think about other options there.
As far as LCH goes, I think it's fair to say, we'd obviously be very interested in what happens with that asset. We own
nearly 10% of the company. We have a board seat and we're the enterprise's largest customer. We think that the
company has a great deal of potential under Ian Axe's leadership. I think he has been doing a great job since he got in
there, but whether it's LCH or the alliances you referred to with DB1; I think given the shifting landscape and the
clients' need for capital efficiency, I think it would be foolish for us not to consider any and all-go forward alliances
that might make sense between – various exchanges and clearing organizations.
.Ultimately it has to be all about the customer, and if there at things we could all do together to provide some of those
capital efficiencies that people may not be able to do individually, we should certainly consider that. I think the alliance
we've with DTC and NYPC is a great example of that. That was pretty much unprecedented, and I think that puts us in
position to provide capital efficiency that neither we nor DTC could do alone. So hopefully that gets at most of your
question, Alex.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Yes. Thank you very much.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Thank you. All right. Stephen you want to take one more and then we got to get down
to the next one. What do you think?
<A - Stephen C. Davidson>: Sure. We'll take two more and then we'll...
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Stephen is telling me we're going to take two more. So I guess we're going to take two
more. All right.

And the next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy, Raymond James.
<Q - Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy>: Hey. Good morning guys.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning.
<Q - Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy>: I wanted to ask a question about the regulatory environment in Europe and maybe
another two part one question, testing; apologies to Alex, for stealing his method. So with the, the financial transaction
tax that Sarkozy wants to apply in France it might be more of a stamp duty type tax than a financial transaction tax.
What exactly did you mean by a muted impact? I guess there I am trying to get to what sort of impact do you think
you'd see a market share potential opportunity for regulatory arbitrage, et cetera.
And then the second part would be with such a negative regulatory environment overall, to what extent, are you
worried that maybe a year or two down the line MiFiD 2 or MIR or some other construct that Europe might try to blow
up the vertical clearing model?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: All right. So maybe we should have taken zero more questions; I'm not sure. So let me
go over the FTT first, and so let me just be clear about what I said. When this was first floated as much as a year ago, I
think it was a lot more draconian than it's sort of evolved to. I think common sense has prevailed, and people realized
that policymakers in Europe I think have come to realize that while it sounds good on paper, when you get down to the
details and talk about how to implement it, you realize that if it's not implemented broadly and pretty consistently, it
gets challenging at best and I think policymakers also realize that it's not that hard for a lot of the volume to migrate
across border now.
So I think what we were trying to say in our remarks and look I want to reiterate this is a populist enough issue that we
should all expect it to stay in the press for their foreseeable future. But I think if you listen to the news coming out of

Europe of late, these proposals are sort of evolving to stamp duty proposals.
So, sort of a fraction of an amount that we've lived with another jurisdictions around the world before, we do think the
latest proposals are at least a little more sensible because they're limited in scope, they're not as dramatic in terms of
cost as they originally proposed ones were – and if you exempt the things we'd be most worried about are we just don't
want it to affect price discovery and liquidity and obviously if you exempt liquidity providers and market makers,
which we imagine will be a pretty broad definition, hopefully it's easy for everyone to see why we'd be more optimistic
that it's a fairly muted impact on the business.
So that's a long winded answer to a long question. And we also think if they apply it, it'll apply to MTFs and
exchanges. So I don't think there is as much opportunity for regulatory arbitrage as there was talked about a few months
ago.
The second part of your question I think bears watching, I think we're going to have to stay very close to that, I think if
we have any learnings from the recent experience we had in Europe is that they – the policymakers there are bound and
determined to push some of these regulations through and I think we will keep a very close eye on where that goes.
Certainly in the cash business I think we think that the silo has already more or less been broken and where it goes from
here in the derivatives market remains to be seen. As we've mentioned on this call and on to some of you before, I think
everyone should tread carefully because I don't get the sense that there is similar momentum for such change in North
America, South America or Asia nor do I think there will be in the near-term.
<Q - Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy>: Great, thank you.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Okay. Are we okay, because that count as two questions.

All right. Now, with that guys, I promise, if we didn't get to you, Mike and Stephen and the team will be available
today. We thank you for your patience, not only on the call, but really the last year. It was an exciting year for us; I
don't regret what we tried to do for a second and we go onwards and upwards from here. And we appreciate the
opportunity to share some of our thoughts in the near-term here and we look forward to seeing everybody at Investor
Day on April 2. Thanks a lot.
