Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Rob.
Four years ago this month we embarked on our strategy to deliver end-to-end solutions to our customers with a scalable
design point. Since then we have made great strides in executing this strategy and continue to add to our capabilities. In
the third quarter, our Enterprise Solutions & Services business revenue was $4.8 billion up 3%, led by 11% growth in
our Servers & Networking business. These businesses, which were about $14 billion in FY 2008, are now at an annual
run rate approaching $20 billion. Year-to-date they are up 4% and have generated more than 50% of our non-GAAP
gross margin over that period of time.
Year-to-date we have added AppAssure, SonicWALL, Wyse, Make, Clerity and Quest bringing enhanced capabilities
to a portfolio of software and services that address many of our customers' most pressing needs including security,
cloud, data backup and protection, systems management and application modernization. Specifically the addition of
Quest Software during the quarter provides us with a foundational asset for our software business, which will
contribute to a higher mix of solutions with more predictable revenue and margin streams.
While there is no question that we are in a challenging global IT demand environment, especially in the core PC
business, we are fully committed to our strategy. We continue to make key investments to drive our transformation and
we are seeing important progress in building a strong enterprise franchise as we move through the year.
Moving to the quarter, we delivered revenue of $13.7 billion, down 11% and at the low end of the revenue range we
provided in August. I will refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward. Our gross margin was 22%, down 60
basis points sequentially. As a reminder gross margins in the second quarter benefited from approximately $70 million
or 50 basis points, primarily resulting from a vendor settlement. When you normalize for this benefit the mix to ES&S
is helping stabilize margins as we see incremental margin pressure in our client business.
We continue to be disciplined in managing our discretionary spend. OpEx dollars were down $20 million sequentially
to 15.5% of revenue as we absorbed about $60 million of OpEx associated with Quest and another $90 million of
strategic spend in R&D associated with recent acquisitions and organic investments.
Operating income was $886 million or 6.5% of revenue. Earnings per share of $0.39 declined 28%. We generated
strong cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion with an ending cash and investment balance of $14.2 billion. Our cash
conversion cycle of negative 32 days improved two days sequentially driven by better inventory and receivables
management.
Our cash flow will continue to benefit from the changes in our business model as we migrate to more software and
services-based solutions. With our solid cash flow and commitment to a strong balance sheet, we have invested $4.7
billion this year to acquire new capabilities and intellectual property. We paid out a $139 million dividend distribution
in the third quarter and including our stock repurchase program we've returned almost $900 million to shareholders
year-to-date.
Turning to our lines of business, our Servers & Networking business grew 11% representing the 12th consecutive
quarter of growth. Servers increased 4% driven by strong growth in our hyper-scale data center solutions business and

continued traction with our 12th generation servers. 12G servers now represent two-thirds of our server revenue at
ASPs and margins that are a premium to our previous generation servers. Collectively, our differentiated intellectual
property and solutions has resulted in a growing share position.
Our Networking business increased 40% as it continues to benefit from the 12G servers and native 10-gigabyte
Ethernet on the motherboard. During the quarter we launched our active infrastructure converged offering. This brings
together Dell hardware, software and services under a common design architecture that offers customers a robust and
easy to manage data center infrastructure for applications, virtual desktop infrastructure and cloud deployments. By
making these deployments simpler and easier to manage, we are addressing a key customer need in this growing
market opportunity.
Dell Storage was down 3% to $378 million in a challenging environment and this was below our expectations. Over the
past six months, we've introduced enhancements to the portfolio including new backup, recovery and replication
solutions, new storage compression and dedup technologies, improved Compellent management software, two new
converged data center solutions, and NAS capability on the fiber channel. We believe these enhancements position us
well when industry demand in this important business segment improves.
The services business was down 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially at $2.1 billion and 5% growth in Support &
Deployment and 16% growth in our Security business. Our services backlog increased 2% to $15.8 billion. Gross
margin percent increased sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter as we continue to improve our cost structure and
focus on higher margin areas of the services landscape.
In Apps & BPO we continue to make progress on improving profitability, which is having a short term impact on our
revenue growth. Our Dell Software business continues to introduce innovative solutions focusing on security,
applications, systems management and business intelligence. For example, we sold more SonicWALL SuperMassive
next-generation firewalls during the quarter than at any time before. With 96 cores, SuperMassive's full deep packet
inspection provides the highest level of malware detection and elimination than any firewall in the market. We also
updated our security management tool enabling the management of up to 5,000 firewalls from this single console.
Finally, Quest, vFoglight Storage 2.0 is an integrated solution that provides application to disk performance monitoring
and enables server and storage teams to jointly resolve virtualization performance issues. These all represent
competitively differentiated capabilities we did not have a year ago.
Our third-party Software & Peripheral revenue was down 11% driven by the contraction of Desktop and Mobility
products. Our Desktop and Mobility business was down 19%. Our results here were mixed. Our Desktop business held
share relative to last year while notebooks lost share and did not perform to our expectations.
We are launching new cloud-based client solutions based on our Wyse IP. Last week we unveiled the Wyse Cloud
Client Manager, which gives IT managers the ability to expand beyond the firewall to manage multiple mobile and thin
client devices regardless of the operating system. This provides customers the ability to more effectively and securely
manage BYOD implementations.
Going forward we are focused on selling client and virtualization solutions to our commercial accounts. We enhanced
our focus on our client acquisitions business including a simplified pricing strategy and we are driving more than $1
billion in cost out initiatives specific to the client business.
Now I will turn it over to Steve Felice to give an update on business segment results.
Stephen J. Felice
Thank you, Brian. Large enterprise revenue was down 8%. Enterprise Solutions & Services grew 5% including 14%
growth in Servers & Networking. Operating income was down 170 basis points sequentially to 7.8% of revenue. Here
we saw a reduction in the number of client opportunities as many large commercial customers continue to defer
purchases of discretionary IT hardware. We are seeing success in winning new business but given the long-term nature

of these opportunities they will not impact revenue in the short-term.
Our public business was down 11%. We did see the expected end of fiscal year ramp for the U.S. federal business, but
also as expected, we saw a significant contraction in spending in October. We continue to see budgetary constraints in
Western Europe government spending and global state and local government spending. But despite this we remained
disciplined as sequentially we were able to increase gross margin percent and reduce OpEx spend. Public operating
income was down 10 basis points sequentially to 9.2% of revenue.
SMB continues to be the most stable customer set for Dell as revenue declined 1%. Similar to large enterprises we saw
Enterprise Solutions & Services growth of 15% including 22% growth in services and 16% growth in Servers &
Networking. Operating income was down 110 basis points sequentially to 10.6% of revenue. This business continues to
exemplify the progress of our transformation and despite the macro backdrop we feel it's important to invest through
this macro cycle. Enterprise Solutions & Services mix has improved for six consecutive quarters with expanding
margins over that period of time.
The consumer business continues to be a challenge with revenue down 23%. The operating loss of $65 million or
minus 2.7% of revenue. Industry growth in this space continues to occur predominantly in the low value and entry level
desktop and notebooks, where we've chosen not to participate, and in tablets.
With the launch of Windows 8, we have new tablets and convertibles including the XPS 10, XPS 12 and Latitude 10. In
addition we have two touch enabled all-in-one desktops. While it's too early to share specific demand numbers, we are
encouraged by the initial customer interest in our touch enabled computing.
With that, I'll turn it back to Brian to discuss our outlook.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Steve.
Consistent with our comments last quarter and with what you are hearing from many other technology companies, we
continue to see a challenging global macroeconomic and IT spending environment which is clearly impacting our
results. We don't expect that to improve much in the fourth quarter.
For revenue, we expect sequential growth of 2% to 5%. You should also remember that last year's fourth quarter
included a 14th week.
For the full year we continue the outlook at least $1.70 in earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis, which works out to
a least $0.38 for the fourth quarter. This incorporates a one to two cent dilutive impact from the inclusion of Quest
Software for the fourth quarter. We expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 20%.
Before we take questions let me close with a couple few summary points. We are pleased with the Enterprise Solutions
& Services business. With a revenue run rate approaching $20 billion growing at roughly mid-single digits and strong
profit, this is a business where we will continue to invest and accelerate our growth.
In end user computing, we have work to do but are encouraged by early interest in our new Windows 8 touch portfolio
and the new opportunities we see in our commercial and consumer businesses. As always, we will be balancing
liquidity, profitability and growth to optimize the company for long-term success.
Now let me turn it over to Rob.
Robert L. Williams
Thanks, Brian. Just a quick reminder to limit your questions to one with one follow up. Regina, can we have the first
question?

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America.
<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Can you guys maybe walk us through the consumer business?
The operating profit there was obviously challenged this quarter and I know you guys have been more selective
recently but can you maybe give us your thoughts on restructuring that business or maybe walking away from more
business there?
And then my second question goes around the large enterprise side and what sort of margin pressure are we seeing
there on the PC business? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Scott. I will start on consumer and Steve can jump in. Clearly, in consumer, it has
been a more challenging environment. Emerging markets have slowed, they've moved to lower valued products. We
also saw in the quarter expected channel dynamics around the Windows 8 launch. I would say we are sticking to our
focus on mid to high value segments of that business and not really chasing the lower end of that space. We said last
quarter that we didn't think the consumer market would improve until after the Windows 8 launch and definitely we
have seen that.
So we are committed to the strategy here. We understand the importance of the business and the importance of scale
that comes with that. As we've talked about and Jeff Clarke talked about this summer, we continue to focus on cost
reductions that are important to stay competitive here. So maybe Steve can give a couple comments.
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Yes. I totally agree with Brian. We don't see a need to change from the strategy. We certainly
see a few things that happened in the last quarter that we don't really believe are sustainable changes. For example,
unlike some of the prior declines in the economy, we saw a bigger decline in emerging markets and that is different
from the past and China being in negative growth, India being in negative growth, Brazil being in negative growth. We
don't think that's going to stay that way. We do believe that that's relatively short term although we don't know exactly
when that's going to pull out but we do already see signs that China is doing better.
We also think that there was earnings pressure because of this transition to Windows 8. That is another thing that we
think will ease itself out but as you may recall, we thought that after – in last quarter's earnings discussion, we thought
the industry inventory was high and that would take some working out and especially that's exacerbated by Windows 8.
So we think there are some certain short-term things that will not continue. We certainly do see a challenging
environment in Europe and so we don't see that improving very much, but we are hopeful that the emerging markets
will start to show some recovery.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Scott. On the large enterprise, I would say, clearly some pressure on the client side. We
saw some nice growth in Enterprise Solutions & Services, they grew at 5%. We saw 14% growth in Servers &
Networking in that space. This is clearly a place where we are seeing commercial customers defer discretionary
spending in this sort of environment. That's clearly something that we've seen work its way through. Not clear that
there's going to be – I mean, there continues to be a big opportunity around the Windows 8, a Windows 7 refresh that's
not completed yet and that's still out there and we expect that to continue as we head into next year.
<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: On the client side, we saw in the industry, unit growth down about 9% in the commercial
space so you are just seeing some additional competitive behavior and while we are staying committed to the strategy
we're also going to defend our turf here. So I think we are in good shape with our customers and we are showing that in
cross-selling ability because we are selling a lot of Servers & Networking and services into this space. So we have a
healthy relationship with the customers and we view this more as just normal macro competitive environment.

Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, thanks. Can you comment more specifically on the drivers of the client margin pressure
overall and how we should think about that going forward? And I believe you just said that you wanted to defend your
turf or that was part of the reason why you saw some margin pressure on the client and the enterprise business, does
that signal somewhat of a change in strategy to where you are sort of drawing a line in the sand in terms of how much
market share you're willing to give up specifically in the enterprise category?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, I think we are not changing the strategy. We are focused on profit share here. There
clearly are some places where we're going to defend our turf and important parts of our business, enterprise for us is
critically important and we've shown that we can grow in that space.
When you look at client margins, one thing obviously we had the vendor settlement impact in the business that affected
the second quarter and gave us a benefit in the second quarter. That for us gives us a little bit of a challenge
quarter-on-quarter when you look at gross margins. But it is clear there has been client pricing pressure as a result of
the competitive dynamics and a weaker demand environment and that is something that we expect probably will
continue for a period here.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: I guess as a follow-up to that, can you give us an update on component pricing trends and how
you're thinking about that as we close out the year?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Components generally have been about as we expected. I mean as we teed it up coming into
the year it's basically what we've seen. We had some moderate deflation in the quarter, I would say not what would've
been historical deflation but basically what we would have expected coming in. We are expecting more or less the same
situation as we head through the fourth quarter.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit the client question. I appreciate the fact that the market
is very difficult but it's clear that you are losing overall client share and even if we back out consumer certainly on the
mobility side, you were down in the 20s on the corporate side for mobility. So it's clear that Dell is losing share.
If we think about that impact on the business, we have seen the consumer business descale as a result and you are
starting to see pressure on margins. When you lowered your guidance for this year I think that was largely a reflection
of the fact that you've descaled. Not that your gross margins have gone down but that you've descaled.
So against that backdrop, why wouldn't you tilt the balance or do something a little more radical here going forward?
And what I mean by that is why not be a little bit more aggressive and give up some gross margins to preserve volume
so you don't run that descaling risk that we're starting to see signs of or why is there not a more – a stronger focus on –
and a very deliberate and material focus on taking out costs?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, look, Toni, I think there are, I mean the effort around cost is clearly a priority for us.
We think we are in a position right now where our scale is competitive and given the size of the business but also the
higher value elements of our business, the fact that the buy we have with our supply base tends to be a higher-end buy
given our commercial mix. We think it positions us well from a scale standpoint. Clearly, were not going to go and
shift our overall strategy in this sort of an environment and we think that this is more of a short-term macroeconomic

set of dynamics that we are facing that as it works its way through, we will see PC demand improve and as it improves
you will see the scale return. So that's really how we're thinking about it.
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Yeah, and we did, Toni, we did have some good wins on longer-term client buys in the
quarter. And as I said in my comments, you won't see them in the current quarter but we had better wins than we have
seen in a while.
So I think we are starting to get some of this business back over the longer-term and the other thing I will point out is
that I will go back to the emerging markets point because that had a bigger effect than we've seen in the past and these
are areas where we have a strong position with customers and we really do believe it was more short term or I should
say macro-oriented. Whether it's short term or not depends on how they pull out of it but we did not lose customers but
we did see a big slowdown in their purchases.
We are working on a few things to get more competitive and to make things simpler for our customers. We have
introduced a dramatically simplified pricing strategy in the U.S. just in the past week or so and I think as people go on
to dell.com and look on the commercial side, you will see that where it's very easy to determine what our pricing is
across any of the businesses.
We are also aggressively continuing to work on the $1 billion cost out in the client area. We believe we're making good
progress there and that it will enable us to play in a broader range of price bands next year. So we hear you on some of
these things and we are intending to go after a broader part of the market but we want to do it under the same strategy
of being profitable and delivering value. We're not just going to go after the low price bands if we don't see a value
proposition where it's sustainable with customers.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: If I could use my follow up just to continue that discussion, if I look over the last several
quarters, last eight to ten quarters, Dell has been growing five to ten points slower than the market on the client side. So
even if client growth does return and I understand the cyclical points and pressures that the business is under, even if it
returns and it's a low single-digit business, that still suggests low single on the unit side. That still suggests if your
relative share position is going to be the same that you are going to be down in unit terms and then there may be pricing
pressure on top of that.
So how do you think about that equation going forward? Do you think that market growth will be higher or what
substantially is going to change in terms of your relative share on a go-forward basis to what we've seen over the last
five or eight quarters?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Toni, I don't think we're in a position to make a call on overall PC demand as we move
forward. I do think that the position of our business and the strength of our commercial franchise in the client space as
well as the broader portfolio, they continue to be important assets for us and they are well-positioned. We think we can,
as you know, there's a whole set of lifecycle profits that really come from having those customer relationships and the
profitability that drives across the support business and our SMB business and our financing. So, it's important that we
drive that part of our business where we can capture that value and maintain a strong share position and it really does
help the other parts of the portfolio. So that's I think what you'll see us continue to focus on.
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Yeah, if I could just add a little bit on the product side. Clearly we are starting to see a lot of
receptivity to virtualized clients and that drives a more profitable client business for us, but it also has a big drag along
effect on the enterprise. And so, with the addition of Wyse we are seeing really good progress out of that, and the
synergies it has with the rest of our business.
We also are starting to see a lot of receptivity to the way we've approached the tablet market from a commercial
perspective. I have been meeting with lots of customers who continue to say that they are needing to prioritize security
and manageability as they try to rollout tablets in their environment. Specifically, products like the Latitude 10 that has
things like security built into it with a smartcard feature and even something like a replaceable battery. These are things
that are resonating well on the commercial side.
So those opportunities are going to broaden that commercial business for us and that should help us get back to growth.

Your next question will come from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. First, a clarification. You said that as your business shifts towards software
and services it improves cash flow. You previously said that as you move away from the client business to the
enterprise business that actually could kind of hurt your cash conversion cycle. Could you just clarify that comment?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, there are big parts of the software and some elements of the services business where
it's a cash upfront business. And deferred revenue balance as you've watched it over the last several quarters has
continued to grow for us. That has obviously contributed cash flow in that model. And as that becomes bigger with
Quest and some other key assets in the portfolio, that's going to be a good thing for us.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Okay. On the enterprise side, certainly when one talks to your competitors, they are
pretty dismissive of Dell in the enterprise. You are showing some good early results. What are they missing? Where do
you think you differentiate versus traditional competitors? I know you've talked about a flatter and cheaper architecture
but maybe you could talk a little about some of the architectural approaches in markets that are a bit different from
what your traditional competitors are doing?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: We hope they continue to take that approach to not understanding what we're doing. Point out
that this is roughly a $20 billion business and growing pretty nicely. If we look at x86 servers, which are really the core
of the business for us, we have achieved leading share in North America and we were the only company among the top
three to grow in every region of the world in that space.
We are really innovating in the enterprise without having to protect a legacy of mid-range and mainframe products that
we believe that is a highly differentiated approach and the combination of what we are doing in networking, storage,
and the ability to combine those and manage those, I believe, is resonating very well with our customer. So, you saw
last quarter, Servers & Networking grew 11% year-over-year and particularly a lot of success with our 12th generation
PowerEdge which is sort of the crown jewel of the portfolio. We have beat our competitors to market and in the highest
volume category, we have really outdone our competitors here in terms of the capability of those products.
For example, we have a product right in the core of this product line that has 63% more storage capacity than our
principal competitors. So you think about applications like Hadoop, Big Data, SharePoint, Exchange, all the growth in
hosting activity and cloud activity that's going on with things like OpenStack, Dell's incredibly well positioned to serve
those customers. In fact, our DCS Server business grew 126% year-over-year, which is markedly faster than overall
market.
So I think we're very well-positioned in the enterprise and our services portfolio is very well-aligned to help customers
transition from those legacy architectures to x86.

Your next question will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah, thanks a lot. Maybe for Michael and Brian, on your analyst day, you guys were
one of the first companies to kind of put out some realistic numbers for PC growth and then you said there could be a
downside scenario of negative 5%. Does the performance in this quarter and what you're seeing into the next kind of
change that view? Does it mean that we're at the negative 5% and that's what it should be? Just is there any other

thoughts around that long-term growth rate? And should we assume that it's hitting – it is hitting that worst-case
scenario now and could be negative 5% for a long time? Any perspective? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, but I think it's a – I think you have to look at it over a longer window of time. The
reality is I mean we're in a pretty noisy market in terms of the transition of the operating system, in terms of the
inventory dynamics that are playing out there, as well as the macro. If you take a look at the industry over a longer
period of time, there still are some significant positive trends that I think bring this back and difficult in this sort of
environment to make a call around the long-term dynamics of the client business.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. And then just as a follow up, with regard to your guidance, 2% to 5% growth, it
looks like almost $500 million in revenue, I kind of get $100 million from Quest, can you just tell us where you get the
growth sequentially? Is that normal seasonality? Or is there something else that should pick up that we should key on?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, it's generally the normal seasonality and the consumer mix that you would expect to
see around the holiday season that drives fourth quarter to be bigger than the third quarter. Quest for us should be
actually more than that. It should be approaching $180 million, $200 million of sequential revenue. And then you have
the seasonal impact of the consumer business.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

Your next question will come from the line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. Just the first question is a clarification just on the gross margins, last quarter you
talked about, in your 10-Q, any potential vendor change in sales program impacting you. Was there anything that
happened this quarter that impacted your gross margins? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, nothing material, Maynard.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Okay. And then just on the storage side, I was wondering if you could just be maybe a little bit
more specific, if this is a function of the macro, something in the competitive environment, or maybe an impact from
your server improvements? And then if you could just remind us where the EMC business is now? Has that pretty
much reached levels where that won't be declining going forward? Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Storage was down 3% year-over-year, which is likely in line with market growth. We have a
number of enhancements to the portfolio, and I think another important element here is that the line that separates
servers and storage is really blurring. We have a large customer that we've now installed over a exabyte of storage in
for their cloud and it's one of the most recognized companies in the world. But that exabyte of storage is all contained
within Dell servers, so none of it shows up in our storage revenue.
And as I mentioned earlier, we have a server that has – a two-use server that supports 38 terabytes of storage. You'll
note that, that's right in the heart of the mid-range storage capacities. By the end of this month, that same server will be
available with 50 terabytes of storage. So the lines here are really blurring with converged infrastructure and our overall
Enterprise Server, Storage, Networking business is kind of growing in the mid-single digits and I think well positioned.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: And the EMC piece?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: EMC is de minimis.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, fini.

The next question will come from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask first about the public business? What are you hearing
from governments? You noted a slowdown in October in the U.S. How should we think about what the federal
government in the U.S. is doing as we move toward this fiscal cliff and just in general, I'm curious as to what – if there
has been any signs of improvement maybe in China or Europe or if it just remains relatively muted?
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Well, I think in the U.S. we are in the same position everybody else is. We are waiting for
decisions to be made and it will affect public budgets. But right now, with the uncertainty that is remaining, there's not
a lot of budget available so as soon as the September month ended and they got their approved budget spending out of
the way it shut down quite a bit. Until there is clarification it's hard to predict where that's going to go.
Western Europe, we continue to see weakness in the public sector, as you would expect with their debt crises going on
there, and that one also does not show any near-term signs of improvement. The rest of it is spotty. Asia does show
some signs of recovery, although as I pointed out earlier, it's been one of the biggest changes I think from previous
financial economic downturns is the fact that you saw BRIC countries slow down as much so while it is stabilizing and
coming back it's still below what would be a normal expected growth rate.
So I do think, again, looking at what's going on in China, for example, that we would expect that economy to return and
that we could see improvements but we're not sure exactly when.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. And then as a follow up, I'm curious from a capital structure perspective or at least
from a use of cash perspective, given the stock is under pressure after hours, obviously it's been under pressure for
quite a while, is there any thought to be more aggressive with share repurchase at these levels or how are you thinking
about the cash balance that you are holding given some of the changes I guess that have occurred in the marketplace?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Shannon, I would just reiterate what we said this summer. We are committed to deliver
– to return between 20% and 35% of our free cash flow to shareholders. We're going to be pretty disciplined about that.
We are over that on a year-to-date basis and on a rolling 12 month, a trailing 12 month basis. As you know, we did a
substantial amount of acquisitions this year, $4.7 billion and we're going to continue to manage to that in a disciplined
way.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you very much. When we look at the tablets out there and the industry looks like there's some
pretty aggressive pricing going on, not only from some of the Asia companies but some of the other ones also. Just a
question, can you make profitable money in the tablet sector and is it comparable to your PC margins or higher or
lower because the concern may be that the tablet industry may structurally need a permanent shift to lower
profitability?
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Well, our focus on tablets has primarily been in the commercial side and the feature set that is
required there matches up with a richer configuration and we do think that there is a profit stream there. It also has a
lifecycle profitability attached to it in terms of services agreements and other add-ons that we think is attractive to us.
So you know, we continue to hear a lot of noise from CIOs about having to deal with the added cost and complexity of
not having a standards-based product as a tablet. And so we are pretty encouraged by the reaction to the Latitude 10
and we do see this as a profitable product in the commercial space.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Great. And then my follow up on the stock buyback question, if you are going above that in the first
half of the year of your stock buyback and if I read the cash flow statement correctly, it looked like you did not buy

back stock this quarter. Maybe I misread that. Is it fair to say for this quarter you pretty much exhausted your capital for
your stock buyback or with the stock under pressure I guess it was a little surprising that you didn't take advantage of
that?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I would just again reiterate the commitment that we have and the fact that from a
year-to-date standpoint and we look at it over a longer period of time. Some quarters we will be above the range, some
quarters will be below. The reality is as you know we had a large acquisition in the quarter, $2.4 billion, and
year-to-date we are ahead of the commitment.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you so much for your clarity, gentlemen. I appreciate it.

The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Good afternoon. How do you gain confidence that the acquired storage businesses
aren't losing momentum given the growth rates are now closer to the market, you are no longer are taking share? And is
that where some of the $90 million of investments in acquired businesses, is that were some of that's going?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Well, look, I think there are definitely opportunities to improve some of those businesses. The
pipeline is pretty healthy when I look at the demand. What we also see is we are growing fast in the part of the product
line that has a pretty long tail of revenues. So pretty encouraged with what we see there. And we are just introducing a
whole range of new products this week, in fact, at our Dell Storage Forum in Paris. So I think we are in a reasonably
good position there. We have been adding sales capacity and investment in the sales specialists to be able to drive that
business further but it's definitely an area where we are going to be looking for higher growth rates.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: And then on gross margin, Quest should drive a nice boost sequentially. Is there any reason that
the October quarter, Brian, wasn't a trough in gross margins over the longer term? Is there any risk that PC volumes and
pricing would offset the Quest benefit?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Quest helps and clearly the faster growth on the enterprise side with higher gross margins is
a good thing that over time will continue to push gross margins up. I think in the next quarter, I'd highlight two
challenges. One is just mix as you have a bigger consumer business that typically plays out in the fourth quarter. And
there is some pricing pressure on the client business side. So we will manage through that but there are some good
macro trends that are driving margins up over time.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you. Good afternoon. Michael or Steve, I'm just trying to get a sense here in terms
of the enterprise growth. How much of that is related to customers who are new to Dell and they look to your PC
business as a loss leader? I'm just trying to understand the value of retaining the PC business longer-term if these newer
customers driving the enterprise growth aren't buying your PCs, why keep the PC business?
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Well, for several reasons. First of all, we continue to see a need with the trends in technology
to have an end to end solution. When you think about the trends going on in bring your own device and virtualized
desktops and cloud computing. All of these things leave Dell as a trusted advisor with a lot of customers to give them a
solution from end to end. We also have a nice cash business with our client business. There's a lot of benefits to it and
our commercial client business drives very healthy profitability.

On the enterprise side, you can see from the server performance that we are taking share. We are gaining new
customers. We are gaining them around the world. We are now number one in Asia and that's because we are winning
new customers in China. Michael talked about our leadership position in the U.S. In particular I talked about the strong
growth in the SMB market. We grew enterprise quite a bit there. We resonate really well with those customers and they
have a little better wherewithal to spend money right now, so I think we performed really, really well there. So this is
also, the SMB is also a customer set that does look to Dell as a trusted advisor across all the products. So we have great
cross selling opportunities in that customer set. So we think this portfolio is important.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: And then, Brian, can you give us some line of sight in terms of the incremental R&D
investments required going forward? Should we think about R&D growth being in the mid-teens year-over-year for the
next couple quarters or is there going to be an inflection point soon?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: No, it's going to continue to be a place where you'll see growth, especially around these
enterprise businesses. I think much of what we've done is incrementally invest in R&D in acquired assets and building
out the intellectual property that we've required. So that's going to continue to be very important. And as a company,
we're running at 1.8% of revenue now, significantly up from where we were even a year ago. So it's an important trend
that will continue for us where we'll be increasing R&D.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. My first question is on services. The Support business is growing nicely do to better
attach, yet if I look at infrastructure applications and BPO, it seems that, that business is growing well below market
growth rates, so I was wondering why? And what's the action plan to improve growth in those areas? And I have a
follow-up, please.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Keith, I mean you've seen, as we've talked about over the last few quarters, pretty
strong growth in terms of new signings and much of that's around IT outsourcing and Apps & BPO. What's going on in
this business is we are intentionally pruning some legacy accounts that from our standpoint aren't necessarily long-term
strategic accounts for us. That has improved profitability significantly. It's been very conscious and thoughtful and I
think you'll see, as those new signings begin to kick in over the next few quarters here, that those businesses will begin
to show some nice growth.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Well, my follow...
<A - Michael S. Dell>: That's led, by the way, to six consecutive quarters of increasing margin so...
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, it's helping services margins overall too, yeah.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Well, then my follow up, I want to say with this subject if I can is, Brian, could you give a
little more color on what the growth trajectory here in this business is? And within that context, you've been acquiring a
good deal of IP on transaction-related businesses, but is there a thought here to investing more in this business as well,
including nonorganic sources?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I think we've been – obviously as we've built out and built around the Perot platform,
we've added some things to that portfolio that are executing well. SecureWorks is a great Security Services business
that's been growing very, very well and has been a great acquisition. We've added some new intellectual property
around application modernization this year, with Make and Clerity.
So I think you'll see us try and focus on differentiated IP that we can add to the services portfolio and grow higher
margin parts of that business.

<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yeah, and Keith, whether it's in infrastructure or cloud security or Apps & BPOs, the team at
Dell Services is really focused on next gen services solutions, fill-in-the-blank as a service as an example. And so as a
result of that, they're continuing to fine tune the model to make sure that they've got the right cost structure in place and
the right people and tools and technologies in place. And so they're very comfortable with where they're positioned
right now and feel very comfortable with their pipeline. They're just doing some things that they feel are the right –
absolutely the right strategy on a go-forward basis and it's showing up in the P&L, not necessarily at the revenue line
right now.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: How long does it take to filter out the deals, Brian? I didn't hear that part. Is this another
one, two quarters? Three quarters?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think they'll continue to do it. You'll start to see the benefit of some of the signings kind of
rolling into the business as you get through next year, probably the middle of next year.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: They're being a bit more careful about how they start to book to bring those signings on, and so
again, you've got a good consistent level of signings on a trailing 12-month basis that's been consistently just below $2
billion, so that should begin to filter into the business.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: All right. Thanks, guys.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: A comment related to some customer feedback, the silver lining in a bad economic situation is
it has everybody really examine their cost structures and I feel like we're hitting an inflection point where you hear
CIOs, and I've heard many of them specifically say, I've got to get off of my proprietary environment, I've got to get off
the mainframe. These are comments we never used to hear. And we're so well positioned without having a legacy profit
stream from those proprietary environments to meet the needs of customers wanting to move and that's why we're
getting apps modernization capability, so we can help drive that transition.

Your next question will come from the line of Peter Misek with Jefferies.
<Q - Peter Misek>: Thanks, gentlemen. You exuded a lot of confidence in your commentary that this current
downturn is more of a short-term downturn. Can you give us any data points post the October close or any comfort or
color that this is short-term and this isn't a longer-term malaise? We have a double-dip recession in Europe. We have a
bit of a mess politically in Congress right now. Any kind of dynamics would be great in terms of that? And I have a
quick follow up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, can't really give you any fourth quarter color, but some of the things we talked about
clearly – and we're really talking about the client business. You see what's happened with the inventory dynamics and
you see what happens – what's happened here with the Windows 8 operating system transition. I mean those are clearly
impacts that we would see working their way through the system over the next quarter or so. So don't expect a lot of
improvement in macro-economy and probably don't expect a lot of the fundamental PC demand dynamics to improve
over the next quarter, but that will – that element will work its way through.
<Q - Peter Misek>: And as we look at – and you mentioned in your commentary as well – as you look at the
macro-environment, I'd like to understand a little bit in terms of component strategies, managing inventory, can you
give us any color on how we're looking in terms of – we know what the channel inventory is, you've enunciated that,
any ability to give us some detail on what Dell's raw material purchase commitment inventory looks like? Not
necessarily on the PC side, but more in terms of some of the other hard work. There seems to be some nice component
pricing that's coming down. I'm wondering if Dell's been able to take advantage of that? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think it's one of the strengths of our efficient supply chain and short-cycle times is getting
access to those opportunities and we've done a good job with that. As you've seen over the last quarter at least, that

The final question will come from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks for letting me on the call. Brian, a question for you just on the cost base, really.
With margins having gradually come down for multiple quarters now, at the gross and, I guess, operating level, is there
anything more radical you guys have considered? Are there any disposals you can do, small or large? Or just taking
more of a stringent view of the cost base, if this a prolonged downturn? Or if there's a sustainable pressure on margins
in the client business, so you have to be more actioned going forward? Is that under consideration? Or is it just $1
billion in the client business you've mentioned so far?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: No, look, I think we're doing a couple things. I mean clearly we've managed discretionary
spending with a specific focus on G&A over the last several quarters here, and if you look at the OpEx trend that we've
had this year, I mean it's been fairly well-managed. As in many cases, we've added a lot of investment in the key
priority areas of the business, so that will continue. We just think that's clearly something we have to do in this
environment and the right thing to do.
Jeff Clarke this summer talked about a broader $2 billion initiative. $1 billion of that is in the client space. Some of
that'll be in COGS, some of it'll be in OpEx, and then there's another billion that we're going after in other parts of the
business. So those are broad initiatives that affect the underlying structure of the business and allow us to drive
efficiency and productivity across the business. You'll see that sort of play out over the next couple years and we'll talk
more about that as it sort of works its way through the system.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: And just to be clear, Brian, none of this $2 billion potential in savings, however it might
come into the P&L has really impacted you – has really benefited you guys yet? Is that correct?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: That's generally right. I mean we've started some of the activities, but it's been more
aggressive management of discretionary spending in the short-term.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay. Thank you.
