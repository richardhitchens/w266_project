In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the
webcast will be available on our website later today.
Before we begin our comments, I would like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments
on this call include forward-looking statements. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our
press release and the presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.
On the call with me today our Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive of FCX; Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman
of the Board. We also have Red Conger with us today and Dave Thornton. I'll start by briefly summarizing our
financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be going through the slide materials to review our
recent performance and outlook. As usual, after our prepared comments we'll open the call for questions.
We're very pleased to report today fourth quarter 2010 net income attributable to common stock of $1.5 billion or $3.25
per share. That compared to net income of $971 million or $2.15 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009.
For the year 2010, FCX net income attributable to common stock totaled $4.3 billion or $9.14 per share, which
compared to $2.5 billion or $5.86 per share for the year 2009. Our quarterly results for the fourth quarter and for the
year 2010 were both new records for Freeport.
Our fourth quarter 2010 consolidated copper sales of 941 million pounds were higher than our previous estimate of 895
million pounds; but as anticipated, lower than the fourth quarter 2009 copper sales of 989 million pounds. The variance
to the October 2010 estimate primarily reflects favorable production performance in Indonesia, our South American
operations, and our Tenke Fungurume operations in Africa. The variance to 2009 primarily reflects anticipated lower
sales in North America, partly offset by a higher contribution from Indonesia.
Our fourth quarter 2010 consolidated gold sales of 590,000 ounces were slightly above our previous estimate of
585,000 ounces. And our gold sales in the year-ago period were 551,000 ounces.
Our consolidated molybdenum sales for the fourth quarter of 17 million pounds were slightly higher than our prior
estimate of 15 million pounds, primarily because of stronger demand that we're seeing in the metallurgical sector. The
consolidated molybdenum sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 were similar to the year-ago sales.
Our results include positive pricing for all of our commodities: copper, gold, and molybdenum. Our realized price for
copper in the fourth quarter was $4.18 compared with $3.20 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our realized price of gold
approximated $1,400 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with $1,115 per ounce in the fourth quarter
2009. And our realized molybdenum price of $16.60 was over 20% higher than the year-ago period.
As anticipated, our consolidated unit site production and delivery costs of $1.46 per pound in the fourth quarter were
higher than the year-ago period. Our net unit cost net of byproduct credits averaged $0.53 per pound in the fourth
quarter of 2010, which compared to $0.62 per pound in the prior-year quarter. The lower unit net cash cost in the 2010
period primarily reflect higher gold and molybdenum byproduct credits.
Operating cash flow totaled $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $6.3 billion for the year 2010. These amounts were
net of working capital requirements totaling just over $300 million in the quarter and over $800 million for the year.
Operating cash flows at these levels were significantly above our capital expenditures, which totaled $535 million in
the fourth quarter and $1.4 billion for the year.
We ended the year in a very strong financial position. Our total debt was $4.8 billion, and our consolidated cash
approximated 3.7 billion. During 2010, we repaid a total of $1.6 billion in debt.
We also are pleased to report today our preliminary estimated consolidated proven and probable reserves. These
reserves as of December 31, 2010 are estimated to total 120.5 billion pounds of copper, 35.5 million ounces of gold,
and 3.39 billion pounds of molybdenum. Net reserve additions total 20 billion pounds of copper and significant
amounts of molybdenum. Those totaled 500% of our 2010 copper production and 1,200% of our 2010 molybdenum
production.

We used our long-term price to determine our reserves of $2 per pound of copper, $7.50 for gold, and $10 per pound of
molybdenum. It's a bit higher than our last year's numbers, which were based on $1.60 per pound for copper, $5.50 per
ounce of gold, and $8 for molybdenum.
As previously reported, our Board of Directors declared a supplemental dividend, which was $1.00 per share, that was
paid on December 30th. That dividend is in addition to the regular quarterly common stock dividend of $0.50 per share.
And our Board also declared a two-for-one stock split to be effected on February 1st. The additional shares will be
issued on February 1st and will increase the number of shares outstanding to approximately 945 million from the
current level of 472 million.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be providing additional comments about our results and discuss
our outlook.
Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Good morning, everyone. It's a real pleasure to be reporting on a year in which we had such strong operating and
financial performance. We are making great progress in the restart optimization projects that we have previously talked
with you about. In aggregate, these projects are moving towards adding 500 million pounds of annual copper
production.
We're also aggressively working on identifying major growth projects. We have a very significant opportunity to create
value for our company through investing in our existing resources and reserves and create development projects and
add future cash flows.
Our reserve base allows us to do this. As Kathleen indicated, we had significant reserve additions this year, continuing
the experience that we've had in past years. And with the strong commodity prices, that is significantly enhancing our
financial and liquidity position and allowing our Board of continuing our longstanding tradition at Freeport of returning
cash to shareholders.
If you turn to slide four, these are some of the numbers that Kathleen reviewed with you, and I'd like to make just a
couple of big picture comments about these results. First of all, with copper prices in excess of $4 and many expect
them to go higher, and the market is strong globally, we are earning extraordinary margins.
Our unit cost in 2010 of $0.80, and that will increase to just over $1 next year because of mine sequencing at Grasberg
and some increased input cost. Still at those levels, given the fact that we have such strong levels of consolidated
production volumes, roughly 4 billion pounds a year, and we can see that continuing with minimal capital expenditures
going forward, at today's copper prices that generates operating cash flows in the range of $8 billion a year.
We only had $1.4 billion of CapEx this past year. Our estimate for next year is $2.5 billion. We want to spend more
capital as we advance our growth projects. And we do have a very attractive opportunity to grow internally, which we
want to pursue aggressively.
So the big picture when you look at these numbers, our reserve base, our plans is we have a company that has the
opportunity to grow in markets that are favorable and look to be favorable for the future, and at the same time earn
excess cash, which gives our Board the opportunity of providing those kinds of returns to shareholders.
On page five, we show the details of our unit production costs for the fourth quarter of 2010. You can see that we do
have impacts of higher input costs, which are rising but not to the levels of where they were prior to the financial
downturn in 2008. And yet copper prices are stronger, so our margins are growing.
You can see just how strong this PT-FI asset at Grasberg is in Indonesia. With a quarter in which we had good gold
production, not our highest, not the strongest quarter that we've had by any shot, there we ended up with net unit cost of
$0.91, so we sold almost 300 million pounds of copper there at a price of $4 and a net credit of almost $1 a pound. It's a
great asset. But we have a set of great assets. It gives us a range of production in North America, South America, and
you can see Africa is meeting its design capacity for copper. And all together, we end up with the consolidated unit cost

of $0.53 for the fourth quarter.
In terms of markets, China continues to be strong. The news out of China this morning is that their economy is growing
at a stronger rate than it has been. The market is concerned that that's going to lead to steps to control that growth.
China has had a great run now of being able to have very significant growth and to manage that growth in a way that it
doesn't create the kinds of ups and downs that you see in a lot of other economic situations historically. But China's
internal economy is growing. The world's economy overall is improving.
As we talk to our customers in North America, and we supply almost half of the copper rod to the North American
market, we see sectors of the U.S. economy responding favorably. Of course, anyone involved in either residential or
commercial real estate continues to see weakness. But in the export economies, the manufacturing economies, the
automobile business here, we're seeing positive developments. Northern Europe is strong. And so we add to the fact of
the continued strength in China and the emerging markets sectors in the U.S. and North America of improvement, and
that has added up to a copper market that's very tight globally and a positive outlook for those marketplaces.
We benefit from the high gold prices. Molybdenum prices have come off their lows, and they're at levels today that our
world leading molybdenum business is a significant contributor to our company's profitability and growth opportunity.
At Freeport, we have just a very straightforward operating strategy. We focus on safety. Our business is inherently
dangerous. And whenever we talk about our operations to our people, we talk about safety first, and then we talk about
maximizing production volumes and controlling cost. It's that simple. Execution is what drives it, and we've had a
history of executing very well, and we're very proud of our operating teams for doing that.
Then in terms of building values for our shareholders, we start with this large mineral resource base that we have
associated with our existing mines. We do greenfield exploration. And success there would be incremental to this, but
we don't depend on acquisitions or success in our greenfield projects to look for future growth. We have that within our
set of assets, and those resources are creating additions to our proved and probable reserves, significant additions this
year. But we've had a run of years in which we have had reserve additions. And now we're working hard to convert
those reserves into development projects so that we can grow our production, create future incremental cash flows, and
provide returns to our shareholders.
Page eight details the changes in our reserves. You can see this year we added 20 billion pounds to our proved and
probable recoverable reserves that we report to the SEC. That reflects the higher copper price that we used this year,
$2.00, still much lower than current prices, of course. But that increased our reserves five times over our production to
120 billion pounds of proved and probable copper reserves, six times additions in the molybdenum reserves over our
production for the year. As you can see, if we go back a number of years, we've had increases in our reserves, and we
see within our set of assets the ability to continue that going forward.
And then beyond our proved and probable reserves is this mineralized material which will be the source of future
reserves, future production opportunities for us. We are undertaking exploration to grow those resources. To illustrate
it, we have this chart on page nine, which is a bit of apples and oranges when we add reserves to mineralized material
because the mineralized material is contained copper, not recoverable copper. But at $2.20, you can see over 1 billion
pounds of contained copper within the zones.
It's over 100 billion pounds of contained copper within areas of where we've done drilling to identify this mineralized
material. To get that to reserves, we often have to do further drilling. We have to develop mine plans, ensure we have
power, water, resources to develop it. But it's identified already. It's not something that we have to go out and, as I said,
do acquisitions or have success in greenfield projects. It's there for us.
And it's interesting to look on page 10 to see where our reserve additions are coming from. We have had significant
reserve additions in 2010 at our Cerro Verde project in Peru, which has a great development opportunity, but 80% of
our reserves came from our properties in the U.S. You have to go back many years to hear people in the industry and in
the investment community talk about the poor assets that were located in the Southwest U.S. Well, that is simply not
the case in the context of the markets that we face today. These assets contribute significant profits. They have the
opportunity for significant growth opportunities. And it's a real focus of our company as we go forward, is to identify

how to expand them and take advantage of these very large reserves and resources that we have there.
Jim Bob did a presentation in New York in November, which is on our website. And I would encourage you to go
review those slides in which he talked about our exploration from a big picture standpoint. But it's these really very
significant sulfide resources that are below the oxide deposits that the company has been mining traditionally that give
us this opportunity for growth.
So as we look forward for these expansions, we're looking at mill investments. That's significant. The mill investments
allow you to have significant recoveries and be able to produce those reserves in an economic fashion. So that's what
we're doing.
The slide is a little simple. It's not quite that bright line change between oxides and sulfides, but we have the technology
and the capability to do it, and we're committed to going forward and growing our business.
We have some detailed reports on where we stand with some of the projects that we have been pursuing. At Morenci,
we've restarted the mill. It's operating over 40,000 tons per day on its way to 50,000 tons per day. That's allowing us to
process material more efficiently than we otherwise could. We had cut our mine rate at Morenci in half at the end of
2008 and going into 2009. That was done in response to low prices at that point and driving down unit cost.
Now we're stepping it back up, and we're ramping it up to a current target of 635 metric tons. Sometimes we talk about
short tons at Morenci, but this is metric tons. And we're looking at further rate increases. We're doing this in a way and
with a view towards containing costs, but it does give us an opportunity to add volumes on an economic basis. And we
are looking at – aggressively looking at a potential investment in a major new mill to mine the sulfide ores that have
been identified and continue to be expanded.
Miami, which is a historical mining district here east of Phoenix, we have significant reclamation activities there. Now
we are doing stripping activities to allow us to mine copper as we reclaim this area. We're ramping up to 100 million
pounds per year, a relatively low-cost project. We're using some of our existing equipment. We've got reserves to allow
us to operate for a number of years. We're doing drilling there. This is a place that had historical – significant historical
production. It's also in the area where the Resolution Project is being pursued, and there are opportunities there that
we're going to see if are available to us.
At Safford, which is a relatively new mine near Morenci, we have a sulphur burner project that's progressing. And
that's going to allow our project to be more efficient, more profitable, and will be beneficial for the long term
development of that district where we have an ore body called Lone Star that has significant resources. It will be part of
our future.
In New Mexico, we're restarting the Chino mine, where we had stopped mining and ore crushing activities. This is
turning out to be a good project with the higher copper prices. Our reserves that we've identified last year of just over 1
billion pounds have grown to over 2.5 billion pounds. We're investing money. We're working towards reaching a
production level of 200 million pounds a year by 2014, and the economics of that are very attractive.
In South America, the El Abra Sulfolix project is progressing. Here's a picture where just within the last week to 10
days, we initiated the stacking of ore on the new Sulfolix system. That sulfide ore will replace the depleting oxide ore
that we've been mining and give us a long-term life from that ore – that mine. The project is 80% complete and has
gone on schedule within our capital budget. And as we've gone forward with this, one of the things we found since
completion of the merger is that there is a significantly larger sulfide resource there than we had anticipated. And so
we're looking at ways of accessing that through potentially a major mill development and working with our partner
Codelco to do that on an economic basis.
Cerro Verde in Peru, we've completed a $50 million debottleneck project. That increased our mill rate from 108,000
tons to 120,000 tons per day at a very low cash cost. This is a mine that has the capacity to be expanded significantly,
and we're working right now on plans to do that. We expect to complete a feasibility study for a major expansion
during the first half of this year and to move forward with permitting on it. The expansion itself would be for either a
doubling or tripling of the current mill throughput rate. And we are very positive about the progress that has been made

on both the feasibility study and on the important issue of identifying water resources to allow us to expand this in such
a significant way.
In Indonesia, we continue to progress the development of our underground reserves, very large, world-class, profitable
ore body for the long range because of the very significant copper reserves together with the significant gold resource
in the same ore.
Our DOZ mine, which is currently operating at an 80,000 ton per day level, is one of the world's – if not the world's
largest block caving mine. We've also begun mining the smaller Big Gossan mine that has very high grades and is
contributing to our profitability. We'll be moving to the Grasberg block cave after the depletion of the Grasberg open
pit, currently scheduled for 2016. It may be extended for a period of time. But that has very large reserves and would
allow Grasberg to continue as a major low-cost copper mine for the long-term future.
In Africa, Tenke Fungurume, we are benefiting from the fact that the mill that was designed for our initial development
project is operating significantly above capacity. It was designed for 8,000 tons per day, and has operated in the fourth
quarter at 11,000 tons per day and 10,000 tons per day for the year. Now those tonnage, when you compare it to a
Grasberg, sounds small. But the grades at Tenke Fungurume are so large, roughly 4% copper equivalent, that these
increases in capacity for the mill translate into significant volumes.
The original project was designed at 115,000 tons of copper per year, roughly 250 million pounds. You can see our
numbers. We're operating at that level in 2010. Taking advantage of this higher mill capacity, we bought some mining
equipment we're putting in place. And that will allow copper production to increase to an estimated 290 million pounds
in 2011.
We are moving forward with our expansion project. We've had a goal to double the initial project through mining
additional oxide ore. We'll be doing that in steps, and we're progressing plans to do that. We're looking to add 100
million to 200 million pounds to this roughly 300 million pounds over the next two to three years. At the same time,
we're drilling a lot of core holes, doing exploration analysis to see where the future of this goes. We continue to believe
this has the resource to allow this to be world-class mine, and that's our goal for being there.
We completed the contract review process with the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the appropriate
government officials for the different agencies. And our company has signed the amended contracts. We are awaiting
formal presidential decrees which would finalize the process. But we have a good working relationship with the
government on the project at this point and anticipate working to keep that in that status.
At Climax, Climax is we believe the world's most attractive development project in the molybdenum business. It's a
pure molybdenum mine located near Leadville, Colorado. We are advancing construction to give us the ability to make
the decision to start it up. We're spending money to – even in the winter, we've advanced construction projects. We will
continue this mine development. We'll continue mine development in 2011. It's a $700 million project with remaining
costs of $450 million. Our plans include spending 350 million in 2011. So you can see that we're going to be nearing
completion by the end of 2011.
The project has design capacity of 30 million pounds annually when it begins operation, and it has the resource to allow
us to consider really significant expansion options beyond that. We'll continue to make the decision as to when to start
hiring people to start this operation up. We're going to be in a position to do that, though, because of the money we're
spending.
Page 20 outlines the specific projects that we're working on that I mentioned earlier. It shows how they aggregate to
this 500 million pounds of additional incremental copper production. And this is just from debottlenecking, restarting
deferred operations, tweaking the business, not making major capital expenditures. But the major capital expenditures
are things that we're really focused on. Page 21 divides those projects in the two basic types. One is projects that
replace depleting ore. That includes Sulfolix at El Abra, the Grasberg underground to replace the pit there, significant
projects, very important to the future of our company.

But beyond that, we have these resource opportunities that would allow us to significantly add incremental production
to our current base levels. That includes the projects in South America, in North America, and in Africa with the Tenke
oxide project. In aggregate, that's over 1.5 billion pounds of copper annually. It involves spending capital which we're
prepared to spend, have the resources to spend over the coming years.
And then beyond that, there are other significant expansion opportunities that we are evaluating, studying. With good
copper markets, we expect to go forward with those. And that's the Tenke sulfides, other North American mill projects,
the Lone Star development. And we continue to look at resources through spending money on exploration. We're
increasing our exploration budget significantly this year to $200 million. You can see that's going to be spent globally,
really focused on our existing properties and brownfield expansions.
When we look at our 2011 outlook, we can report to you now the results of this annual process that we go through and
finalizing our budgets, which our Board will be approving at its upcoming meeting. But our current sales outlook is for
3.85 billion pounds of copper, 1.4 million ounces of gold, which reflects the sequencing at Grasberg where we'll be
mining in lower grade areas this year and moving back to higher grade areas in the future; 70 million pounds of
molybdenum. Net unit cash cost at those levels and at $15 moly and $1,350 an ounce gold of $1.10 a pound; at current
copper prices, our model would indicate $8 billion of operating cash flows with significant leverage to copper. Each
$0.10 is $300 million and $2.5 billion of capital expenditures, so very strong free cash flows.
Page 24 shows that we will be producing larger volumes as we go forward. This shows the outlook for 2011 to 2013.
The gold sales reflect the mine sequencing at Grasberg. And the molybdenum sales at this point do not include Climax.
And when we make the decision for Climax, that would be in addition to these volumes.
I mentioned these projects under evaluation to add to those volumes, and that's what our plans are. Our objectives are
further increases in Morenci and Safford; plans in the Sierrita district where we acquired the Twin Buttes ore body
that's adjacent to Sierrita looking for how to deal with that either at separate ore bodies or some kind of combined basis;
the top Climax restart, the major mill project; the major expansion at Cerro Verde; the mill project for a major
expansion El Abra; further development at the Tenke oxides; and the long-term sulfides. So these are numbers are
approved, we're going forward with. This is what we'll be working on to add to those numbers in the future.
Looking at 2011, because of mine sequencing, we'll produce higher volumes during the second half of the year than the
first half, but this gives you the quarter-by-quarter outlook for copper, gold, and molybdenum sales. And when you add
all that together, you can see how our 2011 sales by region compare with this year. You see higher volumes in North
America, South America volumes being relatively consistent, and then lower volumes in Indonesia because of this
mine sequencing issue.
That translates into unit cost by region which we show on page 28. You can see the swing is really basically at
Grasberg, and that is shown on page 29 where we have a reconciliation. It reflects 16% lower volumes of copper at
Grasberg and 26% below lower volumes of gold. And again, that's at $1,350 gold price. So the unit cost is really more
of a function of volumes. It does have some impact from higher energy costs and other input costs, but it's driven
principally by volumes.
Page 30 shows the analysis of operating cash flows and EBITDA numbers that we typically present that I referred to
earlier. At current copper prices, $8 billion of operating cash flows and with EBITDA between $11.5 billion and $12
billion at current prices. And you can see how that varies with changing prices. Sensitivity data for your use and
information is presented on slide 31.
Our current approved capital expenditures are shown on slide 32. As we go forward, we would expect these to be
adjusted upward as we deal with these projects that we are studying and have plans to pursue. We have financial
resources to do this. Our company is financially very strong at this point. You can see how our debt has been reduced
from the acquisition in 2007 to the end of 2010. Our gross debt was $4.8 billion with no really near-term required
maturities. We may have the opportunity to deal with some debt because of the call features in that debt. But net of
cash, our debt is $1 billion.

At December 31st, the transaction that was previously announced to make the investment in McMoRan Exploration
was closed. FCX purchased $500 million of McMoRan's 5.75% perpetual preferred convertible stock as part of a $900
million financing by McMoRan. It's convertible at $16 a share. McMoRan is engaged in drilling high potential wells in
the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico that's redefining really geology on the shelf and has the potential of having very
significant increases in the value of that company. And FCX now has a participation in that through this convertible
preferred stock.
Financial policy continues to be one that's focused on maintaining the balance sheet, investing in our growth projects
that we have, dealing with debt repayments when that's economic to do so. And our Board in 2010 declared a
supplemental dividend that was paid in December.
We'll have a two-for-one stock split effective the 1st of February. The current dividend is now $2.00 a share. Of course,
that will be $1.00 per share past the split on February 1st. And the Board will continue to have the opportunity to
review ways to return cash to shareholders because of the financial performance of our company.
With that, we'll be prepared to open the line for questions. We appreciate your interest in our company and look
forward to hearing your questions.

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question
comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Good morning.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Hey, Sal.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Hi, Sal.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: If I'm looking at this slide on the growth project or the production projections for Tenke or
Grasberg, you have copper going down again in 2012. Is it fair to assume that copper cost will actually even go up
further because of that?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: There is cost which is the cost that
you incur in running that operation, and then there is unit cost. And unit cost, if all costs stay the same and units are
down, then your unit costs are rising, but costs really haven't risen. It's primarily a fixed cost operation. So Sal, the unit
costs are a reflection of the units that are produced, both units of copper and gold, and then the gold price.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Okay, understood, and just one more question before I hand it over to someone. The latest merger
between Lundin and Inmet, does it change anything for you at the Tenke, your plans? And since you have now resolved
issues with the government, would you be interested in buying that portion for yourself?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: The transaction that Lundin is
pursuing is a corporate transaction involving Lundin's, and it's their own business. It does not have any impact on the
structure that we have at Tenke or has no impact on our plans at Tenke.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Great, thank you very much.

<Q - Brian Yu>: Thank you and good morning, Rich and Kathleen. My question is on the reserve additions. Could you
parse out how much of that is attributable to drilling and exploration versus the changes in your price assumptions?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: It's really a combination of the two.
It's essentially – the bulk of it is through drilling activity. And it's the transfer, as we talked about, of resources to
reserves. So we have these significant resources. We're doing work every day, all the time to qualify those resources as
reserves. And while there is some impact in going from $1.60 to $2.00, the bulk of the change has to do with the
physical activities through drilling, mine planning analysis that gets those resources into reserves.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Essentially, what we
were able to do is to move – a lot of this material was in our mineralized material previously. And so that was able to
be moved into the reserve category, which is our goal going forward, to continue to find ways to move mineralized
material into reserves. And it reflects, as Richard was talking about, several years of drilling that was done. The price
impact and the economic assumptions did allow us to move it into reserves, but it was a result of the drilling over time.
<A - James Moffett>: Let me tell you – sorry, this is Jim Bob. Let me reemphasize what both Rich and Kathleen have
said. The reason why it's a combination is if you get a chance to review my presentation in New York earlier – or last
year, we have this huge resource. If you don't have core holes that are drilled into it, it doesn't matter what the prices
are. You can't set back and say, well, we got this big resource and prices have gone up, and we'll use a $2.00 price. If
you haven't drilled the core holes and gotten the spacing, it's necessary to use definition of the proved and probable
resource going into a reserve. Then you can't add it to your reserves.
So if you just imagine a project that's got a open pit and you're seeing there and then the deepest wells that have been
drilled right below the pit level, and maybe there are one or two or three core holes that have been drilled deeper, you
might put that into mineralized material, but you can't discuss it even as a possible resource because with just one or
two or three drill holes, the spacing is just too wide.
What we've done is in all of our major projects going in, expense probably – is actually $400 million or $500 million
since the acquisition of the Phelps Dodge Company. And by getting the core holes and having the data spacing, it's
necessary to be able to find by assays. And then of course by taking the average extent of those assays, we can add
these major volumes.
I hope that gives you some idea of why we say it's a combination of the drilling. And of course once you get to drilling,
if you have the prices that you use at cutoff are $1.00, $1.60 or $2.00, that's going to have an impact on how deep you
can really take some of these pits and add these reserves that you drill out.
<Q - Brian Yu>: Okay, that's helpful.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: And Brian...
<Q - Brian Yu>: Yes?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Just one more comment along those
lines; it's not something you can really divide easily because at higher prices, your entire mine development approach
may change than it would at lower prices. So you may have a bigger footprint, a bigger processing facility. And this is
an exercise that we do for purposes of public reporting with the SEC. When we get into planning, actual development
activity, it's not targeted to a specific price. We look at an array of prices and think about how that would fit into our
portfolio, what would be an opportunity to us, and how would we manage it within our portfolio. And so it is not a
simplistic thing of looking at a price and saying that's going to drive how we decide to spend our money.
<Q - Brian Yu>: Okay, that's helpful. Can I get one more question in? With your 2011 exploration budget, it looks like
most of it's for North America and South America in terms of the incremental increases. Along those same lines, can
you give us a sense of how much of that is attributable to more of an infield drilling versus stepping out of your
existing resource base?

<A - James Moffett>: It's still targeted at brownfield projects and getting them defined, as I just described. We
obviously have some greenfield stuff that we always have out in front of the exploration program. And we've got some
very interesting greenfield projects that will be pursued. But the majority of the money, as you see, for our budget will
be a continuation of this effort to convert mineralized material around our substantial holding, and continue to add to
the reserve base vis-à-vis the techniques we just described to you.
<Q - Brian Yu>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with Credit Suisse.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. My questions relate to your project pipeline or slides 25 and
slide 21 on the slide deck. First on slide 25, of the eight or so projects that are still under evaluation, I was wondering if
you could prioritize that list, and also give us a sense as to when we should get definitive go/no-go decisions for those
projects.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Okay. It is a question, Dave, of
we're working on all of these projects. So it's in some cases different teams within our company working on them. So
it's not like we just go from one to another. But the one really to watch near term is this Cerro Verde project. We expect
to have a feasibility study during the early part of 2011, and that will lead to a permitting process. And the major
decision we're evaluating there, a lot of it driven by water resources, is whether double or triple, so that's one to watch.
At Tenke, we're doing this in steps. We have permits that allow us to expand there, so it's a different process than at
Cerro Verde. And we will be making progress on that and reporting that to you as we go along.
I'd say the next major project that will require – that we're working on, we're very encouraged by the progress we're
making and what we're seeing with it is this idea of a concentrator mill at Morenci. And that would be a significant
capital project, but a significant incremental value driver for Morenci in our North American operation.
With the Climax startup, you can see how much money we're spending. We have our plan. We're just doing it. And it's
just going to be a question of saying when do we start hiring the operators and going to work there. And that's going to
be based on our assessment of the marketplace. But we're spending money on a much more accelerated rate than we
previously planned to spend money.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay, that's helpful. And just to clarify, none of these are in the current mine plan through
2013, correct?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: That's correct.
Nothing is in our volumes or the CapEx for these projects.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay, and then my – sorry, go ahead.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Except the Climax
CapEx is there, but not the volumes.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay, okay. And then my last question, on slide 21, I was wondering if you could just divide
the bucket in terms of the $8 billion to $10 billion of CapEx between the left side of replacement and the right side of
growth projects.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: At El Abra, we're just
about finished with the sell-side spending there. On the replacement, we're going to be spending roughly $450 million
to $500 million on Grasberg development over the next several years. So the balance of what we're talking about in $8
billion to $10 billion aside from the Grasberg development of roughly $450 million to $500 million a year is coming
from the projects that Richard just talked about.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS Securities.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Good morning. I just want to follow up a little bit on Dave's question. On 21, you talked
about 850 million pounds out of South America potential new copper production annually. Is that a consolidated
number? Where I'm going with this is Cerro Verde could be doubled or tripled to make up a good portion of that. But
do we have anything in five years for potentially Candelaria or El Abra at deep? Are you thinking about that, or is that
just really Cerro Verde?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Cerro Verde and El
Abra; it's the Cerro Verde mill project that we've been talking about, and it's a potential project at El Abra for a mill.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Okay. And second question, just on 32, and we're talking about capital going forward, you
give us $1.3 billion in 2011, which it's for major projects, which I assume is $470 million for Grasberg, $350 million
for Climax, $200 million for the rest of El Abra and odds and sods. Does that mean the other $1.2 billion for all other,
is that a sustaining CapEx number going forward, up from $700 million to $800 million?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Yes, some of the
timing, Brian, of what we – we were budgeting around $900 million or $1 billion a year in CapEx, sustaining CapEx.
And some of what you're seeing in 2011 and 2012 is really from prior years. But a good number is around the $900
million or $1 billion for sustaining capital.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Yes, and part of it just this catch-up.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Right.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: The last half of '08 and through at
least half of '09, we really cut back capital. We were cannibalizing equipment, not buying spare parts. And now those
100 trucks we had parked are either cannibalized or going back to work, and now we're having some restocking coming
in on that.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Right, which is why you carried it forward for another year after that, right?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Right.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Next question, just very quickly, Grasberg taxes in the fourth quarter were down to 40%,
which is lower than the year. Is that just cleanup of truing up? And I know it varies a lot, but nothing has changed going
forward as far as the tax rate. It's just the way it worked out this quarter because that is lower than...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: No, that's strictly just the way that
we make calculations on a quarterly basis, and it's trued up every quarter and that reflects that. The tax rate is set by our
contract to work. The income tax is 35%. The withholding tax is 10%, so that has not changed.

<Q - Brian MacArthur>: And just one final question; just with gold price over there, is there anything going on at
Wabu or anything at all, any change there?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: No, there is no change at Wabu. Our
work to date does not indicate that there is a resource that warrants development from our standpoint.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Great, thank you very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: I will say, though, we do have
continued exploration drilling outside of Block A, and that work continues as well as significant exploration within
Block A.

Our next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Dahlman Rose.
<Q - Tony Rizzuto>: Hi, all. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I've got two of them actually. One is –
and thanks for all the detail on Cerro Verde. I noticed that around the holidays, there was the threat of a potential labor
action there, which is not unusual. But I was wondering if you could provide us a little bit of color behind maybe what
you guys agreed to with the labor there. And it seems to me that that was a very important component of allowing the
increased and further development there along the lines of expanding the operations.
And the second question I have is on Tenke, and that's in regards to...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Tony let's go ahead and...
<Q - Tony Rizzuto>: Tackle that one first?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Yes, let's go ahead and let Red talk
about Cerro Verde.
<Q - Tony Rizzuto>: All right.
<A - Harry Conger>: Good morning, Tony. The team there did a great job of understanding what the union's concerns
were, primarily around how we do shift change and hot changes to maximize the utilization of the equipment. We got
that resolved satisfactorily. And we're also looking into some of the details around how medical benefits are done, and
we're going to jointly look at that going forward. So good resolution there, and we continue to be pleased with the
workforce at Cerro Verde.
<Q - Tony Rizzuto>: Excellent, excellent. The second question I have...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: We do have our contract up for
renegotiation this year.
<Q - Tony Rizzuto>: Correct.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: I recall back in 2007 and prior, it
was not uncommon to have strikes at Cerro Verde for any number of reasons, some totally unrelated to our employees.
And we had plans and still have plans that allow to operate us when those strikes occur. And not all of our workers
would be subject to a union strike there.
But one of the things that has really improved is Cerro Verde's relationships with the community in Arequipa. We're
building a major water plant for them now. The community relationships are much improved, and we just don't have
the kind of issues related to work stoppages that we had going back three years ago.

<Q - Tony Rizzuto>: Excellent. The other question I have, gentlemen and lady, is on Tenke. And obviously with the
contract review process completed, I understand there's another political or another election this year, if I'm not
mistaken. I'm wondering how comfortable are you that this whole thing may not be – may be reopened again – may not
be reopened again?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: There is a Presidential election
scheduled for the end of 2011. That's a normal cycle Presidential election. There have been some changes in the
constitution there about how that election will be conducted. But we are confident that our contract now has completed
this 2.5- year-plus review process. I don't think anybody will have an appetite for opening it up.
We will be a significant taxpayer. The government will be getting after recoupment of the capital that we've invested
on their behalf in the future, there are dividends coming to them. We have a workforce that approaches 5,000 people;
80% of those are Congolese. And operations going relatively smoothly, and everybody is focused on expansion. So we
think all that adds up to giving us a lot more comfort about our relationships with the government than we've had
during the course of this contract review.
<Q - Tony Rizzuto>: Excellent. Thank you, Richard. I appreciate it and look forward to seeing the continued success
there. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Liinamaa with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Mark Liinamaa>: Good morning. I'd like to just ask about the new royalty structure that was discussed in some
articles yesterday in Chile. Is that included in your guidance? How much of a change is it, and do you expect that sort
of thing to maybe happen in Peru or elsewhere? Thanks.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Let me just say – and I'll let
Kathleen talk about the details. This is a special situation in Chile that's related to the country's recovery from the
earthquake. And it has been a matter of discussion for some time now. And there was a give and take between the
government, the administration, the parliament, and the industry to come up with a structure that would provide some
nearer term cash to the government to deal with the significant investment they're having to make from earthquake
recovery, and to do it in a way that would be acceptable to the miners there. And we are supportive of it and believe
that they can come up with that. Now Kathleen will talk about how it affects us.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: It is reflected in our
results for the year 2010. The impact of pre-minority interest was about $16 million. And it is reflected in our results
going forward, and it depends on prices and margins at each operation. But as Richard said, it is a contribution to the
recovery of Chile, and we were pleased to be a part of contributing to that effort.
And you asked also about Peru.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Peru, we have a current stabilization
agreement at Cerro Verde in connection with our expansion, which the government is very supportive and encouraging
of us expanding there. We will be talking about the possibility of a new stabilization agreement with the government at
that point.
<Q - Mark Liinamaa>: Thanks for that. And then just quickly, is there any comment you can make associated with
maybe non-Freeport investments in infrastructure in the Congo that would allow you to develop Tenke up to its full
potential? Thanks and that's it from me.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Thanks a lot, Mark. The
infrastructure development in that country is a major priority and a great need for the country. There is work being

done with the Chinese, and they're discussing issues with the Koreans and others about it. We are having discussion
with other miners there about the ultimate development of a rail connection, most logically through Angola. And that
would be done on a cooperative basis with companies and the government, and so that's something we are working on.
Power development is another factor that we're investing in significantly now. We will require further investments,
roads. So this infrastructure development issue is an important one and we will be a player in that and there will be
other players involved.
<Q - Mark Liinamaa>: Thanks, good luck with everything.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: I will say, though, we talked a lot
about this trucking issue, and it's not without its adventures. But overall, it is working very well. We're able to move
product going all the way down to Durban. And costs are up because some diesel costs are up. But overall, that system
is working well. And that will be the source of transport for the next expansion that we work on.

Our next question comes from the line of John Redstone with Desjardins.
<Q - John Redstone>: Good morning and I have two quick questions; firstly, off the top of the bat, if you could clarify
the situation regarding Climax. In another words, given where we are today, what would be the earliest stake that that
operation could be into production?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: 2012.
<Q - John Redstone>: All right. Okay, early 2012 or late 2012?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: The earliest would be early 2012.
<Q - John Redstone>: All right, okay. The other thing is on slide 31, you've outlined in great detail actually the impact
that diesel, purchased power, and currencies have on your EBITDA. And I was wondering if you had or if you were
considering taking any steps to mitigate the risk of these inputs and maybe locking prices and so forth going forward.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: No. I tell you, we look at this and we
see correlations between many of these costs and the copper prices. And philosophically, we have not hedged copper
prices with a couple of minor exceptions. And historically, we've not hedged any other costs as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.

CapEx, dividends, including extraordinaries, the potential for buybacks; and lastly M&A because it would seem that
given the consolidation happening in the copper industry, I'm just wondering what Freeport's thoughts are in terms of
the potential for M&A. And would you remain copper focused?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: In terms of priority, it's CapEx,
CapEx, CapEx, CapEx. That's our number one priority. To the extent we can identify projects that have attractive rates
of return and contribute to our growth, that's what's going to be our number one priority.
And beyond that, because we're now an investment-grade rated company with all the credit rating agencies, banks are –
can I say very amenable to talking with us about financings if we need it. We won't have any need of keeping

significant cash in the company, so that allows the Board to think about dividends and stock buybacks. That's a subject
of ongoing discussions.
With M&A activity, it's difficult and we are in the deal flow information we have. You can rest assured that bankers
present every opportunity that's available globally to us. And we have discussions and we have groups that follow
projects and so forth. It's not something I think – and my experience has been you can't plan these unless you have a
strategy of growing through acquisitions, which we do not. We have a strategy of going through internal investments.
And so potential M&A opportunities are opportunistic, and we're certainly listening to opportunities. It would have to
be something that would be attractive to us incrementally to what we're doing with our basic strategy. We would not
necessarily be limited to copper and molybdenum. And so we would be open to ideas. Our experience has been that it's
difficult to see how those work for us given our company situation and our internal investment opportunities.
<Q - Jorge Beristain>: Okay. And then just lastly, maybe you could touch upon your outlook for the copper price set.
Typically in a quarter, you talk about how you're seeing better demand from industry. Could you comment on what
you're seeing right now in terms of the end pull for copper and if you think the current copper price is fair in the context
of what you're aware of in the world?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Jorge, the copper price, and I'm
asked this all the time in the media and others, and the current copper price is what it is. It's just the result of the
marketplace at any point in time. It's affected by investment fund flows. That can affect the absolute price at any point
in time, and it affects the volatility in prices. All you know that and that's just what it is. So I don't even allow myself to
think about whether the price is fair or not. It's what it is.
We don't really have a view about predicting short-term price movements. We're not traders or hedgers. So we're
optimistic about the economics of this business longer run, and that's driven by the supply challenges that you can see.
We would like to turn the spigot on and produce more copper today, but we can't do that because of the time it takes to
drill resources, to get permits, to get water and power ,and so forth, and that's the double-edged sword. We can't turn it
on quickly. But because we can't, others can't either, and that leads to strong prices. So we're optimistic about the
future.
I don't know what short-term prices are going to be. Now in advance of each of these meetings, I have our marketing
guys around the world give me comments that they're hearing from customers. And when I get those, when I got those
for this meeting, I looked at them. I was very encouraged by what I saw, encouraged by what we're seeing in Asia. And
in the U.S. in general, it's a continuing improvement situation, same way for Northern Europe. But still, those
customers that are linked in to residential and commercial real estate have weak businesses. But others are seeing their
business is strong. They've adjusted to us. They are concerned about how copper prices – because of the working
capital implications, the potential substitution. But offsetting that substitution is new markets that are increasingly
becoming important because of the investment in energy-saving devices, the potential future of hybrid and electric cars,
the mechanization in electronics that's being put in all processes today. So fundamentally, we feel very good about the
marketplace. We feel good about 2011 and we're very positive over a longer period.
<Q - Jorge Beristain>: Great, thank you.
<A - James Moffett>: Richard, let me make a comment about our investment strategies. With the kind of cash you've
heard that we're going to be generating, assuming copper prices stay buoyant, it gives us a great opportunity to be on
the lookout for big deals. And actually, one of the things that controls our investment strategy is we're not going to get
into a situation where we take on a small deal because we've learned quickly over the last 35 years of being in the
natural resource business is small projects get smaller and big projects get bigger, so we're focused on taking the
opportunity.
And unfortunately, when you define that investment strategy, it means that there are many projects that you look at that
may have some interesting co-holes on initial drilling or additional exploration. But unless you're convinced that it's a
big opportunity, especially with the fact that we have mineralized material and our resources still are vast that we have
not exploited. As you've heard us say, we've added significant reserves since the inception of our exploration,

exploitation of these brownfield projects after the Phelps deal. We've added over 40 billion pounds of copper, over 40
billion pounds of copper, 42 billion to be exact. That's the equivalent of a Collahuasi. It's the equivalent of Ou Tonga.
So you can see why we have a great potential if we continue what has been successful. It's the great resources that we
have, and make sure we define it. The big projects are our target because that's the only thing that's going to add value
to the size of the resources that we have, and that's what you're looking for.
<Q - Jorge Beristain>: Great, thanks for the additional color.

Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.
<Q - John Tumazos>: Congratulations on $1.46 site cost. That's a big accomplishment.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Thanks, John.
<Q - John Tumazos>: How much engineering, metallurgy, geology staff do you have? The brownfield projects are
superb economically but also from a personnel standpoint because you have the whole suite of specialists at each
producing mine. Do you have the personnel to undertake even one project away from your core operations if there was
a new discovery or a new project? How much human capacity do you have? I'm sure you guys are working very hard.
<A - James Moffett>: John, this is Jim Bob. With the combination of the Freeport and Phelps Dodge human resources
when we made our deal, we have the finest and deepest bench that you can imagine. And of course, in order to do all
the things you've heard us say we're doing where we react to changes in the market conditions, we've been engaged in
trying to define these assets and make sure that everybody understands where our best opportunities are.
But there's one thing you can be assured. We suited up the finest human resource group, all the way from our mines to
our research to our financial people. This company is blessed with the best people we can possibly have. And we have
enough people with the amount of experience we have, hundreds of years of experience, most of which were spent
right here on either the Freeport or the Phelps Dodge properties. So that's not an issue that we even think about. We just
are blessed to have the human resources group that we have.
<Q - John Tumazos>: Super, thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: And one thing, John, too that we're
benefiting from is these years of experience that we have or developing new people, is they are not new now. But in
Africa, Tenke Fungurume, you see a lot of Indonesian faces. We're using people from South America for the
underground development at Grasberg. People that work with us because of the broad scope of our open-pit mining,
our underground mining, our concentrated mill processing in our SX/EW [Solution eXtraction/ElectroWinning]
operations have gotten tremendous amounts of experience. We're always looking for good people and we're filling in.
But for example, as we undertook the remaining of the Chino project with adding 500 or so people, we realigned some
responsibilities, and all of that's going very well.
<Q - John Tumazos>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research.
<Q - Charles Bradford>: Good morning. There has been a lot of talk, obviously, about the cash needs in Chile and
Peru. But what about the U.S.? There had been talk a few years ago about redoing the old Mining Act. Some of the
states where you operate are in pretty bad shape. Are you seeing any pushes locally or within the U.S. to increase taxes
or royalties or anything else?

<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: The Mining Act changes are still
being debated, and we're engaged in that through the American Mining Congress. Most of our properties in U.S. are
owned in fee, so the discussions about government royalties don't apply to many of our operations.
Here in Arizona, where the most significant of our operations are, there is a significant budget deficit, but there is a real
focus on job creation, and we meet frequently. I'm meeting with the Governor this afternoon, as a matter of fact, and
talking about this notion of our ability to invest and add significant numbers of jobs in Arizona.
So the politics are what the politics are globally, and we and the industry have to live with them. And as prices go up,
governments, employees are going to push for more. That has had an impact, as you know, in a number of operations in
seeing projects deferred as has environmental and community acceptance. So all of this adds to this issue of the supply,
supportive nature of the supply situation.
<Q - Charles Bradford>: Thank you very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Okay, Chuck.

Your next question comes from the line of Stefanie Chachra with Barclays.
<Q - Stefanie Chachra>: Hi. I just have noticed that you've done a very good job reducing debt. And I know that the
2015s are callable in April. And I was wondering if you had any color on possibly refinancing those or how you view
your capital structure.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: We haven't made a
decision. We have the ability to call those, as you mentioned. And so we'll be looking at whether to call and refinance,
repay with the cash on balance sheet. We haven't made decisions as to where we'd go, but we have opportunities that
look economically attractive.
<Q - Stefanie Chachra>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: The face interest rate on our existing
debt is substantially higher than what we could obtain with new financing in the marketplace.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew O'Connor with Harris Investments.
<Q>: Richard, Kathleen, and Jim Bob, congratulations on your progress.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Thanks, Andy.
<Q>: I simply wanted to gauge your sense of risk regarding your metal end markets today relative to say 12 to 18
months ago, and you've already spoken of this a little bit. But are you more inclined to use debt today at what are still
low interest rates to finance the company's organic growth versus say 12 to 18 months ago? So thanks for any
additional comments you have.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Clearly, I think the world is stronger
today than it was 12 or 18 months ago, I think most clearly evidenced by the improvement in the financial sector. The
banks are stronger. Pockets of growth are there. There is still risk that you read about every day, and those risks are still
there. But I think everyone will agree the world is stronger today than it was 12 or 18 months ago. And we certainly see
that for our business in terms of the fundamentals of selling copper, so it's there.

Now our situation is, we're making so much cash at these levels, the need for financing is very low. The financing is
there. As Jim Bob referred to, if an opportunistic big deal came along, we could finance that. But in terms of seeing our
capital requirements as we go forward now, we have sufficient cash to pay for those. Okay, operator?

Our final question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Jefferies & Company.
<Q - Brett Levy>: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I know that on the Alcoa call, they guided to a 2011
demand growth of about 12%. There has also been a couple of articles out there talking about certain applications
where aluminum is a substitute for copper. Whether it's your own sources or an external source, can you talk about
what you see as an absolute percentage of demand growth for copper globally from '10 to '11, and then maybe even '11
to '12? And then also talk about whether or not you think there is any significant risk of copper to aluminum
substitution.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: Copper in the developed world has
historically been the commodity that's most closely correlated to industrial production changes. So if you look in the
developed world and take your own view of GNP/IP growth, in large part you're going to see what copper demand is
going to be.
Then China, which today is between 35% and 40% of world consumption, is its own special case. And as I said, the
story today is about China's GNP growth, and they are spending tremendous amounts of money on projects that require
copper. And when you look out over future years and think about what's ahead for China in terms of its own internal
development, its demand for copper is very significant. And then the rest of the developing world and Asia and South
America adds to that.
So I would refer you to the analysts that follow this supply/demand balance. They've been right, they've been wrong.
We sell all of our product to end users. We don't sell to exchanges. We sell a very little amount to traders, and we see
demand being very strong.
<Q - Brett Levy>: Double-digit strong?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: No, not double-digit strong, but
going from the 2% to 3%, maybe to the 4% to 5% levels, which is really significant for copper considering the
challenges that the market has for supplying in place. Most people are expecting a deficit. But I've got to tell you, we
are focused on dealing with our customers and our operations. We don't see ourselves as a market gurus. There are lots
of those out there, and we read them all and think about how we plan our businesses, and that's the way we respond.
<A - James Moffett>: Richard, let me add a little color to that. I'm not a market guru. I'm not a exploration geologist,
but I'll tell you that back in 1980 when we put McMoRan and Freeport together, the conversation about replacing of
copper with aluminum reminds me of our energy policy in the United States, where people in 1950 said we were going
to become independent of OPEC oil. And 1960, 1970, 1990, 2010, we're still trying to figure out how to become
non-dependent on OPEC oil.
And back in 1980 – '81, when we considered the combination of the Magma and the Freeport companies, the big
consideration was, was fiber optics going to replace copper. And they were all the same conversations that you're
talking about right now were going on then, and yet the rest is history as to whether aluminum became – or fiber optics
became an option to using copper. But copper uses are so varied today with the third-world countries becoming as
economically improved as they are; so as I say, this conversation has been going on for 40-some years that I know of,
and it will be going on 40 years from now.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director>: With respect to aluminum, there had
been uses for aluminum that traditionally were copper uses. But at the same time, aluminum cannot compete with
copper because of its fundamental qualities in conducting electricity. There are a lot of barriers to substitution because

of the investments that are required, and there are new uses being developed for copper because of the way the world is
changing that copper is really moving. When it is replaced, it's really moving to higher uses in the economic cycle. So
it's a great commodity because it is so difficult to replace for its fundamental uses.
<A - James Moffett>: One last issue from my side; when you look at the copper and project the amount of copper
that's going to be available to the market, to the extent that has an impact on the prices, what you have to remember is
since 1980 – '81, when I started doing my research on putting the two companies together, the other issue that people
continue to misunderstand, if you go back and plot from 1980 to today, there has been a hell of a lot of more copper
used than we've found. So we haven't been replacing our reserves. We've been lucky in our place to replace our
reserves, as we've talked about earlier today. If you look at the amount of the copper that's been used versus the amount
of copper that has been found since 1980, it would overwhelm you.
