Paul M. Bisaro
Thank you, Lisa. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We were pleased to report another quarter
of solid revenue and double-digit earnings growth. Net revenues increased 25% to over $1.3 billion. Non-GAAP
earnings were up 41% to $1.42 per share. Excluding the $0.21 per share contribution from our sales of generic Lipitor,
non-GAAP earnings per share were up 20% from last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 37% to $330 million in the
quarter. We also generated strong cash flow from operations during the quarter of approximately $200 million.
We had a number of highlights in each business segment. In our Global Generics business, we announced an agreement
with Endo Pharmaceuticals to settle patent litigation related to Watson's generic version of Lidoderm. The agreement
provides a date-certain launch of September 15, 2013, pending FDA approval, and eliminates any risk involving
current, pending or future patent litigation surrounding the product.
We also launched five new products in the second quarter in the U.S. including generic Vancocin and in the third
quarter received approval for general Arthrotec earlier than expected. We expect to launch this product in the fourth
quarter.
Our international generics business experienced the strongest quarter thus far, generating over $210 million in revenue
as a result of the acquisition of Ascent and Specifar and organic growth driven by new product launches in key
markets.
In our Global Brands business, we launched Gelnique 3% and had continued strong sales of key promoted products
including Rapaflo, Generess Fe and Crinone. The Phase III U.S. trail for Esmya is ongoing, and we expect the trial to
be completed by late 2013. We also submitted the NDS for Esmya for the treatment of anemia associated with uterine
fibroids, in Canada. We licensed in Herceptin from Synthon and contributed the product to our Amgen collaboration.
This transaction demonstrates the flexibility of this partnership to make changes and to capitalize on opportunities to

develop quality assets for introduction at market formation.
Anda's relocation of its Ohio distribution facility to Mississippi is nearing completion and Anda has begun shipping
from this location. The expansion into Mississippi allows us to enhance our capabilities and service levels for our
customers.
Of course, the big news for the quarter was the April 25 announcement of our intention to acquire Actavis. There has
been a lot of activity around this and here are a few highlights.
At the announcement, Watson entered into an option to hedge the transaction at a dollar to euro strike price of $1.33.
We have been able to unwind portions of that option and enter into forward contracts to capitalize on the decline of the
euro. Todd will elaborate further on the details. However, to-date, we have saved approximately $157 million on the
cost of the deal. If the euro remains at today's levels, we could save close to $400 million in total on the transaction.
On June 22 we secured a new $1.8 billion senior unsecured term loan facility at very attractive rates. The proceeds of
this term loan will be used to fund the Actavis transaction in conjunction with the senior notes that we plan to issue
later this year at the close of the transaction.
During the quarter, we also amended a revolving credit facility, increasing the borrowing capacity by $250 million to a
total of $750 million.
As anticipated, on July 12, we announced that we received a second request from the Federal Trade Commission in
connection with Watson's pending acquisition of the Actavis Group. We're working with the FTC on the review and we
continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2012.
We are aggressively planning for the successful integration of the Actavis business. And to-date, we have held a
number of integration team planning meetings and begun to define the management of the combined business going
forwards.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd.
R. Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul. And good morning, everyone. I will now review our results on a consolidated and divisional basis.
Watson's net revenues for the second quarter were $1.355 billion, an increase of 25% over the prior year.
In our Global Generics Division, net revenues were $995 million, up 26% year-over-year, which includes sales of new
products, including the generic version of Lipitor launched late last year, the generic version of Lovenox, which was
launched in January, and the generic version of Vancocin, launched in April. The addition of Specifar and Ascent also
contributed to the year-over-year revenue growth.
Sales of extended release products were $349 million, down 8% on slightly lower sales of generic Concerta as the prior
year launch included initial customer stocking. Sales of generic Toprol XL and Micro-K also declined as a result of
competition
Sales for oral contraceptives were $94.6 million, down 1.8% compared to the prior year as competition on our base oral
contraceptive franchise was largely offset by sales of generic Seasonique.
Ex-U.S. net revenues were $210.7 million, up 77% from the second quarter of 2011. International net revenue
increased as a result of the acquisition of Specifar in May of 2011 and Ascent in January of 2012 and new product
launches in key markets.
Global Generics' adjusted gross margin was 47.6%, up 2.4 percentage points year-over-year due to higher margins on
sales of our authorized generic version of Concerta. Under our agreement with J&J, our share of profit from this
product has increased each quarter since launch. Our share of profit will increase further if a competitor enters the
market.

The increase in adjusted gross margin was partially offset by lower margins on our authorized generic version of
Lipitor.
Moving to our Global Brands Division, net revenues were $119.3 million, up 6% on higher sales of promoted products
including Rapaflo and Crinone and the addition of new products including Generess Fe, partially offset by lower sales
of Androderm as a result of the sales transition period following the launch of the two new strengths. We anticipate
Androderm sales will grow sequentially.
Global Brands' gross margin was 75.9%, down 1.9 percentage points due to a more favorable product mix in the prior
year period.
Finally, net revenues from our Anda Distribution Division were $241 million, up 37% on higher new product launches
and higher sales to certain chain customers. Anda's gross margin for the quarter was 13.7%, down 1.7 percentage points
year-over-year on the higher chain sales.
Turning now to operating expenses. Consolidated GAAP research and development for the second quarter was $79.7
million, down 1% year-over-year. For the full year, on a standalone basis, excluding any impact from the pending
acquisition of Actavis, we expect GAAP R&D spending of approximately $400 million, which includes approximately
$39 million of brand and biosimilar licensing and development cost for the rest of the year.
SG&A on a GAAP basis was $240 million, up 28% year-over-year. The trend year period includes $28 million in
acquisition costs related to the pending acquisition of Actavis. On a standalone basis, we expect SG&A for the full year
on a GAAP basis to be approximately $1 billion. This includes approximately $25 million of additional
acquisition-related SG&A costs for the rest of the year.
Amortization for the second quarter was a $105.8 million. For 2012, we expect amortization expense on a standalone
basis to be approximately $445 million. On a non-GAAP basis, our income tax rate was 36.6% in the second quarter,
up from 35.7% in the prior year period. Our income tax rate on a GAAP basis was 23.1% due to non-deductibility of
the loss from foreign exchange derivatives partially offset by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to the Ascent
acquisition.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization impairment charges and other charges detailed in Table 4 of our
press release, earnings for the second quarter were $1.42 per share, up 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings for
the second quarter include $0.21 per share contribution from generic Lipitor. For GAAP purposes, we reported a loss of
$0.49 per share for the second quarter, which includes foreign exchange hedging losses of $142.7 million. These
hedging losses relate to the Actavis acquisition, and also we recorded during the quarter a net impairment charge
related to IPR&D acquired in the Specifar acquisition of $79.7 million.
As Paul mentioned earlier, the hedging losses relate to a euro option contract that we purchased shortly after the
Actavis acquisition announcement. The option hedge was purchased at a dollar to euro strike price of $1.33 and we
have unwound €2.25 billion of that option and entered into forward contracts at an average rate of $1.26 to the euro,
translating into approximately $157 million in savings for the transaction to date.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $333 million, an increase of 37%. Cash flow from operations was
strong for the second quarter, reaching $199.7 million and cash and marketable securities were $225 million at quarter
end. We paid down $65 million in the revolving credit facility borrowings, bringing the drawn balance at quarter end to
$250 million.
Our existing capital structure will enable us to finance the acquisition of Actavis at favorable rates. As Paul mentioned,
we've secured a new $1.8 billion senior unsecured term loan facility at very attractive rates, equal to LIBOR plus an
expected margin of 150 basis points. This new five-year loan is fully pre-payable.
During the quarter, we also amended our revolving credit facility, increasing borrowing capacity by $250 million to
$750 million. Future cash flows generated from the combined business will enable us to delever quickly, as Watson has
done with acquisitions in the past.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2012 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. I'll now provide an update to our 2012 forecast. Our forecast includes certain assumptions for increased
competition on oral contraceptives and extended release products. We've also determined that a competitive entrant on
our generic Concerta in the fourth quarter of 2012 would not have any impact on our current earnings forecast,
including our ability to potentially deliver results at the high end of the range.
Product launches included in the forecast are generic versions of Actos, Xopenex and Arthrotec as well as other
undisclosed launches. Excluding the impact of Lipitor, we expect seasonality similar to last year, where the fourth
quarter will be higher than the third quarter, driven by lower sales during the summer of our methylphenidate product
and higher sales in the fourth quarter of our international business. Watson's non-GAAP earnings forecast for 2012
excludes any pre-acquisition costs or post-acquisition earnings from Actavis.
So with that, our updated forecast is as follows. Our estimate for full year net revenue remains at $5.5 billion. We
expect Global Generics revenue of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion, Global Brands net revenue of $500 million to $525
million and revenue at our Anda Distribution business of $950 million to $1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA of
$1.325 billion to $1.380 billion.
Based on our strong first half results, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.65 to $5.85 per
share.
Our record results in the first half of 2012 demonstrate our focus to continue to execute on the long-term objectives of
our company.
We do have a busy second half of 2012 ahead of us. In our Global Generics business, we expect to complete the
acquisition of Actavis and quickly integrate this asset into our company. In Global Brands, we will continue to pursue
development of new products and will focus on furthering our brands and biosimilars pipelines. And in Anda, we're
taking steps to expand this asset to best support our vision for future growth, which is in the area of specialty
distribution.
I would like to thank all of our employees around the world for their hard work in helping us achieve a very successful
first half of 2012. I look forward to the continued growth and evolution of our company in the remainder of 2012.
And with that, we'll take questions. Lisa?

<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Gregg.

hand or have to do any more work that seems to be required on that one?
And instead of asking about a Lidoderm update, let me ask about Prochieve. Any steps forward there you can share
with us? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. Well, let me start with Concerta. And we believe our application is approvable and
remains approvable based on the results of the Concerta citizens' petition. As we've said in the past, it has not been a
high priority item for us at the moment. We don't need approval until the end of 2014. And so with that, we will expect
to get the approval in due course, but we're not pushing to get that done anytime soon.
So we're pleased with the way things are looking on Concerta. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have
evaluated the situation, and of course we don't know if there will be an entrant in 2012, but if one does come, as I said
in the prepared remarks, we don't expect to have any major impact on our guidance.
Fred, I'll let you handle the...
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Sure. Thanks. On Prochieve, obviously, we're working with the Agency to
explore all the avenues for seeking approval. We've communicated I think on previous calls, as have Columbia, that
we're not going to adjudicate this publicly. We've got a good ongoing discussion with the Agency and we hope to
resolve the issue as soon as possible.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of David Amsellem from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Hey, thanks. Just a couple. Following up on Concerta, can you talk about what happens to
your royalty if there is a second entrant down the road?
And then on Lidoderm, what's your assumption regarding competition in September 2013, are you expecting that you
will be there alone or with Mylan? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure, on Concerta as we have mentioned, our royalty increases – the flow of the royalty to us
increases when a second entrant hits the market. We have not said what that number is, but it is not an insignificant
increase in royalty. That accounts for the earlier comment – or answer to Gregg's question.
Regarding Lidoderm, we believe we have maintained our exclusivity and have exclusivity, so we wouldn't expect to
see an entrant until at least six months after we launch our product in 2013. So, we wouldn't expect to see any generic
competition in 2013.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: All right. Thanks.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Two things. One, can you give us a little more color on what's happening in Europe with
respect to your business and maybe a little more broadly just as you're getting ready to acquire a business that's bigger
in Europe?
And second, can you just repeat your comments about Concerta and the revenues? Did you say they were down from
the second quarter of last year? And can you give a little more color on that? Is there any pricing issues going on? I
mean, there is nobody new, so I'm just a little curious why the numbers would be down, just given the scripts. Thanks.

<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hi, Marc, it's Siggi here. Let's start on the Concerta one. The reason is basically that we
launched Concerta in May of last year, and that's the reason – when you launch a product, you have rapid sale in that
quarter, that's why the comparison is a little down from second quarter of last year. But overall, the business is going
well. We have about 87% market share in the market. We have a good and steady supply. So, it's only due to the reason
that the product was launched last year in second quarter.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: And the price increase flowed right through just like everybody expected it?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: As we expected, the price has been as we've talked about on the price increase earlier
this year, yes.
With regard to Europe, second quarter has been quite good for us. We have been happy with our markets in Greece.
Obviously, Greece has been a challenge with regards to – there's been strikes both in pharmacies and by doctors. But as
we all know, people tend to be sick anyway, even though their doctor and pharmacists are on strike, so we have had the
good business of the local – in the local Greek market. And we continue to grow that. We have a significant number of
new launches in that market, and even though Greece is having a tough time economically, the generic penetration is
increasing and we're happy with our Greek market going forward.
UK has been good, has been delivering quite a few new launches. France, the price erosion has been bad, as I talked
about in the previous calls. We have cut down some of our portfolio because we are focused on being profitable in
France. We had eight new launches in France in the second quarter, which helped us enormously in the market.
With regard to Europe as an overall, in the combined company with Actavis going forward, we think we will be very
strong in Europe. The exposure maybe to West Europe and the euro is not that much. Pro forma, the EBITDA exposure
of the combined company in Western Europe in the markets where have the lowest price is only about 5%. But overall,
we think the market, especially in Eastern Europe, is growing well and we look forward to take on that challenge when
the transaction closes.

Your next question comes from the line of David Buck from Buckingham Research.
<Q - David George Buck>: Yes, thanks for taking the question.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, David.
<Q - David George Buck>: Hi, good morning, Paul. Just a couple of quick ones. First, can you comment on – I know
you have a generic OxyContin controlled release in the queue of filings. Can you talk a little bit about the CP from
Purdue Frederick and what you think some of the hurdles may be in terms of showing a bio-equivalence there?
Secondly, as you look to close Actavis, can you talk a little bit about your ability to settle cases that may be pending,
such as Intuniv?
And then finally, Paul, you talked about in the past, if you had not gotten the Lidoderm approval, it might be difficult to
have double-digit growth on a standalone basis. With the settlement as entered with Endo and the compensation you're
getting with free product, would you still be making that comment or do you think you have more flexibility to make
that double digit on a standalone basis in 2013? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. Well, let's start with the OxyContin issue. We did see the citizens' petition. We're
obviously looking at it, evaluating it. To-date – or at least at the moment, we don't see that as a hurdle to our existing
application. We're still waiting for the Agency to give more guidance on this. If they – frankly, they don't have to; they
can leave things as they are and we would then expect our application to proceed through the queue and be approved in
the normal course. If there is additional guidance from the Agency, of course we'll react accordingly. But right now, we
stand by our application; we believe we have an equivalent tamper-resistant product. So, we feel comfortable with that.

Regarding our ability to settle cases, certainly there is no impact on Watson's ability to settle its own litigation cases,
and Actavis as a standalone company is certainly able to settle its cases. There are, of course, provisions within the
agreement that we have to acquire the company that there has to be some limitations on things they can and cannot do.
But that is not one of the limitations. So, if an appropriate settlements were available, we would expect that Actavis
would be able to enter – would take on the opportunity to enter into them.
And your third question was about growth for 2013. I think it's important – first of all, on a standalone basis, our target
was, and we've maintained that target, of double-digit growth. I would say we feel comfortable with that still. Certainly
the way things have developed with Lidoderm, we believe that is a comfortable position for us on a standalone basis.
And I think on an overall basis, on a combined basis, we stand by our comments that we made at the time we signed the
deal with Actavis, that for 2013, on a combined basis, we would expect greater than 30% accretion to a 2013 Watson
standalone. As I've said and committed that we will give you more guidance at the time of the close of the transaction,
and hopefully we will able to also provide specific guidance on a pro forma basis for 2013 at that time.
So, we're very pleased with the way our business has been running. We watch how the Actavis business is running, and
it has been doing quite well. So overall, we couldn't be more happy with where we sit.

The next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Hi. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Tim.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Good morning, Paul. I had two questions. One is financial. It looked like your gross margins
actually were pretty strong sequentially, it was around 44%. And you stated in the press release that you benefited on
the generic side from a contractual step-up in the profit margin with Concerta. Does that step-up continue on a quarterly
basis going forward? I was just wondering about Concerta.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, our margins on our generic business are going to be flat with Q2 for the rest of the year.
We do pick up a little bit just with the fall-off of Lipitor, because those sales were declining and that was a slightly
lower margin.
On the other side is we have some slightly higher costs, manufacturing costs, some of that's driven out of Salt Lake
City because of the settlement with Endo on Lidoderm. So, we have some slightly higher manufacturing costs, but we
expect to maintain the kind of Q2 margin levels through Q3 and Q4 on the generic side, and that really drives the
consolidated margin.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Okay. And just one follow-up. I think in your Analyst Day, early this year you highlighted the fact
that you expected around a 16% decline in oral contraceptives for the year. Is that a target that you still maintain or –
because it seemed like you did slightly better in the quarter on your OC business?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, Tim, it's Siggi here, yes. There has been a competition on the oral contraceptives.
There have been approval coming through from Lupin, Glenmark, Qualitest, Sandoz, to name a few. But really the
competition hasn't been as much as we expected. There are still companies out there that are talking about a significant
number of approval of OCs, but so far this year, we have had a scattered competition on OCs. And so year-to-date, we
are a little bit better than we expected.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Siggi, is that also in part because you're able to take prices up some in that market?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: No. Really, the competition is not hard in the OC market that it doesn't allow the
opportunity for price increases. There are that many players in the market that price increases on OCs are very rare or
impossible.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple of quick ones here. Maybe first coming back to
the 2013 guidance, do you feel you need to get an approval on Lidoderm to get comfortable with that number or is the
product provided in the settlement enough to get you comfortable with that double-digit growth?
The second question, on Concerta. When you think about the dynamics of the lower royalty, if the product became – if
you get another competitor, is it possible you could actually be more profitable on Concerta if a competitor were
approved or is that not something we should be thinking about?
And then finally on Adderall, do you think you're going to be able to keep your filing with the Actavis product now
approved? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Let me start. So, I'll go backwards on this one. On the Adderall filing, we'll be speaking with
the Agency, the FTC on this. They of course have an opinion. And we will let you know where we end up. So it's a
little premature to know what's going to happen with all of our pending products.
Regarding – I'm sorry, on the guidance, you asked whether if we don't get the approval. I would say it would certainly
be a bit more challenging to achieve the double-digit growth if we don't have approval for our own product in 2013.
Certainly having it would be – make it a lot easier to get there.
And then I forget what the Concerta question was.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Concerta, could it be more profitable?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, it is possible. It would depend on the market dynamics of the product, what – the
competitor that enters, how much product they have, what the market dynamics on the pricing ultimately turn out to be.
But it's probably – I wouldn't expect it.

Ladies and gentlemen, please be reminded to limit your question to one. The next question comes from the line of Jami
Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Paul, just to follow-up on Lidoderm, I think before you had stated your confidence that
you expected an ANDA approval this summer. Is there anything that would – anything out there that you are aware of
that would prevent that from happening? What are the steps that are still in place for that ANDA approval?
And forgive me, but I will ask a second question. Paul, I think that investors clearly recognize the near-term visibility
of Watson's growth drivers, particularly with the Actavis deal, but I think many still struggle with the company's ability
to drive organic growth beyond 2015. If you could just remind us what are the key growth drivers beyond sort of the
near-term synergies from Actavis, the P4 pipeline and the U.S. generics business expansion overseas, I think that would
allay some of the concern. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. On the Lidoderm, we do expect approval, we do expect to get approval, certainly prior to
the time of the launch of the product. Predicting exactly when that's going to occur is challenging. The Agency has got
its own issues to overcome, including the lack of resources and the like. But we are working actively with them to try to
get the approval done as quickly as possible. So we still are confident that that will happen.
Regarding the longer term growth potential of the company, I've stated on a number of occasions that while we do
believe there is still a lot of growth available to Watson and its generic franchises around the world even past 2014 and

into 2015 and 2016, we also would be looking at that timeframe for larger contributions from our brand franchise. We
should see at that point some very important products coming to market, like Esmya, additional contraceptive products,
plus deploying other assets that we have, cash assets that we have, to get ourselves more product opportunities for our
brand business.
And then in 2015-2016 timeframe, we're also talking about launching biosimilars at that point. FSH should be in
certain markets around the world and potentially our first product out of the Amgen collaboration would also be hitting
around that time.
So, from my perspective, we have lots of levers to pull to get those – to get that growth. And it isn't just generics at that
point, it is brands and biosimilars certainly contributing significantly to our growth.

Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Hi, good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Good morning. Just dovetailing on Jami's
questions – it's actually a two-part question. The first one is around Herceptin. I think you've mentioned that you will
be at market formation with a Synthon product. Can you give us a little bit more granularity: when you think about
market formation, what year and what geography?
And second, would you be able to comment on the Third Circuit decision on reverse payments? Especially as it relates
to AndroGel, do you expect a third petition on AndroGel by the FTC?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: So, let me jump in on the Herceptin and the Amgen relationship. Obviously, we
were very pleased, I think both parties were pleased that collectively we could move forward, identify an asset that was
ahead of the development program that was in our hands with – between Amgen and Watson. We did an extensive
diligence, liked the quality of the product and what we believe it does is it catapults us into a position where we could
be very early in the development of the biosimilar Herceptin market outside the United States. Our plan was always to
be on time or ahead of on-time for the U.S. market. This allows us to participate very effectively in the ex-U.S.
marketplace.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And then, Ronny, I think you asked about the recent Third Circuit decision. People have called
it a split. I think I would call it more of an outlier. There has been three other circuits that have ruled appropriately on
this matter. I would expect that the FTC will try to take this up to the Supreme Court; I think that was the purpose of
shopping around and finding a circuit to actually do what the Third Circuit did for them. So, we would expect to see at
least a petition to the Supreme Court. Whether it would be the Eleventh Circuit decision around AndroGel is –
obviously there has been some speculation on that. We'll wait and see. Of course, we're actively engaged, along with
our trade association, at trying to get this thing put to bed once and for all.

<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Elliot.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Hey, Paul, how are you? First question, for Fred. I guess in just sort of thinking about full year
branded segment guidance and kind of year-to-date performance, even kind of the low end of the range would have you
generating roughly 30% incremental growth versus first half performance. I'm just sort of wondering how do you get
there, what has to happen in order to hit the low end of – at least the low end of the range there.

And then for you, Paul, bigger picture question thinking about Actavis and some of the capabilities that brings to you
longer term and in some of the alternative dosage forms, injectables and topicals, and liquids. Seems like a lot of times
what happens when a big company buys assets or capabilities in some of these areas, over the long term they go after
one or two big products but then the business just seems to kind of fall by the wayside. And if you just look at sort of
the leaders in each of those categories, injectable guys have around $1 billion in sales, and topicals can be a $200
million business or a $400 million business, and liquids maybe $200 million, I mean, that would seem to – potentially
adds a lot of long-term growth to the overall platform. And I'm just sort of wondering, what should we be thinking
about in terms of how deep you actually plan to go in some of these alternative dosage form categories. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. Fred?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Well, let me hit the brand business. I mean, I think it's a terrific question, it kind
of spotlights the three core products that are the focus of our three different sell-in groups out there.
I mean, you've got Rapaflo right now in its third year after launch that's still growing at close to a 50% year-over-year
pace. So I think that's – we're pleased with the growth pattern; it seems to be very consistently growing at somewhere
between 8% and 12% quarter-over-quarter. Generess, we're in our 15th month of launch and growing at over 500%, as
you would expect. We've passed a 1% market share in an incredibly crowded marketplace. Pretty pleased with the
growth there. In Crinone we've become largest progesterone used in infertility. Now kind of going ahead head and toe
to the injectable piece and still growing that close to 40% growth year-over-year.
So, pleased with the real movers that we have there because those are the promotional items. Sometimes we get
dragged just little bit with some of the legacy products as they decline in unit use, so we're focusing a lot of attention on
those products in the second half of the year. But we're very confident of hitting the guidance numbers that have been
laid out at the beginning of the year and reiterated today.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Elliot, on your question, I think I would start with a discussion – a quick discussion on R&D
dollar allocation. As we look forward into 2013 and 2014, one of the things we will be doing is allocating our generic
R&D dollars to the categories' development you're talking about. We do see opportunities in injectables. We do see a
large opportunity in topicals and in liquids with the assets that the Actavis acquisition brings to the combined group.
I would add that we have both been involved in inhalation development, so that's an area that we would also be
focusing R&D money on. And, of course, Watson and Actavis have both been active in the patch development area.
So, I think all of those – maybe they're alternative dosage forms, if you will, will be areas that we will focus on to help
drive growth not just in the U.S. market, but also in markets around the world. Those – we do think there is significant
opportunities that still remain within those areas for us and we will be allocating more of our R&D dollars to those
kinds of development programs.

The next question comes from the line of Michael Faerm with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I have another question on Concerta. So if and
when a competitor enters, how do you expect the market to develop with respect to share and price? And really what
I'm wondering is to what extent do you think what would otherwise be a normal market situation might be constrained
by supply constraints.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, Michael, it's Siggi here. I think the issue with Concerta is obviously what will
affect the market in the beginning is you need the DEA quota for the methylphenidate to be able to launch the product.
So, usually when you come in with a new C2 product, it's not like that the market changes overnight. It changes slowly.
And these are two player market,; the prices are more stable than when you get a lot of competition at one. So I think
overall the change in our market share and in the market share will be over time much more than quickly on day one
due to the quota issue.

And secondly, the Concerta tablets are very complex tablets to manufacture. So, you need to build up quite a lot
inventory to be able to launch into the market. I think that will also affect how the new entrants will enter the market
when the competition comes.

The next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Thanks. Thanks, Paul, you've been pretty clear – it sounds, at least, pretty clear directionally in
the long term about where you want to go with brand. And you've said in the past – and I don't want to misquote you,
that deals are done sometimes when assets are available. So, as you look at your debt paydown schedule, how soon do
you think you'd be in a position to act on a brand asset of size?
And then also if you could give a little bit of nuance on how you think the Adderall XR marketplace is going to play
out from the players that are there, and clearly trying to take into account your own filing and maybe where that filing
goes. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. As to, I would say, doing another deal of size, it will of course take us a little while to
bring our debt load down to where we feel comfortable to be able to enter into another sizable transaction. We are
benefiting, at least at the moment, from the weaker euro, as we've talked about in our prepared remarks. That is of
course helping us in the long term. We've got some great favorable rates on our term loan. And as we move into the
bond issuing issuance, a lot of that will of course help us pay down that debt faster than we had originally planned. And
that will allow us to move more quickly to deploy additional assets in other areas. So, but I do think it will take us a
little time to be in a position to do a sizable transaction. As we've discussed, it will take at least through the end of
probably 2013. It would be challenging for us to do something of significance probably in 2013.
I think you asked about the Adderall marketplace. I don't want to speculate too much on this because I'm not – it's not
quite clear what the FTC – and how we are going to work through the situation on Adderall with the FTC. So, it is a
little challenging to answer that question at the moment. It might be better to wait and see what happens with that
application, what the FTC's ultimate decision is and how we move forward with Adderall before I further comment on
the situation. Right now, of course Actavis is in a good position. From what we can see, they're doing well with the
product, and of course that's good for the combined entity.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Gary Nachman from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Hi, good morning. Paul, as you're starting with the integration meetings on Actavis, do you
still feel good about your initial synergy targets you'd laid out? Could it end up being greater than what you initially
thought? Some color on that would be helpful.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, first of all, I think we feel very comfortable with the synergy targets we laid out. I think
we should be able to achieve the synergies that we talked about, that which, as a reminder, was $300 million over three
years. We said roughly that we'd get those in roughly equal parts. I think it's possible we could achieve some of those
synergies faster than we originally expected.
The integration meetings have gone extremely well. Both sides have worked very hard and continue to work very hard
in preparation. We've got a good team in place and the – our [ph] IMO (46:42) office is in full steam and in full gear.
And I think we have already made some very significant decisions on leadership and we'll be making more of those
decisions and communicating those to our internal folks here.

So, lots of things are moving, but I do feel very comfortable on achieving that synergy target. Whether we'll be able to
achieve more, I think a lot of it will depend on the out years as we look at facilities and what those facilities – where we
need to build additional capacity and where we need to move capacity around. But certainly the $300 million is
achievable.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Okay. And then a quick one for Siggi. What are you assuming for price erosion in Europe? I
think you'd previously baked in 10% in 2012. Just an update there, if you could quantify that. Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, we've seen between 8% to 10% currently in the run rate for the year, so we're not
moving from that. We see what is helping us are the new product launches, but the underlying price erosion on the base
of business is between 8% and 10% – different between different markets, but that's the average.

The next question comes from the line of Michael Tong with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Hi, good morning. Just a quick follow-up question on Concerta. As the royalty that flows to
you, goes up, does the supply from J&J contractually go down?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, your short answer is no.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Good. And then as my follow-up, maybe this is for Todd. I see in your reconciliation table
about $101 million in a noncash impairment charge related to the Specifar acquisition, which is not an insignificant
amount relative to the purchase price. Can you provide a little bit more color as to what those charges are stemming
from, other than just in-process R&D?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Well, part of it is esomeprazole. We had much greater expectations at the time of the acquisition
for that product and we've revised our forecast down significantly on that. So the gross number was $101 million, the
net number, as I said in my prepared remarks, was closer to $80 million. And that – there was a liability that we'd also
established as part of the acquisition accounting for $20 million that would have been – this was the earn-out on
esomeprazole that would have gone its selling shareholders. So, it's roughly three significant products that have had
either development delays or changes in the marketplace that have impacted the valuation of that IPR&D, the biggest
being esomeprazole.

The next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes, hi. It's Dave Risinger from Morgan Stanley. I just was hoping that you could provide
some commentary on the outlook for your European business. So how should we think about growth going forward?
Can you talk about Nexium on the positive side, and on the negative side, potential renegotiation of Specifar contracts?
Thank you.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: David, it's Siggi here. I think the outlook for Europe for the combined company, we are
quite excited about it. We have said that for the Western European business we expect a low single digit growth in
those markets. The combined company will have a strong presence in quite a few countries, will be in the top three in
11 markets around the world, including UK, which is very good market for Actavis and we feel strongly in that market.
On the other hand, tough markets like Germany and Holland and some of the Nordic countries are tougher, but what
Actavis has there, which is growing quite well, is the OTC business.
On the other hand, when you move to Eastern Europe, there is a significant growth in Eastern Europe; both the markets
are growing, like in Russia growing – the market is growing 14% and Actavis is growing extremely well in that market.
And hopefully, we – after closing, we can explain that better to all of you how we see that down to the details.

I mentioned Greece before. The Greek market is growing. The prices are going down, but we knew that, that when the
generic penetration as it was in Greece was only 16%, to increase that significantly, the prices will go down. But we
still think the Greek market is good going forward.
With regard to esomeprazole and Nexium, there was a delay in that launch. We had hoped to launch that in third to
fourth quarter last year, and that's the reason what Todd was mentioning why we took the impairment charge. We have
now launched that product in Spain and in Switzerland and we are hoping to launch in France in – we are not hoping,
we know we will launch in France in the third quarter of this year, and then take it into other markets. The launch is
much slower due to manufacturing challenges we had. We have overcome these challenges and we are getting the
products on to the market now.
There is a still a good opportunity for this product, but maybe what changed the most was that, for example, in the
French market the esomeprazole capsules were launched, generic capsules were launched ahead of the tablets and the
capsules managed to get about 60% market share. The tablets are still the preferred dosage form, but it's a challenge to
go into the French market and the prices in the market are much lower than if you would have launched a generic
esomeprazole tablet in third quarter of last year. So, that's the main reason for the write-off, but also we think there is
still a lot of good value in that product the more markets you take it into. There are not that many that have this product
available. We still see interest in different markets. So, we definitely have not given up on esomeprazole going forward.

The next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from Canaccord Genuity.
<A - Randall S. Stanicky>: Thanks, guys. Paul, I just really had just one follow-up. If you look at the results there,
you raised guidance in the core business, you've reaffirmed your 2013 core standalone guidance, you've reaffirmed
your better than 30% accretion from Actavis. And the three big swing factors you talked about on Q1 were Adderall
XR, Lidoderm and Concerta, which we now have better visibility around, I would argue, on all three. What should we
be thinking about in terms of the bigger swing factors for 2013 with the combined business going forward?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I mean, I think it was a good summary, and I think that was exactly what we did do. And
I think for us on 2013 the other swing factor that wasn't mentioned would probably be the synergy capture, integration
and synergy capture. And of course, we don't take that lightly. We know we have to focus on integration and we have
to make sure that on a combined basis both businesses once combined continue to grow. And we are – I can assure you,
we are exercising all the efforts we possibly can to make sure that on a combined basis both businesses continue to
grow and that we hit the ground running in all of the markets around the world with clear leadership, clear commercial
decision-making, clear quality decision-making, clear manufacturing decision-making so we don't stumble out of the
blocks. So if we can execute, I think we're going to be very pleased with the results for 2013 and, of course, that will
carry us into 2014 and then beyond. So, very happy with the way things are developing. Certainly, the approval that
Actavis got on Adderall was a very nice upside, nice surprise. And we will carry that momentum into 2013 from them.
And with hopefully getting our Lidoderm approval will carry that momentum into 2013 from the Watson perspective.
Hopefully that helps
<A - Randall S. Stanicky>: Yeah, let me try and ask one more question which hopefully directionally maybe you can
help with. You talked before about the $300 million in synergies coming, I think, $100 million per year. On the call it
sounds like you're a little bit more, I'd say, optimistic on earlier capture. Are you willing to kind of – how much
optimistic – or how much more optimistic are you? And if you can help quantify what that number could be in 2013.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, I don't really – I would rather not do that at the moment. I mean, we will try to provide
additional clarity at close. Of course as every month goes by and as we understand more and more about what the
combined company is going to look like and how we will capture some of the synergies and, frankly, will we be able to
capture revenue synergies faster than we anticipate, which really aren't included in the $300 million. So a lot of that
visibility – more of that visibility will be given around close. So I think right now I'll stick with the $300 million, with
the $100 million – roughly $100 million a year. I think that's a good spot for us to be and I don't want to get beyond that

<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Obviously, in terms of your expectations for guidance – or for Actavis next year, I was
curious if you had factored in the company getting approval for Adderall XR when it did and how that might affect
your outlook.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, I would say certainly the Actavis folks believe they were going to get approval in 2012,
and in fact they did. So we have – as we built our own model of what the company looked like, we had to make some
call around that, and we did have some expectation they were going to get the approval in 2012. So things did sort of
work the way we thought they were, and so it is baked into what our projections have been.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: So that was done on some kind of weighted probability basis?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, it was.

beginning of the quarter to about a 10% market share now. As you know, we are only operating in the retail space. We
now have a good supply and steady supplies from Amphastar. And so the market has been growing. The price erosion
has been significantly more than we expected. There has been a very hefty competition in that market with [ph] the AG
(58:26) and also from Sandoz. But overall we are pleased we have seen a good growth in the quarter and we will
continue to compete in this space going forward.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Shibani Malhotra with RBC Capital.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First on Concerta, Paul, I know you said that you
believe that you have an approvable filing, et cetera, but can you just comment on the fact that the FDA did not approve
any generic at the same time as responding to the CP? And if a company – theoretically, if a company had to do the
studies required by the Agency, how long would that take? So that's one.
And then second, on Lidoderm, can you confirm that – rather, can you just talk us through why you remain confident
that you maintained first-to-file status for the product? And have you had any back and forth with the Agency since
your last update?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. On Concerta, I guess it would be – it's pure speculation on our part, but if the citizens'
petition is slightly different than what I think people might have thought the Agency was going to rule on, what you
would have to do is calculate the area under the curve statistics and see how you stack up against what the Agency
ultimately said they wanted to see for this product. That calculation work could be done reasonably quickly and filed if
the data was available. If the data wasn't available, then you'd have to either run a new study, and that could take you

several months to get the study done, get the data generated and then get it filed, and then the Agency of course would
need to review it. So that would take a significant amount of time if you didn't already have the data in a form that you
could sort of re-cut in the new form. So it would take people time to do that. Of course, in the worst case, you run the
study and you find out you don't meet the requirement so you got to reformulate. So that would be possibly the worst
possible case and that is clearly a long period of time to get to.
So again, pure speculation on our part; we just don't know. We've heard what – some people have reported that UCB
have said or [indiscernible] (1:01:01) have said, and all we can do is stay tuned and be ready to respond to the
commercial situation when it occurs.
On Lidoderm, I think our application – our situation is such that it hasn't really changed from the last time we updated
you. We believe we've maintained our exclusivity because the product was approvable in the form in time for meeting
the timeline for getting a tentative approval. The citizens' petition was the only outstanding issue. We believe that the
citizens' petition remains the only outstanding issue with respect to our application. So, from our perspective, under the
law, we have the exclusivity. And we will – we won't know with absolute uncertainty until the Agency grants our final
approval and tells us that we have the exclusivity, but right now we have no reason to believe we don't have it and so
we will defend that position.

Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the allotted time for questions. Thank you for your participation. I would now
like to turn the call over to Lisa.

Thank you for joining us today. There are still a number of questions in the queue that we didn't get to, but we look
forward to following up with you directly.
