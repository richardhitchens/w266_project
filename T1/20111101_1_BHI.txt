With that, I'll conclude our discussion of the administrative details and turn the call over to Peter Ragauss. Peter?
Peter A. Ragauss
Thank you, Adam. Good morning. This morning, we reported adjusted net income of $518 million, or $1.18 per share.
This excludes a non-cash tax benefit of $214 million associated with the reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries
related to the BJ Services integration.
You will see a corresponding decrease in the deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. This suggested net income also
excludes a loss of $26 million related to the early extinguishment of our $500 million notes that were due in 2013. On a
GAAP basis, net income attributable to Baker Hughes for the third quarter was $706 million, or $1.61 per diluted share.
Revenue was a record $5.18 billion, up 27% or $1.1 billion from last year, and up 9% or $437 million sequentially.
Adjusted EBITDA was $1.15 billion, up 62% from last year and up 13% sequentially.
To help in your understanding of the moving pieces, I'll bridge Q3 last year EPS to this quarter's EPS. GAAP EPS a
year ago was $0.59 per share. Subtract $0.06 for the early extinguishment of debt this quarter. Add $0.49 for the
non-cash tax benefit from the tax reorganization. Subtract $0.07 for higher corporate costs, net interest expense, income
taxes and a higher share count. Operations added $0.66. That brings us to $1.61 per share on a GAAP basis.
Bridging the sequential quarters, GAAP EPS for last quarter was $0.77 per share. First, add back the $0.16 impact of
the Libya reserve to our Q2 2011 results. Subtract again $0.06 for the early extinguishment of debt this quarter. Add
again $0.49 for the non-cash tax benefit from the tax reorganization. Subtract $0.04 for higher corporate costs, net
interest expense and a higher share count.
Corporate costs were up $15 million sequentially, primarily as a result of the planned SAP implementation of the
pressure pumping product line in North America. Operations added $0.23 per share. Lastly, we benefited $0.06 per
share from a more favorable tax rate this quarter. That brings us to $1.61 per share on a GAAP basis.
In Table Four of our earnings release, we provide financial information excluding the impact of the $70 million Libya
charge from the Q2 results to provide more meaningful comparisons between quarters. From this point on in the
conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin refer explicitly to Table Four.
Revenue in North America was $2.72 billion, up 35%, compared to a year ago and up 15% sequentially. North
America operating profits were $607 million, up $267 million year-over-year and up $167 million sequentially. North
American margins were 22%, up 540 basis points from a year ago and up 377 basis points, compared to the last quarter.
Q3 2011 has benefited from the seasonal recovery in Canada. The rig count was slower to ramp up, compared to prior
years due to the unusually wet weather really through the whole spring, but picked up pace through August and
averaged 441 rigs for the quarter, 23% higher than the same quarter last year. Activity in the U.S. continued to increase
with the average rig count up 20%, compared to the same quarter last year and up 7% sequentially.
Moving to the international side, international revenue was $2.13 billion, up 19%, compared to a year ago and up 4%,
compared to the prior quarter. Operating profits were $260 million, up $165 million year-on-year and down $16 million
from the prior quarter. International margins were 12.2%, up 693 basis points year-over-year and down 124 basis points
sequentially. As provided in earlier guidance, we still expect to exit the year with international margins around 15%.
Our Industrial Services and Other segment revenue was $336 million, up 21%, compared to last year and up 4%,
compared to last quarter. Operating profit was $28 million, down $8 million, compared to a year ago and down $6
million sequentially. Operating margin was 8.2%, down 216 basis points from last quarter. This was primarily driven
by an increase in cost of goods sold. We expect Q4 margins to be in line with Q3 for the Industrial and Other segment.
Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter-end, our total debt was $3.9 billion, up $292 million from the prior quarter,
reflecting the issuance of $750 million in 3.2%, 10-year notes, and the redemption of $500 million of 6.5% notes.
These 3.2% notes have the lowest 10-year yield ever issued by any company in our industry.

Our total debt-to-capital ratio was 20%. Accounts receivable grew some $540 million in the quarter and this increase
was driven by revenue growth, as well as the usual invoicing delays resulting from the implementation of SAP for our
North American pressure pumping business. We expect our accounts receivable to return to more normal levels in line
with our business growth in Q4.
Our capital expenditures were $628 million this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.65 billion. At the end of
the quarter, we had $803 million in cash and short-term investments. During the quarter, we replaced our $1.7 billion
credit facilities with a new $2.5 billion five-year facility. This new facility has no financial covenants, which is another
reflection of the strength of our balance sheet.
And finally, I'll provide you with our updated outlook for the fourth quarter of 2011. Planned interest expense to be
between $55 million and $60 million; corporate costs, between $75 million and $80 million; depreciation and
amortization expense, between $340 million and $350 million. CapEx for the quarter will be about $700 million to
$750 million, resulting in a full-year capital spend of between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion. Our tax rate is expected to
be between 32% and 33% for the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Martin.
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Peter. Good morning, everyone. This was a record-revenue quarter for Baker Hughes, provides further
confirmation that our transformation to a geomarket structure is paying dividends. Overall, we're pleased with the
results and the growth of our major businesses. We still have some challenges and efficiencies to work through with a
goal of further improving our overall margins next year to better reflect the value that our products and services provide
the industry.
I'd like to start out by providing our listeners with an update on pricing. Large international contract renewals continue
to remain highly competitive, but when you put those contracts aside, prices are increasing; albeit slowly. It is our
expectation that if commodity prices remain where they are and North America activity stays where it is, international
pricing will continue to trend higher.
As for pricing in North America, while there are certainly variations across our product lines, on the whole we're still
able to modestly grow pricing in excess of cost increases. In U.S. Land, we track the pricing on eight of our product
lines across seven principal basins. And with regards to pressure pumping, for example, in Q3 relative to Q2, two
basins had pricing trending down, two basins had pricing trending up, and three basins were unchanged. And we
believe these trends will remain the same into Q4. And as I mentioned, however, each product line is experiencing
unique pricing behaviors.
Before we move off pricing, I'd like to be clear that my commentary for both international and North America pertains
only to price improvement on like-for-like services. Given the increasing reservoir, operational and regulatory
challenges our industry faces, we will continue to high-grade the product and services mix, which in turn leads to
comparably higher prices.
Now, I'd like to discuss operating results, and I'll start with North America. In Canada, unconventionals continued to
drive our activity. While rig count was up 23% year-on-year, well count increased about 15%, highlighting the greater
complexity of the Canadian well construction market, and therefore, the greater service intensity per well drilled.
A significant element of our Canadian unconventionals are the oil sand developments. Baker Hughes has an enviable
position in production chemicals and ultra-high temperature ESPs in this growing market. The strong rig count growth
we saw during the latter part of Q3 in Canada is very encouraging, yet overall shortages of people, equipment and
consumables will temper growth over the next few quarters.
Moving to the Gulf of Mexico, we saw gradual activity improvement sequentially, driven by an improvement in the
permitting process for deepwater wells. While margins are improving, they're still significantly below the pre-Macondo

levels due to less exploration and high-end development activity, and the higher operating costs associated with
increased compliance requirements. As we've highlighted on previous calls, Baker Hughes remains bullish on the Gulf
of Mexico, and we're very well-positioned to support our customers as the activity and mix eventually resume to
historic levels.
Turning to U.S. Land, clearly, the unconventional shale plays continue to be the big story. Even with the fairly
significant volatility in the commodities and equities market, we haven't seen our customers alter their spending
behavior in any material way. And the proof of this is in the 6.5% sequential growth in the U.S. rig count.
Demand continues to outstrip supply across most of our services, especially drilling services, completion systems,
pressure pumping and wireline. We're adding capacity to our supply chain at record rates across all product lines to
meet our customers' demands. And furthermore, like the industry, we continue to be challenged by shortages of water
and sand, and we're working diligently to resolve these supply chain and logistical constraints.
Staffing continues to be another challenge for the industry. Baker Hughes has already created thousands of new jobs in
the U.S. and Canada this year, and we're working hard to hire an additional 6,000 people over the next few months.
We completed the first OptiPort frac job in the U.S. this quarter. This particular horizontal well in the Barnett was
successfully completed with 49 stages. The OptiPort multistage fracturing system, as we highlighted at the Analyst
Meeting earlier this year, saves time and money by eliminating rig up and rig down time between stages, enables more
efficient fluid use, and most impressively, essentially allows for an unlimited number of stages.
Last quarter, we reported on some of our newest technology such as the next generation FracPoint, the InTallic
disintegrating Frac Balls and the AutoTrak Curve. And we're very pleased to report that these continue to experience
tremendous customer demand.
As we work to ramp up supply of these new products, we're quite optimistic that these, as well as others in the pipeline
will have a meaningful impact in helping customers even more efficiently develop their substantial unconventional
resources. Initially, all of these new technologies are being introduced in North America. But over time, they will be
equally applicable across the international unconventional markets as well.
What's becoming increasingly apparent with these unconventionals is the technology and intellectual challenges to
unlock, if you will, the code of optimal field development. To meet these challenges, we've co-located integrated teams
comprised of reservoir engineers, geoscientists, completion specialists and drilling engineering experts to partner with
our customers to work through and resolve these challenges. This is further evidence of the changing relationship
between customers and oil field service providers in North America.
And finally, the continuing shift to oil-focused drilling in North America benefits Baker Hughes' production-related
businesses. Oil wells require artificial lift. They require more chemicals. And, in general, they require more workover
services, compared to natural gas wells. Evidence of this trend is an award we received this quarter for a 360-well ESP
contract in the MidCon region, driven largely by our reputation for superior reliability and longer run times of our
ESPs.
Internationally, revenue grew 4% sequentially. And during the quarter, margins contracted as a result of an unfavorable
product mix.
In Europe, revenue was up slightly, but margins deteriorated. This was primarily due to product line mix, coupled with
lower drilling activity in Norway and other transitory costs. In the U.K., activity levels were flat as operators
considered divestitures and the impact of potential tax reforms.
In Poland, we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of future growth in the unconventional businesses, where we
recently performed a horizontal tight gas frac. We expect Europe to return to normal margins in the fourth quarter.
Moving from Europe to Africa, starting with Libya, the outlook there has significantly changed. And we're hearing
from our customers that they hope to get back to work as soon as it's safe to do so. We've done an initial assessment of
the status of our facilities. But at this time, it's a bit premature to speculate when operations will return to normal. We'd

like to acknowledge the dedication and commitment of our local employees during this difficult period. We wish them
and their families the very best through the next stage of Libya's transition.
In Algeria, operations improved modestly, but a shortage of consumables severely constrained our stimulation activity
during the quarter. We expect this to return to normal during the fourth quarter. We were awarded a three-year contract
to provide drilling services on over 70 wells in Algeria. This contract offers another data point to the effectiveness of
the geomarket structure.
In Russia, there was moderate improvement in activity. And we were awarded an important contract to provide
completions, artificial lift and chemicals on an offshore Arctic project.
Moving to the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions, sequential activity remained largely unchanged. In Asia-Pac, we
drilled sidetracks in four different wells using our advanced coiled-tubing drilling systems. This technology enables
operators to efficiently side track an existing well to a new reservoir location without a full rig while providing superior
well productivity results, compared to conventional techniques.
During the quarter, we installed the regions' first GeoFORM screen where we were able to significantly reduce the
complexity associated with performing a conventional sand control job in a very remote environment. In the Middle
East, we did not see the substantial increase in rig activity some had expected, but we believe the region's national oil
companies will execute on their plans to grow the rig count. Significant awards in wireline and directional drilling, as
well as our continued success in completions, artificial lift and chemicals demonstrates the execution performance of
our geomarket leadership there.
As we announced a few weeks ago, we were awarded our first integrated drilling project in Iraq for Lukoil. This project
consists of drilling and completing a total of 23 wells and serves as an important benchmark for us in Iraq. We're
gearing up now, and we expect the first rigs to begin operations early in the first quarter.
Further, we've been awarded an important multiservice project for Khafji Joint Operating Company. This work, which
is in the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait includes an integrated suite of products and services on three
drilling rigs.
In Latin America, we continue to see sequential revenue growth. As in the other regions, the theme continues to be
about the application of technology, and how it's solving our customers' problems and enabling them to develop their
newer resources. In Brazil this quarter, we continued to strengthen our position as a leader in drilling services in the
pre-salt, and were awarded a new multi-well drilling optimization project.
In October, we opened the Baker Hughes Technology Center in Rio, and this is our 10th technology facility worldwide.
This new center will further elevate the commercial relationships we have with the Brazilian customer community by
establishing higher levels of intellectual partnership as we collaborate to solve some of the toughest drilling and
production challenges.
In Mexico, the lab projects and growth in the offshore market are encouraging. In particular, the Coralillo field
laboratory has been successful for Baker Hughes, and we have been able to leverage our technology and reservoir
expertise to impressively grow production in our assigned area.
In Argentina, we continue to position ourselves to take advantage of the unconventional developments. Our view is that
this is one of the most attractive near- to medium-term opportunities for international shales.
So, in closing, our North America business delivered, and we believe the opportunities in this market will continue to
be strong going forward. We also believe that Baker Hughes is very well-positioned to capture an increasing proportion
of the market. We're pleased with our international revenue progression, but our margins were challenged this quarter.
We're addressing these issues, and we're confident we'll deliver on our fourth quarter margin goal.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Chad.

Chadwick C. Deaton
All right. Thank you very much, Martin. Good morning, everyone. Overall, I'd have to say I'm pleased with the results
of this quarter. Our global revenue growth was up 9% sequentially, and the change in sequential operating income was
20% – 21%, and both categories are near the top of our peer group. Our international margin deterioration was mainly
attributable to Europe. And as Martin discussed, we have addressed those issues, and they will return to more normal
levels in Q4.
As I did on the last call, I'd like to give you an update on our progress toward the goals we laid out in our investor
conference – meeting earlier this year. Our overall improvement in international margins over the last five quarters has
been substantial, and we're nearly 700 basis points better than we were this time last year. We maintain our
expectations that we will meet our 15% international margin goal upon exiting 2011. In order to achieve this 15% exit
goal, as we've seen in previous fourth quarters, our supply chain will be challenged to meet a record backlog of product
deliveries.
Second, we are strengthening our presence in the offshore markets as evidenced this quarter by the inaugural
deployment of the Blue Tarpon stimulation vessel. We now possess the two most capable stimulation vessels in the
Gulf of Mexico, enabling us to service the deeper complex reservoirs of the Deep Miocene and lower tertiary
formations.
The third area, we maintain our view that we can sustain leading margins throughout the cycle in North America. We
had a strong, 370-basis-point improvement in North America margins from Q2 to Q3. And as the Gulf of Mexico
returns to our expected share mix, we will see additional improvement. Our balanced product portfolio and strong
production-related services give us the ability to navigate any potential short-term market weakness while preparing
our company for the long-term growth.
Fourth, we continue to position our supply chain organization to be a leading strength and fundamental differentiator
for us in this market. As I've mentioned, we've seen a record order book for our completion tools driven by increasing
demand for our high-end completion systems.
We continue to open new manufacturing centers in key markets around the world. Last month, we broke ground on a
new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. The plant will manufacture production-related equipment for our customers in
the Asia-Pacific region and will open in 2012.
Fifth, as we've told you consistently this year, we are firmly committed to operating responsibly and with the
highest-quality personnel in any oilfield service company. We believe that our industry-leading competency assurance
program is vital to developing this capability. This program will service to both meet the – serve us to meet most
evolving global regulatory requirements, as well as to differentiate our people around the world when delivering
services to our customers.
And finally, we maintain our long-term objective to become the number two pressure pumping player globally. To
achieve this, we'll need to continue to grow our presence in the North American market, but also look for opportunities
to grow our international footprint. The recent award of a multi-year, multi-million dollar stimulation contract in the
North Sea is an example of our commitment to grow this business.
Let me switch topics now and give you a brief outlook on market conditions. Looking at the Baker Hughes rig count
for Q4, we expect the U.S. count to grow by 5% sequentially to an average of 2,030 rigs. Canadian rig count should
grow an estimated 9% sequentially to 485 rigs in Q4, and that compares to 441 in Q3. International activity will see a
modest ramp up and should average approximately 1,215 rigs in the fourth quarter, which is a 4% sequential
improvement.
Looking ahead to 2012, there's a lot of debate out there right now about the uncertainty in the market. But I'd like to
take a minute and tell you how we're thinking about this. Many people have tried to draw a parallel between what is
happening today and the end of 2008. And, although there are reasons to be cautious, we think there are also very
important differences.

First, the North America market in 2008 was still predominantly natural gas driven. And only 20% of the rigs were
targeting oil. As you all well know, the natural gas is strictly tied to the North American energy market and, as a result,
suffered a decline from over $14 per mcf to less than $3 per mcf on a spot basis during the 2008 collapse.
Today, over 50% of the rigs running in the U.S. are oil directed versus the 20% levels in '08. And a large chunk of
those so-called gas rigs are, in fact, targeting liquids-rich reservoirs. Additionally, the business is far more
technologically complex as evidenced by the increase in horizontal wells, which now represent nearly 60% of the U.S.
rig count. This increase in complexity favors Baker Hughes' technology-rich product offerings.
In 2008, there was a substantial liquidity crisis that constrained our customers' ability to raise capital. Today, we aren't
seeing that same level of capital constraint.
Further, the IOCs and NOCs will continue to look for opportunities to expand their presence in North America through
either JVs or acquisitions. In the international markets, project economics are naturally tighter and appear to be very
attractive at current commodity prices. Further, many operators have committed to increase their production capacity
and must drill to not only grow their production, but also replace underlying declines. The duration of these projects is
longer term by nature such as offshore, deepwater, remote locations and as such they are planned years in advance.
Finally, the shift in activity to NOCs is demanding a higher level of involvement and integration with the major oilfield
service companies. Today, we are much better positioned through our infrastructure buildout, our reservoir consulting
capability, the BJ acquisition and of course, our geomarket organization to respond to this shift in the market. As
unconventional resources decline, increasingly the world will return to deepwater, to shale and other difficult to access
reservoirs in order to extract resources to meet the world's energy demand.
So, let me wrap this up. As all of you know, effective January 1st, Martin is going to take over the role of CEO and I'll
remain as Chairman. So, this will be my last quarterly earnings call. I want to take just a minute and thank all of you for
all your support over these last seven years. Being CEO of Baker Hughes has not only been extremely satisfying, but
it's been a privilege as well. This is a great company, it's full of great people. And it continues to get stronger every day.
We've made a lot of changes over these last several years. We have some successes and obviously, we've been faced
with a few challenges. But we are in a much better position today to capitalize on this next up-cycle than ever before.
To our shareholders, I want to assure you that we have the right management team going forward. And for our
employees that may be listening on this call, I want to thank all of you for your support and obviously, for your
dedication over these last several years.
With that, Adam, let's open it up for questions.

<Q - William A. Herbert>: Martin and Peter, with regard to the international margin bridge for the fourth quarter,
historically, you guys have had very strong year-end product sales. I think last year, that probably accounted for close
to half of your significant EBIT improvement in the fourth quarter. Is that pretty much the roadmap for this year's
improvement as well from 12.2% to call it in the vicinity of 15%? Are year-end product sales expected to play a
prominent role?

say, some of the previous Q3 to Q4 [indiscernible] (29:02) is as we've said in our commentary, we had some transitory
cost issues we were challenged with across all the regions. We expect those to abate.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And we had some product line mix issues as well on the revenue side that didn't – weren't
as accretive as maybe some of the other higher ends. So, those two were a little bit more unique to this quarter. But,
yeah, absolutely, Q3 to Q4 is a big part of a manufacturing company like Baker Hughes' year-end numbers.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah. And Bill, this is Peter. Just to maybe put a bigger picture around it. We're expecting
activity to increase in Q4. So, that's beyond just the regular product shipments, right?
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: And you've got what's typically, I guess, for Baker, unique to Baker is product shipments of
completions equipment that we've talked about, and also, artificial lift that typically happen in Q4. Probably the
reversal of some of these transitory costs, we had a little bit of severance. We had a little bit of ForEx like many of the
others. And we had some repair and maintenance costs that are little bit higher in the quarter. And then we expect
favorable contract hopefully to pay out a little bit in the Q4 as well. So, there's a list of six or seven things, and I think I
gave them to you in the order of magnitude that should bring us to the international margin number.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Great. And then, Martin, very quickly, you mentioned international pricing ex-big projects
starting to improve. Are we talking net pricing or gross pricing?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No, I think net pricing, Bill.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay, good.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: And then lastly, with regard to North America, you mentioned constraints in the form of
water, sand and people. Yet on the other hand you've got accelerated frac deliveries at least I think as of the second
quarter call you did, you were in excess of the 40,000 horsepower for every six weeks that you were in the first half. I
think the last time you talked about this you expected to win a disproportionate share of the Gulf of Mexico deepwater
rig reactivations in the fourth quarter. Revenue per rig in the fourth quarter thus in North America should still be pretty
good?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Your comment on the – you're right in the conclusion of accelerated deliveries -
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yes, sir.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: – in the fourth quarter for horsepower.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yeah.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: But there's no getting round the fact that the logistical issues around sand particularly is
challenging the efficiency of these new fleets. And it's just something we have to work through and get a bit better at

Your next question comes from the line of James West with Barclays Capital.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A>: Good morning, James.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: And, Chad, let me echo Bill's comments. Thanks for all your years of leadership and
thoughts on the industry.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Appreciate it. Thank you.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Martin or Peter, you talked about a little bit of the kind of issues internationally that you
were addressing or addressed. I guess I wanted to clarify the kind of cost issues you have particularly as it respects to
Europe. Have those been addressed right now or is this still an ongoing process?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Most of those are one-offs unique to the quarter. I mean, we took most of our – we did most
of our cost-cutting, as you'll recall, the last half of last year with hundreds of heads that came out of the
underperforming geomarkets. And you'll recall, we've taken a lot of overhead costs out. I think that the issue in Q3
were unique costs on, like I said, FX, little severance, a little bit of maintenance that were unexpected, and they're not
underlying structural issues.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay. And then, so do we – if we take all those out from 3Q then, and we think about 4Q,
do you have to have a very strong product sales period to get to that 15% margin target or has that just given you some
cushion?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: We still need those deliveries. I mean, the orders – we've got the orders in hand. Now, it's a
question of just getting the products delivered to bring us up. We've still got to make up 280 basis points, and it's not all
cost. It is activity and product shipments as well.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: And, James, this is Chad. I think Peter hit it right on the head, and it's a very important
point. It's not that we're hoping to sell these products in Q4. These products have been sold. Now, it's the delivery –
getting them out in the next couple of months. So -
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Not that we're hoping for the sales.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then as we look about at international for 2012, at this
point, I would assume you have a vast majority of your revenue contracted. How are you guys thinking about
international E&P spending growth for next year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, as you say, James, I mean, we're – this is Martin. We're in the process of pulling it
all together and having the conversations with our customers, and they themselves are still going through the process.
But I got to tell you, there's not a customer on the international front, IOC, European Independent or NOC that is
anything, but bullish on 2012 in terms of what their spending is going to be.

In response to trying to get their production up. And I think you've seen some of the challenges some of our customers
have on the international front with regards to production and the reserve replacement ratios, and so forth. So, we
expect 2012 to be a better year in terms of activity, distinctly better than 2011.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Let me throw something in because I just got back last night from SPE's only Annual
Technical Conference in Denver and I chaired a panel with actually a lot of our key senior customers were on it,
Petrobras, Petronas, Shell and several others. And to a person, not one of them talked about any type of slowdown in
2012. They're still very optimistic at the very senior level. So, we're thinking 2012 still looks very strong.

Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Good morning.
<A>: Good morning, Angie.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Martin, you mentioned in your comments about current pricing outlook in pressure pumping
across some of the regions with some of the markets were flat, down and up. Could you give us further details on what
markets are, which as just far as up, down, flat? And how much are you seeing in pricing pressure so far, is it marginal
or greater than that? And then thoughts on 2012 pricing.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay. Angie, I've got a chart in front of me here. And it's, obviously, if you will, a bit of
intellectual property. I can't share all of the ins and out of it. We've spent a lot of time trying to understand what's going
on by product line and by basin. But I wanted to tease out the pressure pumping because obviously that's what's of most
interest to you and your peers.
To answer your question, by no means, when I say is the pricing trending down, is it sharp. I think what you find is that
there is a flattening and maybe a bit of a give-up on a little bit of price. And those two basins, as it's been reported, is
the Northeast and the Southeast, which are your gas-driven basins.
We still see – and I think our competitors, at least one of our competitors have said the same thing, a couple of the oil
basins and the basins being a little bit newer to the unconventional, if you will, or at least to the horizontal drilling and
multi-stage fracturing being woefully under-supplied.
And the wait times there for pressure pumping dates are not shrinking. But in turn, again, in those two basins that I
highlighted, wait times have probably dropped 50% according to our data. And like I said, I don't want to go into any of
the other product lines by basin, Angie. But as I look at it, the – if I give you one more data point, I'd say in those two
particular basins as well because it's activity-driven, things like drilling services and wireline services are following – a
little bit like pressure pumping, although there hasn't been as much capacity added in things like wireline or drilling
services in those two basins.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: All right, all right, that's very, very helpful. And then as – sort of an unrelated follow-up, but
on the international margins, two questions. When we think about early next year, I would assume based on your
comments on cost in the third quarter that when we think through margins early 2012, that the normalized margins
should be that second quarter number of 13.5% versus the third quarter of 12.2%. That's first.
And then second, obviously, there's been some debate on pressure on pricing in the international markets for 2012.
Your thoughts on which markets or country should lead and lag next year?

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I would certainly say that we will see the Middle East leading in margins, driven by
Saudi across all product lines, and some other key countries in the Middle East. And then I would say Latin America
will continue with the encouraging rebound we see in Mexico is absorbing capacity on that front on that continent.
No slowdown in Brazil, but possibly a pick-up in activity in the Southern Cone and, of course, the Andean has no – it
doesn't appear to be slowing down. So, I'd say the two regions, if you will, would be driven primarily by Middle East
and Latin America.
Chad, do you have any...
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: No, I think – I think Russia could get a little bit better in 2012.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: And are there any markets that you expect to be lagging or limited pricing recovery in 2012?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Well, I think a lot of that depends on us as a service industry. But I don't think anything is
going to necessarily go down from here. No, I think it's little premature. We have to see how the plans roll up from our
customers in terms of their spend, Angie. So, I'd hold off answering that one maybe until the next time we get together.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: North Africa, maybe a little bit up in the year. Algeria is looking better, but Libya is still
a big question.

Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Hi, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: I'll chime in too, Chad. I do appreciate your accessibility and candor over the years. And good
luck on your next phase.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Thanks, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Sure. So, I guess, the follow-up question I have here is predicated on the commentary you've
provided and the general guide points you've put forth in your presentation, I guess we can all infer from that that Street
consensus number in the fourth quarter of $1.38 looks not only achievable, but probably beatable, predicated on the
product sales that you have in hand for international, and, as well as the North American growth. Would you guys
agree with that comment in principle?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: It's early on in the quarter, so it's hard to say where it stands. But I wouldn't be raising that
estimate.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. That's fair, Peter. I'll leave that one there. All right. And then, I guess, Martin, you had
referenced something back as part of, I think Angie's questions. I just wanted to get some point of clarification, you
mentioned something about – in two basins they're still woefully undersupplied than that's on a liquids front and wait
times are not shrinking yet. And I guess you were mentioning in the two gas basins that wait times have dropped 50%. I
was just looking for some clarity on that.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Kurt, that's about as much clarity as I want to provide. But that's exactly right. The
opportunity our customers have to schedule a fleet now is 50% less from what the wait times were before in the
Haynesville and the Marcellus. But that all said, the frac fleets are far less fungible, if you will, than a drilling
assembly.

So, I think what you're going to find is that that equipment stays landlocked a little bit more and a case in point is as we
move west into Ohio now, you would think that the pricing in the Utica and the wait times would reflect the Marcellus,
but it's not. It's tight. Wait times are long. Pricing is good. Granted, there's some different in well treating properties,
but it's not by any means spreading beyond those two basins at this time.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: All right. I guess I'm just kind of curious hearing the comments that have come out from the
varying peer group so far to-date, the reference about in aggregate the North American pressure pumping market still
being tight; and extremely tight obviously in the liquids basins, and I guess some state of excess in the gas basins.
Typically in this business, if the market is tight, and it's undersupplied, the service companies get very good pricing.
So, I'm just kind of wondering why, with things still relatively in short supply, how come pricing isn't better?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. Well, that's – I think what you're finding though is, if you take a typical well now
that things are a little bit different than in the past. The well – the frac cost on a typical unconventional, let's take the
Eagle Ford, is 50% of the AFE, Kurt. That's a significant amount of spend that, in the last cycle, wasn't there. The
pressure pumping invoice was probably at best to half of that in a total well completion – total well AFE.
So I think what you're finding now is that – just the economics on the wells is very much – affects the pricing we're
able to achieve on such a big portion of the AFE. And I think that's also why you see a pretty big backlog of wells
drilled, but not completed. Just maybe the economics don't work.
So, it's a very good question, but I think, again, in some of those basins where the wait times haven't dropped, and
they're woefully undersupplied, as I said, pricing is still going up. But also, acceleration of that price while going up is
not as high as it was in the past.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then – maybe a last follow-up on Latin America. You referenced Mexico coming
back or being a pretty strong contributor. If we were to look at the varying countries and contributions of varying
countries within Latin America, where would Mexico rank relative to Brazil at this point? And your expectation as to
where Mexico may rank as you head out into 2012.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: When you say contribution -
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Yeah, on a – if you want to talk about revenue. If you want to give some – and once again, this is
all now relative. You don't have to give numbers per se, but is Mexico still your largest contributor in Latin American
market, or has Brazil leapfrogged Mexico?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: For us, Mexico is not our largest contributor. But certainly, I think that if you look at
differential growth for the next 12 to 18 months from where it started, Mexico could very well be out in the lead of the
pack on an incremental revenue growth, percentage-wise.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, appreciate that. That's it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Thank you very much. Peter, first question to you, just some clarification on the tax rate, which
came in a little lower than what you had previously guided and the reasons for this. And also some kind of color of
what you think you should be modeling for 2012?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Okay, sure. Just the taxes can move up and down, depending on where your settlements are
with various authorities around the world. We had about $23 million of discrete items benefit us in Q3, which explains
all that difference, which is higher than we had planned. And we are expecting similar sorts of benefits in Q4,
compared to the average for the year.

With respect to 2012, it's too early to tell. And I know you'd love to know the number, but we haven't done our plans
yet. But if international margins continue to improve year-over-year, which I think they will, that's going to help some
in lowering the overall rate from 2011. But probably not as low as what we've achieved in Q3, and what we're
projecting to achieve in Q4.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay. So, historically, you've been guiding sort of 4%, 5% or we should take it towards the lower
end of that range perhaps?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: If you want, but we'll probably – we'll give a better sense of guidance next quarter.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay. Second question, on just the seasonality in the business, this of course, has changed quite a bit
since you absorbed BJ. So, Martin how should we – thinking about the bridge from the fourth quarter to the first
quarter? Canada will be, of course, benefiting you on the strong side, but then product sales will temper off and then
maybe a little bit going into the second quarter as well given the Canadian effect versus recovery in Russia and other
areas. So, could you just help us a little bit with how to think about the seasonality?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yeah, Ole, this is Chad. I think you can look back over the last several years of what
we've seen, and usually Q4 is a very, very strong quarter for us as you well know. Obviously, as you talked about the
BJ pressure pumping will help offset some of that, the product sales, but I think you'll see the same thing. Q4, we're
expecting a very good Q4 quarter. And I think Q1 will be good, but I wouldn't be surprised if you don't see a little
drop-off in Q1, just from the international and everything else, but it should still be a good quarter in Q1.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Because Canada should be very strong sequentially right from the fourth quarter -
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yes. Yes.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: – through the first quarter. And -
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Canada looks – and as you said Q2, we know what's going to happen in Q2 regarding
Canada. But yeah, Canada will be strong in Q1.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: So, do you think that you'll have a modest net setback in sequential margins, or could it be flat for
the company as a whole?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I think you should expect a modest setback, just like we've done in the past.

think about start-up costs, mobilization costs in Q4? So, how might we think about margins in that region specifically?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Well, I think there will be some start-up costs in Iraq, obviously, with the Lukoil win
because we are – we've been kind of been gearing up for that for the last couple of quarters anyway because we've
known we've had it for awhile. The Khafji is not going to be a major start-up cost operation. This is something that

nobody's shared in for the last 38 years. So, we're pretty excited about that 60% of that contract. But we have the
equipment in the area that we're able to move in there. And of course, when you're sitting in Kuwait and you're sitting
in Saudi already as strong as we are -
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Right.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: It's not like you don't have the assets. So, I don't think Q4 is going to be a huge hit for us
on start-up other than a little bit in Iraq.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Okay. All right. That's helpful context, I appreciate that. Maybe the related follow-up is – so,
if we were to think about the individual regions and the contribution coming from each of them in the fourth quarter
sequentially, is it fairly well-balanced in terms of basis points of margin improvement? Or does one region wind up
driving it in your – based on what you can see today whether it's from product sales or from reversal of costs, or
what-have-you?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Well, I think one thing to look at in Q3 and then understand why we're pretty optimistic
about Q4 is, we have one particular area that took a pretty good hit in Q3, and that was Europe. And Martin highlighted
it in his conversation, but Europe was down from its normal operating margin by several hundred basis points for the
various things that Martin talked about, the mix, a little bit of FX, a little bit of R&M, all of the different things in there.
Europe, traditionally, is a strong area for us, it has been all of this year, and we see it bouncing back in Q4. So, that
right there, we get a lot of comfort knowing Europe's coming back in Q4. So, that will make up a lot of the difference
you saw over Q3.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: That makes sense. So, in other words, as we look at Latin America and the Middle East
sequential performance on the margin basis, that was much more attributable to mix.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yeah. The other regions were okay. They had a little slip here and there.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Yeah.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Things we've talked about, but most of the hit in Q3 came out of the Europe region.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Right. Right no – can do that, Okay, all right. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson with JPMorgan.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks. I just wanted to get back to North America, if you don't mind. You guys had some
pretty bullish comments on the market, glad to hear that. Just want to ask a bit more about your capacity additions
going into next year. You're talking about ramping up. I think you're saying one fleet every – one 40,000, 50,000 fleet
every six weeks. How does that shift going into next year? Are you thinking about next year? Are you going to
continue to add at this pace all next year, and then how then you're thinking about kind of this looming oversupply
situation that everybody's kind of freaking out about? I mean, is that still going be a second half '12 event in your mind,
or is that – or where do you come out there?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Martin, will you take that one?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Sure, Chad. David, this is Martin. Let me say it this way, we are planning to increase the
horsepower per period. I'm not prepared yet until we fully map this out going into the fourth quarter and load the line, if
you will, to give you an exact as we have in the past in terms of a fleet every six weeks. But I think it's safe to say that
based on what we're doing now, we'll be able to do better than that on average in '12.

And in terms of this what everybody is excited about, this overcapacity hang, David, the fact of the matter is that our
customers continue to absorb more and more horsepower. They're drilling longer laterals. They're putting more stages
as you've seen on this OptiPort job that we did; 49 stages in the Barnett.
There's really no better way to extract these reservoirs than to continue to drill longer, put more fracs on, and even
perhaps tighten up the well spacing, which is only going to accelerate again this absorption of capacity. That's not to
say that it's a never-ending trend, obviously in some basins particularly the Haynesville, the lengths haven't gone –
haven't extended for over a year now, they've pretty much flattened out.
But all the other basins are showing continuing lengths, so it's our internal model, as well as some of the – your peer
group that publish the frac models, we remain convinced that the market is not going to be properly supplied on the
pressure pumping front through '12. And that's – of course, there's some macro issues out there the commodity prices
and economic general activity, and so forth. But the way things look now, we don't see a capacity issue hitting us in '12.
<Q - David Anderson>: In '12. Okay, that's great. The BJ fleet, are you done, replacing what you thought you had to
replace? Are you at the point now where you're building your overall capacity level?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Oh yeah, definitely.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. And then, I guess, a little bit of a change and going into the Gulf of Mexico. Your
comments have been gotten a little bit more positive than it has been in the last couple of quarters. Just want to get a
sense, you were talking about how your margins are kind of depressed because of the Gulf. Can you give us a sense as
to how much it could improve your North American margins? I mean, right now you've posted, I think it was 22%
margins in North America. Like how much is it down because of Gulf? And as it starts picking up, is it just a question
of those activity levels and does the cost could absorb really quickly and just kind of hit the bottom line quickly? Can
you just kind of help us understand that progression as you see it into next year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. David, this is Martin again. I don't want to provide too much detail on the – on
what we think our incrementals are going to be. But there is a fixed – heavy fixed cost base in the Gulf of Mexico. And
I think one of the comments from our peers was that, that the incrementals should be very good, and we've seen that.
But the fact of the matter is probably what's most important or it's two fronts to get those margins up. There's nothing
more that can be done, I don't believe, on the cost front nor should we, based on what the outlook is. Our customers are
very bullish. The permitting is getting better. But really, it still is a – highly a mix issue. And the type of rigs that are
running and the type of wells that are being drilled, if you look at the permits, there's still a preponderance of sidetracks
and injector wells.
<Q - David Anderson>: Yes.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And we're woefully underrepresented on the exploration type. And for companies like
our self and our big peers, that's, of course, that's very different revenue mix than some of the wells that are being
drilled. But as Chad highlighted, in terms of our sand-controlled fleet and the boats we're running, commissioning and
getting the Tarpon ready this quarter, it was a very good quarter relative to where it's come from. And I expect that,
year-on-year, we're going to have a much better quarter this time next year if nothing else changes in the Gulf.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thank you.

<Q - Michael Urban>: So, the – it seems like you're on track to hit the, your long-held 15% margin target
internationally. But it also seems that that has come against the backdrop of probably a weaker activity outlook than
you might have expected, a lot of delays, of course, all the geopolitical issues. So, can we take that to mean or imply
that some of the self-help initiatives that you've had underway, whether it's cost-cutting efficiencies, supply chain, all
that kind of stuff has been – you've done better on that than you might have expected?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yeah. I think we've done better in a few areas. I think our cost-cutting area, I think that
has been a good improvement. Our supply chain side is improving, but again, we've got some work still to do there. As
I said in my comments, we have shifted a lot of future manufacturing capability to other parts of the world, so we've
been running a little bit of duplication at a time and may be not fully up-to-speed in certain product centers yet.
I don't think that some of the geopolitical stuff has hurt us all that much when you look at it. Yes, Yemen's down a little
bit; Syria's down a little bit. We look at a few areas. But for the most part, activity has probably held in there. I think we
felt from day one when we started to map out all of this 15% exit rate where it's going to come from, I think we're
hitting on most of the fronts that we targeted. And we always knew that into Q3, Q4 was a strong time for us on
shipments and ESPs in Russia and elsewhere.
So, I don't think there's any surprises out there for – that we haven't anticipated. I think we feel pretty comfortable Q4
will be there if we can just deliver the product that's already been sold. So, that's the key.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Okay. That's helpful. And shifting over to North America, Martin, I think it was you that said
you don't see a – there's not necessarily a tremendous amount of fungibility in terms of equipment in the pressure
pumping markets. Is there anything that you can do to address that and potentially smooth out some of those variances
from basin to basin? Or even if you do see a slowdown in North America, the ability to move some of this stuff
internationally to, kind of, manage the supply globally like skidding frac fleets and things like that.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Mike, by no means did I want to suggest that we don't roll the fleets to other basins, and
we do that now, and it's happening. But relatively speaking, moving one wireline truck or moving a 40,000 horsepower
fleet is a very different task. So, on the scale of mobility if you will, frac fleets are way down the curve, so they can
take a little longer to reposition, and so forth. The second part of your question was what, Mike?
<Q - Michael Urban>: Oh, it's the – could you also address the -
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Oh, the international front.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Yeah.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. So, a certain percentage, I don't want to say what, of the fleet that's scheduled to
come out in the first half is skid-mountable and transferrable for that reason. That if we should start to see second half
of next year a balancing approaching, we'll reassign it to Latin America, Middle East; particularly Saudi with the
unconventional attention and, of course, parts of Europe.
<Q - Michael Urban>: So, your flexibility on that front in terms of being able to -
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: It's very good.
<Q - Michael Urban>: – move capacity around is improving.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: It's well thought out and understood, and that's the way we're building.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Okay. That's all for me. Thank you.
<A - Adam B. Anderson>: Thanks, Mike. Brandy, at this point, can we take one final question, please?

<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Peter, I just wanted to ask you on Canada. I know in the second quarter you mentioned that
you had expected to recapture about two-thirds of what you lost in 2Q in the third quarter. I'm just curious, I know
there was wet weather in July, were you able to do that – make that target?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, pretty much Canada was no surprise in Q2 and met our expectations.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up on Latin America, I think when you guys outlined
the 15% margin expectation as we exit 2011, my recollection was is that Latin America margins would probably be just
shy of that. Given where your margin performance was in 3Q, can you just talk about how we should think about Latin
America here fourth quarter? And I guess, Martin, some mix issues there that perhaps are going to continue to be a
challenge for you as we think about going into 2012.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Just let me balance the math and maybe Martin will talk about mix. But we said Europe
would be our biggest sort of recovery going into Q4, so we'd expect that region probably to be at the higher end of the
three international regions, and I know it's kind of a toss-up if it's Middle East, Asia-Pac, Latin America slightly below
the average, right? So -
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: As far as the mix side, Bill, on a geography side I don't see any slowdown in the Andean
region at all, very bullish, great terms for our customers' optimism, execution performance by our customers and
geological success. Brazil, no temperament both in terms of Petrobras, as well as the local operators like OGX and the
foreign interest. And as I've said on a revenue contribution side, year-on-year, I think Mexico could be the star if
everything lines up properly.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. And those margins in Mexico, Martin, relative to the segment average, better, worse,
in line?
<A - William Sanchez>: I think, let's say, by the middle of the year based on the revenue volume, it'd probably be
about middle of the pack.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. Thank you all for the time. I'll turn it back.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: All right.
<A - Adam B. Anderson>: Thanks, Bill.
