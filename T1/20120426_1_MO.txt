Brendan J. McCormick
Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. I'm joined this morning by Mike Szymanczyk, Altria's Chairman and
CEO, and Howard Willard, Altria's Chief Financial Officer. This morning we will only be discussing Altria's 2012

In addition, comparisons discussed in this conference call are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated. As
part of Altria's cost-reduction program, on January 1, 2012, John Middleton became a subsidiary of PM USA,
reflecting management's goal to achieve efficiencies in the management of these businesses.
Beginning this quarter, we are reporting the financial results for the new Smokeable Product segment which includes
cigarettes and cigars.
Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Mike Szymanczyk.
Michael E. Szymanczyk
Thanks, Brendan, and good morning to everyone. Altria delivered strong financial results in the first quarter, growing
its adjusted diluted earnings per share by 11.4% behind the strength of our diverse business platform. Our business
model generates income streams from the largest and most profitable tobacco categories, as well as from our alcohol
assets and Financial Services business.
Our Smokeable and Smokeless Product segments grew their adjusted operating companies' income and margins behind
the strong performance of our tobacco companies' premium brands and effective cost management. All of our tobacco
companies grew retail share of the categories in which they compete. PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are pursuing
initiatives to build their premium brands for the long term.
As we discussed at the CAGNY Conference in February, PM USA has evolved Marlboro's brand architecture to
support its future growth. This new architecture is focused on four product families, Red, Gold, Green and a new
product family, Black. In the first quarter PM USA made investments in Marlboro Black which builds on Marlboro's
rich heritage of adventure and ruggedness.
Marlboro's cigarette retail share benefited from the investment in this new architecture, Marlboro delivered strong 2012
first quarter sequential share growth of 7/10-ths of a share point versus the fourth quarter of 2011, and grew its
year-over-year share by 1/10th of a share point.
We launched non-menthol and menthol versions of Marlboro Black last year in bold, modern packaging fitting with the
personality of the Marlboro Black family, and are pleased with its first quarter results. The Marlboro Black family is
off to a great start, has generated trial among competitive adult smokers as intended, and gained retail share. However,
some of Marlboro Black's retail share gains were driven by trial-generating activities that are likely to moderate in
2013.
Marlboro will continue to focus on the introduction of its new brand architecture throughout 2012, and plans a number
of brand-building and equity-enhancing products and programs across all four of Marlboro's brand families during this
year and 2013.
In the second quarter, PM USA is introducing Marlboro 83's box that provides the classic Marlboro flavor in modern,
updated packaging in the Red family. Black & Mild delivered strong retail share gains for the first quarter, driven by its
continued leadership in Tip Cigarillos and the success of new Untipped Cigarillos introduced in 2011.
Our smokeless products segment continued to deliver strong adjusted operating companies income growth behind
Copenhagen and Skoal. These brands grew their combined first quarter adjusted volume and retail share versus the
prior year, as Copenhagen continued to show strong momentum. Skoal's retail share was stable on a sequential basis
versus fourth quarter of 2011. Skoal's year-over-year retail share losses, including those attributable to the seven SKUs
delisted last year were partially offset by share gains for Skoal Xtra, which was introduced at the end of the first quarter
of 2011.
In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered strong volume growth as it continued to expand distribution of its
premium wines. Adjusted operating company's income was flat for the first quarter as Ste. Michelle had a higher cost

of certain wine vintages, investments to build its sales force and other items.
Gains on asset sales by PMCC and earnings from our equity investment in SABMiller also contributed to Altria's
strong adjusted earnings per share growth.
Altria continued to return cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. In the first
quarter, Altria paid more than $835 million in dividends and bought back 9.9 million shares, at a total cost of $294
million. Subject to the discretion of the board, the Company plans to repurchase additional shares worth $378 million
by the end of 2012, representing the balance remaining under the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by the
board in October of 2011.
We are pleased with Altria's financial results for the first quarter, which were consistent with our expectations. Altria
reaffirms that it expects its 2012 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.17 to $2.23 from an
adjusted base of $2.05 per share in 2011. Altria anticipates more modest adjusted diluted EPS growth through the
middle quarters of the year.
Finally, I am happy to report that our Chairman and CEO transition is proceeding smoothly. Marty Barrington will
succeed me when I retire as Chairman and CEO following Altria's annual meeting of shareholders on May 17, and
Dave Beran will become President and Chief Operating Officer. Marty will join Howard Willard for our second quarter
earnings conference call in July.
As this is my final earnings conference call as Chairman and CEO of Altria, I want to thank our shareholders and
analysts for your interest in our company. I have appreciated the support and confidence that many of you have offered
as we have transformed Altria following the spin-off of Philip Morris International.
I believe that Altria has many strengths that position our company to continue increasing value for shareholders. These
include the strong premium brands of our tobacco operating companies, which hold leading positions in the largest and
most profitable tobacco segments, a deep knowledge of adult tobacco consumers, and a focus on innovation, growing
alcohol assets, well-developed capabilities to manage external challenges, and a strong balance sheet that supports
superior cash returns to shareholders. As I prepare to retire, I am excited about Altria's prospects for the future and have
great confidence in the leaders that will guide the Company through its next phase of growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Howard Willard, who will discuss Altria's business results in more detail.
Howard A. Willard
Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone.
In the Smokeable Product segment, first quarter reported operating companies' income grew by 5.1%, primarily due to
higher list prices and effective cost management. These factors were partially offset by lower reported shipment
volume and higher promotional spending to support Marlboro's brand-building and equity-enhancing products and
programs.
Excluding the special items, first quarter adjusted operating companies' income for the Smokeable Product segment
increased by 3.9% to $1.4 billion, behind higher pricing and cost savings. Adjusted operating companies' income
margins increased 1.5 percentage points to 41%, driven by Marlboro.
PM USA's reported cigarette shipments decreased 2.6% for the first quarter, primarily due to trade inventory dynamics.
Trade inventories were lower in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the fourth and first quarters. The impact of lower
trade inventories was partially offset by retail share gains on L&M and Marlboro, and one additional shipping day.
When adjusted for trade inventories and one extra shipping day, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume was
essentially flat for the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior-year period. PM USA estimates that the total cigarette
category's adjusted volume declined approximately 2.5% in the first quarter, which is consistent with historical price
elasticity and the secular rate of decline.

On a sequential basis, PM USA had strong 2012 first quarter retail share results, increasing 6/10-ths of a share point
versus the fourth quarter of 2011 to 49.4%. This sequential share gain was driven by Marlboro which grew 7/10-ths of
a share point, partially offset by a 1/10-th of a share point loss on other premium brands. Our discount portfolio was
unchanged on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011.
PM USA's first quarter retail share on a year-over-year basis increased 4/10-ths of a share point to 49.4%, as Marlboro's
share was up 1/10-th of a share point to 42.3% and discount share gains on L&M more than offset share losses for other
portfolio brands.
Cigar shipment volume increased 14.3% for the first quarter, driven primarily by retail share gains, changes in
wholesale trade inventories, and one extra shipping day. Black & Mild's retail share increased 1.4 share points to
30.7%, driven by the success of its Classic, Sweets, and Wine Untipped Cigarillos, and continued strength in its core
Tipped Cigarillo.
Turning to Smokeless Products. Reported operating companies' income for this segment decreased 0.5% to $192
million for the first quarter, due primarily to higher restructuring charges and lower reported volume, mostly offset by
higher pricing and lower costs. When adjusted for restructuring charges, operating companies' income increased 8.8%,
to $211 million. Reported Smokeless Products shipment volume decreased 7.5% in the first quarter of 2012. Volume
gains for Copenhagen were more than offset by declines for Skoal and other brands, which both faced difficult
comparisons versus the prior year.
In the first quarter of 2011, Marlboro and Skoal each introduced two new Snus Products, and Skoal introduced eight
new Skoal Xtra products late in the quarter. Skoal's volume was also impacted by the delisting of seven SKUs in the
second quarter of 2011. While adjusted Smokeless volume is difficult to estimate on a quarterly basis, USSTC and PM
USA believe that their combined 2012 first quarter adjusted Smokeless Products volume grew more than the recent
category trends due to strong retail share gains.
USSTC and PM USA estimate that the Smokeless Products category grew by 5% over the 12 months ended March,
2012. USSTC and PM USA's retail share of the Smokeless Products category increased 1 share point, to 55.5%. New
products introduced by Copenhagen in the recent years continued to have a positive impact on the brand's retail share.
Copenhagen's first quarter retail share grew by a strong 2.7 share points, to 27.8%. Skoal's share declined 4/10-ths of a
share point to 22.5%, as share losses including those related to last year's delisting of seven Skoal SKUs were partially
offset by gains on Skoal Xtra, that was introduced last year.
Ste. Michelle's reported operating companies' income of $15 million was up 25% for the first quarter, but adjusted
operating companies' income' was flat excluding the impact of restructuring costs in 2011. Ste. Michelle has made
investments in its sales force to support its goal of expanding distribution of its premium brands. These investments,
along with higher costs for certain wine vintages in the first quarter of 2012, offset the impact of revenue gains from
higher volume. Ste. Michelle's shipment volume increased 6.6% for the first quarter , driven by the growth in certain
premium brands.
The Financial Services segments reported operating companies' income increased by more than 100%, $52 million for
the first quarter, driven by gains from asset sales.
Our 2011 cost management program remains on track, and we have reported net pre-tax charges, $228 million over the
past two quarters. We expect to incur approximately $70 million in pre-tax restructuring charges in the balance of 2012
related to this program. These 2012 restructuring charges are reflected in our full-year, diluted EPS guidance that we
reaffirmed today.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping
items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest affected-price cigarette was 35% in the first quarter. Marlboro's net pack
price in the first quarter was $5.71 while the lowest affected-price cigarette was $4.23. The cigarette discount
category's retail share was 27.5% for the first quarter. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the
end of the first quarter was $1.37 per pack, unchanged from the fourth quarter, and up $0.01 versus the first quarter of
last year. Copenhagen's first quarter retail price was $4.10, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was

approximately 41% in the quarter.
CapEx was $16 million for the first quarter. We estimate capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately
$150 million. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $56 million for the first quarter. On April 16, PM USA made
its annual MSA payment for 2011 of approximately $3.5 billion. This amount includes approximately $206 million that
was paid into the MSA's Disputed Payment Account, reflecting the amount that PM USA disputes it owes as a result of
the 2009 nonparticipating manufacturer adjustment.
Operator, do we have any questions?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from Nik Modi of UBS.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yeah. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Hi, Nik.
<Q - Nik Modi>: And, Mike, congrats on the retirement again.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Thank you.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Two quick questions I had. First is, just curious on your thoughts on the e-cigarette category just in
lieu of what Lorillard announced yesterday. That's question number one.
And the second question is, if I understand the architecture correctly it's going to be fully implemented at retail by the
end of the second quarter. And I'm just curious if you've tested this, and if you have, what's some of the early context
you got from those test markets? Those two questions, any context would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, I'm not sure what the first question was, Nik, relative to e-cigarettes. Is there a
specific question on that subject?
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yes. I'm curious on your thoughts on the category. Is this something you think Altria should get
involved in? Is it a category you think is viable? I mean, certainly there's a lot of different viewpoints on Snus. So I'm
just curious on your viewpoint on the category.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well look, we pay attention to all of these, I guess, emerging segments and watch
what's going on and do some research, and so we've been monitoring this one for some time. It's been around for a
while, there's pretty high awareness, but it represents still pretty small business proposition, and so we're mindful of it,
paying attention to it. That's about all I can say about it.
And then relative to your second question, what was it?
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yes, just on the architecture. I guess it's going to be fully [indiscernible] (19:36)?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: On the architecture. Well, we did some very specific consumer research relative to
this architecture. It's not the kind of thing that you would market test because it would be pretty hard to read it among
all the noise that exists in the market, but you really rely more on consumer research relative to communication around
the segments and the particular audiences that each segment's designed to appeal to. And yes, we did research that
before we decided to move to this architecture. I hope that answers your question.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Citi.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Hi, Vivien.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Curious about the share gains for Marlboro Black. Could you quantify the contribution
from that line extension to the quarterly share gain for Marlboro?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, no we haven't. We don't usually break out the individual segments of Marlboro,
but as I said in my remarks, we're pretty pleased with Marlboro Black so far. We recognize that some of that is driven
by introductory support, but that's okay. That's part of introducing a new product, and we're pretty pleased with the rest
of the franchise as well.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Absolutely. And then in terms of the introductory support that you're offering for Marlboro
Black. On a percentage basis, is it roughly in line, the kind of level of discount in your promotion that you're putting
behind that line extension, is it in line with prior Marlboro line extensions?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: You know, I don't know if I quantified it, but I would say there's nothing unusual
about it, okay? It's not an abnormally high level. I mean, we have a promotion level and we have trial events for adult
smokers that are more limited in terms of their quantity and duration. So both of those things are typical as part of a
new product launch. So there's nothing really I would say that's exceptional or meaningfully different about Marlboro
Black's introductory plan from things that we've done in the past.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Understood. And lastly, could you just comment on inventory levels at wholesale? That
was certainly a big topic of discussion over the last two days and where you guys feel like things settled down at the
end of the quarter?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, there was some inventory movement downward, wholesale inventory
movement, and a little bit of retail inventory movement downward in the first quarter. Not wholly unexpected. So we
kind if, I think, said at the end of the year in the fourth quarter that our inventory levels for the fourth quarter of 2011
were pretty much in line with where they were in the prior year, and then they've dropped a bit as we've gone through
the first quarter.
You expect some permanent inventory loss relative to the cigarette business because the business has a decline rate
associated with it that's ongoing. And then there are movements in inventory that are driven by various wholesaler
activities and needs that are less predictable. It's hard to quantify how much of this is permanent and how much is kind
of sporadic movement. But I think most of its probably sporadic movement. I don't think that we're expecting to see
any real changes in wholesale inventory levels beyond what you'd predict just from the normal industry change.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Terrific. Thank you very much.

<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Hello. We can hear you.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Oh. You can hear me. Okay, great. Yes. I can hear you. Okay.
So thinking about the cadence of I guess the quarterly flow of Marlboro Black, can we think about Special Blend as I
guess a good model for that, right? Where you come out, and in the first couple of full quarters out there you kind of
peaked and then you see it kind of move off?
And I guess I ask that in the context of some of the stuff you said around expecting a moderation into 2013 on some of
the trial building stuff, I guess. Can you just talk about how that flow might be relative to market share? How you'd
expect it to go?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, I think that's kind of competitively sensitive information, so I'd be somewhat
reluctant to talk about that in any detail. We will – because Marlboro Black is one of the four core segments for
Marlboro going forward we have initiatives and activities planned for it. So that will be ongoing. We won't run
introductory trial levels on the product at the same level we've done early on as a continuum, but the objective will be
to build that franchise over time. So we will have ongoing activities there. And we'll have activities in the other three
segments as well. So all the focus won't be on Black. Part of the benefit of this architecture is it really allows each one
of these areas to pursue the consumer group that it matches up to best in its own way. So you can expect to see ongoing
activity on Marlboro Black.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: And as a follow-up I guess to one of the other questions too. You're saying there was nothing
unusual at all in the promo. I mean you didn't run introductory level spending any longer for Black in duration than you
did for previous launches? Is that fair?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: We're not finished with Black yet. So I can't speak to some finality on Black. We're
still in the introductory phase of Marlboro Black. And we'll have activities going on, on Marlboro Black, all year.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Good morning.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: I just thought maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the promotional environment.
Obviously your competitor sort of called out a pretty intense promotional activity that they saw in Q1. And it looks like
if I look at Marlboro's pricing per pack perhaps down sequentially from Q4 by a couple of pennies. So is that really sort
of that trial driven initiatives that you've put in to the marketplace? It looks like L&M also gained share.
So just sort of talk about the competitive landscape, and your spending to see some of the share gains, and how we
should think about your ability to balance share and profit as we stand today.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Yes. Well, I didn't think that we saw a real meaningfully different competitive
environment in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. And I also don't think we saw any dynamic change between
key segments in the category. I mean the discount segment declined a little bit in favor of the premium segment. But all
three of the major premium brands grew some share. So you would've expected to see little bit of that. There was
continued interplay in the discount level as pricing change on various brands and retailers had activities focused in the
discount area where there's less equity, and the shifting between brands is more driven by price.
Most of L&M's year-over-year share gain occurred in 2011. It had a modest share increase the first quarter versus
fourth quarter, and that continues to really represent some recovery from basic share that we lost. So I just can't tell you

that we saw lots of dynamic change.
Now look, we're installing a major equity initiative on Marlboro that will continue for a while. And it's establishment of
a new architecture, the launching of an element of that architecture, and so we've made some investment relative to
that, which is to be expected. That's part of what we've said all along is the way we'll run the business.
I mean, I'll remind you of what our goals are here. We've said we want to maximize income and maintaining modest
share momentum over time. And I think we've been pretty explicit about saying we really don't want to chase share
with pricing, we want to spend money to build long-term equity initiatives. And so the architecture on Marlboro,
Marlboro Black, those things are long-term equity initiatives and they're worthy of investment because that's the way
we'll be able to accrue increased revenue over time from the brand, and grow overall profitability.
So that's kind of the way we see it. I don't see it as a particularly unusual thing, nor do I see the kinds of introductory
activity or the way we're approaching it to be in any way out of sorts versus what you'd expect in the packaged goods
business on big brands and the way they're run.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And so then on pricing, so I know you don't break out PM USA anymore, but can you
give us any color just in terms of cigarette revenue per unit kind of year-over-year change?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: No. I'm not going to give out those specific numbers. But once again, I think if you
look at the overall Smokeable business, what you're going to see, Judy, is that hey, we had some nice margin expansion
in that business, and we had what we would say for a period of time where we had inventory depletions, and we had
investment behind new brand architecture, we had nice income growth. And I think that's really what we're looking at.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then at the industry level, so the rate of decline 2.5% adjusted for inventory, so
certainly a much better number that we've seen in the last couple of years. So anything that you think is driving that
improvement? And do you think that's sort of now a run rate that we should think about for the foreseeable future for
the industry as a whole?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, I don't know. We can't predict the future, and this stuff ebbs and flows based on
market conditions and based on taxes and all kinds of things like that. So there's also some, I think, interplay between
the Smokeable segment and the Smokeless segment, so we're seeing a little more moderate growth rate in the
Smokeable segment. At the same time we've seen more modest declines in the Smokeable segment, so all of that seems
to tie together pretty well. I don't think there's much that's new here relative to behaviors among consumers related to
these tobacco segments.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. Got it. And good luck, Mike.

Christina, your line is open.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Hello?
<Q - Christina McGlone-Hahn>: Hello?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Hello?
Operator
Yes, Christina, we can hear you.
<Q - Christina McGlone-Hahn>: Hello?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: There you go. I can hear you.
<Q - Christina McGlone-Hahn>: Okay. Sorry. That was a lot harder than normal. Thanks for being patient.
So just following on the previous questions. If we think about Marlboro and the Black introduction, and then following
up with 83's, and I guess introductions in the brand families over the next two years. I guess I wanted to get a sense, to
what extent are these activities additive to brand equity, so that when promotion is pulled back share will still be up
versus 2011?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, we do audit them as part of our brand equity study. And I think we shared with
you in February at CAGNY that when you look at Special Blend as an example it actually gets higher equity scores
than the already high scores that the Marlboro franchise gets. So we pay pretty close attention to those things, because
ultimately our objective is going to be to have the whole platform be able to continue to grow and have value over time.
So we do keep a pretty close eye on that.
<Q - Christina McGlone-Hahn>: And as promotional spending is pulled back when you're past the introductory
phase, you think – I mean all this activity to what extent can we be confident that it really augments total Marlboro
share?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well you know, with any of these things you get some slippage. So you're going to
get some incremental share growth, just like we got behind Special Blend. And then you're going to have some of it
that is simply promotion sensitive consumers that shift around between promotional products that are available on our
brands and on competitive brands. And so that slippage kind of will go away. But net out of that is we typically get a
gain in both share and revenue and profit growth when we do these kinds of things .
<Q - Christina McGlone-Hahn>: Okay. And then in terms of the competitive response. Given the promotional nature
of the Black launch, which is typical, but the pricing which we estimate at about 2% was kind of the lowest rate of
growth since 2008. And we're just curious what you've seen in terms of competitor response? Or what you anticipate to
see?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, I can't anticipate what the competitors are going to do, but I think that the
market remains competitive. But you may recall we showed you a chart at the CAGNY presentation that showed net
effective price and the relationship between Marlboro and its key competitors, including some key discount
competitors. And I can tell you that through the first quarter, those relationships didn't change at all. And so that factors
in all promotion, and there just wasn't any movement there in terms of the relationship between those products.
<Q - Christina McGlone-Hahn>: Okay. Thanks. And then on Smokeless we saw pricing much better than we
expected but volume lower. And as we lap the Skoal Xtra, the delisting – I'm sorry the Skoal delisting, in the second
quarter should we expect to see a volume rebound in the second half? Or is there something else that needs to be done
on Skoal to help with volumes?

<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, volume in the first quarter is a little bit difficult to read because there are several
factors that affected the quarterly volumes. So I wouldn't get too caught up in it. When we look at it on an adjusted
basis we think that the volumes run at a little bit ahead of the industry volume or the industry growth rate for the
Smokeless business.
Just a word about Copenhagen and Skoal; we look at these two brands together. And I think over time, both of these
brands are going to be successful. They actually – having two of them with some significant scale gives us some good
opportunities from a competitive point of view to strategically approach the marketplace. But we're looking at the total
between these two brands.
And I think you can expect over time to see one or the other being more active and growing more, because we will be
doing things on these brands differently over time, and they won't necessarily both grow at even rates. And in the end
it'll be the total that we'll be most interested in. That's the way we're looking at the business.
Skoal has been pretty stable here. And it's still facing headwinds from the discontinuation of some SKUs. And I think
Copenhagen is growing really quite nicely, and Skoal's having to compete with that. But Skoal's time is going to come
as well, and I think the collective performance of these two brands is going to be quite good.
<Q - Christina McGlone-Hahn>: Great. Thank you so much.

Thank you. Your next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Hi, David.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Hi. Good morning, Mike. Can you hear me?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Yes.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Two things I wanted to ask you. First, given the efforts and the spending on Marlboro Black
in the quarter, did you hope for, or plan, or expect, more than 10 basis points of year-on-year share growth for
Marlboro?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: No, I don't think so. I think we felt like Marlboro performed pretty well in the first
quarter. It was up, I mean, you have to really look at where it landed for the year, and it was in pretty good position
relative to that after the launch period of Marlboro Black. And this architecture activity is just getting started really in
terms of playing out with the consumer. So I think we feel pretty good about Marlboro and where we're headed with it.
I mean remember, the goal here is to maximize income and get modest share momentum over time. So we're not
looking for huge share gains in short periods of time on this brand, and as I mentioned a minute ago, it's difficult to
launch things and go into the marketplace without having some slippage due to spending in the marketplace and getting
some business that really isn't going to be long-term business. But that's part of what you have to do in order to build
the franchise for the long term, so we accept that we've got some of that going on.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: I feel pretty good about Marlboro, and I think we're just getting started with our
architecture. I think we're very optimistic about Marlboro's prospects for the future.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And then I wanted to ask a financial question on the remaining or the residual
potential SILO/LILO income tax exposure. Given what must be a fairly high statutory rate of interest that you would
ultimately have to pay, how keen are you on trying to quickly resolve the remaining issue?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Well as you know, that's an issue that's ongoing, but if you look at the impact on our
financial statements, really the impact of the charge was really reflected in the second quarter of last year, and through

the end of this quarter we estimate that future cash outflow for that is about $600 million.
With regard to the timing, obviously we've got a lot of activity going on with regard to that litigation. I think the timing
of that cash outflow is going to depend on a number of future activities.

Your next question comes from [ph] Kip Taylor-Reid (41:20) of Jefferies.
<Q>: Good morning. Could you give us a little bit more background on Marlboro 83's? How are they different from
just regular King Size Marlboro Reds?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, they're 83 millimeters.
<Q>: So one millimeter difference?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: No. No. No. No. Marlboro Red is not 80 millimeters, okay? So it's a different sized
cigarette.
<Q>: And I understand it comes in different packaging?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: It does.
<Q>: Okay. So what gives you confidence that this won't be massive cannibalization of Marlboro Red?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, we obviously research these things, and Marlboro Red has a very loyal
franchise that likes that product. So we wouldn't anticipate that we're going to get a large amount of cannibalization.
<Q>: Okay. And I assume there will be introductory pricing for 83's as well?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, we have an introductory program for 83's, it's a bit different. I'm not going to
describe it because I'd rather my competitors have to figure it out. But it's a bit different than for example, the Black
launch.
<Q>: Okay. And then last question on pricing, and just following up on a question that Judy asked. You introduced, or
you announced price increases of $0.15 over the last 12 months, yet the retail price for Marlboro moved by $0.01. Was
that driven by increased promotions? Was that driven by more retailer spending on Marlboro? Can you elaborate on
that a little?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, I think it's a lot of factors. I think what retailers decided to do from a pricing
point of view is certainly a factor. The competitive marketplace is a factor. So I think that it's influenced by a number
of things.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Has Special Blends' role changed at all with the new Marlboro architecture? Or is that
basically the same?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, in the context of the Marlboro architecture, there are – there's a Special Blend in
the Red line, there's a Special Blend in the Gold line of this proposition. So if you look at these four families in the
Marlboro architecture, Special Blend exists within those families as a part of the architecture. It doesn't exist as a
singular line of products.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: And have you thought about the pricing any differently? I know you said you've got
these higher than the base equity scores. Have you've been able to price that up since the introduction?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Yes. Absolutely. Marlboro's Special Blend has been subject to the same list price
increases that everything else in the Marlboro lineup has.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: I'm sorry. I guess I mean on like a net pricing. Have you been able to promote it less?
What kind of trajectory has the promotions been on that?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, the answer to that question is the answer I just gave you. We've taken list price
increases. And we always realize part of our list price increases to the Company's profitability.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: No. That's helpful. And then on your Corporate Unallocated costs, they were roughly
flat year-over-year. Should we expect to see any of the restructuring savings coming through that line? Or is it just in
the operating segments? How should we think about that line there?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yes. I think you'll see some of the savings flow through that line. But a lot of the savings
are really going to flow through the costs that are allocated to the various tobacco businesses. Particularly the
Smokeable business, because that's where a lot of the activity is focused. And then it unfolds as the year progresses.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Yes. That's what I was going to – and so you've realized some of that. But there's still
more of those savings you would expect to be coming?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yes. Some of that has come through in the first quarter in a number of the different cost
elements in selling, general and administrative. But you should expect to see more as the year unfolds.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: All right. Thank you very much.

<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. How are you? Can you hear me all right?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Yes.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Good. Great. I just had a couple quick questions for you; a bit of a follow-up. I wanted
to ask a question regarding Marlboro regarding the MLP program and some of the variations. That changed a little bit
earlier in the year, as I understand. And just to be clear on how that is playing out at retail, and how that could be a
factor, or is that a factor in the retail price change year-over-year. I guess the question being, are you seeing that
program lead to lower retail prices for Marlboro at retail?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, I think what we see our trade programs do is they certainly have many retailers
competing aggressively using Marlboro as a vehicle to compete with. And some times that has some bearing on
pricing.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. I wanted to ask also relative to the level of discount growth in the quarter – and
particularly the performance of L&M. Was that a function of increased promotional spending and/or I guess an increase
in distribution, geographic push for that brand? I'm just curious what's driving that growth.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: You know, it's really kind of lapping what occurred in 2011 where we had some
distribution expansion of L&M throughout the year 2011 as we were replacing some of the lost basic share. So it built
up to a pretty good level by the end of the fourth quarter, and it picked up 1/10-th point in the first quarter, but not with
any real change in anything that we were doing.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And my last question, this is relative to the Smokeless category, and just what
you expect in terms of growth for the category for the year. Should we expect the sort of 5% increase in volume for the
year? Is that a good run rate you believe for the category?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, that's what it's running at. We can't predict the future, but this category has kind
of run in the 5% to 6% range, and you're always estimating these things a little bit, and there's some interplay between
it and the Smokeable segment, but that seems to be a reasonable range to think about, I guess.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Well, thank you. And I wish you all the best, Mike, in your retirement.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Hi, Ann.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: I was wondering if you could talk about within the Marlboro family are you seeing consumers
move from the discount category into the Marlboro family under the new architecture?
And if so, is that movement in line with expectations?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, I think that we see some competitive consumers that have some interest in
Marlboro that may have been buying competitive products, not necessarily discount products but competitive other
premium brands. Finding some of these SKU expansions that we've done to be products that they like, and that's how
we sustain share growth on the brand. That's one of the reasons why we've articulated in the past why we think some of
the SKU work that we've done over time is important for the brand, because it allows us to reach out to a broader
universe of adult tobacco consumers. Because eventually your mainline products get of sufficient size, and have had

broad-based trial, and some consumers are not buying them because they don't like those particular products. And so it
may be that they like the Marlboro franchise, they just don't like that set of products. And so you try and reach out to
them with something that they find more appealing.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Okay. And then with cigars, you all had a nice quarter. Double-digit volume growth, some of
that due to trade inventory movement. Can you help me with how I should think about volumes for the cigar business
for the year?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, I don't know how to predict going forward in the future what it's going to be, so
it's kind of something I would hesitate to try to comment on.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Fair to say it should grow though?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: We hope it does.

Your next question comes from the line of [ph] Gale Alexander of [indiscernible] (50:59) Associates.
<Q>: Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Hi.
<Q>: As you look at the Smokeless category can you give us any feel as to your profitability trends over the next few
years? I mean, you've had a lot of restructuring, you've had a lot of positioning. Is there – can you give us any feel as to
how much the operating profit margins can increase, or what you'd like to have happen?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Well, I think our objective, as we've said before, is to have volume growth in this
growing category that's slightly ahead of the category, and that'll be driven by modest share growth, and we already
have a very nice margins in this category. And so if you put all that together what you should expect is to see, we'd like
to see income growth in the category that is kind of running a bit ahead of the overall category growth rate.
And so far, we feel pretty good about what we've been able to achieve in this business. And I think sometimes difficult
for people from outside of it to understand this, but we've gotten really substantial synergy out of having this business
and that has benefited our other businesses. And we also have substantial R&D opportunities related to this business
that we believe long-term also will add growth to the company. So I think that we look very favorably on the prospects
and contributions from our Smokeless business.
