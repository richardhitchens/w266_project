William H. Swanson
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon delivered solid operating results in 2011. Looking back at the
year, I see a company that capitalized on global market opportunities, and also, successfully managed the challenges of
an evolving economic environment. Our margins, earnings and cash flow were all better than expected, and bookings
and backlogs were strong.
In this environment, we focused on the things we could control, and what we do best. We executed our strategy, we
continued to implement efficiencies across the businesses, lowering our costs, we provided more affordable, innovative
solutions to our customers, and this ultimately allowed us to deliver solid returns for our shareholders.
A bright spot and a key driver of our bookings strength was the international business, which represented 29% of the
total company's bookings for the year. A couple of highlights included two large awards in the fourth quarter, the
United Arab Emirates ordered two TPY-2 radars, which are the world's most advanced forward-looking mobile radars
and a key sensing component of the THAAD Missile Defense System. This represents the first international sale for
this product.
The other highlight was Taiwan's order for an additional three Patriot fire units. I mentioned some of the larger ones,
but there're also hundreds of smaller bookings across a number of product lines in the 81 countries where we do
business. This drove the international backlog to 37% of our total backlog and demonstrates the alignment of our
advanced technologies with the evolving needs of our global customers. It also points to continued success of our
international strategy.
On the domestic front, we started off the year under a continuing resolution and even after the budget was signed in
mid-April, the funding was slow to start up. Coupled with this, we finished the year again under CR through December
22. With all this in mind, we were encouraged by the fact that congress avoided another extended continuing resolution
and moved forward on the fiscal year '12 defense budget. The outcome contained few, if any, surprises.
I'm proud of Raytheon's teams' performance and our ability to deliver in this environment. We expect the fiscal '13
budget shortly, we expect some changes. In this environment, we're focused on the right areas and have a strong
portfolio in electronic warfare, ISR, cyber and missile defense, which are priority areas for our domestic and
international customers.
Regardless of any external uncertainty, the Raytheon team will remain focused on what we do best, delivering
innovative products while reducing our cost and operating with improved speed and agility. We remain committed to
delivering the best value for our customers and our shareholders. Our company remains strong, and we're
well-positioned for the future, with a proven strategy and solid financial foundation.
I'd like to take a minute to highlight a couple of the achievements of last year. In recognition for our development of
top leaders, Raytheon was named a Fortune's 2011 North America Top Companies for Leaders list for the second
consecutive year. Further, we finished 2011 with the best environmental health and safety performance in the
company's history. Our safety performance is world-class and industry leading and our sustainability program
continues to be recognized.
Before concluding, you've heard me talk in the past about our companywide integrated enterprise platform and
common processes and systems that span all our major functions: finance, supply chain, contracts, human resources, as
well as manufacturing and engineering. This has been a multi-year strategy, with over 85% of our business
transactions, supply spend and manufacturing volume now supported by our integrated enterprise platforms.
We also achieved key milestones for our engineering common Product Data Management, PDM, and our
Manufacturing Requirements Planning, MRP, systems. PDM, for example, is being deployed across the company to
enable us to manage, share and use product data more effectively. Having these platforms help drive our cost-efficiency

efforts, the results of which are reflected in our performance.
I want to thank the Raytheon team for their hard work, dedication and focus on customer success that makes our solid
results possible, for the ongoing commitment to our customers, our company and our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras
Okay. Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. I have a few opening remarks starting with fourth quarter and full-year
results and then I'll discuss our outlook for 2012 and, after that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions. So, during
my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our website.
Okay, if everyone could please move to page three. Strong operational performance, including cost reduction efforts
across the company drove our margin, EPS, and operating cash flow results during the quarter. Our fourth quarter
adjusted EPS of $1.74 was up 12%, and for the full year, was $5.90, up 7%, primarily the result of operational
improvements and capital deployment actions.
We also generated strong operating cash flow of $1.3 billion for the quarter and $2.2 billion for the year, after making a
fourth quarter $750 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, the
company repurchased 7 million shares of common stock for $313 million, bringing the full-year 2011 repurchases to
27.1 million shares for about $1.3 billion.
As we previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter 2011, the company issued $1 billion in long-term debt. The company
ended the year with a strong balance sheet, and net debt of just over $600 million. I'll talk to our strong bookings,
particularly in the fourth quarter, in just a moment.
And finally, during the quarter, we announced that we had acquired two companies, Pikewerks Corporation and
Henggeler Computer Consultants, further extending our capability to serve the cyber security, enterprise architecture,
and systems engineering needs of our customers in the intelligence community, as well as in the Department of
Defense.
Both companies have become part of our Intelligence and Information Systems business. These acquisitions are on top
of the two we completed earlier in the year, Applied Signal Technology, which is now part of our Space and Airborne
Systems business, and Ktech, which is now part of our missiles business. All are performing well.
Turning now to page four, let me take you through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full-year results. We
had strong bookings of $7.1 billion in the quarter and $26.6 billion for the full year, resulting in a backlog of $35.3
billion and a book-to-bill of 1.11 in the quarter and 1.07 for the year. 33% of our bookings during the quarter and 29%
of our total bookings for the year were from international customers.
And also of note, three of our businesses, Integrated Defense Systems, Space and Airborne Systems and Technical
Services, each had record bookings for the full year of 2011. Notable bookings in the fourth quarter included just over
$1 billion at IDS for TPY-2 radar contracts for the UAE Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Army, $560 million to
provide advanced air and missile defense capability for Taiwan, $243 million on the Zumwalt-class destroyer program
for the U.S. Navy and $177 million to provide consolidated logistic support for the MDA.
Missile Systems booked $383 million for the development of Standard Missile-3 for the Missile Defense Agency, $131
million for the production of Paveway for international customers, and $128 million for the production of Evolved Sea
Sparrow Missiles for the U.S. Navy and international customers. SAS booked $212 million for the production of AESA
radars for the U.S. Navy. And IIS and SAS booked $433 million and $177 million, respectively, on a number of
classified programs. Backlog for the year increased a little better than $750 million over year-end 2010.
Turning now to page five, fourth quarter sales came in at $6.4 billion. Comparing to our guidance, sales came in
slightly below the low end, primarily due to the company's ongoing cost reduction efforts. When comparing the prior

year, it's important note that there were five fewer work days in the 2011 fourth quarter. Our average 2011 sales per
workday was approximately $100 million.
Looking at the businesses, Integrated Defense Systems' net sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter. The change was
primarily due to lower sales on Zumwalt, and on an international Patriot program. As many of you are aware, during
the quarter, IDS received U.S. Congressional and State Department approvals on a $1.7 billion direct commercial
contract to upgrade the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Patriot systems to the latest Configuration-3.
Intelligence and Information Systems' net sales were $753 million in the quarter, driven by lower sales on domestic
programs, which were impacted by the continuing resolution. Missile Systems' net sales were $1.5 billion in the
quarter. The change was driven by the Rolling Airframe Missile and SM-2 programs.
At Network-centric Systems, net sales were $1.1 billion in the quarter. The change in net sales was primarily due to
U.S. Army programs, which are nearing completion. Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.3 billion in the
quarter, up 3%, driven by sales related to Raytheon Applied Signal Technology.
Technical Services had fourth quarter 2011 net sales of $886 million. The change was primarily due to the lower sales
on programs nearing completion, including a DTRA program and a TSA program.
We'll move ahead page six. We delivered strong operational performance and executed well on our cost reduction
initiatives, both in the quarter and for the full year. Our adjusted operating margin was up 220 basis points in Q4 and up
70 basis points for the full year. Each business had solid performance, with a year-over-year margin expansion. There
were couple of items that I do want to point out that did have a positive impact on two of our businesses. At IIS, we had
a $9 million recovery of an insurance claim, and at Missiles we had $21 million favorable contractual resolution.
When you compare our fourth quarter margins to our prior guidance, all of our businesses performed better than the
high end of the range that we had provided in October. We clearly saw meaningful improvements from our
productivity efforts. As I've been saying all year, we're focused on cost control and productivity improvements, which
will ultimately benefit our shareholders and our customers.
Just to put some color on this, our efforts on efficiency improvements cover the full spectrum of our cost structure. We
are continuing to drive savings across the supply chain. We are streamlining our factory operations, improving our
direct-to-indirect ratio and driving down overhead costs. The positive swing in margins reflects these efforts.
Now, let me just briefly describe our supply chain initiatives. The objective is to deliver cost savings, improve
efficiencies and quality while building stronger, longer-lasting strategic relationships with our supplier partners. By
way of example, our centralized strategic sourcing effort allows us to identify key suppliers with the right capabilities
and capacity that meet our requirements. As a result, we've taken our supply base from approximately 30,000 several
years ago to about 12,000 today, even as we increased our total spend on supply chain in line with the company's
growth.
We are seeing real value and cost-efficiencies. We're leveraging our resources more effectively with a smaller, more
strategic group of suppliers that drives the quality and product affordability that our customers expect from Raytheon.
In large part, we're in a position to effectively implement these types of enterprise-wide productivity programs as a
result of the strategic investments in our Information Technology area. As Bill just mentioned, we're in the final stages
of a company-wide MRP platform implementation, allowing us to improve visibility into our supply chain across the
company and better respond the market conditions and customer requirements.
Additionally, we're moving forward with an enterprise-wide product data management system, which will allow us to
seamlessly collaborate on product design across the company with our suppliers, while integrating with our MRP
system for real-time resource planning. These are significant competitive discriminators and will be become
increasingly important going forward.
If you would move to pages seven and eight, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full-year adjusted earnings per share.
In the fourth quarter 2011, our adjusted EPS was $1.74, up 12%, and for the full year was $5.90 versus $5.51 in 2010,
an increase of 7%. The increase for both periods was driven by operational improvements and capital deployment

actions, specifically, share repurchases.
The company generated stronger than expected operating cash flow of $2.2 billion in 2011 after the discretionary $750
million cash contribution to our pension plans. This was a result of our continued focus on working capital
management and customer advances.
Turning now to page nine. In the first quarter of 2012, we sold the remaining operating assets of RAAS. Raytheon's
residual turbo-prop commuter aircraft portfolio had a slight gain and all its operations have ceased and there are no
contingent obligations. The results from RAAS are required to be reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods,
including prior periods, beginning in the first quarter of 2012. We provided historical data for this reclassification in the
attachments that accompany the press release to help you better understand the impact to our historical results. This
completes the sale and close-out process of our 515 plane portfolio that we began a number of years ago.
Moving on to our 2012 guidance. We see sales in the range of between $24.5 billion and $25 billion. As for pension,
we now see the FAS/CAS adjustment at $284 million, which is more favorable than we assumed on the third quarter
earnings call, primarily due to the $750 million discretionary cash contribution we made in the fourth quarter. In
addition to the discretionary contribution, our 2012 FAS/CAS adjustment was also impacted by the discount rate
environment and our asset returns in 2011, which were slightly negative for the year. Our end-of-year discount rate was
5%
We expect net interest expense to be between $190 million and $200 million, which is higher than 2011 due to the new
debt that we issued in the fourth quarter. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between 334 million and
340 million on a full-year basis.
As for our effective tax rate, we see this coming in at approximately 32%. In 2011, our effective tax rate was 29.5%. If
you adjust for the 2011 third quarter tax-related benefit and the R&D credit, 2011 would have been approximately
32.5%.
Also, and just to be clear, in the past, we've included the R&D tax credit in our guidance. However, for planning
purposes, we've not included the possible extension of the R&D tax credit in our 2012 guidance. If the legislation
passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 100 basis points, and it's worth about $0.07 in EPS. In
2012, we expect EPS to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.05. We see our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.60.
Our operating cash flow guidance is expected to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, which is down slightly from
2011. However, it's important to note that we received a cash advance at the end of 2011, which is expected to liquidate
as we move through 2012. And we also made a sizeable discretionary pension contribution in 2011, which is not
anticipated for 2012.
When you normalize for these items, cash flow decreases slightly, driven by higher cash taxes, as well as the strong
performance we saw in Q4 of 2011. And finally, we expect our return on invested capital to be between 12.3% and
12.8%.
Continuing on to page 10, I'll briefly comment on our outlook. From a sales perspective, we see our international
business offsetting to softness in our domestic business. We expect 2012 margins to continue to be solid, but will be
impacted by a change in program mix, contract completions and a work-down of more mature products in our domestic
backlog. And, again, our improved cost structure gets re-priced into our new contracts as they get awarded throughout
the year.
If you'd now turn to page 11, we've provided you with our 2012 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the improvement in
sales cadence as we go through the year, which reflects program timing in the current environment. It's also important
to note that there is a slower ramp of our longer duration international business, specifically, associated with some of
the larger bookings we received at the end of 2011. We expect bookings to be back-half loaded, similar to last year.
Finally, on page 12, as many of you have requested we've provided a summary of the financial impact from our
pensions in 2011, as well as our assumptions for 2012 through 2014. We believe this will help you better understand
our company over the next few years. I do want to point out that holding all assumptions equal, 2011 represents the

inflexion point with the FAS/CAS adjustment continuing to improve in 2012, ultimately turning positive in 2014.
With respect to CAS harmonization, the rule was published late in 2011 and primarily increases the CAS
reimbursement in 2014 and beyond. For this outlook, we've held the 5% discount rate constant over the forecast period,
not withstanding possible increases in the interest rate environment.
So, let me conclude by saying that in 2011, Raytheon delivered strong operating performance, with margins, earnings
and operating cash flow all ahead of expectations, despite the challenging economic environment. Book-to-bill was
strong and total backlog increased year-over-year. We will continue to expand our already substantial international
business.
Our balance sheet remains solid, with net debt of less than $1 billion. Given our strong financial position, our diverse
portfolio of innovative and affordable technologies and our continued focus on driving efficiencies across the business,
we remain confident in our future and in our ability to continue to deliver improved value for our customers and our
shareholders.
So with that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Heidi Wood, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, hi. Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Hi.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Heidi.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: A couple of questions for you guys. Actually, just awash in paperwork here, so I'm trying to find
the questions.
<A - William H. Swanson>: If you don't have one, I can ask you.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: First of all, on the international sales outlook, Bill, as we look forward, can you highlight for us
where the areas of opportunity are going forward? I mean, has the Asia-Pacific market sort of flattened out, or do you
opportunities in Indonesia and Malaysia, Saudi? Where is that coming in from? And also highlight for us what
percentage of international sales will there be in 2012 versus 2011?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. Let me start with 2012 first. We expect about 30% of our bookings to come
internationally and about 26% of our sales, and we expect probably mid-single-digit increase in the environment.
Clearly, for us, Asia and the Middle East are important and are still growing, and we don't see those being flat. And we
actually, given some of our products, they're all around world. If you take our traffic control business and radars and
systems, those have got markets everywhere.
We've got to C4I opportunities, not only in mid-East, but other places in the world and, of course, in our Missile
business, those continue. Patriot, probably one of our biggest drivers. We've got Kuwait probably in the second half for
two to four fire units. Turkey should be making a decision probably in the first half, and an award in the second half.
We've got activity in Oman for Air Defense. We've got Paveway around the world. I mentioned ATC training is
growing for us internationally. We've sold some virtual simulation equipment initial sales, and that looks like it's going
to proceed to other parts of the world, and we see South America actually warming up as we go forward, if all that
helps.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Very much so. I'll let someone else ask a question. Thank you.

Operator
The next question will come from the line of Troy Lahr, Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Yeah, thanks. You guys talked a lot about some of the restructuring efforts that you're going
through. But how much of these are you actually able to hold on to? Are you giving back all this to the customer once
you guys re-price this? And can you just maybe give me some clarity on that because we're seeing margins, kind of,
decline a little bit in 2012? So, I'm just wondering, even longer term, how much do you guys try to keep?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, let me take part of it and then I'll turn it over to Dave. One, I would not use the
term restructuring. For us, part of what we do every day is continue to take costs out of our business. We do that a
number of ways. Dave went through the Integrated Systems, and what we're doing. What we basically try and do in this
company is fundamentally lower our costs across the board in all businesses. And for us, we can say that because all six
businesses did very well in improving their margin performance, so we look for sustaining in that effort.
For us, clearly 56% of our contracts are fixed price, and about 44% are cost plus. So, you take that into account when
you go forward. Some of those savings immediately go right to the customer, which is good for them because they
want us to do more with no more, and I think we're demonstrating that. And on the fixed price, some of those contracts
have a long duration, so you keep it. Some have a short duration, where you bid year-over-year. And where it's
year-over-year-over-year, we reflect those savings, and then we start again and go look for more savings as we go
forward.
So, for me, having done this for a long time, you never run in place. You're always conditioning yourself to be able to
run longer and faster, and that's what we're trying to do here. So, with that, I'll turn it to Dave.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So, I talked a little bit about this in the opening comments. Raytheon does have a
competitive advantage in many areas. Here specifically, we're addressing the strategic investments that we made in our
information technology systems that began a number of years ago and are in the final phases now. I provided a little bit
of color on the supply chain, and what we're doing to improve our efficiencies there, along with our supplier partner
base.
Going forward, we see these type of initiatives continuing because, again, based on the broad range of company-wide
systems that we're able to leverage as we approach cost structure improvements. I agree with Bill, it's more of the way
we do business, and I think characterizing it as a restructuring is not the right way to look at our cost and productivity
initiatives.
Going forward, I would suggest that this continues to be the case. It's something we've talked about for a while. If you
are looking at 2012, the biggest driver there is the mix of our business, primarily from an international perspective. We
have some longer duration large international programs that are beginning to ramp up, and some other international
programs that are in the final phases of production, and it's more of a typical cycle. But with that, we do see ourselves
continuing to support the customer in their effort to reduce costs and improve affordability and also, ultimately, it's in
the benefit of our shareholders.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it, and I'll leave it at one.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thanks, Troy.

you might speak to the ministerial changes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and what you see that meaning for the
world's largest defense export market? And how we should be thinking about that transition, and if it means anything to
you and even to some of your peers, I'd love some of your insights there.
And secondly, for Dave, just a clarification on your cash flow comments. You said that in Q4, working capital and
customer advances were a contributor to the strong performance and then you called out cash taxes being a headwind in
2012. But then you said that 2012 cash flow will be down slightly after correcting for, I think, the advances, but not the
cash taxes. I'm just trying to figure out, is working capital a reversal in 2012 as well, or is this just the advance reversal
in cash taxes?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, it's – okay, so let me just answer the last question and then I can clarify whatever
you'd like. So, as you go forward into 2012, what I was trying to do – there's a lot activity, right. We have the
discretionary pension funding. As we move forward from 2011 to 2012, we had that $750 million pre-tax, $500 million
after tax. Then if you separate that out, there is a slight increase in the cash taxes year-over-year. The balance of this is
we had strong cash performance in Q4, particularly towards the latter part of Q4, which obviously improved in 2011,
and that's going to be difficult to replicate as we go into 2012. The largest portion of the change between the working
capital and the advances is the liquidation of the advances.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay, okay. I think I got it.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. Let me try and remember the question you gave me.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: The KSA and ministerial change.
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, no, I remember it, I was just being a little facetious. For Raytheon, we've been there
since 1965, so that's 47 years. I've been doing business there for about 32 years, so a good portion of that time. We've
seen a lot of change in the Kingdom. The change has been positive, they have a very good succession planning process,
it's laid out, and they've let us know where the changes are going to be.
And so, for a company that's been there for 47 years and has probably one of the best relationships, I'll be a little bit
biased here, we feel very comfortable with what takes place there, and they count on us to do what we say we're going
to do and to do a little bit better. And our plan is to continue to delight them. And they're a big customers of ours, and
that's about the way I think of it. I look at it as very stable.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: So, no significant change in how we should think about contracting and there's no – there's
really a seamless transition is what you're saying?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, for us. I mean, we've been there – what I tried to – maybe I'll explain a little bit.
We've been there so long that we understand it, we feel part of the fabric. And we continue to get contracts there across
the board, across all the ministries, whether it's Ministry of Interior, whether it's MODA, whether it's the SANG, the
National Guard, we really enjoy our relationship, and I don't see any change in that going forward, from a Raytheon
perspective.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: But it sort of implies it could be different for some of your peers?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Well, if you don't perform, it will be really different.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: All right. Thank you, gentlemen.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

The next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Sam.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Dave, I wanted to just go back a little bit on the cash flow and see if you can maybe quantify
some of this, is that, if I look at your year-over-year cash from operations, it looks like it's down, kind of, $400 million
to $500 million. You've showed in the slide that you're going to have about $700 million less in cash going into
pension. And so I'm just trying to think about how much of that could really be the cash taxes? And then, separately,
can you just give us a CapEx number for 2012 versus 2011?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, CapEx for 2012, let me start off with that, including the software portion, is about in
line with what we – where we ended for 2011. So, there's no big swing item in that area. And if you look at kind of
2011 to 2012, because of the year-end performance in combination with the advances, the way I would suggest, Sam,
looking at our cash flow is really over a two-year period, and I think if you normalize it, you'll see more of the normal
pace in cadence from our company perspective.
The change is between the advances and the performance in Q4 is in the neighborhood year-over-year of $700 million,
$800 million. But, again, this is all due to the timing of what happens, when. It could happened on the last day of one
quarter versus the first day of another. So, I think it's better analytically, if you're going to try to look at the company
and understand the company, to sort of average just over a two-year period.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: But if I see – if I just look at the advances line, it's up $500 million from the September
quarter to the December, so that's what you're talking about in terms of the advances. And then I'm just trying to just
get a quantification of cash taxes in 2012 versus 2011, how big of a shift is it?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, the shift in cash taxes to 2012 is about a $100 million, $150 million. Now, that's
excluding the impact of the cash taxes from the discretionary pension contribution. If you take that into account, it's
$300 million, $350 million. So, I'm trying to just walk that down. I was isolating the tax benefit associated with the
discretionary pension contribution.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.

And the next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Could you talk a little bit about the organic sales expectation by domestic and international,
Bill, and then perhaps offer your bookings expectation for the year?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I think the way I look at this is I expect domestic to be down – probably down
because of inflation, because we look at it being flat with inflation taking it down. And then on the macro part, we look
at the international, offsetting that to kind of keep us at, I'd say, level as we look through it. At the same time, if the
international happened at a faster rate, then the international would really offset the domestic. And so, we're pushing
hard on some big jobs internationally to see if we can begin the move to left a little bit, which would be better for the
home team, as I look at it.

And so, that's where our real push is and, as Dave mentioned, we had some come in at the late part of the year, a little
later than we wanted, but the good news is, they came in. And for us, internationally, we're not having losses, it's just a
delay. So, I feel really good about our international posture of where we're going.
And then the other thing domestically, we're seeing a good uptick in the classified. For us, total year, we had about 12%
of our bookings and about 15% of our sales in classified. And next year, we expect bookings about 13% or 15% range,
and we expect sales in the 14% or 15%. So, we expect a high-single or low-double-digit growth in the classified area.
So, that's a positive on the domestic side that we expect to see more of that, especially where we think the department is
going in 2012, 2013, and 2014.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Bill, can we put some more specific numbers to those, though? Would we have – like what
would your book-to-bill expectation be across the company for the year? And then on the organic growth decline
domestically, what does that look like, given that you've got, sort of, flattish sales with the acquisitions and the
international growing?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. So, Rob -
<A - William H. Swanson>: Dave's trying to tackle me, so I'd better let him get in. He's just chomping at the bit -
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: [Laughter] I'm sorry.
<A - William H. Swanson>: – find out what he has to say here.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sorry, Bill. It's early in the morning. I have a lot of energy...
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, we gave him too much coffee this morning or something. [Laughter]
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, yeah. I'm on my fourth cup, so you better let me talk here, Rob, okay?
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Thanks, Dave.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So, yeah. Let me kind of set up a little perspective, and I'll answer your question very
directly. So, you start out with a bookings cadence in 2011, bookings in the first half of the year were about $12.5
billion. The balance of a little better of $14 billion was in the back half of the year. Following the same sort of pace and
cadence as we go into 2012, just say, roughly speaking, 40%, 45% in the first half, the balance in the back half of the
year.
That's kind of from a company level viewpoint. So, you take this down, wanted to translate into from a domestic sales
standpoint a full-year basis, we see ourselves being down in the low-single-digits, say, 2%, 3%-ish. From an
international standpoint, mid to-high single-digits and then you kind of run through the math, and that takes you to
about flat on the year, maybe plus 1% to down 1%. And if you want to bookend the book-to-bill ratio today, again, it's
early in the year, but you could be anywhere in the, say, the slightly under 1 to maybe upwards of 1.04, 1.05, right in
that neighborhood.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Excellent, excellent. Thank you very much, Dave.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.
<A - William H. Swanson>: I won't add anything to that.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Now, Bill's tackling me.

<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Bill, how are you thinking about the potential for the sequester, and how do you plan for that,
given that it's unlikely anything is going to be resolved until post the Presidential election?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Well, what we do here is since modeling and sim is a good part of our business, we look
at both the upside and the downside, and what it means. And the other thing that we look at, I mean, the key things are
the versatility of our portfolio. I've always been trained when one door closes another door opens. Here, the way we
talk about it in our company, is trying to figure out the second and third order effects of every decision.
So for us, what we look at is, we still have to figure out how to train fight and equip, and we have to do it in this new
environment. And given that we've got 8,000 programs and 15,000 contracts, we go through a pretty good analysis of
figuring out, okay, this is what the normal budget would be, and if we did go to sequestration, what would they do, and
how would we handle it, where do we offset it. Clearly, for us, if I think about what the Sec. Def. says, he still wants to
have the strongest military in the world, he believes the forces will be smaller, but still significant, he wants them agile,
flexible, rapid, et cetera, he wants to focus on the balance of global posture, which is really the Pacific region, MENA,
and he wants to work on partnerships.
So, if I think through that part, our international strategy really ties in nice. We also tie into the front part and he wants
to be able to confront multiple aggressors and wants to continue to invest in defense technology. And so, when I think
of all of the things that he wants to do in the current environment, and what sequester would do to them, we would look
at it and make sure that we see the telltale signs of it as things happen, and that, as a company, we have plans in place
to be able to handle that. And so, from our standpoint, we know what to do if the worst happens. Spending my time on
the Hill, we're not hearing about the worst happening. They're trying to figure out ways around this, but we'll see what
will happen. But in any case, plus, middle, or down, I can assure you that the company has plans in place to be able to
handle that.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. But just to be clear in terms of your forecast as it stands, say revenue forecast, it
doesn't incorporate any impact from the sequester actually coming through this year?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Right. Because if you look at it, the fiscal year 2012 and 2013 budgets have the Budget
Control Act built into them.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Right.
<A - William H. Swanson>: The only thing that could change that is if somebody decides that they're really going to
go through – go in and throw the knife and make it happen. Then I think we'll start to see that in 2014 and 2015, but
there could be some cancellations in 2013.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. As a follow-up, can you just give us an idea on DDG-1000, where that stands now in
terms of a revenue run rate? How much is going to come off, and what's the outlook for it over the next year or two?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So, this is -
<A - William H. Swanson>: I'm going to get tackled again. Go ahead.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So, right, if you, you go back to 2010, the program from a Raytheon standpoint drove
about $800 million in sales. You roll the reel forward, the program was retimed out a few more years than we originally
had anticipated. In 2011, we had about $450 million in sales from that program, and that'll come down to about $300
million in 2012 and then start to rebound about a $100 million a year after that. In other words, it'll be up to about $400
million in 2013.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And I would add something to what Dave said, is there's going to be a pretty good debate
going on now between what Zumwalt can do, and what the 51 can do. There is a GAO report out that's asking for a
pretty good analysis to be done because some of the decisions that were made back when really didn't have all the

information of what the Zumwalt can do. So, we're looking forward to seeing that first ship go in the water with its
capabilities, and we think it's going to be eye watering when people see what this new hull can do and the electronics in
the ship.

The next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky, Citi.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: I was wondering if you could on a more book picking-type question, update us on the
percentage of overall company sales, which you might get from the largest contract at this point, and maybe from your
top-10 contracts?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, let me talk a little bit about composition and diversification, since the numbers are
important to us. Only 36 of our contracts had sales greater than $100 million last year. Only one contract had sales
greater than $500 million. Only 31 contracts made up 25% of our sales. The next 25% are 132 contracts. The remaining
50% is driven by 15,000 contracts.
So, I'll give you an idea of the diversification of our portfolio, and how we look at the company. And one of the reason
why I feel sorry for all of you is because it's really hard to model us when you look at it, when you have that many
contracts in the mix. But the good part about it is it really speaks to the strength of the portfolio of smaller forces, how
do you be significant and agile, flexible and rapid, and we can do that.
And then it's you give me an opportunity to do a little bit of my thing that I like to talk about on tech wins that no one
ever reads about. And some of the wins we're having are phenomenal, where we have strategic social interaction where
we really look at helping the military understand how you engage with others with cultural differences, just to give you
an idea of the versatility of what we get into. We have another program called Sirius, which is a learning environment
of how do you mitigate cognitive-based biases. So, when analysts look at things, you have built in biases, and we're
working with gamers and other to help analysts understand how you get those biases out when you look data or
information.
And then we have our high-frequency surface wave radar systems where we can do costal defense with unbelievable
area coverage far enough out. I mentioned our virtual simulation, we had an international award there, but now
countries are realizing they can do training in a different way, especially when you realize the youth is very
comfortable with virtual worlds.
And then we have work we do for the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast capability, ADS-B, which is the air
traffic control work that we're doing there. And then we've got railgun pulse forming networks, we kind of see those in
the movies, the Transformers and stuff, but that's the stuff this company is involved in. So, a broad-based portfolio, lots
of tech wins going on that help us here in future, if that helps.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: That does. And then, just one quick follow-up, if we look at margins out over the next
several years, Dave, I think you mentioned that international as far as the revenue rate, kind of, picking up into the back
half of the year, I'm guessing, that moves into 2013 as well. Can you confirm or just give us some color as to what

margin rates do when international becomes a greater mix of your overall business. Do they stay at current levels or
actually move higher as that mix moves more towards international?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, so, we performed well in 2011. I understand that's in the rearview mirror. That was a
result, primarily of controlling and managing our cost structure, and we'll continue to do that as we move forward. As
we shift more toward international, we do see that benefiting the company from a returns standpoint. So, I would
suggest that we will continue to focus the group on return on sales and managing the cost structure and capitalizing and
leveraging on our international business.
One of things that you have to keep in mind is, and we've said in the past, the numbers you see are the company
average. So, there's a lot of programs that are to the left of that average and some programs to the right of that average.
And internally, we continue to focus on programs that are to the left of center and continue to try to drive the company
toward improving overall returns for the company as we move ahead. So, hope that helps.

Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr, Cowen & Company.
<Q – [05H4HJ-E]Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.> Yes. Thanks, an awful lot, and good quarter.
<A>: Thank you, Cai.
<Q – [05H4HJ-E]Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.> So, and also – thank you. I mean, I've followed the company for, I
don't know, over 25 years. Nice to see you breakout single line item total Patriot orders. I always thought it was like 25
programs, nice to admit that it's really one major area. So, anyway, so you had $3.1 billion of orders, and it looks like
your book-to-bill was well over 1 and you indicated the DDG is coming down this year, but we've gone two years with
book-to-bill at IDS kind of over 1.1. With the rebound at DDG next year, I mean, in 2013, I mean, and the growing
backlog on Patriot and, I mean, is anyway we're not going to have a good sales gain at IDS in 2013?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, it's – I like your analysis. We're not talking about 2013, but I would suggest that if
you stand back and look at the performance of IDS and the large awards and the duration of these contracts as they start
to ramp up, I think we'll see a good, solid year for IDS in 2013 on top of a strong year in 2012.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: But then, you had you projected that margins are going to be down and yet you have a big
incremental backlog add from the Patriot, and the Saudi work is your second Config 3 customer. So, shouldn't the
profitability be at least as good, if not improving?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: There's a lot of moving parts and you have to, firstly, keep in mind that the margin, by and
large, as we look again in the rearview mirror was driven by the productivity actions and those at some point in time,
either real-time or in a fairly short period of time, get repriced in the contracts. So, that's part one.
Part two is the larger program that we are recently awarded in IDS and some other ones that we anticipate being
awarded this year are longer duration ramp-up programs. And, as a result, given the initial risk and opportunity profile,
we have to take all that into account with respect to our booking rates, and how we see these programs from a return
perspective. So, in 2012, you're starting to see the ramp-up of some new programs and you're seeing the final phases of
some longer-term production programs. As we move into 2013 and 2014, we'll continue to push on margins, not only at
IDS, but across the company.

And the next question will come from the line of George Shapiro, Access 342.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Hi, good morning
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, George.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Hi, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Dave or Bill, I was just wondering, you usually give how much international sales grew in
the quarter, how much domestic came down, and what classified did, but unless I was sleeping on that, I didn't hear at
this time?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Well, let me try and do some of them and Dave can chime here. I think I mentioned on
the classified, they represented total year of about 12% of our bookings and 15% of the sales. It was about the same
thing in Q4 in that and classified grew about 9% year-over-year.
And we expect similar growth next year in the 8% to 10% range. On the international, for the total year, they were 29%
of the bookings and about 25% of the sales, and for the quarter, it was about 33% of the bookings and 25% of the sales.
And that was about a 7% increase year-over-year. In 2012, I think I mentioned that bookings should be about 30%,
sales around 26%, and we expect mid-single-digit increase.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, so, George one of the things – and I'll provide you a little more color. One of the
things that's important to keep in mind is there were five fewer work days overall on the quarter. So, year-over-year
from a company standpoint, adjusting for those days, we would have been up about 2% from an overall standpoint. But
when you just run the pure math and you don't normalize for days, classified would have been down about 5%. But it's
not a good comp because you're comparing a little bit of apples-and-oranges, and I think that's maybe what you were
looking for.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And the one thing I would add that we didn't chat about, but cyber continues to grow for
us. We both have the white and the black world here, classified and non-classified. But the good news is the way we
look at the classified and the way we can, but we can't report on it. But, clearly for us, we saw a double-digit increase
last year in cyber and for your all benefit, DRPs are starting to see an uptick in this world. So, we're feeling a pretty
good about where cyber is going.
And to kind of put it in perspective, I think we've got about 2,000 people, work professionals, working on the ones and
zeros side and an equal number working on making sure that our solutions are inside our products as we go. So, that's
why it makes it hard for us, compared to anybody else that we do it in the product and services plus we do it internally.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: So, Dave, putting in all it together, how much was domestic down on both adjusted and
unadjusted basis?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: In the fourth quarter I can give you the unadjusted, it was down just a little under 7.5%.
But, again, George, and this is important, so I want to – I'll re-emphasize that those five days have a big swing in all of
these numbers. And if you want to do it analytically, you can, I'll leave that to you, which is fine. But just on an – just
on an arithmetic basis, it was down a little under 7.5%. Again, that's not a good comp because of the five less work
days.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: And then just one slightly different question, you're projecting NCS sales in 2012 to be
down to flat to down a little bit, after declining by 9% in 2011. Given the sharp declines we're seeing in the Army and
the high focus of that businesses in the Army, why wouldn't that revenue number be down by more?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. So, NCS was historically aligned with Army requirements, as you just suggested,
and priorities have shifted. So, when we look at C4I, they have one or two meaningful international prospects in 2012.
And we would expect them to ramp up during the year. It's also important to note that they have some real opportunity

to expand in the homeland security area. So, I guess the summary is they're ramping down in the second-gen EO Army
business and shifting more toward international areas of C4I, homeland security and virtual or simulation training.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Plus, I'd add their air traffic control, radar and systems business is picking up because
international air traffic is growing. And for us, we see homeland security increasing, I think last year we had sales
around $760 million, if you go back a couple of years ago, that was about $532 million. And we expect homeland
security to grow in the low-single-digits, and that's one of the strengths of NCS.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay, thanks. That's a good answer.
