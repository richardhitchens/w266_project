Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q3 earnings announcement of Sara Lee.
This is a very special one, as this is the last earnings call as Sara Lee Co., and I think as of the next time we'll have two
separate companies performing the call.
Before going to the presentation, let me take you through the order of the call. First of all, I will start with the pure play
progress, followed by Mark taking you through the financials and then we take a deep dive into the two companies,
Coffee & Tea will be taken by myself and then Marcel will take you through the Meat, and then we go into the Q&A,
as Melissa just said.
Let me then take you through the progress of pure play. I mean, the presentation is getting shorter and shorter as we are
nearing the end. And so the key milestones, what have we done in this quarter? The IRS Private Letter Ruling, it's
done, signed, sealed, delivered, very good. I mean, the results were in line with expectations, somewhat above. The
debt tender offers and redemption are completed, which was done in March. The D.E MASTER BLENDERS Investor
Day happened on March 13 and 14, also there I think it's been completed, the strategy given and the guidance given.
The SEC review, we filed the F-1 on the 1 of March. I can say that all the SEC reviews and the process is going
completely according to our plans and we feel very comfortable. The debt raise for D.E MASTER BLENDERS, also
that one is going according to plan and we'll hope to announce something in the next couple of weeks in terms of the
results of that debt raise.
So, what are the critical days from now until, as you've in the press release, June 30, which will be the date of the spin
so that as of July 1 both of the companies will be up and running. And the important thing still is the announcement of
the boards. That will happen in the next couple of weeks. We will announce who will be on the boards of the Sara Lee
current board members as well as we will announce some new board members who will join both of the companies.
Investor meetings are going on. D.E MASTER BLENDERS is on the road in May and June, and Meat Co, as you have
hopefully gotten the invitation, will have its Investor Day by June 5. And then the following road shows are happening
in June.
The special dividend will occur immediately after the spin-off. And the spin there, as I said before, we are saying the
end of June, but to be very specific, June 30 is the day we're all aiming for so that over the weekend July 1 we are up
and running. So that's all about the spin off. We feel very comfortable. I think we are really making sure that things are
happening the way we want them to happen.
And let me then take you through to Mark, who will take you through the financials. Mark?
Mark A. Garvey
Thank you, Jan. Good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to start by reviewing some key financial highlights for
the quarter. Overall results were mixed, adjusted net sales for continuing operations grew by 3%. In the North
American Meat businesses we're seeing a stabilization of volume trends. Overall volumes were almost flat for the
quarter compared to declines in the previous two quarters.
In Coffee & Tea, we continued to see strong pricing and positive mix, as sales of single-serve capsules do well.
However, this positive trend was partially offset by lower volumes. Adjusted operating income from continuing
operations decreased 5% for the quarter and was up 6% year-to-date. A number of factors impacted our results. Volume
softness at both businesses has led to some manufacturing inefficiencies which we are working to mitigate. In addition,
both businesses are managing through stranded costs and will continue to do so in fiscal 2013.
Finally, we had negative commodity mark-to-market results in the quarter, which led to a variance of $18 million
compared to the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations was down $0.02, to $0.20
for the quarter. Year-to-date earnings per share was up $0.10, to $0.65.

Looking ahead to the full year, we are beginning to see commodity costs decline in the Coffee & Tea business and
stabilize in our Meat business. This should have some beneficial impact on our fourth quarter result, particularly for
Coffee & Tea, and gives us confidence that we will end up within our existing guidance ranges.
To be more precise, we expect adjusted earnings per share to fall in the middle of our guidance range of $0.89 to $0.95
which we provided at the beginning of this fiscal year and, as you'll see later, our earnings per share expectation has
benefited from more favorable expectations on interest expense and tax costs for the year. For net sales and adjusted
operating income, we expect actual results to be at the low end of the current guidance ranges.
Now we'd like to look at our results in some more detail. On this slide you can see a summary of our third quarter and
first nine month performance for continuing operations. As I mentioned, adjusted net sales grew by 3% for the quarter
and 4.9% year-to-date. We did see price increases exceeding commodity cost increases from both businesses in the
quarter, the first quarter since the third quarter of fiscal 2010, in fact, that we have had pricing ahead of commodities in
all segments
However, gross margins declined, as the benefit of price increases outpacing commodity costs were offset by
manufacturing inefficiencies in both businesses as well as the impact of discounts to move aged inventory in our U.S.
Meats business.
MAP spend excluding acquisitions and currency was down for the quarter, with increased MAP at Meats and lower
MAP at Coffee & Tea. For the year-to-date, MAP is up 3.2%. Selling, general and administrative costs excluding MAP
were down 7% in the quarter, primarily due to lower costs at Meat Company, Incorporated, partially offset by increased
Coffee & Tea costs because of stranded overheads remaining following the Household & Body Care and International
Bakery dispositions.
In addition, as we approach the spin, both businesses are building their standalone corporate functions, and these costs
are included in their segment results. Overall, adjusted operating income was down 4.7% for the quarter but up 6.3%
year-to-date and the adjusted operating margin was 10.5% for the quarter and 10.9% for the first nine months.
Turning to Coffee & Tea, as you can see here, adjusted net sales were up almost 5% for the quarter, a lower increase
than prior quarters as price increases began to lap last year's increases. We saw good mix results for the quarter with
capsules performing well. These strong pricing and mix results were offset, however, by lower volumes, some of which
are non-recurring in nature, which Jan will discuss later, and also we had lower green coffee sales. MAP was down in
the quarter as funds were partially reallocated to support volume actions in selected smaller markets and to foster
upcoming innovations, but MAP is up 7.1% year-to-date.
SG&A costs were up in Coffee, primarily due to stranded costs, increased spending behind innovations, some of which
were shown at the recent Investor Day, and the buildup of standalone costs for the new business. Overall, adjusted
operating income was down 8.7% for the quarter but up 2.9% year-to-date.
The primary drivers of operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date for Coffee & Tea are outlined on this
slide. As you can see, price increases of $84 million exceeded commodity cost increases of $58 million for the quarter,
a trend which you should see continue into the fourth quarter. MAP was $9 million lower and SG&A cost was $17
million higher, as just explained.
Now let me turn to the North American Meats financials, which include the North American Retail and Foodservice
segment. Adjusted net sales rose 1.3% for the quarter and 0.6% year-to-date. We have seen improving volume trends
over this year, particularly in our Meat categories, whereas our Bakery categories remain soft.
Gross margins were impacted by discounts on the sale of aged inventories, as well as the impact of lower volumes
leading to manufacturing inefficiencies. MAP spending increased 29% for the quarter behind new product
introductions and the Aidells business. Overall adjusted operating segment income fell by 7.1% for the quarter due to
softer gross margin results, higher MAP, partially offset by reduced selling, general and administrative costs.
You can see from this slide that the pricing in the North American business exceeded commodity costs for the quarter,
although there's still a deficit year-to-date. SG&A costs improved by $15 million in the quarter and by $41 million

year-to-date as a result of cost savings initiatives that are coming through. These savings are helping to offset stranded
costs and the buildup of standalone costs in the North American segments this fiscal year.
Overall, volume and mix were negative for the quarter with more positive trends in our Meat categories being offset by
weaker results in our Bakery categories. In addition, increased Turkey commodity sales and discounts on aged
inventory impacted gross margins this quarter. We continued to benefit from reduced corporate costs in the quarter,
although these were partially offset by unfavorable commodity mark-to-market results. Total corporate costs including
amortization and commodity mark-to-market fell by $10 million this quarter.
General corporate expenses have come down significantly, due to corporate head count reductions, lower pension and
casualty insurance costs and lower overhead expenses relating to sold companies. Additionally, as you would expect
with the spin now less than two months away, the operating segments are beginning to build their corporate structures,
so you are also seeing some migration of costs from the corporate center to the business segments. Commodity
mark-to-market results were $10 million negative for the quarter, primarily due to declining Coffee costs which
compares to a $8 million positive of the same quarter last year. This represents a negative swing of $18 million in our
operating profit versus last year's third quarter.
We now expect the total corporate costs for the year including commodity mark-to-market and amortization of
trademarks will be approximately $70 million to $80 million. As we have discussed, rising commodity costs have been
a major factor in our results in recent years. And the good news is that we are seeing some improving trends in this
area. In particular, our Arabica and Robusta prices are declining, and the North American Meats business is also seeing
some stabilization in their basket of commodities.
On this slide you can see the commodity inflation we have absorbed in fiscal 2011 and in the first three quarters of
fiscal 2012, adding to about $1 billion of cost headwind. Based on the current direction of our more significant
commodity inputs, we are currently not anticipating any significant commodity inflation in Q4, which will benefit our
last quarter result. We expect that these trends, should they continue, will also benefit both businesses in fiscal 2013, in
particular the Coffee & Tea business. In the third quarter, we incurred $131 million of significant items, with the most
significant charges related to the termination of a prior Philips agreement in connection with the acquisition of the
Senseo trademark.
Secondly, similar to our first and second quarters, we incurred spin-related advisory costs which we have included in
significant items. These costs include accounting and tax-related costs and legal compliance and consulting costs
associated with establishing the two new companies.
We now estimate that full-year significant items will be approximately $550 million based on plans approved to-date,
and that 60% of the items recorded in significant items will generate a positive return for the future new companies,
such as the benefits from the acquisition of Senseo, adjusting IT contracts, streamlining functional areas and
establishing the new capital structures for both companies.
We estimate the after-tax costs of these significant items would be approximately $350 million. In the fourth quarter
and following the spin we expect to release approximately $700 million in deferred tax liabilities related to the
repatriation of foreign earnings. This amount will be included in significant items in the fourth quarter, but has not been
included in the $550 million significant item expense estimate for the year.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.20 for the third quarter, down $0.02 from the same quarter a year ago, primarily
due to reduced adjusted operating income. Year-to-date earnings per share was $0.65, an increase of 18%, primarily
due to improved adjusted operating income, lower net interest expense and a reduced share count. This slide
summarizes the reported to adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter and year-to-date. The largest impact for the
quarter came from significant items, which I just discussed, impacting earnings per share by $0.15.
Now I would like to turn to working capital and provide you with an overview of how we are looking at trade working
capital for Coffee & Tea and Meat Co. For the third quarter, trade working capital at Coffee & Tea was 21% of net
sales, a 19 basis point increase from the prior year.

Page 5 of 20
Year-to-date, average working capital has increased by 245 basis points to 20.8%. As you can see, this has been caused
primarily by inventory, which has been impacted by commodity cost increases. Coffee & Tea is developing plans to
reduce trade working capital as a percentage of sales to 10% by 2015, with a future goal of 5%.
On the next slide, you can see the same metrics for Meat Co, where the results of focused working capital management
are beginning to bear fruit. In North America, trade working capital is 7.7% of net sales for the quarter, showing
improvement of 106 basis points from fiscal 2011, mostly driven by improvements in payables.
Now I would like to give you an update on overall cash flow and our anticipated year-end cash and debt balances. In
the third quarter, cash flow from operations was an outflow of $173 million compared to an inflow of $59 million last
year. The decrease was primarily due to higher cash payments for significant items, which included $73 million of
termination payments paid to Philips. In addition, there were refundable sales tax payments of $43 million, primarily
related to the Senseo trademark acquisition. These refundable taxes will ultimately come back to Coffee & Tea.
For the year-to-date, cash from operations was an outflow of $140 million, a reduction from an inflow of $292 million
in fiscal 2011. The year-to-date decrease is primarily attributed to a significant decline in cash generated from
discontinued operations as divestitures were completed, higher cash payments for significant items, a one-time €60
million payment to the Netherlands pension plan in the first quarter and the refundable tax payments I just discussed.
As we plan for the new capital structures of Meats and Coffee, we completed the purchase of $970 million of
outstanding notes just after the quarter-end. This consisted of redemption of $500 million of 2013 notes and the
acceptance of tenders amounting to $470 million related to the 2020 and 2022 notes.
The remaining debts of Meat Co of approximately $940 million will have a gross blended interest rate of approximately
4.75% for fiscal 2013. We are currently in the process of raising debt for Coffee & Tea, and we expect to announce the
results of this process very shortly. We continue to expect both companies to have solid investment grade credit ratings
following the spin.
Finally, I would like to close with an overview of our guidance for the year. With eight weeks to go to the end of the
year, we can provide a more refined view of where we expect the year to end. As mentioned earlier, adjusted earnings
per share is expected to fall in the middle of the previously communicated guidance range of $0.89 to $0.95. We expect
net sales and adjusted operating income for the year to come in at the low end of our previously communicated
guidance ranges of $7.9 billion to $8.15 billion for net sales and $875 million to $930 million for adjusted operating
income.
Primarily due to the early redemption of debt, we expect interest expense to be approximately $65 million for the year,
which is down from our previous guidance of $80 million. Additionally, we now estimate that the tax rate will be
approximately 33% for the year.
We are also reiterating our year-end cash and debt balance guidance, and we expect year-end cash and debt balances to
be approximately $300 million and $1.79 billion, respectively, for the combined companies. We have maintained the
average dollar/euro rate at $1.35 for the year. You may recall that we initially issued our guidance last August, we had
assumed a dollar/euro rate of $1.44 for the year and we have not adjusted guidance for the currency decline during the
year, this was an approximate EPS headwind of $0.04, which we have absorbed.
So, overall, albeit a mixed quarter, we're pleased that we will deliver results within our guidance range. We're
encouraged to see positive trends in commodity prices. We're on track to execute the spin and to set both new
businesses up for a successful future.
With that, let me hand it over to Jan to provide you with some more insights on the Coffee & Tea business.
Jan Bennink
Thank you very much, Mark. Let's now move this over to the Coffee & Tea Company, or D.E MASTER BLENDERS
as it will be called as of July 1. Before going into the numbers, what I would like to say, let's take the key messages,

what are the messages we really – what happened in this quarter. I think, first and foremost, very important that we
continue – we see continued good performance of our branded business in all business sectors, being it Western
Europe, being it the Rest of the World and Out-of-Home. What do I mean by branded business? The branded business
is our business, excluding the exports, which I will come back to in a minute.
The underlying margins and excluding currency mark-to-market are improving. Now, currency mark-to-market is
something which we've announced that we will take out of the operating line as of July 1, because they can be positive,
they can be negative, and I think we've had some favorable things in the first quarter, they're negative at the moment.
So I think if you look at the underlying margins, they see a very positive trend and I think we'll come back to that later,
but I think that's the key of the story.
The key Western European countries continue to perform well. I think that is encouraging news also because Western
Europe, as we all know, is not in the most economically favorable climates. But I think our key countries, being
Holland, France and Spain, which comprise about 70% to 80% of our Western Europe business, are doing very well.
Innovation is coming on stream and we've launched the premium range, as we call it, and say – kind of, we call it
almost a make-or-break in our jargon here, is doing very well. Although one bird doesn't make a summer, the initial
results are positive.
In Q4, we'll continue with a new packaging and line extension in the capsules. Also we will relaunch completely in
terms of convenience and in terms of packaging our important tea range in Spain. And then the bigger launches of
Senseo, Senseo brand and their launch of [ph] Cervista (20:27) are continuing as planned in the summer as well as Q1,
Q2 for this year. So everything is on track to begin delivering as announced in the Investor Day.
The positive effect of the decrease in raw materials, unfortunately, doesn't come through in Q3, because, as you all
know, we've done some forward buying and I think that's a principle which we'll prefer also going forward. So actually
the results of the lower coffee prices, which you've all seen and which you all follow probably, if you look at the
company day by day, are not reflected in Q3 but, will, as Mark already said, will be reflected in Q4. And going
forward, they will also create a good tailwind as well as for Q1 as well as for hopefully the rest of fiscal 2013.
Our SG&A costs have increased. Mark already alluded to it, due to the stranded cost of our sale of our bakery in Spain
as well as in France. We have one-time investment costs. I mean, the one-time probably sounds a bit weird, but the
one-time investment costs are costs which come from ramping up very fast our innovation pipeline. This is not
something which will occur all the time but it's like – it's an additional expense we've had in the last three months. And
not mentioned on the slide but I think also here and there are some additional costs, of course, with the ramp up of our
standalone costs. All these costs, I can assure you, are under a severe – we're looking at severely and making sure that
these costs will go out as quickly as they potentially can. I won't promise that they will go to zero, but we'll minimize
them as quickly as we can.
The quarterly sales results are dampened by the decision to reduce our green coffee exports. If you really look at our
branded business, the growth of the branded business has been 8.6%, while we report a 4.6%. Why did we kind of
decide to go out of the export business? And, again, we've announced it in the Investor Day, it's a low margin business
and it carries extremely high inventories. So if you look at the total business model of the exports, it is actually a
loss-making proposition so that's why we decided to reduce them, not completely to zero, but reduce them to a
minimum level as possible and that goes very fast. I will come back to the numbers later.
There is a weaker performance in selected small countries. We focused a lot in the last six months in seeing all the
changes we've had on the bigger countries who deliver. The smaller countries have had some pressure on pricing, and I
would specifically mention one competitor, Tchibo, who has done some very aggressive pricing both in Germany as
well as in Eastern Europe, which kind of reduced our volumes in the countries where we play together. We've put
actions in place to make sure that we get the right balance between margins in one hand and the volumes in the other.
And last but not least, I don't want to put this in as an excuse, but quarter three has been a period of transition. Four out
of the nine [ph] EXCO (23:23) members are new, I mean, not to mention the CEO, CFO, the COO Operations and the
Western European regional head who will actually – or actually started on Monday. So a lot of changes happening, no

excuses, but that's basically what has been happening in Q3.
Let me now take you through some more specific numbers, going to the next page. If you look at what I said, the good
sales of the branded business. I mean, here you see that the export, which didn't have a real effect in Q1 and Q2
because they were more or less aligned with the branded business in Q3 after the decision to let them go and to reduce
them. You see a 36% decline in exports, and as a result you see an 8.2% increase in our branded business. I think that's
the underlying growth business, which is important.
Going to the next page, where you will see the growth split by the three segments as we have identified them, Western
Europe, Rest of the World and Out-of-Home, with Western Europe being the hero at 10.5% growth, the Retail business
growing at 8.4% and Out-of-Home stabilizing kind of at 2%, 3% percent as we've seen during the quarters, so getting
us to the 8.2%.
How is the volume mix built up? As you see on the next page you see and, Mark said it before, you see a beautiful
increase in mix. I think that's what we are aiming for also going forward. The whole game is about premiumization of
our products, making sure that we sell more higher-margin products and I think the mix effect makes it very clear.
We're talking about premium Roast & Ground business, we are talking about the capsules, we're talking about the
Senseo pads. So that, I think, at least shows us results.
Price, as you can expect, is an effect which is lessening. We started to increase the prices aggressively as of the
beginning of calendar year 2011. So here, of course, you'll see a lessening effect. And volumes remain at a negative
level, at 7.3% versus 6.5% in Q2. Why do the volumes decline 7.3%? I think if you go to next page you will have a
little explanation. Also here we've mentioned clearly the two before, the French private label and the Thai flooding, if
you take those two elements out, the total underlying business is declining by 3.9%.
Now the question which I've got a lot on the road is when are these effects going out, so when are we seeing the real
results. So if you go to the next page, you'll see that the French private label, we've been taking that into consideration
as of the summer of last year, so as of Q1 of the new fiscal that, in fact, that French private label is out of the system, so
that's good for comparison reasons.
The Thai factory, I mean, is up and running again. When we started back somewhere in March, we've started to
campaign to get our brand back on its feet. And actually we do that in April, and we expect it will last a little bit, but
probably three quarters maximum to get us back to where we were. And hopefully we'll get even a bit better because
we're going to put a lot more focus on our Asian countries. Thailand has been performing very well and where we see
big opportunities.
Now the 3.9%, as I said before a little bit in my keynotes of decline in smaller countries, that is – the big countries are
doing well. Some smaller countries due to price pressure are performing less. They're very clearly identified with the –
there's probably three countries which contribute most to this volume loss and we're putting actions in place to make
sure that we get the right balance between margins on one hand and making sure that the volume losses will be reduced
to zero. A similar principle as we've applied in Meats over the last six months to nine months. So even there is I think
in volume growth recovery, that's what we expect and hopefully the volume from a minus 7.9%, we are working hard
to get it back to a neutralizing zero.
Now we've talked about the underlying margins on the currency mark-to-market. So it's good to see if you strip that
out, as we will do as of next year, what has been the progress in our underlying margins of our business? So you see
that in Q4 we had 11.7% ex-mark-to-market. You see the numbers of the reported number below, so it's a 11.7%,
12.1%, 13.6% and 14.7% for this quarter. So if you look at this, I think actually our underlying business is performing
well, our margins are increasing and that's exactly where we're aiming at, making sure that our business gets back to, as
we said, historical levels.
So key countries, Western Europe. We've mentioned before because we've taken out Holland, France and Spain, as the
one who we should follow up on. What are the market shares doing? We've had, in Holland, very positive news. I
mean, in the first quarter we've seen a 55.4% market share after it's almost a percentage point pick up in the first
quarter. We expect this to continue based on what we're doing in Holland. We're putting a lot of focus on it. Also the

premium launch we'll see starting its affect in the next quarter. So that's not reflected in this 55.4%. So overall, very
happy with Holland, back to the high levels where we're used to.
France, our jewel, what can I say more than this chart? I think it is – if you would like to design the chart, it's probably
the ideal way of doing it, 25.9% market share versus 24.7% in the second half of last year. So continued very positive
sales in France. Spain, and we made a huge jump in the second half last year, we were able to hold onto the high levels.
So also there we see very positive growth in terms of volume, in terms of market share, and I'd say in one of Western
Europe's most depressed countries, we feel actually pretty happy.
Now here, during Investor Day I've got a lot of people asking this Roast & Ground business, this thing which we are
proposing, how is it doing? Because you've been in the market for four weeks and is it doing well, is it doing not so
well? Management wouldn't like me to show this yet, but I think we owe it to you to see that how are the initial results.
And I'm stressing that they're initial result, it's ten weeks in the market. How are we doing?
And you see that the premium business is up 7%, the base is up 3% – total Roast & Ground is up 3% since launch. And
I think those are very positive news you see, emphasis with the same promoted volume as we had in the last year. So
there's no extra promotion, there's just similar comparable numbers. You see that actually customers like change, they
want to have change, they want to see new things, and after 40 years of doing nothing, it is very beautiful to see that
they react to this.
Also our shares, we've seen some indication of our premium shares, the real shares will come out a little bit later, but
they're close to doubling of the premium segment. So, very good results, but keep in mind it's ten weeks in the game,
but very encouraging. In Q4 what you will see more of, you'll see a launch of the new capsules and packaging and
product extension in Q4. The same thing as I said before, you'll see a complete re-launch of our tea range. And this is
high margin, an important part of the Spanish business of the Hornimans brand extending of the lines, better and more
convenient packaging and a big extension in terms of flavors. And the market in tea is growing in Spain, so here also a
very big re-launch in of one of our key Western European countries. And this is all preparing ourselves for the bigger
tornado in summer and Q2 of next year, Q1, Q2.
Now, let me stop for a second on raw materials. I think we've talked a lot about raw materials. I mean, you've seen the
magnificent charge of Mark, where we've see $1 billion of headwinds we had in terms of raw materials over the last
two years. I think that is hopefully and luckily seeing what everybody can see, going the other way. The favorable raw
materials are starting to creep in in Q4, getting into Q1, and hopefully if prices will continue to go as the way we're
seeing it now, we will have a significant tailwind in the full fiscal year of next, which is very good news and very
encouraging in the time of the spin.
Lots of people have asked prices, what are you doing, because you see market prices of $1.85, $1.80, there's Arabica,
there's Robusta. So here what we've done is giving you an overview of what the market average prices have been over
the first nine months, which you'll see here on the chart, $2.42 for Arabica and Robusta $1.02.
In our prices in the first three quarters have been $2.63 and $1.14, so we've been actually buying higher than the market
and then sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. For Q4 and Q1, we have now locked all our purchases until October
and here you see the locked in prices from now until October, $2.26 for Arabica and $1.04 Robusta. So you can see
here the pricing reflected for the next seven months to come. I have to note that these are numbers excluding Brazil
because it is a bit of a specific market, so but at least it gives you an idea of what's in the numbers, what can you expect
and give a bit more transparency in terms of where we are in terms of our markets.
Before handing it over to Marcel, what is the business working on, what are we making sure is delivered? The small
countries who've been dragging us down a bit in volume, there is a very active – there's an active plan to make sure that
the countries are going back on track and getting the attention they need. Fixed cost, I mean, you've seen the SG&A in
this quarter. I cannot say that there is – you cannot put more attention to the fixed cost as the team is currently doing.
They really want to go after them and are making sure that the targets, which you have heard from Michiel, as he has
given them very clearly that they will be reached.

And I hope they will do slightly better, but let's make sure that they reach them. The working capital at the atrocious
level of 21% for this quarter, that is, you all know my targets, 5% is what I've mentioned and I wouldn't mention the
other number, which is even better. But also there we're working on – we will be helped a lot by eliminating our export
sales, because export sales is in our best estimates representing around 5% of our working capital. So reducing that
inventory level and reducing exports will help us a lot to get working capital down fast.
Innovations to market, you've seen the effects, and this is very initial and I say it again, of our break. Innovations are
critical to the market. We need to innovate, we need to change, we need to make sure that the promise that Michiel
made that no SKU will be unturned in the 24 months will really happen. It is a stretch for the organization, but we will
make it work. And now with a new management board in place, I think that's something where they put a lot of focus
on.
The organization has to be focused, has to make – we have make sure that it works well. Will there be ups and downs?
Absolutely, it won't be perfect. There will be some flaws coming in. And as we said, it is a transitional year coming
forward but, I feel pretty comfortable that all the promises made on March 13, 14 will be met.
So having said this, we'll put it over to Marcel who will take you through the Meat Co.
Marcel H. M. Smits
Thank you, Jan, and good morning to everybody on the call. Now before I start, let me just note one more time that we
have an Investor Day coming up with our new CEO, Sean Connolly, on June the 5. I'm very pleased to see the
enthusiasm and experience he brings to the party, and therefore I'm not going to steal has thunder. So let me just keep
this short and crisp with a quick update. You will recall from our earlier earnings calls that we've been working hard to
stabilize our volume trends while protecting profitability. And in the early part of fiscal 2012, we came to the
conclusion that we needed to dial back on pricing selectively in order to protect our competitive position. And
fortunately, we were concurrently working through a large cost reduction which allowed us to be more competitive
without jeopardizing too much of our bottom line.
So this is where we're on the slide. The volume in the first quarter – in the quarter showed another sequential
improvement. We were close to flat, aided a bit by the timing of the Easter holiday, but an improvement nevertheless.
Jimmy Dean and Aidells continued to be our best performers, and we've had some good innovation coming through, in
particular in Jimmy Dean, Aidells, Ball Park, Sara Lee Bakery and Hillshire. And in the quarter we were steadily on air
to support innovations and we will do the same in the fourth quarter. Ball Park will be on air for the first time in a
couple of years.
One of the many things we changed in fiscal 2012 was a move of some of our smaller customers through a broker.
And, as you will recall, we had some teething problems as we went through the transition, but we're making good
progress in getting them sorted. And then last but not least, our effort to reduce cost are helping to protect the bottom
line.
That said, there's further work to be done. In lunchmeat we are still challenged and, frankly, we've been out-innovated.
Management of the business is very focused on the entire spectrum of product and packaging innovation, as well as a
refresh of the brand positioning. And in the meantime, we're shoring up our position with [ph] taxable (37:10) pricing,
but that's not the long-term solution. A bit more of that to come on the Investor Day.
The Bakery business also needs further work. It's a business, especially on the Foodservice side, which is the bigger
part by the way, where we are pretty severely challenged by headwinds from consumers forgoing their desserts on a
large-scale in efforts to cut expenses.
On the Retail side, the issue is in intense price competition. And on both sides the company has work to do. The third
element that impacted performance in the third quarter were efforts to move aging inventory. The incoming team has
had a hard look at what volumes will be achieved realistically going forward and have cleared out what they believe
was overhang. So that is in short an overview of the key points for the quarter.

Now let us look into a bit more detail on the points that I've just made. Here are the volume trends. As you can see,
we're making progress quarter-by-quarter. And that's in the red box. Minus 5.7% in Q1, minus 3.5% in Q2 and minus
0.6% in Q3. We're up against a relatively soft prior-year volumes in Q4, but at the same time, we will have to make up
for the timing difference of Easter, which gave us some tailwind in Q3.
We're working through the impact of increased commodity costs, and in Q3 we are still reporting a 4.3% price increase.
Going forward, that figure will gradually decline assuming commodity costs hold at or below current levels. And it's
not unrealistic to expect that as pricing pressures ease over time, that will help volume.
And here are some of the growth figures for both Jimmy Dean and Aidells, for which we believe we have bragging
rights. Jimmy Dean has held up wonderfully, despite commodity cost increases and competitive challenges. Aidells is a
great addition to our portfolio and our business has learned valuable lessons from Aidells and is adopting elements of
its management mix. As we did in the last quarter, here we're making the split between our Meats categories versus
Bakery categories and our total North America Meat Co. operations. We're pleased with sequential improvements in
Meat categories, where we were positive in the third quarter.
In the red box, you can see the impact of the Bakery categories. There's a sequential improvement, but we're far from
satisfied. As I just indicated, we're working through teething problems with the transfer of our smaller customer
accounts through a broker. This move will give us a cost benefit and eventually, we believe, also a volume benefit. The
good news is that we're gradually improving, as you can see in the red bar, but there's still work to do.
Now, we have some interesting innovation coming through. Ball Park has launched frozen beef patties. That's a
shortcut to making a perfect cheeseburger or hamburger. It's an interesting proposition as an extension to our hot dog
business, which we believe we can do under the Ball Park brand.
We're supporting this initiative with TV advertising, which puts the Ball Park brand back on air since a couple of years.
Jimmy Dean meanwhile added new extensions to its very successful line of breakfast convenience products. Jimmy
Dean, of course, is the textbook example of how to leverage what was once a fairly narrow franchise into a much
broader offering.
As you can see here, we've made a significant step-down in SG&A expenses. It is, of course, [ph] some turmoil
(40:32), but it has given us some really nice tailwind, as you've already seen in [ph] Mark's (40:38) slides. There's more
to come and the new team is busy identifying further opportunities, which it will talk about on the June 5. You'll have
noted that the business has corporate expenses to absorb next year and some additional stranded expenses, so more has
to be done. We want to continue to invest behind our brands.
Now, let me quickly wrap it up. Business is stabilizing, but more needs to be done. Lunchmeat and Bakery categories
are core focus areas. We hired a guy to run the business who has a focus on innovation as a key business enabler, and
I'm very confident that he and his team will do well. More work to be done on the cost side, some benefits are already
baked in as a result of the restructuring taken this year, but we will need to identify more opportunities. The new team
will have a lot to talk about on June the 5 and is looking forward to engaging you in that dialogue.
And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to turn it to Q&A.

<Q - Jason English>: Couple of quick ones, first on the Meat side of the business, how much did the liquidation of
some aging meat weigh on the bottom line for the business this quarter?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Ballpark, Jason, it's a bit of a question as to exactly what you can add in and what you
can't, but ballpark it's around $10 millionish
<Q - Jason English>: That's helpful. And then moving to Coffee. The margins, particularly at the gross margin line,
you gave us the MAP and overhead so we're backing into gross margin. It looks like it was down around 180 basis
point or so against a pretty easy comp in some easing cost inflation. I know mark-to-market was a headwind, but in
light of your exit of the export business, which presumably mix is up, what were the other contributors there that
caused the shortfall?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Mark, do you have the...
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: I would say mark-to-market was clearly the biggest headwind we had in there. There were
also some manufacturing inefficiencies going through our Coffee business as well and that did cause some of the
margin weakness, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: What sort of manufacturing efficiencies or inefficiencies?
<A - Jan Bennink>: There's about a €5 million – if you took the $10 million here, I mean, you're talking about €5
million in coffee. It is just missing of very simple expectations and forecasting, buying in the wrong places. I mean, it is
a little bit of the ups and downs of change in an organization. So it's about €5 million there.
<Q - Jason English>: One thing that surprised in this quarter was the decline in MAP for the business, particularly in
Coffee Co. If we were to contemplate the amount of money you put into promo dollars versus the amount of money, so
it's a bit of shell game here, if we combined the incremental promo dollars with the MAP, would it have been up
year-on-year?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: The MAP would have been – not in the quarter, no, not in the quarter. It probably wouldn't
have been up at all, no, no, no. It was planned to be down, so there's nothing kind of extraordinary that we kind of all of
a sudden had to do things, but it was planned to be down, you know, to ramp up for Q4 more and to make sure that we
hit the right balance because the innovations are coming in later. So that's – it would not have been up, it would have
been negative.
<Q - Jason English>: So it's an innovation timing thing?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes.
<Q - Jason English>: Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Jason, the – on MAP spending, in Coffee & Tea we're up cumulative in the year, in Meat, I
think we're now up cumulative in the year and we're going to – last year we actually took a really big cut in the second
half. We're not going to do that this year. So we have a sort of a steady state of MAP expenditure.
<Q - Jason English>: Thanks a lot, guys.

<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: You talked a bit in Coffee about some of the aggressive pricing actions in some of the smaller
markets for Coffee. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in some of the key Western European markets on
that front on pricing?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yep.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: As input costs ease. And I know you talked a little bit about a one point potentially trying to
best hold onto that 70% of price. Is that still a relevant number or how's that changed a bit?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I still stick with my 70%. I mean, I'm pulling in a very closely, because I made that statement and
I've been bugged by you and lots of others, I mean, whether my 70% still holds. So far, yes. I mean, if I take the bigger
countries, I mean, we went through what has happened with our price differences between private levels and our key
competitors.
The price is going down because, of course, that's the big question. Pricing this is – and I am talking here Nielsen data,
through March, show absolutely no increase in the gap between us and private label. On the contrary, I'm seeing in
some countries even a contrary indication where private labels are coming closer to us rather than going further away.
So that's I think positive news.
In France and Spain, we've held our prices completely. I mean, that was in the negotiations. In Holland, we went down
by 5% in pricing in order to enable some of our innovations coming in faster. So in Holland somewhat down. So far,
the 70% still holds and I'll keep you posted if it doesn't work.
But so far we were good in this in the bigger countries where we put a lot of focus. In the smaller ones where we
haven't been focusing on a lot, and this is completely due to management changes and I've been focusing on the big
stuff, there you see Hungary, you see Germany, I mean, for us it's a smaller country where I would say Tchibo has been
very, very aggressive on their pricing. And I think if you looked at the coffee announcements and of late Tchibo has
announced increased sales. I think they announced it three, four days ago and I think it is just because of behind
aggressive pricing so [indiscernible] (46:40) Europe and Germany.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: That's very helpful, I appreciate it. And then just a quick follow up would be the 14.7% or so
underlying EBIT margin that you saw in coffee this quarter, is that a run rate that we can sort of build off sequentially,
or is the run rate really closer maybe to 13.5% if we were to...?
<A - Jan Bennink>: You have to be very careful with this 14.7% because I have to do in the IFRS and I think let's
make sure that – the best one to answer is Michiel, because he's been going through the IFRS conversion as no one
else. So where this – because if you take the currency out, there's another part, which is the pensions, and so I think just
we can come back to that but I think it's better that Michiel answer that question because he is all over this.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Sure, no problem there. What I was getting at is even not necessarily the absolute number I
guess, more in the quarter you also benefited the margin by about, let's call it 1 point or so due to the lower MAP just in
the quarter itself. So I know it's gotten better sequentially, but part of that was the lower MAP. So I was just trying to
get a sense of whether it is 14.7% or not, as you – as MAP goes up, ultimately, you know...
<A - Jan Bennink>: There's a lot of elements working in our favor in Q4 and I think that is – on a U.S. GAAP basis I
feel very comfortable with that 14.7% as something which I would not be afraid of saying.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: And I think, Andrew, you also get to that outcome if you do the gap analysis of what we have
achieved today to what we have to do in the last quarter in order to get to the guidance range. You'll see that the fourth
quarter is projected to be a decent quarter. And some of that is driven by commodity favorability, and particularly on
the Coffee side.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great, very helpful. Thanks very much, everybody.

Thank you. Our next question is from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Can I ask about the acquisition strategy in the Coffee business? It seems to be – there's
been a series of small bolt-on acquisitions, Tea Forte, the Coffee Company, which I think was a series of cafés in the
Netherlands, the House of Coffee business, which I think is food – an office foodservice kind of business in
Scandinavia. It feels as if you are getting to a lot of different business models there, I know they're very tiny
acquisitions, but I just wondered if could give us a few comments about whether that's going to distract management or
what you are trying to learn?
<A - Jan Bennink>: These are actually very small acquisitions. I mean, if you talk about the last one, I mean, I could
pay it easily personally out of my own pocket. It's very...
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: That says more about the personal wealth than the acquisition, by the way.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Jokes aside, jokes aside. But I mean, I think those are very small acquisitions which actually
strengthen the current business in the countries where they are. And the management, take Brazil, what we do, I mean
it's actually – they were already running this by this distributor. What we're doing as we kind of now – it's now owned
by us rather than having him as a separate entity. So there's Tea Forte, that was a business which was there and run by
itself and Peter is still running the business as if we've never been there, so he continues to run the business. So we feel
and Michel and Michiel very clearly, we make these acquisitions, keep them doing what they've been doing so far.
The Scandinavian one is actually bought by Friele, our joint venture partner. He is doing the integration, we have
nothing to do with it. So we just paid our fair share of it, so there's all – it's not a distraction. Going forward, I think it is
best to have Michiel talk about it. I mean, he talked about it a lot in – not a lot, but he talked about it in the Investor
Day. We're clearly looking at M&A opportunities which will help us to get our high-growth, high margin story and
strengthening us in parts where we are not or strengthening us in businesses where we have a business which is not
necessarily at the size we want to have it. So we can become more specific once we've gone through the whole M&A
strategy with Michel, with Michiel, and that process with the new board and I think then we can be more clear to you.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on the Meat side. Could you just give us a
couple of comments on the lessons learned from transition to the broker? It's obviously been weighing on volumes for a
few quarters now. But if you got to do it again, what would you change?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes, I think – I don't think you'd change all that much. We've had some system issues that
we needed to work through so in particular the broker – the people who moved to the broker, inside the broker there's
staff from us and there is also staff that was with the broker and they have to get onto our systems in order to support
the business in terms of promotional planning and so on and henceforth. So that has caused some hiccups. And at the
same time, we combined this with being fairly strict on promotional push. Would you do it again? I don't think you'd do
a lot different. You'd want to get it over and behind you, but in the ideal world you'd have three more months to make
[indiscernible] (51:58).
<A - Jan Bennink>: We would absolutely do it again. I think it is a wise decision. I mean, just as – the broker we're
talking about, I mean, it's a change, it's a transition, every transition you see these kind of things happening. It's a bit
worse than we had expected, but just imagine the same broker took on Kraft and Campbell. So if we were to do
something different, probably you're going to have a timing which is a bit more appropriate because I think having
three accounts of the size of Kraft and Campbell and us coming together has been challenging.

So I feel very comfortable, the choice is great, I mean, distributor is absolutely perfect. So we'll get out of it and I
would do it again because it's a better cost benefit analysis and the fact that Kraft and Campbell, just to mention two
very important American companies, do the same, I think it just reinforces the message.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: We have confidence that that's been the right move.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Thank you very much, good morning. I just had two questions I guess. The first question is a
little bit more housekeeping, which is just the cost savings targets I know you've called out, which is the $180 million
to $200 million, which was inclusive of I guess Project Accelerate. And then overall just corporate savings, has that
changed or has the timing or split between 2012 and 2013 changed? Just because now, I guess, when we started the
year, we were at $115 million for corporate expense and now we're at $70 million to $80 million, so it's just I guess the
point of the question is just the cost savings that we're seeing now, are these cost savings that you expected to maybe
partially come in 2013 but we're seeing more now than we would in 2013?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yeah, Rob, it's Mark, yeah, the answer is yes. Firstly, the $180 million to $200 million is the
target that we set, we continue to see those cost savings come through. They've come through faster, frankly, yeah,
we've seen more come through as you've seen in corporate. We're also seeing some good SG&A savings come through
in the U.S. business as well.
They've been offset somewhat by some of the softness in the gross margin side or the gross profit side that we've talked
about. We're going to see some of those flow into next year, but I think Michel Cup, when he talked about Coffee gave
you a good indication of his savings targets going forward. And on Investor Day you'll also get a good update from
Meat in terms of their investor – their savings going forward as well.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: The other thing that I think we should mention here is that the savings have come
forward...
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yeah.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: ...[indiscernible] (54:27) some of the stranded costs because some of the deals came a bit
later, some of the stranded costs have moved more into 2013 than in 2012, so the balance has shifted.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, perfect. And then another – the second question just on coffee pricing in Europe. Some
of the data that we see – I guess what it looks like is it looks like the delta between coffee prices at retail in Europe
versus prices that you're actually able to get – or across Europe just seems higher in general than what we're seeing in
the U.S.
I was just curious, as coffee costs roll-off, would you expect that the retailers should be following pricing coming down
on your end or would you expect some of the retailers in Europe to potentially try to capture some of the margin back?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I think that it's a bit following-up on the question from Andrew. I mean, I think what we see so far
is that people are pocketing the money and making sure that you build the prices and build the coffee category as much
possible. It hasn't been a very profitable category for retail in the last five years.
And then this all of a sudden now with the prices going down, also that was basically the benefit. So, will there be a
downward trend if the prices of $1.75, $1.80, $1.85 continue? The delta between the prices what they are now and what
they were are so big that you might see some of the roll back, yes, I mean, coming back to the 30% of what I mentioned
before, so 70%, hang on but that depends a little on the prices.

Comparing between Europe and the U.S., I think every market is relative, depends on the competitive environment,
depends on who is your competition. There's different prices between France and then Germany and Eastern Europe
and Holland and Spain, so there those price differences with different brands also don't really bother us. I mean, there
will be no cross-border exports. You don't have a co-brand where people can have cross-border shipments, it is every
brand stands for itself.

Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi, good morning, everybody.
<A>: Hi, Eric.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hey.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: After 15 years of following this company, maybe the best news I've heard, Jan, was when
you said this is the last quarterly call.
<A - Jan Bennink>: We will try and bother you with some more from the offspring...
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I don't know many restatements we've gone through...
<A - Jan Bennink>: ...from the mother.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, I guess first just somewhat related to going back to Andrew's question, and I realize
that the IFRS versus the GAAP and various adjustments, but you gave the like long-term goals at the Analyst Day in
Holland. But in looking at fiscal 2013 for the MASTER BLENDERS business, can you just give some sense as to kind
of sales, how we should think about volume versus pricing as F 2013 progresses as well as like EBIT growth regardless
of what the right base is, again, whether we use a GAAP or an IFRS number?
<A - Jan Bennink>: [indiscernible] (58:05) guidance of the Coffee Co. Company for fiscal 2013, yes. I understand.
We – I think it is more appropriate that that will be done in August. At the moment Michel and Michiel are giving the
guidance for the year. There will be a guidance for the year. I think if you read between the lines of what I've been
telling about the Coffee, I think we feel comfortable about Coffee, we feel very positive with the things which are
happening.
I've given you some indications of what we wanted to do with the volume, where the mix is, you know the raw material
input, you know the innovation. So I think overall if you add up everything, yes, there's organizational changes, yes
there are a couple of countries not performing in line with what we want to do, but overall message is there's nothing
which would tell me that they are any different from what we've given as a guidance for the long-term that we can't
make that. So, that's as close as I can get to giving you some help.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: No, that's fine. That's helpful. And then just on the – right, so the total company today is
paying around $0.46 a share on an ongoing dividend. How do we think about that like post-split? Because I think that
you're – if coming out of the Analyst's Day from Holland, it looked like that was going to be a somewhat lower payout
ratio. And just trying to do some pro forma calculations, it seems as if that put a very high payout ratio on the Meat Co.
in order to get back to – if in fact you're going to get back to that $0.46 or so a share to the current shareholder.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Okay, Mark?

<A - Mark A. Garvey>: So, you're right, Eric, at the Investor Day for Coffee we talked about a 30% payout ratio for
the Coffee business and that's basically where they will come out, approximately. Their board will obviously have to
approve that and management will talk to them about that very soon. For the Meats business, they'll talk about that in
Investor Day. They haven't – we haven't said yet what their ratio will be. So in terms of your question as to whether the
Meat plus the Coffee will exactly equal the Sara Lee one, it may not, frankly. So let's just wait and see what the Meats
come out with at the beginning of June. And then I think it will be very clear for both companies where the dividends
will be for the future.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then just last question. On the technical thing of the split, so we're going – so the
Coffee Company is going to list in Holland, after that it's going to pay the $3 dividend. Do know is there going to be a
when issued equity around the MASTER BLENDERS business? Like how technically is that going to work in terms of
the – with the transition from the New York Stock Exchange to European-based exchange?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yeah, I can give you some flavor for that. So if we assume that we spin on June 30, firstly,
you will get two pieces of stock, right, you'll get Sara Lee stock and you'll get D.E MASTER BLENDERS stock. And
you will immediately thereafter get the $3 dividend paid out to you as a shareholder on the D.E MASTER BLENDERS
stock.
From a technical perspective, that means a number of weeks before that we will be declaring the dividend and you
would expect for a number of weeks you will have an as and when issued trading process. I think once we have all
these approvals and the board has approved everything, we will communicate very clearly to people, A, when the
dividend gets declared, when it gets paid and when the actual as and when issued market will work and what we expect
the first trading day to be for the Sara Lee stock remaining and the actual D.E MASTER BLENDERS stock remaining.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, thanks. I'll pass it on.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Morning, Chris.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I want to ask you first about if I could, Jan, in the Coffee business and the very strong
mix performance and I guess when I put that together with the volume weakness, especially given a lot of that volume
weakness came from some of the smaller countries, I was surprised that there was not – and I should also say that
pricing was better than cost inflation. I was surprised there was not a better profit performance in the quarter. Was that
mix, is it not as profitable to the bottom line? Are there are costs to achieving that I guess for new products that are
weighing on profit growth for Coffee?
<A - Jan Bennink>: No, I think the mix has a higher gross margin, so but what's dragging the profits down is what we
said, the SG&A. I mean the volume overall, I mean, it's like you have the manufacturing, as I said the €5 million which
is in there, so it is more the cost weighing down the gross margins and not the pickup of the raw materials as we
would've liked though if it would've been on the free market.
So, I mean the mix, all the mix, especially if I talk specifically, capsules, they have a definitely a higher mix. Some of
the startup of the premium brand which have launched in Holland will have startup costs, and that's what I was
referring to a little bit in the innovation cost plus the gross margin because a lot of the things are being packed currently
still by hand, though they will pick up. So it is a bit of a mix of those four or five elements which I just said.

<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then the other question I had was just to look at or to better understand the
cost savings that you're generating in relation to the continued or the stranded overhead costs. And I guess this quarter
you had some manufacturing inefficiencies as well, so if you looked at the cost savings, say, this quarter or even as you
look ahead, I'm trying to understand how those cost savings would match up with the stranded overhead costs and the
inefficiencies that occurred?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yeah, we just talked about it little bit earlier but, again, those cost savings are coming in
earlier than we'd anticipated, so it's helping in corporate, it's helping in North America. North America doesn't have a
huge push on stranded this year because they are getting the benefit of transition services agreements as we've sort of
doubled the Bakery and obviously worked with Bimbo in terms of transition. Once they come to an end, they will
actually have a push on stranded overhead next year.
So to some extent you have to realize that will hurt them a little bit next year. On Coffee, you've seen the stranded
overhead come in significantly this year and I think cost savings have helped somewhat. We've also had some margin
softness which has offset that. But, overall, you think about our cost savings, Chris, of the $180 million to $200 million,
more of that is coming in this year than we'd originally thought. I think we said 50/50 approximately before. So you
would see less of that coming in next year and you'd also see some stranded begin to hit North America a little bit into
next year as well.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yeah, so, Chris, we have been fairly specific in the Coffee Co. Investor Conference and I
think we'll do the same on Meat Co. Conference, so we'll clarify that.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yeah, both companies then will give you a flavor for their costs going forward. That's
important.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: [indiscernible] (1:04:58) That's the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Agreed.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
<A>: Okay.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Hi, good morning, everyone.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning, Ken.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hi, Ken.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Just two questions. When you think about – just following up on Eric's question, when you
think about the dividend payout ratio, I know you can't really give us a number or anything for Meat Co., who do you
think of your comps? The protein companies don't tend to pay out high ratios, payout ratios, is there something that
would be different in your business model that you think about that would be quite different than the typical payout
ratios by the protein-oriented companies?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Ken, I'm just going to push that to Investor Day, because I think Sean and Maria really want
to take you through their strategy, their capital structure and dividend and how they're thinking about it versus comp, so
they will cover that on June 5.

<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Okay. Then the second question is can you just talk about pricing trends across the
categories in your Meat business? Particularly as lot of the probably input costs seem to be – maybe not rolling over,
but definitely abating a little bit. So how are you guys seeing the pricing trends across the categories in the Meat
business?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yeah, it's a mixed picture. So you'll have seen that pork and sows are coming down and
that's an important impact because it's a very important component for us. Meanwhile, beef prices are keeping up and
are still high, energy prices are going up and the rest is smaller.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: What about on the retail side, actually on – to the consumer? Sorry.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yeah. On the consumer side, things have quieted down, so we took a fair amount of price
increases, let me think, in the second quarter of 2011. Yes, that's correct. So we took a fair amount of price increase in
the second quarter of 2011, we then had smaller price increases coming through all the way up to the fourth quarter of
2011. In 2012, we've dialed back a bit, so we're not seeing any further price increases coming through.
I don't know where beef products or where beef is going to go, end products very heavily depend on beef, we may have
to tweak there, but we've definitely for a while now come to a point where most of our price increases are done.
On the Foodservice side, we typically lag a bit. So the Foodservice side is a slightly different story, because as a result
of these contracts it all comes in a bit later. So we're pretty much, I'd say, done with pricing up, with a small proviso
that I can't predict where beef is going to go. And what we're now starting to see is that our commodity costs are
becoming flat. And if we – if current prices hold then we may have some benefit coming through next year, that's what
the current calculations show.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: And can I just sneak in one more? On the pod business in the Coffee side, can you just talk
about how that business is impacted just given the whole Nestlé issue, just any impact at all?
<A - Jan Bennink>: On the capsules, that's really no impact. There was a lot of talk about the infringement and the
patent for Nestlé. I think it is just one court case out of many, and there is a long process including appeals. Does it
have any effect on our sales? Absolutely none, zero, zero comma zero...
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Perfect. Greatly appreciate it. Take care.
<A - Jan Bennink>: You can never be sure, but it's so far, this is what I'm – this is the clear message.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Just a technical question. In your slides you talk about excluding the currency mark-to-market
impact to get to an adjusted margin. But then in your script, Jan, I think you talked about it more as a commodity
mark-to-market. Can you help me again understand the difference between the two?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I don't have a script so that's probably the problem. But it's – I just talk what I feel like I talk. And
so – but Mark will give you some clarity here.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Let me help. Firstly, from a geography perspective, Rob, commodity mark-to-market only
appears generally in our corporate costs area, okay, it does not appear in the segment results. Currency mark-to-market
appears in the segment results. The difference obviously from a commodity perspective to the extent that you have
forward purchases, hedges and then the market price of those commodities move, we get an up or down in terms of the
commodity mark-to-market results on a quarter-by-quarter basis. The currency mark-to-market relates to the fact that
we have to buy coffee in dollars and then of course we do matching hedges in euros, and as those currencies move we
also have to do a mark-to-market there in the segment.

<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. So when you're giving us the adjusted operating margin in the slides, you're excluding
the currency impact that's in the segments.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Correct.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: And so, there's really – there's more upside to come here in the next quarter, really that is what
you're saying, unrelated to any kind of currency hedging? There's just more upside to come when the currency – I'm
sorry, when the commodity hedges roll over. Is the currency – is your currency hedging going to have an influence on
this adjusted margin in fourth quarter as well?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Well, to the extent that Jan has taken it out of the number, it won't have an impact on that
adjusted number that it has. But to the extent you looked at Sara Lee's bottom line results, depending on how currency
moves, obviously, to the end of the fiscal year, it could have an impact.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. And then one last question. On Thailand, you said you're going to be back in market in
April, can you give us any kind of quantification as to what the upside is to fiscal 2013 if Thailand is back online, back
to normal?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I mean, the exact upside, I mean, Thailand was basically zero, so everything – but it was – do I
know the exact upside? I might come – I have to come back to it, it is a small business that has a high – it's a high
volume instant business, but I can come back with the exact details. But, I mean, volume-wise it's, assuming all the
losses you had, hopefully we'll get them back. I mean...
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. So it's all volume and there's really no impact on profits for fiscal 2013?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Oh, there is a positive impact on profit. I mean, we had a little bit of – part of it was insured,
luckily, and so there's not completely out of the operating income. But definitely there will be a pickup of – I don't
know exactly, but there will be – it will be positive.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Well, to the detail you can give us, we'd appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Okay.
Operator

<A - Jan Bennink>: I think we have time for two more questions maximum.

Our final question today is from Karel Zoete with Rabo Bank.
<Q - Karel Zoete>: Yes, good morning. Two questions, please. The first one with regard to your key markets in
Europe, you indicated performed well and shown [ph] fairly mature chart (1:12:05). What can you say about the
volume trends in these four key markets in Europe? And then, secondly, growth in the Rest of the World is slowing
down a little bit to Retail. Can you say little bit more about your performance in Brazil and Australia in the third
quarter? Thank you.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Okay. I mean, volume and value are very much aligned in terms of volume development. I mean,
it's slightly different levels but it's – I don't see very good big discrepancies on the key Western European countries. If I
go to Australia, I mean, you've seen it in the Investor Day, I mean, what is happening there. I mean, market shares are
in the last quarter were also positive. So there was a slight pickup, basically stable versus the last half year, but a slight
pickup. Also there which just, I mean, because we've been taking out – Australia is promotional-driven, it depends very

much on the two, three key accounts.
So what we've done is we've taken a little bit of the promotional pressure off and kind of went for the volumes, which
we did deliver. So that's a little bit of a negative volume development. But in terms of value and in terms of mix,
Australia is performing in line with what you've seen in the March basis.
Brazil, flat market shares, no increase. São Paulo, Rio, perhaps a tad down in terms of a slight decline. Pricing, because
we priced up extremely heavily, looking at the last pricing charge versus our main competition, being it in Rio, being it
in the rest of Brazil, I think they have followed us so far. So it is more – it's going, there's nothing bad or good to
mention in Brazil. And the rest of the world, I mean, that's what you see is what I've mentioned a little bit for the
countries, which is Eastern Europe because of the pressure on Tchibo, which has been negatively influencing us.
<Q - Karel Zoete>: Thank you.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Okay.

Okay, thank you. I think this is the last question. I would like to thank you very much for being on the call and asking

probably be difficult but it was a great pleasure and hopeful we'll continue the nice relationship we had over the last
periods. Thank you very much for investing in the company.
