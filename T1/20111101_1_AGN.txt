Earlier this morning, Watson issued a press release reporting its earnings for the third quarter ended September 30,
2011. The press release, together with additional materials reconciling our GAAP and adjusted financial results and
forecast, are available on our website at www.watson.com. Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call,
which will also be available on our website after the call's conclusion.
With us on today's call are Paul Bisaro, our President and CEO, who will provide an overview of the third quarter
within our Global Generics, Global Brands and Distribution business segments; Todd Joyce, our Chief Financial
Officer, will then provide additional details on the performance of our business segments as well as our consolidated
financial results for the quarter. Paul will conclude our presentation with our updated outlook for 2011. We'll then open
up the call up for questions and answers.
Also on the call and available during Q&A session are Siggi Olafsson, Executive Vice President of our Global
Generics division; Fred Wilkinson, Executive Vice President of Global Brands; Al Paonessa, Executive Vice President
and Chief Operating Officer of our Anda Distribution division; and David Buchen, our Executive Vice President,
General Counsel and Secretary.
Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and cannot be rebroadcast without
the company's expressed written consent. I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call, management
will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of
the company. It's important to note that such statements about estimated or anticipated Watson results, prospects or
other non-historical facts are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of existing trends and
information as of today's date.
Watson disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by
law. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections, depending on a number of factors
affecting the Watson business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission including, but not limited to, the Watson Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2010, and Form
10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Patty. And thanks everyone for joining the call today. We are pleased to report our second consecutive quarter
of record net revenues of $1.1 billion. This represents a 23% increase over the third quarter of 2010. We also delivered
record profitability, with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.09 and adjusted EBITDA increased to $258
million. We continue to focus on executing our strategies and our results reflect this.
In the third quarter our Global Generics business performed exceptionally well based on strong continued performance
of our extended release and oral contraceptive franchises in the U.S. In our non-U.S. business, we increased both
revenue and profitability as a result of the addition of a full quarter of Specifar and the impact of increased product
launches, including an authorized generic version of Esomeprazole tablets in the UK. These launches helped offset
competitive pressures in certain markets and also contributed to improved margins in our non-U.S. business.
Results within our Global Brands business were in line with expectations, driven by strong sales of key promoted
products, including RAPAFLO, GELNIQUE, TRELSTAR and CRINONE. RAPAFLO reached a milestone of more
than 500,000 prescriptions dispensed since launch. Generess Fe, our newly launched OC, also contributed to these
results. These companywide strong results allowed us to continue to drive investment in our global businesses,
including investment in R&D within both our Generics and Brands businesses.
Within our Global Generics business, we invested in product development and in additional bio-studies that support
further expansion of our product portfolios, including patch and gel products such as our recently announced first to file
generic version of Daytrana, a transdermal patch treat ADHD.

In our Global Brands business, we are on target to initiate our Esmya Phase III uterine fibroids study by year-end and
we are preparing to enter Phase I in early 2012 for our FSH biologic product. We also licensed in another product in the
overactive bladder category through an agreement with Antares Pharma. This Oxybutynin gel product will provide the
OAB product line with dosing and delivery enhancements and has a PDUFA date of December 8 of this year. We also
received approval for Androderm 2 milligram and 4 milligram, which we anticipate launching later this month.
Second, we increased our investment in selling and marketing in the third quarter driven mainly by the addition of
Specifar and higher selling and marketing spend outside the U.S., notably focused on the upcoming launch of our
portfolio of Brand products in Canada. We expanded our sales force in the U.S. by just over 40 reps to provide
promotion to RAPAFLO and also to support the launch of the two new strengths of Androderm.
Lastly, in Anda, we announced we are building a 234,000 square foot state of the art distribution facility in Olive
Branch, Mississippi, which aligns more closely with our plans for growth of this business in the future.
During the quarter, we continued our integration of Specifar which I'm pleased to say is right on target. We have
identified numerous products to be added to the Specifar pipeline and even more products to add to the Greek domestic
business. We are consolidating product development and we'll realize synergies by consolidating API purchasing and
harmonizing in-licensing activities.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd who can take us through the financial results in more detail.
R. Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul. I will now review our results on a consolidated and divisional basis. Net revenue for the third quarter
were $1.082 billion, an increase of 23% over the prior year reflecting strong growth in both our Global Generics and
Global Brands divisions. Net revenue for Global Generics were $803 million, up 39% on a year-over-year basis. Sales
increased as a result of new products, including the generic versions of Concerta and SEASONIQUE, both of which
were launched this year. The addition of Specifar also contributed to the year-over-year revenue growth.
Sales of extended release products were $341.7 million, up 89% year-over-year as a result of the launch of generic
Concerta in the second quarter. Sales of oral contraceptives were $113.7 million, up 12% compared to the prior year,
primarily as a result of the launch of our generic version of SEASONIQUE in the third quarter. Ex U.S. net revenues
were $144.6 million, up 41% from the third quarter of last year reflecting the acquisition of Specifar and a number of
product launches in certain key markets.
Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was 46.5%, down 3.6 percentage points year-over-year due to the
launch of generic Concerta. Adjusted gross margin improved sequentially as our share of generic Concerta margins
increased under the terms of our agreement with J&J. Our share of margin on this product will continue to increase
each quarter through the middle of next year. However, margins for our Global Generics division will decline in the
fourth quarter due to the launch of generic Lipitor. Under our agreement with Pfizer, our share of generic Lipitor
margin is lower than our third quarter generic product margins.
Moving to Global Brands, net revenues were $110.3 million, up 11% on higher sales of promoted products including
RAPAFLO, TRELSTAR, GELNIQUE, CRINONE and Generess Fe. Global Brands' adjusted gross margin was 77.5%,
down 260 basis points year-over-year due to lower margins on Nulecit, a value brand of Ferrlecit.
Finally, net revenues for our Anda Distribution division were $168.8 million, down 18% from the prior year period due
to fewer third party product launches. Distribution adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 17%, up 210 basis points
from last year.
Turning now to operating expenses, consolidated R&D for the third quarter was $73.4 million, down 3%
year-over-year as the prior-year results include brand development and milestone payments for rFSH, Uracyst and ella.
For the full year, we expect R&D spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. On a
non-GAAP basis, we expect fourth quarter consolidated R&D to increase 5% to 10% from third quarter levels.

SG&A for the third quarter was $189.6 million, a decrease of $52 million. The third quarter of 2010 includes an $89.9
million charge associated with the company's drug pricing litigation. Excluding that amount, SG&A increased $38
million, reflecting higher brand selling cost and higher international SG&A in our Global Generics business, which
includes the addition of Specifar.
For the full-year, we expect SG&A expenses on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million and
on a non-GAAP basis, we expect SG&A expense in the fourth quarter to increase 7% to 10% from the third quarter
levels due to increased brand marketing cost, including a field force expansion and product spending associated with
the planned launch of PROCHIEVE and higher Anda distribution cost associated with projected sales levels in the
fourth quarter. And we also expect higher legal cost associated with our generic product development program.
Amortization for the third quarter was $71.8 million. For the full-year, we expect amortization expense to be
approximately $340 million which includes approximately $55 million of amortization related to our Atorvastatin
product rights.
On a non-GAAP basis, our income tax rate was 35% in the third quarter, down from 37.4% in the prior year period.
Our income tax rate on a GAAP basis was 42.9%. In the current year period, our tax rate was positively impacted by
tax reductions in the UK. For the full year 2011, we continue to expect our effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to
be approximately 36%.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization and impairment charges and other charges detailed in Table 4 of
our earnings press release, earnings for the third quarter were $1.09 per share, up 28% year-over-year. GAAP earnings
for the quarter were $0.54 per share.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $258.2 million, a 22% increase, and cash flow from operations was
$118 million for the quarter, and cash and marketable securities were $172 million at September 30.
We remain well-positioned financially, following the acquisition of Specifar. During the third quarter, we refinanced
our revolving credit facility on favorable terms and repaid $125 million of the $250 million that we borrowed to fund
the Specifar acquisition.
Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now just 1.2 times and we expect to pay off our revolving credit balance by the
end of the year. We remain well positioned to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our businesses in support of
our long-term earnings growth objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2011 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. Our estimate for full year net revenue is approximately $4.5 billion. We now expect our Global Generics
segment revenue to be approximately $3.3 billion. On the Brands side of our business, we continue to expect net
revenue of approximately $445 million. With the Anda Distribution business, we continue to anticipate revenue to be
approximately $770 million. As a reminder, Anda's results do not include the sale of Watson Products. We expect
adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion.
We now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4.55 and $4.65 per share. The increase in our
non-GAAP earnings per share reflects better than expected earnings in the third quarter, reduced competition
assumptions for our oral contraceptives and extended release products, and additional launches that were not included
in the previous forecast, including generic SEASONIQUE which launched in the third quarter and other undisclosed
launches expected to occur in the fourth quarter. Given the recent court decision, LOVENOX continues to be excluded
from our guidance for 2011.
Regarding the launch of generic Lipitor later this month, which will be Watson's largest product launch ever from a
revenue perspective, we anticipate the Atorvastatin launch to contribute between $0.48 and $0.53 in diluted earnings
per share in the fourth quarter. This includes the assumption that Ranbaxy will launch with Watson and that Pfizer will

compete aggressively and retain approximately 40% market share for the Lipitor brand.
In summary, Watson reported a second consecutive quarter of $1 billion plus sales and record earnings. We are
aggressively investing in the business and paying down debt to support continued growth and we expect to meet or
exceed our growth objectives for 2011 and beyond.
As always, I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and the contributions that they are making toward
the future growth of all of our global businesses.
With that, Patty, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A.
Patricia Eisenhaur
Thanks, Paul. And Kristel, we'll open up the Q&A right now.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thanks, much, and congrats on the results. Just had a couple of questions on generic
Lipitor. First, can you elaborate on the type of launch you're expecting from Ranbaxy this quarter, is that going to be a
full launch or a partial launch? Second, can you elaborate on what type of actions you're seeing from Pfizer in terms of
protecting its franchise and what that translates to into price for the generic? And then finally what type of impact
would the lack of a generic launch by Ranbaxy have on your numbers? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay. Well, for purposes of these estimates, Chris, we're assuming a full launch by Ranbaxy.
So we're expecting them to have sufficient capacity and sufficient product to meet demand as they get market share.
Regarding Pfizer and the activities that have been going on, I think they have been very aggressive at maintaining their
brand share. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I said we expect them to maintain – this forecast expects them to
maintain roughly 40% of the brand market share.
And they're actually doing it a couple of different ways, one is by going to PBMs, paying PBMs to – in some cases,
NDC block generics. So that's a pretty effective way to make sure the generic doesn't get dispensed and they maintain
market share. Also, Lipitor is a chronic care medication, so it has a high mail order utilization and they have gone and
been very aggressive in the mail order segment and maintained a large, or we expect them to maintain a large, position
in the mail order. So with that, I think that's where we see the efforts that they have undertaken to maintain market
share.
Regarding our price, I mean I think we've always said we'll do our best to maximize our generic value for this product,
so we won't disclose what the pricing plans are but we do expect to try to maximize our value.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. And just a final question in terms of if Ranbaxy were not to come to market, do
you have any sense of just what type of leverage that would have in terms of your numbers?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think a little bit would depend on how long we expected them to not be there. If it was a
short period of time, probably have very little impact. If it was going to be a month or two, then I think we could see
potentially two times what we're talking about.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. A couple questions, with respect to Nexium and the UK contribution to
the third quarter, could you just provide some more color on that and also the outlook for additional country launches,
the competitive landscape, relative profitability on Nexium ex-U.S.?
And then my second question is with respect to Lipitor and contracting with customers, could you just update us on
where things stand? It's now November 1, obviously the clock is ticking for Ranbaxy. Are your customers telling you
they're not yet willing to sign with Watson because they're waiting longer for Ranbaxy or when does the actual rubber
meet the road in terms of customers signing contracts with you and giving up on Ranbaxy?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: So, David, it's Siggi here. Let's start with Nexium in Europe. So we have authorized the
generic of Nexium in UK. Ranbaxy launched a generic and AstraZeneca signed up with us and that has been very
successful launch. We don't give out what the contribution was in our UK business, but it was successful and we kept a
significant market share of the generic part.
With regard to the rest of the businesses that Ranbaxy has launched in – as I mentioned, in UK. They also have
launched in France. There is a shortage of tablets in the market from them, so we still expect that we will launch our
generic version from Specifar before the end of this year. First in France, as we mentioned, our focus market is France.
Then we would focus on Switzerland and Spain after that. There is still – in France, there is still the generic capsules on
the market but clearly, the generic tablets are taking a significant market share. When more competitors will be on the
market, I think that will confirm what we have previously said that the tablets will be the preferred dosage form.
Regarding the customers on Atorvastatin, I think, we are speaking to the customers. I think, Ranbaxy is also speaking
to the customers. It's not unusual that one month before launch that prices haven't been agreed. I think we are just
waiting to see what happens in the market. We wait to see how many players are in the market, because our pricing
strategy will be based on that. So I don't think it's an unusual situation that we sit and wait until later this month.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Good morning. My first one is on LOVENOX, Paul. I know it's excluded from guidance, but
can you walk us through the possible timeline and outcomes, and of course, your personal view on what's likely to
happen and then I have a second.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. I think as you probably know, an appeal has been filed. I think that process is going to
take some time even if we get expedited review or an expedited treatment of that appeal. I think we – as from what we
can see, I think we believe we're going to – we have a strong case on appeal. And we'll take it from there. What I –
timeline here is really going to be dependent on what the Federal circuit is going to – how quickly they're going to
move on this. So, I think we still stand ready to launch the product as soon as possible and we'll wait and see. But at the
moment, as you said, we have excluded it from guidance for the rest of 2011.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Just to frame the bookends, would you say it's a couple of months, fastest case and maybe a
couple of years longer case? Is that reasonable? Or could it be faster?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I think it's, probably fastest is probably three months and longest case could be a year.

<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay. And then my second question is about a sneaky way of asking about 2012 outlook, Paul,
without asking it. We know that Lipitor and Concerta will be a big chunk, possibly over $2 of earnings next year. So
how are you thinking about sort of, not that I'd try to exclude those items, but if you put those aside, can you talk about
the key pushes and pulls over the next year or so for Watson earnings power, recognizing that there are a couple of big
chunky items that folks will continuously be nervous about? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure, Gregg. And just to remind everybody, it's been our practice to give guidance for 2012 in
probably January or maybe even February next year. But we'll obviously give pretty specific guidance then. But I think
the moving factors for us continue to be our extended release franchise and our oral contraceptive franchise in the U.S.
We do expect those to continue to be strong and provide strong value.
We, of course, have a pipeline of extended release products that we expect to – that we continue to expect to feed those
extended release – or that [ph] expressed (23:59) extended release franchise with these new products through '12,
through '13 and then onto '14. I think the same is true on the oral contraceptives, although there is fewer and fewer
product opportunities because most of them have been – either are now ours or not.
And then, [ph] I still think (24:15) internationally of course, we have, as Siggi was talking about just a second ago, the
[ph] SMF result (24:21) tablet opportunity in the markets that he mentioned as well as additional markets throughout
'12 and '13. Also, ex-U.S. the additional launches that we might be seeing from the pipeline as it starts to mature.
And then finally – not finally – but on the Brands side, of course, we're very excited about the launch of PROCHIEVE.
We have a PDUFA date in February. And we are working very hard to get prepared for that launch and I think that
product has – as you know, I've been very excited about this product. It's a very important product to the medical
community here in the U.S. and I think it's going to be a great product for Watson.
And then we also continue to see good growth from Anda. I think Anda's got a good business model in place. They're
working hard to improve on all aspects of their business. The move to Mississippi makes a lot of sense. It's right next to
the FedEx facility so we can ship product out to customers even faster than we've ever been able to do. So all three of
the business segments, I think, provide that growth that we're looking for – continued growth from '11 to '12 to '13.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Paul, just a -
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Hi, Paul, just a couple of questions, back to Lipitor, sort of the opposite question to Chris' earlier
question on whether or not if Ranbaxy is delayed, what if there is a three generic player market, or even a four generic
player market, and I know that the clock is running, but it seems to me that that possibility or scenario cannot be
completely eliminated, and just wondering what the economics look like for Watson under that scenario?
And my second question relates to Lidoderm, there's been a lot of noise recently around Lidoderm, and just wondering
if you could clarify your expectations in terms of both the regulatory and the legal landscape? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. Well, regarding Lipitor, Jami, I think I would say that there is a pretty small likelihood
now, in my view, that we'll see in November of this year a multiplayer market other than the brand, Watson and
Ranbaxy. I think there's always some possibility that that could occur, but I think it's pretty unlikely given the state of
situation. What I would say though, six months from now, after Ranbaxy launches and their exclusivity runs, I would
say that we could anticipate a three or four player, maybe five, or six player market, at which point, I think the product
has a completely different economic outlook for us at that point. So we will see competition six months after Ranbaxy
is launched, we fully expect that, and now that we've seen other people start to settle with Pfizer, we sort of expect to

see more players at that point. Although, as I think as many people have said, there are no tentative approvals yet, that
could just be the FDA having the backlog that they are trying to deal with, but nevertheless that's kind of the way we're
modeling it for purposes of our forecast.
Regarding Lidoderm, our efforts to increase our capacity in Salt Lake are well underway. We're on target to complete
the expansion in time in 2012. And we'll be ready to, I guess, monetize that asset as early as possible. We like our case,
we like where our case sits. We think we've, the District Court has been certainly in the Markman hearing was, we
think was favorable to us and we're pretty excited about where that product opportunity presents itself.
And Lidoderm is just one example of the products that can continue to drive growth for Watson in '12 and '13 and '14.
So following up on my answer to Gregg, would be the Paragraph IV pipeline at Watson's probably never been stronger,
never been deeper. And there's still opportunities out there for companies like us to get very successful growth through
Paragraph IV challenges and we continue to be very focused on that.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Paul, just a follow up, are you comfortable that FDA will not ask you for clinical trials for
Lidoderm?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Our position has been and remains that the FDA has already given guidance on this issue and
we have followed that guidance. And we don't believe we're going to be required to do any more work than what we've
already done.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: My question's around CRINONE and PROCHIEVE. Just wondering if you could give us any
sense of what's been happening with – from a managed care perspective for CRINONE, for pre-term birth. I don't know
if there's been any changes in any formularies that are already going ahead in reimbursing for that indication. Also
wondering if you can give us some of the pricing increases around CRINONE over the last year, and then finally
maybe a discussion about conversations with ACOG or Maternal-Fetal Medicine association, any early discussions
about them changing their guidelines for the pre-term indication? Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Ken, I'll have Fred answer that one. So Fred?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Let me kind of run through the process. Under the current coverage of
CRINONE, which just to remind you, we'll be filing a separate NDA for the pre-term birth. So it will really start a new
cycle on reimbursement, but under the current provisions insurance companies generally cover for what's called the –
once a woman is pregnant, so they're already covering the cost of the product for – after the first 14 days and after the
woman's become pregnant. So we've got very good coverage at this particular point for CRINONE in that situation. In
all of our discussions with the insurance companies and the payers around coverage for pre-term, we've had some very
positive discussions and we believe this – it will happen almost immediately after the approval.
Regarding price increases, I believe we took a price increase somewhere earlier this year. Don't remember the amount;
it was probably in around the 8% range. The product had not had many price increases over the last history – over its
history and we thought that it probably warranted. The market had moved in the infertility space. So we moved with the
infertility marketplace.
And then finally, there's actually been a lot of activity going on with ACOG and with the SMFM group, which is the
Maternal-Fetal Medicine subsection of ACOG, on trying to – on starting to establish guidelines for two things; both
transvaginal ultrasound on all women that are pregnant. And secondly, then on what therapy should be used once they
find a short cervix. I think the findings of our studies have shown that short cervix is clearly an indicator for preterm

Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. Just a bigger picture question on the Brand business, you had previously had an
aspirational target of I believe doubling revenue from Brands to around $1 billion longer term. Is that still an
aspirational goal? Do you feel you can get there primarily on PROCHIEVE and the existing in market portfolio
continuing to grow or do you feel that you'll need additional in-licensing and acquisitions to get there? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, David, we still do have that as our goal. And we do think that PROCHIEVE and
RAPAFLO and the continued growth of the product line we have now, ANDRODERM as well, I think gives us a big
push toward that $1 billion target. I do think probably the – if Esmya works out the way we think it's going to work out,
we have high expectations for that product. So I think the current product line plus the pipeline can get us to that $1
billion. However, as you know, we've been very aggressive at looking for additional opportunities in urology and
women's health, and in some cases even on the oncology side. So we're – we continue to aggressively pursue
opportunities to add products to our brand portfolio.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay, then switching gears, back to the Generics, on Mucinex D and DM generics, any
update on where you are at the FDA regarding the filings? Any color there? Do you see this as a high probability
opportunity for either the fourth quarter or for next year?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, we continue to pursue our applications for the Mucinex product line. At this point, we
don't expect anything for 2011. And 2012, we probably would see some contribution but again, there is – we're sort of
swimming upstream at some of these issues with the FDA. There's just enormous amounts of backlog and issues that
have to be – the workload at the FDA is enormous so it takes time to get anything done. And that's kind of what we're
up against. Hopefully, with the generic user fees on the horizon, we'll get some help to the agency and they can process
these applications faster. But for now, not anything in 2011.

too, and then next year, is a pretty good year for launches even though I have to handicap it a little bit. IMS shows
about $32 billion of products coming off, but about $17 billion of that are going to be me-too products with multiple
vendors, so heavily discounted. So – but it will still be one of the best years ever for new product launches.
<Q - Frank H. Pinkerton>: And then Paul, just a follow up for you. As we think about – not 2011, not 2012, but what
most people are pointing to as the cliff and let's call that 2015 or 2016, can you just talk about the discussions you have
at a higher level about ultimately, is Watson positioned such that if new generic opportunities slow down, where is
Watson headed to continue to show growth in the longer term? Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure, Frank. There's been a lot of talk about the cliff and we've talked about this quite a bit. I
think what I've said in the past, and I'll repeat some of it, and one of the issues I think you've got to look at is you've got
to look at each company's product portfolio as it approaches 2015 and 2016. While there is not as many blockbuster
generic opportunities in the U.S., there are still good product opportunities. So I do think the generic business will not
go away and I don't think – what I have said though, is it will be harder for a Watson or – at least I'll just speak about
Watson – for Watson to continue to see the growth rate that it has if we rely solely on U.S. generics.
So what we've done to position ourselves for that time period is continue to expand our generics globally. I think we
still have a lot of runway ahead of us to increase our generic portfolio across the globe and we're going to be very
focused on doing that.
At the same time, we continue to build our brand franchise, because we think we can add a lot of value in specialty
areas like urology, women's health and in some cases, even oncology. And then finally, when we start to get out to
2015, 2016, 2017, we start seeing the inflow of revenue from our biologics program when we would see FSH come to
market and hopefully in some of the emerging markets first then in Europe and then ultimately the U.S. and as I said,
we've been very aggressive at looking with partners to build a bigger portfolio of biologic opportunities. So more to
come on that on the biologics front from us, but that's the way we see ourselves growing through those years of '15, '16,
and '17.

Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Needham & Company.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Elliot.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Hi, Paul. Thanks and good morning to everyone. Just real quickly, first question is for Todd just
more of a mechanistic question on EBITDA and EPS guidance. Actually, it was a modest reduction to full-year
adjusted EBITDA expectations and I'm trying to reconcile that with the increase to adjusted EPS given that the
expected adjusted tax rate is remaining the same.
And then I guess I'll just throw in another question on Lidoderm for Paul, we're coming up on a two-year anniversary
of filing so obviously still some runway left in terms of getting approval within the 30-month period. The question is
based on the CP filing and some changes that may have been requested by FDA, do you still believe that you have to
get approval within the 30 months in order to maintain your statutory exclusivity on the product? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay, I'll take the first – I will answer my question first and then we'll turn it over to Todd. On
Lidoderm, I think we are comfortable that we should get our tentative approval before the 30 months. However, in
situations where the approvals have been held up by citizen's petitions, the agency, I think, has a policy of allowing
companies to go beyond the TA time if, in fact, it's held up for that reason. So you still have to prosecute your
application as quickly as possible and you still have to do everything, but if the application has been – at least, that's my
understanding – they have allowed for companies to go beyond the 30 months in the situation where an application has
been held up due to a citizen's petition.

<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Yeah. In terms of the revised EBITDA guidance, in the – as part of our last quarter's call, we
gave guidance of $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion was the EBITDA guidance range. We've changed that guidance to
$1.080 billion to $1.1 billion. So that's the revision. You should kind of focus on those – the midpoint of that range.
And the tax rate has moved a little bit but not dramatically from the prior quarter's guidance range.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Faerm with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. On Lipitor, could you just clarify your
assumption regarding assumed 40% brand share? How long do you expect that to be and how do you expect that to
play out over time? And also with respect to your fourth quarter EPS guidance on Lipitor, what are your assumptions
around stocking in that number?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'll answer the first part and then hand it over to Siggi for the stocking part. I think our
assumption around the 40% would be for pretty much the six month period of exclusivity that Ranbaxy has. Once it
becomes a multiple player market, it's unlikely that they would maintain that much market share. It's possible, but it's
unlikely, I think. So, we are expecting that six month scenario. Siggi?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: So, in our assumption for the stocking of Lipitor, generic Lipitor, we assume that we are
roughly at 10 weeks, stocking in the beginning when we go to the market, like with any other generic launch we do in
the U.S.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Could I just ask one follow-up? Regarding oral contraceptives, you mentioned that reduced
assumptions on competition are a factor in your higher 2011 guidance. Could you talk a little bit about what the drivers
are of those assumptions, and to what extent you think those are durable or more temporary phenomena?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. A couple of things. One is that again, the FDA backlog is keeping people from getting the
approvals. We certainly heard that a number of companies have filed portfolios of oral contraception products. We
haven't seen anybody emerge yet with a portfolio of products. We've had one-off kind of approvals, but we really
haven't seen a portfolio. So how long that will continue is probably dependent a bit on the FDA.
And then I think there has been a few situations that have actually increased our draw on our oral contraception
products. There was an unfortunate situation, there was a recall of one of our competitors had on OCs, and when that
happens, a number of customers came to us to look to fill the, at least the momentary loss of product for those
customers, so we had a bump from that as well, as we supplied additional OCs into the customers who were with that
other competitor. And that happens from time to time, that's just not on oral contraceptives, but it happens on other
products like the narcotic products we see that happen when people get in shortages of their quota or whatever. If we're
in a good stock position, we can jump in and supply the market. So we've been opportunistic on that front as well.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Great. Thank you.

And second, again, at a high level, your debt is coming down quite a bit and I noticed you haven't instituted a dividend
policy yet. Is that something you're considering? Is that a possibility going forward or is the cash kind of going to be
dedicated elsewhere?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay. Well, as to respiratory, I should have mentioned it. It is an area that we've spent a lot of
time and a lot of effort on and we'll continue to do so. So that is one of the areas we could see growth in the – as you
point out, the 2014, 2015 timeframe.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Can you give us a bit more detail?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Pardon me?
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Can you give us a bit more details there?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, not at this point. But we'll certainly put – okay. But we are working on the products that
you would expect we would be working on.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Right.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: So, regarding the debt and dividend policy, at the moment and I think for the foreseeable
future, we continue to see opportunities for us to use our cash to continue to grow our business. I think our growth rate
over the last few years demonstrates that we can provide great return to our shareholders by focusing on our business
operationally as well as executing on the strategy we have in place.
And part of that strategy includes deployment of that cash that we have and we'll be deploying that cash over the next
few months for biologics, for brand opportunities as well as for generic opportunities. So for the foreseeable future, no
dividend policy, no dividend at all, but we certainly see growth.

<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Thanks, Paul. Just -
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Randall.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: – hey, guys. Just a question, a follow up question on Lipitor, there's been a lot of
discussion today. Are you effectively saying that you don't think there is any likelihood or at least a low likelihood that
Ranbaxy would license their exclusivity to anybody, and if that was the case, would there be any change to the way
you're thinking about the economics that you've laid out? Then I have a follow up.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. No, there is – I'll answer the last question first – is no, we wouldn't expect any changes
even if they had moved their exclusivity to someone else. That – we would expect the situation to probably be the
same. And then as to why, I guess maybe I was a bit bullish about this but I mean, I think our market intelligence tells
us that Ranbaxy has product. So if they were going to move the exclusivity to somebody else they wouldn't have built
inventory. So I think that's why – that's where I came down with the Ranbaxy comment.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Okay. That's helpful. We've been getting a lot of questions around Concerta, there's been a
couple of additional settlements out there. Can you just comment on the impact or probably more likely the lack of
impact based on the economics with your settlement with J&J? Should we see another generic emerge over the next
year or two?

we're not permitted to give all the details around the financial arrangements. What we've said and continue to believe is
that we won't see competition – we don't expect to see competition on Concerta until sometime in the earliest of late
2012. And that's really based on the timelines that people must be facing because we know we're facing them at the
FDA. So assuming a normal timeline, a normal review, it's going to take people – we think it's going to take them about
that long to get the product approved. Regarding what happens to the economics. The economics do change if another
party enters the market but we haven't disclosed what that would be.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: But to be clear, you have some level of protection there. So we shouldn't be expecting any
big impact if we see an additional generic come in?

Your next question comes from the line of David Buck with Buckingham Research.
<Q - David G. Buck>: Yes. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, David.
<Q - David G. Buck>: Good morning, Paul. Quick question I guess for Siggi on the international generics. Can you
talk a little bit about how sustainable you think that record level of sales might be? You mentioned obviously the tablet
launch but also some pricing pressure. I'm just curious the impact of the pricing pressure.
And then for Paul, what have you learned so far, maybe early, but on your generic OxyContin filing, the new
tamper-resistant one. What have you learned in terms of the FDA's willingness to approve one of the non
tamper-resistants? What's your confidence level there? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, David. On the European business, I think as Paul mentioned before, we are
benefiting from both the introduction of Specifar into the Watson Group but also we have launched a significant
amount of products this year. Just in France alone, we have launched around 25 products in France. So we are building
a portfolio which is helping us in the pricing environment we are seeing in Europe. Clearly, the situation in France is
still bad. We are keeping up with our new launches. UK is similar, as I mentioned in the second quarter call, we have
had a good, good launches in the UK which has benefited us clearly and the Esomeprazole authorized generics helped
us.
With regard to the Greek market, the utilization of generics is significantly increasing. At the same time obviously, the
prices are going a little bit down, but the volume in the market is increasing faster than the pricing. So overall, I'm a
little bit more optimistic with our international markets.
To add to that, the Canadian market, there is a built in price decrease which are agreed with the provinces, where the
pharmaceutical companies have agreed, the generic companies have agreed with the provinces. We know what's going
to happen next year so we can build our focus pretty accurately, but there again, with a significant number of new
products which come from the Watson portfolio helps us to grow the business. So overall, I think it's quite a positive
sound from us in this quarter.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, and David you asked about generic OxyContin, our filing. At the moment we don't have
a lot of visibility into the answer to your question, our application is fairly new so there's not a lot of activity going on
with it right now. I'm not quite sure where, I don't think any of us are quite sure where the FDA is going to come down
on this idea of approving non – tamper resistant product. So it is still an open question and one that we expect to get an
answer to as time goes on.
<Q - David G. Buck>: Great, maybe if I could sneak one in on the extended release competition assumption, you
talked about the OC competition assumption and was just curious what changed your view on the extended release
competition and how sustainable that might be with the lessened competition? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. For 2011, I think we're pretty comfortable that we don't expect to see much change in the
big products we have in the extended release franchise. It may be early next year we could see some additional
changes, but right now for 2011, I think we're a bit more optimistic that things are going to pretty much stay, I think
normalized.

Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Collins Stewart.
<Q - Louise A. Chen>: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First question I had was on your PROCHIEVE product. Do
you have any update on the follow-on product? What are some unmet needs you could potentially address here and
would [indiscernible] (51:57) just be for the U.S. market or a worldwide opportunity?
And then the second question I had was just on the LOVENOX opportunity. How large is the retail market and then
what is the current generic penetration there?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: This is Fred Wilkinson. Let me take the PROCHIEVE question. Actually, we are
deep in development of a second generation of our progesterone gel product. We've not given any detail on what it
looks like or what it would be, but we will be into the clinics in middle of 2012 with a fairly aggressive program to try
to get the market in – get it in to the marketplace within a couple of years. It will be a global development, so it would
be available to us to be able to commercialize throughout the world.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: So if I take the LOVENOX thing is in the retail market, I don't have the accurate – the
size of the market in millions of dollars, but overall in the retail market, the [ph] generic (52:59) penetration is about
80%, [ph] Sandoz (53:03) has about [ph] 80% generic (53:04) penetration in retail. Sanofi is about [ph] 20 points
(53:06). Also, Sanofi announced that they are launching an [ph] AG (53:10), so there will be a three player market plus
the brand, if and when we launch our generic to the market.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Leerink Swann.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple. First, on LOVENOX. Momenta's out there
saying that their expectations for timing is 12 to 18 months and basically, a patent trial that I presume would go to the
District Court level, versus you guys are talking about somewhere in the range of 3 to 12 months and I guess a legal
process going through the Federal circuit. So maybe if you can just help reconcile those timing differences? Are you
guys talking about different tracks there?
And then on Lipitor, just curious, do you expect your generic to be Tier 1 or Tier 2 and can you just maybe outline your
assumptions if you expect any co-pay differential versus the brand? Thanks.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: David, I why don't you handle the LOVENOX?
<A - David A. Buchen>: On the LOVENOX, I think our assumption on the timing is 3 months is – would assume that
the Federal circuit grants expedited review for the preliminary injunction. 12 months would be the assumption to get
through a District Court judgment. And so I think that was the range that we were talking about. Naturally, if there's a
District Court judgment after 12 months, reasonable to expect the side that did not win to file an appeal with the
Federal circuit, so that would take longer.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Okay.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. And then, Jason, regarding the activity around co-pays and Tier 1 versus Tier 2, versus
Tier 3, in addition to the NDC blocks I was talking about before, that Pfizer is doing with PBMs, they're also working
aggressively to move the brand into Tier 1, pushing the generics into Tier 2 or Tier 3, increasing the co-pays then for
the – obviously, making the co-pays for the generic more expensive than for the brand. So there has been a number – I
mean, that's not an unusual tactic I guess. It is what happens and what companies have done in the past, and that's
what's going on right now in the marketplace. So there are some plans that are putting generics in Tier 3, some plans
are putting it in Tier 2 and some plans are being more true to their roots and dispensing the generic.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of John Boris with Citi.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, John.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Hey, Paul. And congratulations on the results.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Thank you.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Just first question on Toprol XL as you called out to Gregg's question on the extended release
assets, is your assumption that there won't be any Toprol XL additional generics in 2012?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Oh, no. No, we would anticipate additional competition on that product, on the
METOPROLOL in 2012. Regard – and I was speaking mostly to the rest of the year. I mean we just haven't -
<Q - John T. Boris>: Got it.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: [ph] – the cut is (56:06) always possible. It's just given, it's November and we just haven't
really heard of anybody coming imminently. So it's probably a pretty good bet that the rest of 2011 will be pretty
stable.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Okay. One on PROCHIEVE, any thoughts on some of the questions that you're anticipating that
you might be getting from the FDA at the December ad com and any update on the dialogue that you're having with the
FDA related to PROCHIEVE?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah maybe first a correction, we're not seeing the FDA in December. The ad
com meeting in December is more around YAZ and Beyaz, so. But we are deep in discussions with the agency. We're
kind of having the appropriate discussions that you'd have when you have about four months to go on your NDA
process. So I think the review seems to be going generally well, but it's still got four more months to go.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And, John, I guess I would just add and remind you that as of now, we don't have – we have
not been told that we are going to an advisory committee, although as we've said, we continue to prepare as though we
are going to one. I think the earliest date then would be January?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: And they haven't published the dates for 2012 yet.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: So they're focused on finishing up '11 and they'll be publishing any dates in '12
sometime within the next two to three months.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Great. Thanks for that point of clarification and then just one last one for Siggi. The distributor
relationships that you have in Europe and just linking that to some of the price compression that we've had, as these
distributor agreements then come up for renewal, how does pricing potentially – if generic pricing compresses on an
asset that you're supplying, how does that impact your negotiation once you realign with those distributors over
supplying product?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: John, it's a good question. Basically, as you know, in Europe there is three main
wholesalers, the three big wholesalers in Europe; Celesio, Alliance Boots, and Phoenix. We work with all of them.
Obviously, [ph] the bigger that (58:11) our business is, all these wholesalers are cross European, so we work with them
in every market we are. So the more we can offer them in different markets, the better situation we are in in the
negotiation. Obviously, when the prices are going down, the wholesalers are looking for a better price for the product.
And with that we have our global operational excellence program which we are trying to lower our cost of goods to be
able to compete in the market. But overall, I think due to that we are growing in size in Europe, we are in more than
seven countries in Europe, helps us in the negotiations between different markets. But clearly there's enormous pressure
in each and every market to keep up, there's a price pressure that is in the marketplace itself.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for that.

Your next question comes from the line of Shibani Malhotra with RBC Capital.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I've just got a couple. First on Concerta, I know
there was a number of factors influencing the performance this quarter. We saw the market share increase, but the
overall market declined and then your profit was obviously larger than it was last quarter. We also understand that there
was some destocking this quarter. But can you help us think through what drivers we should be looking for next quarter
and as we go forward and whether this is a decent run rate for Concerta over the next year or so?
And then separately on Lidoderm generic and more related to the FDA approval, I guess what surprised us with
Voltaren Gel recently wasn't so much that the FDA required studies, but the scope of the studies and how large these
were and the design of these studies. Why – what gives you confidence that Lidoderm is potentially more
straightforward and you wouldn't be required to do those types of studies, and if you were, would you still pursue this
opportunity?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Let me start it, Siggi here on Concerta. As you know, we are roughly at [ph] 82% gross
(1:00:26) market share. I think the numbers that came out there yesterday, we have [ph] 82% gross (1:00:30) market
share. We mentioned on the last call this is a very seasonal product. There's a significant decrease in prescription over
the summer time and over a holiday period when the kids are not in schools, so we saw that. But I think the biggest
thing is, we talk about destocking, we mentioned this also before that our customers expected that we might have some
supply issue similar to that the customer saw for ADDERALL XR in the market, I think we have proven to our
customers we have an excellent supply chain and we haven't been in stock out in any of our strengths. So with that and
with the confirmation having been on the market now for five, six months, they have released and they have less stock
themselves, and that has impacted third quarter.
Overall, we see for fourth quarter, just to talk about it, we see that we will be around the number we are – we have been
around 82% now for three weeks. It's slowly creeping up, but 82% to 84% would not be unreasonable to see to the end
of the year. But we don't expect any more destocking to happen in fourth quarter.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And Shibani, regarding the LIDODERM, as you know, we have a very extensive development
program on patches and gels so we're real familiar with how the FDA has been – what they've been requiring. We
certainly understand that the FDA has been requiring clinical endpoint studies for gel products and we have been
engaged in doing those which is why our R&D expenditures have been going up, but we're happy about that because
they're hard to do and they're expensive and that means that there will be fewer and fewer competitors.
On the LIDODERM, it's a patch product and the FDA has been very clear about patch products. We believe that
patches don't require that kind of clinical endpoint study, what it requires is the studies that we've performed per the
guidance that they issued. And again, they were asked this very specific question and they didn't answer – and their
answer was you don't need to do it. So I don't understand why the FDA would go back and change their mind on this
when they were that clear when they were asked through the citizen's petition process. So -
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: That's perfect.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: – that's where we stand on this.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: You bet.

Your last question comes from the line of Michael Tong with Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Good morning. The first one maybe is for Fred. You talk about sales force expansion in the
U.S. Could you remind us where you stand in terms of how your sales force is structured currently and is that going to
be the same structure going that you're going to go to the market with PROCHIEVE on? And then secondly for Paul,
given your current sort of debt structure, you're definitely ready to do some type of business development activities.
Realistically, I know you look at everything, but based on what's going on in the EU, is that still a priority of yours or
would you steer us to thinking towards more Asia Pacific or maybe even more branded opportunities in the U.S.?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Well, let me start with force structure, yeah, we actually just added about 42, 43
representatives in October. They're actually out now promoting. It was very rapid process of hiring representatives.
We've got them into the company pretty quickly and very pleased that they're out there in the street right now
promoting. They were actually added to our Euro primary care sales force, that brings that group up to just under 150.
They have 175 that are doing urology and ob-gyn coverage. That will be the group that will launch PROCHIEVE to the
OBs. And just to remind you, we have a 55-person SAS team, strategic accounts specialist team, that call on the key
specialists in those areas, meaning urologists, infertility specialists and now the maternal-fetal medicine. That
essentially will be the group that we see launching PROCHIEVE and also carrying the ball on to continuing to grow
RAPAFLO, launching Androderm 2, 4, and the series of other things that we have in our bag.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Michael, you asked about – I guess, M&A and we – you're right, we do continue to look at all
the opportunities that are presented in the market. There are some that are out there and that have been intriguing and
we've looked at hard. I don't think we're shying away from any region, really. While there are challenges in the EU,
there are certainly challenges all over the world but as we look out, we think the future is bright for generic utilization
around the world. As you know, we've invested in the Greek market. Part of the answer to the Greek debt problem is
generic utilization. They're still at very low penetration rates, very low utilization rates at some point, the government's
got to require utilization of generics and when they do, we'll be well-positioned to take advantage of that upside.

So, the markets we recognize there are challenges and – but we also see a lot of opportunities around the world. So
we're not – I guess to answer your question directly, we're not saying no to the Euro zone.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: You bet.
