William H. Swanson
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon delivered a solid quarter with sales, margin and EPS, all
exceeding our expectations. Our adjusted operating margin was 12.4% and was driven by our continued focus on
performance across the businesses. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin increased to 12.5%, up 10 basis points
compared to 2010. In the quarter, our book-to-bill was 1.2, driven in part by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's decision to
upgrade their Patriot system, which we announced at the Paris Air Show in June. This booking once again demonstrates
that when it comes to choosing the most advanced integrated air and missile defense systems, global customers
continue to look to Raytheon and to Patriot.
As you know, an important part of our strategy is to continue to grow our international market. Our presence at the air
show re-affirmed our commitment to this strategy and to our international customers. For us this was a record year at
the air show where we met with approximately 2,100 customers from 63 nations and 44 delegations. It gave me an
opportunity to personally meet with many of the delegations and customers. I was encouraged by the conversations.
Our cutting-edge technologies, our innovative solutions continue to be well aligned with their evolving requirements,
particularly in the areas of air and missile defense, global ISR, air traffic management, homeland security and training.
I went into the show feeling good about our international opportunities and I left feeling more confident. The threat
level around the world remains high and despite competing priorities, our customers continue to place a heightened
emphasis on investments in defense and security. From a company perspective, we have an excellent pipeline and the
key is to convert these bookings within the planned timeframe.
Domestically, our customers work through the quarter to put the extended continuing resolution behind them. The
funding recovery was slow to start but it picked up steam through the quarter. Our efforts to keep programs on cost and
on schedule during the CR paid off and we're able to report domestic revenue ahead of our expectations. Domestic
book-to-bill was greater than one in the quarter.
We understand that this environment is dynamic. Our customer's been asked to do more with no more and is looking
for innovative ways to meet what is demanded of them. This is the new reality and it fits well with our focus on
delivering capabilities and solutions that offer more value. We not only see this in our core markets, but we also see
examples of this in our growth markets. For example, as we approach the electronic warfare or EW market from
various perspectives, we can apply our capabilities and manipulating RF signals to attack, deny and defend against an
adversary. Our products include the ALR-69A which will go on the new tanker, the KC-46A, the ALR-67 for the F-18
E/F (sic) [F/A-18 E/F] (5:00) and our Miniature Air Launch Decoys, MALD, plus a host of other classified products.
The key here is that our EW capabilities are truly a force multiplier for our customers worldwide allowing them to
leverage existing platforms at reduced costs, to continue to execute their missions. This is yet another example of how
Raytheon's platform agnostic approach to the market creates values for our customers.
Offering innovative solutions to meet customer needs is only part of the equation. Doing so efficiently with the right
balance of resources is another. For many years now, we've been focused on delivering greater value and predictability
to our customers and shareholders by improving cost efficiencies and program performance. We've achieved this by
leveraging the power of Raytheon's Six Sigma and optimizing our supply chain. Our supply chain initiative is allowing
us to streamline our buying processes, reduce cost and increase efficiencies. This focus is producing real savings today,
as evidenced by our track record of solid operating results.
Going forward, we've redoubled our efforts to reduce cost and are targeting additional opportunities across all areas of
expense. Further, we're focusing on enhancing our capital efficiency by reducing our footprint and optimizing our
facility utilization. These are just some of the examples of how we're finding more ways to produce savings for our
customers and drive incremental returns for our shareholders.

We believe this focus is the right approach in the current economic environment and for us, our track record of
achieving cost efficiencies speaks for itself. As I look at the quarter, I see a company that continues to perform well and
delivers considerable value for our customers and our shareholders. We remain well positioned in an evolving
marketplace. We continue to make targeted investment in growth areas and are taking the necessary actions to ensure
the company remains healthy and competitive. I'm proud of the dedicated natural Raytheon team for rising to the
challenge, again and again.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras
Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks, starting with second quarter highlights and then, we'll move onto
questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the Web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
Okay, if everyone would please turn to Page 3. As Bill noted, we performed well in the second quarter with sales,
margin and EPS all exceeding our expectations. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $7.4 billion, resulting
in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2. The strong bookings were driven in part by the previously announced $1.7 billion Saudi
Patriot award. Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 also improved over the same period last year. And adjusted operating margin
was 12.4%, reflecting continued strong performance across the business. Sales were $6.2 billion, which I'll address
further in just a moment.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations was an outflow of $91 million for the quarter and on a year-to-date
basis is tracking to our expectations. We are increasing our full year cash flow outlook by $100 million, which I'll
address further in a few minutes along with other updates to our 2011 guidance.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 6.4 million shares of common stock for $313 million bringing the
year-to-date share repurchase to 12.5 million shares for $625 million.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Our total company
bookings for the quarter were $7.4 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $12.5 billion. In addition to the $1.7 billion
Saudi Patriot booking at IDS, other notable bookings included $315 million at Missile Systems for the development of
Standard Missile-3 for the Missile Defense Agency, and $200 million for the production of Standard Missile-6 for the
U.S. Navy. And SAS booked $109 million on an international program.
Technical Services booked $612 million for domestic training and $119 million for foreign training programs in
support of the Warfighter FOCUS program. TS also booked $100 million for base operations, maintenance and support
services in Australia. Backlog at the end of the quarter was a strong $34.5 billion.
If you'd now move to Page 5. Sales were slightly above our expectations. By business, IDS had second quarter 2011 net
sales of $1.3 billion. The change in IDS sales was primarily due to lower volume on the Zumwalt program as a result of
the revised funding profile which I spoke about on prior calls. IIS had second quarter 2011 net sales of $752 million
compared to $472 million in the second quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, last year's net sales included an adjustment related to the UK Border Agency program for $316 million.
It is worth noting that during the quarter, we filed our counterclaim against the UK Border Agency for the collection of
receivables and damages in the amount of $800 million. We don't anticipate any change to our reserve position and we
don't expect to make any further comment until a final resolution, which isn't expected until mid 2013.
Missile Systems had net sales of $1.4 billion. The change was primarily due to lower sales on SM-2 driven by lower
planned production build rates. NCS had net sales of $1.1 billion. The change in net sales was primarily due to the
planned decline in production of U.S. Army sensor programs.
Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 12% driven by growth on intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance systems programs and international airborne tactical radar program and higher net

sales related to Raytheon Applied Signal Technology, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2011. And Technical
Services had sales up modestly compared with the same period last year.
Moving ahead to Page 6, we are pleased by our overall company margin performance. Our adjusted margin was 12.4%.
On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted margin was 12.5%, up 10 basis points over the comparable period in 2010. The
strength in our underlying margin was due to our continued focus on execution as we have discussed on prior calls, and
includes the benefits related to our ongoing cost-efficiency initiatives.
So looking at business margins, NCS margins were up in the quarter compared with the same period last year, the result
of solid operating performance. IDS and Technical Services margins were essentially in line with prior year's Q2.
When you look at IIS, if you normalize for the cost related to the UK Border Agency program in both the second
quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2010, margins were essentially in line at slightly over 8%.
Missile's underlying margins were strong and absorbed $15 million related to a contractual settlement. At SAS, the
change in margins was primarily due to the acquisition and integration-related costs for Applied Signal Technology,
which impacted SAS's margins by approximately 70 basis points in the quarter. We're very pleased with the
performance of AST. The integration is going well and they are tracking to our expectations. Overall, the company
continues to perform well.
Turning now to Page 7. Second quarter 2011 adjusted EPS was $1.39, the increase was driven by capital deployment
actions, specifically share repurchases. And on a year-to-date basis, adjusted EPS was $2.77, up 7% from the same
period last year.
Okay. If you'd please turn to Page 8, I'd like to briefly comment on our updated outlook for the year. We've tightened
the range for full year 2011 net sales, reducing the high end by $400 million. We now expect sales to be in a range of
between $25.5 billion and $25.9 billion. We expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 28.3%; this reflects a
recently approved tax-related benefit of $55 million including interest, or $0.15 per diluted share, related to multiple
prior year tax filings. This will be booked in the third quarter.
As a result, we've increased our full year GAAP EPS outlook and now see a range of $4.82 to $4.97 per share. And as I
discussed a few minutes ago, we've increased our guidance for operating cash flow from continuing operations by $100
million to between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion. Year-to-date cash flow is tracking to our initial guidance that we
provided back in January of 2011, where the cadence of cash generation was weighted to the second half of the year,
largely due to the timing of some specific working capital items.
We had one additional payroll period in the second quarter of 2011 compared to 2010, as well as a burn down of some
advances on international programs that's expected to be offset in the second half based on recent order activity.
Essentially our view of the cadence of cash flow from operations hasn't changed, however our confidence in the
magnitude of the improvement in working capital has, which is driving the increase in our guidance.
And as you can see on Page 9, we've reflected the change in our guidance by business. The increase in margin guidance
reflects the expected additional benefits of our productivity and efficiency initiatives. Overall, we're pleased with the
results of our operational improvements and the margin we've delivered, while at the same time, passing along savings
to our customers.
On Page 10, we've provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS
and operating cash flow from continuing operations.
Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize. We saw solid performance in the second quarter, and in many areas
exceeded the guidance we provided back in April. We had strong bookings, solid sales in a challenging environment,
strong margins and earnings per share. And we've increased our cash flow outlook for the year.
Looking ahead, we're well positioned to address the opportunities and also the challenges in our industry with a diverse
portfolio of innovative technologies. We remain focused on delivering best value for our customers and our
shareholders. This includes making sure the company continues to be proactive and have the right cost structure to
operate effectively and efficiently in a dynamic and evolving marketplace.

With that, Bill and I will open the call up to questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of George Shapiro, Access 342.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: David, look – from the guidance, you took down several of the sectors by $100 million at
the high end and it looks like the most of it came out of the fourth quarter. Can you just give the thought process as to
what's going on since it changed for multiple sectors?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. So you'll recall that when we gave initial guidance back in January for the year, we
had a range of about $800 million and it was the widest range certainly in recent history, and that's just as a result of
what was going on. Midpoint through the year, we have better clarity. I wouldn't say there's anything specific in any of
the segments. Again, we have good visibility for the third and fourth quarter. We've been able to tighten up our
expectations of the timing of awards and how these will play out from a sales standpoint. So there's nothing
remarkable, I just feel that we have a better view of how we're going to close out 2011.
I do want to point out one thing, this does not reflect any loss of business. Again, it's just a retiming and a better gauge
on how we see things playing out.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: And then a follow up. My old pet peeve's that you effectively beat your own earnings
guidance in the quarter by about $0.10 and it looks like in terms of the new distribution of earnings in Q3 and Q4, you
took out somewhere around $0.10 in the Q3 and Q4, probably due to the lower sales potential. Is that a fair way to look
at it?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, let me try to put it a little bit differently. Okay? And I had sense, George, that you
might ask me this question. So here's the way I'd think about it. We improved the first half from an EPS standpoint of
say, I don't know, $0.14, $0.15, $0.16. And that was driven by the timing of the cost efficiencies that Bill spoke to
earlier and I spoke to a little bit as well. Then we tightened the sales range in the back half of the year for both the third
and the fourth quarter and we offset roughly $50 million of associated earnings, again, principally with the cost
efficiencies. So when you stand back from this, we're continuing to drive margins and earnings results from cost
efficiencies as we tighten up the sales guidance from a full year standpoint. It's a first half, second half thing, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks a lot, Dave.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Hey, Dave, can you talk a little bit about some of the margins and just look again at that first
half, second half issue? Like SAS in particular, how do you get the margins up to that 13.3%, 13.5% level given the
12.7% for the first half? Is that a specific program that we'll see a proper rate adjustment in one quarter? Or is that

something different? And then, at the same time on NCS you have the reverse issue where the second half would imply
much lower margins. And can you talk about that?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Right. So SAS continues to perform well, I would say on virtually every level of the
business. So from a margin perspective specifically, the timing of productivity improvements in that business are
second-half weighted. Notwithstanding the broader company, from an SAS business perspective you'll see greater
improvements from a productivity standpoint flowing through their financials in the third and fourth quarter.
With respect to NCS, the year-to-date margins are higher than guidance and that was driven by a couple of things, both
the productivity and cost-efficiency actions that were taken in NCS, as well as mix. They had a fairly strong level of
sales in some production programs and that also helped out margins in the first half. So again, it's – I would say that
there's nothing too remarkable in either of the businesses, it's simply timing from first half to second half.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.
Operator
And the next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Dave, did you provide the full year bookings guidance? I don't know if I heard it.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, that's a good question, Rob. We actually don't provide formal guidance on bookings.
We have a target for bookings that has not changed since our initial guidance of $27.5 billion for the year, plus or
minus $500 million. And it's probably important to note that about 30% of that will come from international sales. Let
me just ask the next question that you're probably going to – let me answer the next question that you're probably going
to ask me anyway.
So from a book-to-bill standpoint, we still expect to close out the year in the 1.06 to 1.08 range and I'd suggest that
we're biased towards the higher end of that range.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay. So it doesn't really change much even though the high end of the sales guidance
changes a little bit there for the book-to-bill calculation? But it's close.
And so Bill, I would ask you what are the major things on the horizon that gets you there? What are the swing factors?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Ton of stuff. Let's see if I can go through them. Probably international's the easiest one,
we've got TPY-2 radars in the back half in Q4. Those could be in the, let's say, $800 million to $1 billion range. We've
got Patriot in there, whether you're looking at Taiwan or Kuwait, those are both late in Q4. Totaled up together, those
could be, say, in the $1 billion to $2 billion range as we see it.
We've got some missile activity especially in Paveway, we expect in Q3, early Q4. We have a signed contract that
could be in the $500 million to $600 million range. We see air traffic control radars in the $100 million to $200 million
in Q3, Q4. We see missiles worth about another $300 million to $400 million in various orders, various countries, split
across both quarters.
Training is about $300 million the next two quarters. And we expect an announcement sometime probably in Q4 on
Turkey and then, we'll see where we go from there, as you know that's a competitive venue that's taking place there.
And then, we've started talk with Oman on air and missile defense and that could in the $1 billion to $2 billion range.
So internationally, pretty good. If you look domestically, probably $1 billion worth of missile stuff to go and the rest is
our standard contracts under $50 million, which we have hundreds of them that take place. So that's how we look at the

next two quarters and what we have in front of us.
We've seen good growth internationally. Our bookings in the quarter were 36%, international sales were about 26% of
that. And we see the year, bookings international probably being around 30% so it's going to be a little higher and sales
should be about 25%. So there's a lot going on and as we said at the beginning of the year and it hasn't change, we
expect the second half to be busy for us and of course, the economic environment puts a cloud over everything but that
isn't stopping us from what we have in front of us and the air show convinced me that these customers still want what
we have.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: And just as a follow-up to that, Bill. The CR that we had and the potential for another one
here, how does that enter into the thinking on everything you just said, at least domestically?
<A - William H. Swanson>: That's how we look at it and our job is to get these things done so we can ramp up
quicker. If you look at it, both Dave and I mentioned the Saudi award. We are getting ready to start congressional
notification. But from our standpoint as a company, we've released some funds to get all the planning and orders
stacked up and get us ready so that the day we get the green light, we've got a lot a preplanning and stuff already in the
hopper ready to go, rather than start from scratch when that happens. So we're trying to pre-position stuff so we get a
good jump on it.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Thanks for all the detail.
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, no problem. Happy to do it. You can tell we're keeping an eye on it.
Operator
And the next question will come from the line of Heidi Wood, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, Bill. On another topic, I wondered if you would give us a sense about how you're thinking
about incumbency? Under Gates, he was a pretty strong proponent of incumbency and I wondered if you could give us
some color on how you think Panetta may or may not vary? And of course for you it cuts both ways, you have both
incumbency and you're pushing in some critical areas to oust some incumbents, such as the Aegis system recompete.
So can you talk – tell us a little bit about the strategy for that in a defense budget down cycle?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, incumbency, I guess the way we look at it here is competition is a way of life. And
what you try and do is get your business sized properly. That's why when you look at us we proactively manage our
headcounts, we manage our facilities and our utilization so that we can compete on any given day. And once you get
behind that eight ball that we all learned from the '90s, it's hard to get around it and we've learned to stay in front of it
and that's the way we look at competition. And as you say it goes both ways, but for me this company competes all the
time. I know you like technology and if you just look at some of our wins, these are small jobs in the $2 million to $20
million range, but we're winning in advanced wireless networks where we give the individual soldier a network radio
nodes on the battlefield, so think of it as a soldier's information system.
And we have advanced cryptographic modernization where we're providing secure radios with two contracts there we
just got that are worth about $50 million in total. And advanced detectors, advanced human factors, advanced missile
programs, advanced sensors for IEDs, I could go on and on, but every day we compete here and you're right, it goes
both ways and if you're competitive and you have good processes that can spin quickly on a dime, I think you're ready
for competition and I don't see it changing.
Internationally, we compete every day, so when you look at our international growing at high single-digits, it's part of
our DNA, I guess the best way to describe it, Heidi, I don't lose any sleep on it.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, Bill.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Did that get what you were looking for?

<Q - Heidi Wood>: Well, I just can't readily recollect in the last three or four years any major upsets on – and it just
seems that we'd see a repeated pattern of incumbency again which is good for you in the areas where you're strong. But
I'm just wondering in terms of the attempts to penetrate to the...
<A - William H. Swanson>: Well, Heidi, since you gave me that opening, how about Small Diameter Bomb where we
expected to lose. I could go through them, I just don't want to impugn any of our competitors when I – we don't gloat,
we just get up every day and make the donuts here and do our job.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: All right. Great. Thanks very much, Bill.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

And the next question will come from the line of David Strauss, UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Hey, Dave. Do you – what was the sales growth number when you adjust for e-Borders and
you adjust for AST? What do you see as organic growth in the quarter? Did sales actually decline?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: It was around – if you adjust for e-Borders it was around flat year-over-year organically.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And then, any sense of what AST contributed in the quarter?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: AST in the quarter was – had about $56 million in sales and roughly $90 million
year-to-date, most of it obviously being classified.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And then following-up on that, it looks like the sales guidance implies a bit of a pickup
relative to that in the second half. In particular, it looks like at Missiles and NCS, can you just comment on what gives
you guys the confidence that you're going to actually see a sales pickup in the back half of the year relative to what you
saw in the first half?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure, yeah. Well Bill, just mentioned the Small Diameter Bomb II and that'll be ramping up
by way of example and there's other programs in the Missiles group not quite that size, but that are also ramping up
from a production standpoint. With respect to NCS, that ramp is based on both some wins, again it's a very robust
portfolio of a lot of smaller type programs, wins that took place in the second quarter that we're expecting in the third
quarter and we're expecting to ramp up there as well. We're comfortable with the second half sales guidance.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Last one from me, at NCS the 15% margins in the quarter, were there any EAC
adjustments? Any one timers in that number, Dave?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No. And maybe I didn't go as – I wasn't quite as clear as I should have been on – with one
of your colleagues. There was some favorable impact from mix, I talked about a production program, both – and that
was both internationally and domestically. And they just did an excellent job with respect to bringing forward some
cost productivity and cost-efficiency initiatives. So there wasn't anything remarkable there.
The only area that I would say that something was a non-recurring, for lack of a better term, was the – there was a
contractually – a contractual-related settlement that – in Missile Systems, but other than that there was nothing else in
the company.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Great. Thanks.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.

And the next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Bill, I've got a big picture question for you. I was wondering if your general view of the
outlook has deteriorated over the last couple of months, given the situation on the U.S. domestic front? And whether
that's having an impact on your decision making with regards to the deployment of capital?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Well, put in perspective I think if you look at what's going on as a country, we need to
make sure the nation doesn't default on its obligations. We need a balanced plan that reduces the deficits and burns
down our national debt. And we need a foundation for true economic growth in my opinion.
It's difficult to do all of this as we can read in the papers and the administration and the Congress need to get it done. I
personally, I won't speak for the company here, but me, personally, I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll reach a
conclusion here in time and the Senate and the House, in my opinion, have to reach a compromise and that's the thing
we have to get done.
Given that as a backdrop from our point of view, you've seen our forecast as we go forward. I'll have Dave comment
here on the capital, but from our standpoint we look at our balance sheet, it's a strong balance sheet. We don't have to
do anything different in that regard. We have the strength to invest in ourselves which we're going to continue to do,
because as a company you go through these cycles and those that are strong, well run, have invested in themselves on a
good portfolio, come out of that period firing on all cylinders and that's what we expect to do. So that's how I look at it.
I'll ask Dave if he's got anything to add?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yes. I'll just echo a little bit of what Bill just mentioned. A few years back, one of the
strategic thrusts that Bill put forward was to have a exceptionally solid financial foundation. The balance sheet is very,
very healthy. The pension – the pension plan is tracking towards being fully funded from a PPA basis of say 2013. We
should close out this year just under 90%. We have been, I think, fairly forward leaning from a share repurchase
program. We've increased dividends for six or seven years in a row now. We have continued to invest in ourselves
from a technology standpoint, as well as in many other areas and I don't see that changing going forward.
Someone asked earlier about M&A, Bill set out a strategy on M&A and we've been executing along those lines for the
last few years and we don't see any wholesale changes in that area either. We'll continue to look at acquisitions that fill
important technology gaps for the company and add real incremental value to shareholders looking forward.
So again, notwithstanding the environment that was – that we all find ourselves in, I think you can expect Raytheon to
continue to deliver for its customers and its shareholders.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And I would add one last thing. The most important thing in times like this is to be
transparent and that's what we try to do more than anything. So what you see is what you get.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

<A - William H. Swanson>: We were just testing you.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Yeah, Doug is a lot taller than I am. Two quick questions, I found it curious, Bill, that you
mentioned that we started out at the gate pretty slow with the CR, but things from an order perspective had started to
accelerate. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of whether that continues today? And whether you think –
whether it's – the acceleration of orders has progressively gotten better as time has gone by and whether you expect that
to continue as we move into the back half of the year?
And then one question for Dave, I see that both in the quarter and in the first half of the year, R&D is down a little bit
and I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what the trajectory of that is going to be for the rest of the
year? Thanks, guys.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. Thanks. From our standpoint, we see the pace continuing here. The one concern
that I might have is that through all these budget drills that we don't lose our focus on keeping things going.
Fortunately, the two are somewhat separated now so I see the domestic continuing to flow in that regard and the
quicker we can get through the current talks here and figure out what we're going to do about short term, whether it's
the House bill, or the Senate bill between Reid and Boehner here, that the better it will be.
And as I said, I'm cautiously optimistic that they're going to reach a conclusion here which will allow people to
continue doing what they're doing so we can stay on track. So it's how I look at it, I'm not expecting a change and I'd
expect the cadence to keep on going here and...
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So yes. So with respect to R&D, it's timing. We actually expect to increase our R&D
year-over-year by about 5% and as a percent of sales, it'll go up to roughly 2.6%, 2.7% range. So it's just timing
between second quarter and third quarter. I also think it's important to keep in mind that, that doesn't include well over
$1 billion a year for contracts under the umbrella of CR&D, which is also R&D. So the company's continuing to focus
in that area.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. That's great. Thank you.

And the next question will come from the line of Peter Arment, Gleacher & Co.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Yeah, good morning, Bill and Dave.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Peter.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Hey. Bill, I guess this is more of having a bigger picture or a philosophical question. When you
look at the domestic portfolio or look at the entire mix of programs that you have and I think you've mentioned in the
past something like 8,000 programs or 15,000 contracts. How should we think about your ability to just stay above the
trajectory of the DoD budget? I think everyone's expecting a nose-down direction going forward. Is it just the mix that
gives you confidence? And maybe you could just give us a little color on that?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes, it's – mix helps us also probably about 60%, two-thirds of our business is DoD.
Good balance is international mix on top of that and then, it's a mix of others. For us, I already gave some of the –
where we expect bookings to be this year. Internationally in the 30% range and sales at 25%. If I look at classified, we
expect about 10% of our bookings to be there. Sales should be in the 15%, 16% range. We expect double-digit growth
in the classified. That's a good market for us. We do extremely well there with our technologies.
In the cyber area, we are seeing double-digit growth. We're seeing RFPs starting to flow in a more disciplined market
there. If you think about us, the way I like to describe it is that we have 24 contracts that make up about 25% of our
sales. The next 120 contracts make up the next 25% and then thousands of contracts make up the next 50%. And it's the

next thousands of contracts that we see on a daily basis across the gamut, across different customer bases. And that's
what we really believe is where the future is, because people still need to get things done and the pressure is is they're
not going to buy new but they need capabilities and they need solutions to their problems.
And at the air show, it was really nice to sit down with our customers and listen to the challenges that they're facing and
the things that we have in our portfolio that are already developed that don't need any new activity that can help them
solve their problems, whether it's in Asia and whether it's in the Mideast. So it really is the mix and just the – if you're a
techie like me, you look at our portfolio and it is a candy store. There is a lot in there.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Yes, and regarding I guess the latest on the cyber front, if you're talking about the – on the
bleeding edge here, we've heard a little bit about recently a lot of the contract opportunities are being bundled into Fed
IT contracts and you were deliberately did not want to build up a big Fed IT help desk business. Do you still see that
Raytheon is well positioned to get a lot of this cyber contract opportunities? How should we think about that?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes, I don't think about them as Fed IT. This cyber threat is very sophisticated. It's not
your standard ones and zeros business and what we see are specific efforts in this and this requires a good architecture
thinking, from us we have to protect ourselves and everybody can see what's going on in the world there. They've
actually brought a lot of attention to this problem, so we look at it in a way that is causing people to focus on it. We
continue to make sure that our products are protected and then the last aspect here is, given what we do in the other
two, it gives us a real natural of understanding, the domain knowledge that's needed to provide the systems or services
in this market.
So we look at the specific RFPs, that there's only going to be a small cadre of people that can do what's being asked to
be done, if that helps.
<Q - Peter Arment>: No, that's very helpful. Thank you very much. Nice quarter.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. Thank you.

And the next question will come from the line of Cai von Rumohr, Cowen & Co.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you very much. Bill, you gave a nice review of your foreign order potentials. I didn't
hear in there the potential for missiles and other gear associated with the Saudi F-15 buy or their potential helicopter
buy. How big is that number? And was it embedded in the numbers you gave us?
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, it wasn't, Cai. I didn't go through the domestic because there wasn't anything in there
that I thought would get somebody's attention. But if you look at it in Missiles, we probably got a $1 billion to $1.5
billion to go in bookings there and those are our standard Standard Missile. AMRAM, Paveway, 9Xs, I could go on but
those are laid out, program budgeted, so we expect that.
Then you look across the gamut of the business. You're right. We've got some F-18s (sic) [F/A-18s] (46:30) in there
and maybe $150 million in that. We've got some training in Warfighter that could be another $150 million or so. But
there's nothing – it's the standard bread and butter or what we do every quarter, that's why I didn't go through it. But
we've got it all laid out and it appears to all be on track.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: But so you're saying that these are the items that would be in the Saudi F-15 buy and the
Saudi helicopter buy?
<A - William H. Swanson>: We don't have the Saudi helicopter buy in there.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. So just if we take the totality of the Saudi F-15 buy and the Saudi helicopter buy, how
big would that – each of those be to you without going through whether it's missiles or electronics or what it is?

<A - William H. Swanson>: We haven't broken it out that way and we probably wouldn't talk about it that way, Cai,
until it's all finished and finalized, given the customer and given that – given we have two customers, the platform and
the end-item customer and you know me, I don't like talking about what our international customers are going to go do
till it's done.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Well, is it in your plan? Let me rephrase the question. Is it in your target?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes. We forecast and factor everything. Yes, it's not like we've forgotten it.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Great. And a question for Dave. Your $15 million contract adjustment in Missiles, what was
that about? And can you itemize, were there any other – I guess you have the settlement, but to be more specific,
anywhere else in your business that you had any other pluses or minuses that we would consider special?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No. There wasn't any other items across the company that you might consider "special."
And with respect to the settlement, we're not going to get into that publicly at this point. But again, we see it as an event
that took place in the second quarter and not to be repeated in the back half of the year.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: And the last one, we've seen a number of other companies where we didn't think there was
much optempo business, the impact at Northrop in specific. Do you have any – how big is your optempo related
business? And what are you seeing? Do you see any incremental risk there?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No. Actually I would actually, strongly suggest that there's not a lot of incremental risk
there. We've been fairly thoughtful in what we're seeing in the back half of the year and going forward. And that book
of business is come down to almost a rounding error from a Raytheon perspective.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. Thank you very much.

And the next question will come from the line of Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein & Co.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Good morning. Jason's making me feel taller today.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: You look a little taller.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Well, thank you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: I'd like to talk a little bit about international and the competitive situation. When you look at
Turkey, where you've got Russian, Chinese, European systems and a lot of companies being fairly aggressive in other
countries trying to pick up their own business base, how is this playing out for you? Are you seeing more situations
where you've got basically tougher terms in terms of putting content in countries and pricing? Can you talk a little bit
about that?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I think, Turkey, I could wax eloquently there. If you want to buy a viewgraph, you
can probably buy a viewgraph. If you want to buy a system that takes five times the manning or 10 times the spares or
costs you double in five years, then you go buy that kind of system.
The good news is we're competing with something that's proven. What we always realize is that countries make
political decisions and you don't change your business model because of that. You continue to offer the price that's
right or the value that's right and countries have to decide and – Saudi Arabia's a good example of upgrading what they
have with a proven system. So we look at it that way.

Internationally, the marketplace is the same. We compete and have competed my whole career internationally and it
feels about the same. Nothing's really dramatically changed. What we do is we understand the job. We price in the
appropriate risk and we want to make sure that we give our shareholders the returns they expect out of us. And that's
why I said earlier, we spend a lot of time proactively managing our expenses and our costs, so that we can compete
internationally and domestically.
The way I like to think about it is if you think about eight years ago, we had about $18 billion in sales with 78,000
employees. Today, we have $25 billion with 72,000 employees. So we continue to get more efficient. We continue to
deliver strong margins and so forth. So that's how you have to look at it. And one of the things you don't sit in our
reviews here, but when we bid a program, we're always very, very conscious of what are the corners here, what cash
flow is needed, what margins are needed, what risk we should be taking on and can we deliver. And that hasn't changed
from that standpoint. So I don't know if I'm really answering your question, but the temperature of the water feels about
the same to me.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: So no greater pressure with respect to margins off that and...
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, we're not sitting here in a bid and taking – and we've got to take 10% off to go win it
and put the company in a position that people would look and say, what the heck are you guys doing? I made the
comment, we want to be as transparent as we possibly can for our investors. And you expect us to continue to deliver
the same kind of returns that we've delivered.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: And then, if I can, on the domestic side, Dave, you commented that you're seeing domestic
book-to-bill above 1. But if you look down within that and you look at areas that are stronger versus ones that may be
weaker, how do you see it? I look at your missile backlog, it's coming down a little bit. We've seen some pressure on
Missile Systems in the [ph] HAK-D (53:46). How are you seeing different pieces of that domestic market?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, it's not unique to any one product area or any one business. And we've talked about
this 10 different ways and we have thousands of different programs, and I would say, there's areas of strength and
there's areas of focus for the company. We've talked a lot about ISR. I would say that's probably a standout across the
company.
You saw what SAS delivered in the second quarter from a sales standpoint. Bookings were also very, very strong. And
they're not the only business that participates in ISR. That's across four of our business areas. So from that standpoint,
from a missile defense standpoint, from an EW standpoint, it's the things that you and others would be familiar with.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And just to chime in here, the back half is a big one for missiles. As I mentioned, we
expect $300 million to $500 million of international in missiles. We've already got a signed contract for about $500
million on Paveway that we need to get notified so we can start off. And then domestically I mentioned, we've got
about $1 billion to a $1.5 billion of bookings coming in, in Q3 and Q4. So that's going to build up their backlog as we
go into it.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.
<A - Todd Ernst>: Deanna, we have time for one more question?
Operator
And yes, the next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel, Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. I'm going to try to make this one straightforward. Dave, if I do the math, I think
your organic growth's down maybe 1% or 2%. And the softball part of the question though is, Bill, if you look at
Patriot system today, it's substantially different from when it was when you were going around the world first selling it.
So there's two parts to this.

One is that, what cues are you getting from the market? If you're down 1% or 2% and the reality is the world's changed,
how are you thinking about positioning the company for virtually no growth or minimal growth? And then, are there
enough opportunities like the upgrade of this or the next-gen AMRAM that make a difference to beat this market of
very little growth?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I think the way, Howard, is that your strategy is not done on a day-by-day basis, as
you know as well as I do. So for us, our strategy has been to make sure that we position ourselves in the right markets.
We think we've done that in cyber, we think we've done that and Homeland Security. I think you picked up rightly so,
recently, EW should be the next growth market. You heard me touch base on that.
The way we think of our company and to be able to do things in this environment is that you have to not only move
forward but you have to move backward. And by backward I mean is, how do you keep running the things that are
getting old and some places internationally and domestically won't be able to afford to redo and start new, but they
want a capability to make it almost like new, if that makes sense.
And so from our standpoint, we look to being able to take systems and make them like they're a new development and
we have a portfolio of everything from radars to missiles to EO systems, to communication, that we can go new and we
can go backwards to make like new and that's how we expect to power through this thing and be ready for the next up
cycle as we go.
And our technologists are continuing to work on ways to do that. Take radars, for example, gallium nitride, we'll be
able to upgrade every phased array we've ever built with new technology as we go forward. And I could go through the
EO world, the RF world, even the C4I world for that matter. And I'm really encouraged by some of the new
technologies that I see our teams working on. They are eye-watering and orders of magnitude different than what I
grew up with.
And you're right about Patriot. There's a system that's over two-thirds brand new and when you see what we're
delivering and the capabilities and the upgrades, it's going to be going for a long time, way past me.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So, Howard. Howard, this is Dave. Let me just clarify something you'd mentioned. When I
spoke to the growth rate earlier, what I was suggesting was on a full year basis we should be around breakeven from a
domestic growth standpoint. So we did have a strong book-to-bill in the quarter. But your math is right, we're down
around 1%-ish in the quarter on organic growth domestically. But the question I was answering, which may not have
been exactly the way it was phrased, was on a full year basis.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. See you later.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. Thanks.
