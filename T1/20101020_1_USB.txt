Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Judy and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to begin on page 3 of the
presentation and review a few of the highlights of our quarterly results. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $908
million through the third quarter of 2010 or $0.45 per diluted common share. Earnings were $0.15 higher than the same
quarter of last year and equal to the second quarter of 2010. We achieved record total net revenue of $4.6 billion in the
third quarter. This represented a 7.9% increase over the same quarter of 2009, and a 1.5% increase over the prior
quarter.
Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5.8%, benefiting from recent acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, average
loans were down slightly from last year. Importantly however, on a linked-quarter basis, average total loans grew by
0.7%.
We continue to post strong year-over-year average deposit growth, particularly in the low cost categories, including
noninterest bearing, interest checking, money market and savings. These categories grew on average 13.6%
year-over-year or 9% excluding acquisitions.
Once again, credit quality improved quarter-over-quarter as net charge-offs and nonperforming assets excluding
covered assets declined by 10.7% and 4.6%, respectively from the second quarter. Our capital position remains strong
and growing, with the Tier 1 common ratio and Tier 1 capital ratio increasing to 7.6% and 10.3%, respectively at
September 30.
Slide four graphs our performance metrics over the past 5 quarters. Return on average assets in the third quarter was
1.26% and return on average common equity was 12.8%. The 5 quarter trend of our net interest margin and efficiency
ratio are shown on the graph on the right hand of the slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.91% was just
slightly higher than the prior quarter and 24 basis points higher than the same quarter of 2009. Our third quarter
efficiency ratio was 51.9%, slightly lower than the prior quarter, but about the same quarter of last year. We remain the
best among our peers in terms of efficiency, and the increase in this ratio year-over-year reflects both ongoing
investments, and the impact of recent legislative and regulatory actions on revenue and on expense.
Turning to slide five, our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. Additionally, our tangible common
equity to tangible assets ratio rose from 5.4% at September 30, 2009, to 6.2% at September 30, 2010. Our company
continues to generate significant capital each quarter, due to the momentum in our diverse business mix in addition to
our efficiency and our ongoing profitability.
As I have said before, we are confident that our capital levels and our ability to generate new capital each quarter can
support a dividend increase and allow us to meet or exceed any capital requirements that may be forthcoming.
Increasing the dividend remains a top priority for our management team and our board of directors, but we must
continue to wait for final regulatory capital guidelines to be established and regulatory approval to be given before a
dividend action can be taken. We fully expect however, to be one of the first banks to gain approval to raise our
dividend once those guidelines have been determined.
Moving on to slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $10 billion year-over-year. But as noted on
the slide, excluding acquisitions, total average loans declined by 0.4% year-over-year as the average commitment
utilization rate by our commercial and corporate borrowers declined from 32% in the third quarter of 2009 to 26% in
the third quarter of this year. On a linked-quarter basis however, total loans increased by 0.7% as we experienced
slightly higher demand for new loans from credit-worthy borrowers and as the average utilization rate on commitments
stabilized, albeit at a historically low level.
Notably we recorded an increase in average commercial loans outstanding quarter-over-quarter. This is the first
linked-quarter increase since the fourth quarter of 2008. At September 30, total loans were approximately $3 billion
higher than at June 30, again signifying that we are seeing some improvement in loan demand, coupled with an
ongoing flight to quality. As we continue to originate and renew lines and loans for our qualified customers who want,
and who need credit. In fact, during the third quarter of 2010, U.S. Bank originated over $16.5 billion of residential

mortgages, originated almost $6 billion of other consumer loans, including installment loans, student loans, lines of
credit and home equity lines and loans. We originated new prime-based credit card accounts with lines totaling $1.4
billion and we issued over $12 billion of new commitments and renewed almost $19 billion of commitments to small
businesses, commercial and commercial real estate customers. Overall, excluding mortgage production, new
originations plus new and renewed commitments total approximately $38 billion, about $2 billion higher than the
previous quarter's total.
Total average deposits increased by $16.3 billion, or 9.8% over the same quarter of last year. Excluding acquisitions,
the growth rate was 2.7% year-over-year. Total average deposits declined by $658 million on a linked-quarter basis
primarily due to lower corporate trust, institutional trust and broker dealer deposits.
Turning to slide seven. The company reported record total net revenue in the third quarter of $4.6 billion. The growth
in revenue was driven by earning asset growth and expanding net interest margin, strength in our fee-based businesses,
organic growth initiatives and acquisitions, all tempered by the impact of recent legislative actions.
Turning to slide eight and credit quality. Third quarter total net charge-offs of $995 million were 10.7% lower than the
second quarter of 2010. Nonperforming assets excluding covered assets decreased by $171 million, or 4.6%.
On slide nine, you can see that early and late stage delinquencies excluding covered assets improved again this quarter.
The decrease in net charge-offs and nonperforming assets in addition to the favorable changes in early and late state
delinquencies and as detailed on the right hand side of slide nine, the continuing favorable trend in criticized assets all
indicate that we have reached the inflection point in credit quality. Accordingly, we expect the level of both net
charge-offs and nonperforming assets excluding covered assets to continue to decline in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide ten, you can see that this was the first reporting period since the fourth quarter of 2007 that we have
not recorded an incremental provision for loan losses. This compares with an incremental provision equal to
approximately 2% of net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2010 and approximately 40% of net charge-offs in the
third quarter of 2009. Despite this positive trend in credit quality, we did not release reserves this quarter. Contrary to
some of our peers, our loan portfolio and particularly a number of consumer loan categories has grown. And the
economy although showing some signs of stability, continues to be uncertain with high unemployment and a very
challenging real estate market.
We entered this cycle with a strong and resilient balance sheet and we intend to protect that position going forward.
Maintaining reserve levels commensurate with the growth and changing risk of our loan portfolio is an integral part of
that effort. You will find additional credit information on all of the major loan categories in the appendix of this slide
presentation.
Finally, I wanted to address concerns about the validity of our foreclosure process and calls by many for a national
moratorium. Our company's primary goal is to keep borrowers in their homes whenever possible. U.S. Bank
participates in a number of loan modification programs, including HAMP, which establish affordable payment options
for our customers. In addition, we have developed and implemented other foreclosure prevention methods that include
early contact with delinquent borrowers, marketing outreach programs and participation in foreclosure prevention
workshops. In fact, since 2007, U.S. Bank has modified over 34,000 loans with mortgage balances outstanding of
approximately $8.2 billion.
The manageable size and quality of our portfolio allow us to manage the foreclosure process internally. Recall that U.S.
Bank did not participate in the large scale origination and/or securitization of subprime or questionable loan structures.
The foreclosure process at U.S. Bank follows well-established safeguards, including both individual and committee
review of each loan file to ensure that the foreclosure documentation is accurate. We routinely review our policies and
procedures and we have just reassessed and reconfirmed the quality of our processes and controls. We will continue to
review our processes going forward, and comply with any information request we receive from our regulators or other
government officials. We do not however, have plans to halt foreclosures and we believe that any blanket foreclosure
moratorium would seriously impair the national economic recovery.

Before leaving this topic, I'd like to spend a moment on discussing U.S. Bank's role as trustee for mortgage backed
securities, as our company is referenced from time to time erroneously as having certain responsibilities with respect to
transaction where in fact, our role is limited to very specific duties outlined in the documents that establish the trust. As
trustee, U.S. Bank does not have a role in the servicing of mortgages that are used as collateral in the trust. As trustee,
we do not select the service or the mortgages or have a role in the actions the servicer takes in the foreclosure process.
Further, as trustee and/or custodian, we do not have responsibility for determining the validity or enforceability of the
underlying mortgage documents. That is the role of securitizations sponsor.
I will now turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Richard. I will take just a few minutes to provide you with a few more details about the results. I turn your
attention to slide 12 which gives a full view of our third quarter 2010 results, compared with those recorded in the
second quarter of 2010, and the third quarter of 2009.
Earnings per diluted common share were $0.45 for the third quarter of 2010, equal to the prior quarter and $0.15 higher
than the third quarter of 2009. The key drivers of the company's third quarter results are detailed on slide 13. The $305
million, or 50.6% increase in net income year-over-year was primarily the result of a 7.9% increase in the net revenue
and a $461 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, which was compromised of a $46 million favorable
variance in net charge-offs and a $415 million decrease in incremental provision expense. These favorable changes in
total revenue, and the provision were partially offset by a 16.2% increase in noninterest expense year-over-year.
Net income was $142 million, or 18.5% higher on a linked-quarter basis. A 1.5% growth in total net revenue and a
favorable variance of $144 million in the provision for loan losses more than offset the slight increase in noninterest
expense quarter-over-quarter.
A summary of the significant items that impact the comparison of our third quarter results to prior periods are detailed
on slide 14. The only significant item called off for the third quarter of 2010 were net securities losses of $9 million,
not large enough to have an impact on the company's EPS.
Earnings per diluted common share in the second quarter of 2010 included a $0.05 benefit related to the nonrecurring
exchange of perpetual preferred stock for outstanding income trust securities. Other smaller items are listed for your
review on the slide. Significant items impacting the third quarter of 2009 are also highlighted on slide 14, the largest
item of which was a $415 million incremental provision expense.
Turning to slide 15, net interest income increased year-over-year by $320 million, or 14.8%, due to a $17.8 billion
increase in average earning assets and an expanded net interest margin. The increase in average earning assets was
primarily acquisition related. The net interest margin was 24 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2009,
primarily to growth in low cost deposits, lower funding rates and improved credit spreads.
On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $68 million, the result of both an increase in average
earning assets, slightly higher margin and day basis. The net interest margin was higher by just 1 basis point over the
prior quarter as lower funding costs were partially offset by the incremental impact of CARD Act. Assuming the
current rate environment and yield curve, we expect the net interest margin to decline by 5 to 10 basis points in the
fourth quarter of 2010 due to the CARD Act and lower long term rates.
Slide 16 provides you with more detail on the change in average total loans outstanding. Average total loans grew by
$10.6 billion, or 5.8% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, average total loans declined by 0.4% and as you can see
from the chart on the left, this decline was driven by an 8.7% year-over-year decrease in average commercial loans
outstanding. As Richard pointed out, the reduction in commercial and corporate lending year-over-year was prior
primarily due to the utilization rate which has declined from 32% in the third quarter of 2009 to 26% in the current
quarter, representing a decrease in excess of $3 billion.

Covered loans, which grew by $9 billion year-over-year represent loans acquired through the FDIC assisted
transactions and include Downey, PFF, and the banking operations of FBOP, the later of which was acquired on
October 31 of 2009. On a linked-quarter basis, the 0.7% increase in average loans outstanding was driven by increases
in commercial loans, residential mortgage and total retail loans.
Moving to slide 17. You can see the growth in total low cost core deposits over the past 5 quarters. Average total
deposits grew by $16.3 billion, or 9.8% year-over-year, partially due to acquisitions. Notably, low cost core deposits,
noninterest-bearing, interest checking, money market and savings excluding acquisitions grew by over 9%. On a
linked-quarter basis, average deposits decreased slightly, principally due to corporate institutional customer activity,
which was partially offset by low cost deposit growth in the consumer bank.
Slide 18 represents in more detail the changes in noninterest income on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis.
Noninterest income in the third quarter of 2010 was $17 million, or 0.8% higher than the third quarter of 2009. This
variance was driven by growth in payments, commercial products and mortgage banking revenue. These favorable
variances were partially offset by lower deposit service charges, which reflected the legislative and bank-developed
pricing changes and lower trust and investment management fees. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was
flat.
Payments related revenue grew by 2.5%, driven by seasonally higher transaction volumes and mortgage banking
revenue increased by $67 million, driven by record high production volume and net securities losses were favorable.
These positive items were offset by reductions in deposit service charges, the results of changes in overdraft policies
and pricing, the Visa gain recorded in the second quarter of 2010, and a number of smaller variance in the other fee
income accounts. Acquisitions had a minimal impact on the variance in fee revenue on a year-over-year or
linked-quarter basis.
Slide 19 highlights noninterest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $332 million, or 16.2%. The majority of
the increase can be attributed to acquisitions, which accounted for $85 million of the increase, higher compensation and
benefits expense, driven by incentives, merit increases, and the restoration of the 5% salary reductions taken as part of
our cost savings program in 2009 and additional staffing. Higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects
accounted for $22 million of the increase. An increase in professional services expense and technology and
communication expense related to investments and projects and higher ORE expense, which will remain at the current
levels as we aggressively manage the disposition of our ORE properties. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense
was higher by just $8 million, or 0.3%.
Finally, the tax rate on a quota basis was 25.9% in the third quarter of 2010, compared to 25% in the second quarter of
2010, and 18.4% in the third quarter of 2009.
Given the heightened focus on mortgage foreclosure and repurchases, we have provided more detail in the company's
mortgage repurchase-related expense, and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments on
slide 20. We have also added this information to the supplemental financial data schedule attached to our quarterly
earnings release. As indicated on the table on the left-hand side of the slide, our ending reserve was $147 million at
September 30, and the addition to the reserve in the third quarter of 2010 was $70 million. This $70 million repurchase
expense was booked as a contra revenue item in the mortgage banking fee income line.
Mortgages repurchased and make-whole payments in the third quarter totaled $53 million. Our company's conservative
credit underwriting culture, as well as our very disciplined loan origination process, has resulted in lower repurchase
volumes and expense relative to our peers. Given the current environment, we expect repurchase activity to remain
slightly elevated over the next few quarters before beginning to moderate downward, with quarterly repurchase expense
of $50 million to $70 million per quarter and any reserve levels of between $150 million and $175 million.
On slide 21, we have listed the two regulatory changes that have and will have an impact on our results and we wanted
to give you a brief update on revenue assumptions related to these changes. We estimate that overdraft pricing and
policy changes have reduced revenue year-to-date 2010 by approximately $140 million, and will reduce revenue by an
additional $110 million to $120 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full-year 2010 estimate to between $250

million and $260 million.
The annual run rate going forward, is expected to be $440 million to $480 million. This is slightly lower than our
previous estimate and does not include any mitigating actions. Overall, our opt-in rate has been higher than expected,
but our pricing changes and lower than anticipated number of overdraft incidences keeps us from materially changing
our estimates. The CARD Act has reduced total revenue year-to-date by approximately $100 million, and is expected to
reduce revenue by approximately $60 million to $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect the total 2000
(sic) [2010] revenue impact to be in the range of $160 million to $180 million with an annual run rate going forward, of
approximately $250 million.
Finally, turning to slide 22, an update on the impact of Basel III. We originally presented this analysis at our Investor
Day in September, and we have now updated the numbers as of September 30, and the numbers have not changed
materially. The impact of limits for mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets, and investment and financial
institutions remains at 0. The impact of the deduction for the pension liability, purchased credit card relationship
intangibles and all others equals 38 basis points. While the changes related to our noncore capital elements or trust
preferreds, net of replacement capital requirements is equal to 45 basis points. All of this translates to a pro forma Tier
1 common equity ratio as of September 30 of 7.2% and a Tier 1 ratio of 9.4%. On a pro forma basis, this puts us above
the Tier 1 common equity target of 7%, the Basel III level required in the year 2019.
However, two items remain uncertain. First, the implementation timetable of the countercyclical component of capital
remains uncertain, and second, the systemic buffer as yet to be defined. Regardless, we have the capital we need today
and we continue to generate significant capital each and every quarter, so I'm very satisfied that we can manage our
capital requirements going forward.
Moving to the right hand side of the slide, I would say first and foremost that our liquidity has never been stronger.
There are still a number of unknowns in regard to how Basel III will be implemented. Given the strength of our balance
sheet and our ability to generate deposits and liquidity, we feel any change will be manageable and we have already
have a number of initiatives underway to ensure that we are prepared.
I will now turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks I turn your attention to slide 23. On September 15, we held an Investor
Day in New York City. The theme of the day was Positioned to Win. Our presentation highlighted our strong
foundation, including our ability to manage credit and risk, our diversified business mix and our prudent capital
management. We discussed how we have proven our ability to perform even during one of the most challenging and
uncertain economic cycles. We talked about how we have invested in our business lines and as a result, are building
profitable scale and growing our market share.
Our third quarter results fully support our belief that U.S. Bancorp is operating from a position of strength and remains
positioned to win. We are moving forward with optimism despite the headwinds of new regulatory and legislative
actions and oversight and still an uncertain economy. We are focused on the future and we are ready and willing to do
what we can to support the economic recovery of this country while sustaining our engaged and performance-driven
workforce in creating superior value for our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would be happy to answer any questions from the audience.

<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Jon.
<A - P.W. Parker>: Hey Jon.
<Q - Jon Arfstrom>: Thanks, good morning. A couple questions for you on lending, particularly commercial lending.
Can you talk a little bit about where that growth is coming from, if that's part of your national initiative or the small
business initiative that you have? Just give us an idea of where that demand is coming from.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So Jon, this is Richard. I'll start and I'll
ask Bill Parker to chime in. We're seeing it across the board slowly, just a little bit and just about everywhere. So, what
we're seeing is qualified customers are now starting to come back into the marketplace. As you think about it, the most
qualified are the ones who least needed to use our balance sheet to grow their companies, and they're starting now to
see enough reason to incur some debt and to develop some inventory and consider some investments.
So on the corporate banking side as you know, we have continued to enjoy some growth there, but these customers
have got a very strong capital market to use as well. And in some cases they're now using both the capital markets, and
the bank balance sheet and we are starting to see some growth there. Probably our most important growth comes from
the commercial banking middle market area where we're seeing continued slow, but steady increases across the entire
geography. We currently see stress in entertainment and gaming sections as you would expect and in all of our areas
where we have appraisals for owner-occupied real estate, they continue to reflect decreasing values, and there's some
continued stress in all of those areas as you would expect.
Community banking is steady as it always has been and agriculture looks to be very solid this year with a little lower
production being offset by higher commodity prices. And finally, small business continued to be very strong for us, not
only because we're starting to see a new lift in a number of small businesses getting to a point where they're strong
enough now to incur some debt. But a couple of years ago we placed a full court press on becoming more involved in
small business lending from traditional to SBA to small ticket leasing and those benefits are starting to yield results by
the hundreds of new employees we have put in place, and the backoffs as we created to do a better job at small lending.
So, for us, it's a lot – a little bit everywhere and a little bit of our good work a few years ago starting to come into
fruition. So, Bill, you might add to that.
<A - P.W. Parker>: Yes, I'll start with small business. I mean, that was up about 1% just in the quarter. Second quarter
to third quarter and that's pretty much across the board, whether it was SBA or the loan, small business loans originated
out of our branches. We had fairly steady growth in that area the last several quarters. And then on the corporate middle
market side we have a strong emphasis on leading credits. we've been able to successfully gain some market share in
those areas. So, we have seen pretty good, pretty good loan demand here in the last quarter.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You had more than one question, Jon?
<Q - Jon Arfstrom>: Yes. Just the next question is more of a, just changing the retail. Obviously, you highlighted your
Reg E issue and we have Durban that will show up at some point. But how do you think about the retail checking
product? Some of your larger competitors have made some changes in terms of the account structure and just curious
what you're thinking is. Is it higher minimums, is it monthly fees? How do you get paid for your retail branch network?
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you, Jon. First of all, to our
competitors, go for it. We're going to wait. And I think I said this last time, we I think have the luxury and we have
earned the position to watch and learn. I have no idea what the customer is going to want at this now next range. I'm
not going to say we're going to get it all back without knowing what that means. We have to have a value proposition.
We have to have a relationship. It's got more than a transaction account attached to it. We're building all those
preparations. But I'll tell you, I think it's going to be a monthly service charge, but I think it's going to be for more than
just the standard checking account. I think people will be able to offset any of those charges by having deeper
relationships and different value transactions with the company. But I'm not going to move on that quickly. We're
going to, I think I said this last time, we'll withhold some near term earnings by not jumping into the fray early, by
taking a little longer to learn what the right answer is. Perhaps take some market share while people are adjusting more

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Ed.
<Q - Ed Najarian>: Good morning, guys. I was just wondering if I could flip you back to page 21. And I guess I just
didn't quite understand exactly what you were saying on that page in terms of the impact. If you could just go through
that quickly, one more time.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. This is the regulatory environment, Ed?
<Q - Ed Najarian>: Yes.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. So, both CARD Act and on the overdraft
Reg E changes have been slowly impacting us more and more each and every quarter of 2010. I would say we're
getting to the full run rate in the fourth quarter. So, we were not at the full run rate in the third quarter and certainly, not
in the first half of the year. So, that 110/120 represents the full run rate and 4 times that amount is what you see for next
year.
<Q - Ed Najarian>: The full run rate of the negative revenue impact on a pre-tax basis.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: That is correct, Ed. And that is correct for both
the overdraft, and the CARD Act impact, and the CARD Act is both in fee income, and in net interest margin.
<Q - Ed Najarian>: Right. Okay. So, this is a revenue, sort of a lost revenue estimate on a pre-tax basis based on these
regulatory actions.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: That's is correct.
<A - P.W. Parker>: That's right. Another way of saying it is quarter 4 is finally hitting stride. Multiply it kind of by 4,
and you're kind of there without the mitigating discussion that we had with Jon a minute ago.
<Q - Ed Najarian>: Okay. And then next question would be with respect to the net interest margin outlook for the
fourth quarter, down 5 to 10 basis points, obviously, we saw good stability and good net interest income growth this
quarter. You indicated it was the low rate backdrop. Could you put a little more color around that, and would you
expect it to stabilize subsequent to 4Q, or is this the beginning of a bit of a NIM compression trend?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: There are 2 key factors, Ed, driving the fourth
quarter. One is what you just asked about, which is the full impact of CARD Act on our credit card rates and yields in
the fourth quarter, will be fully baked in, so to speak. And that's going to cause a bit of that compression. The second
item as you know, long rates are down versus where we were in the first half of the year and that has a negative impact
on both our securities portfolio and other earning assets. So, those are the two key drivers. Those are what's causing the
5 to 10 basis point decline in the fourth quarter. Depending upon what happens with long rates in 2011, I don't know
how that will look, but as we see today, and what the yield curve looks like today, that's what the impact is. If it doesn't
change a lot, that impact will be relatively stable. If the yield curve changes, it will adjust.
<A - P.W. Parker>: We're not trying to guess beyond quarter 4, we're just trying to see what moves.

<Q - Ed Najarian>: Right. But I mean, when you say relatively stable, if the interest rate remains stable, you mean it
will get down to that level, but not, potentially not compress a lot further than that? Or when you say relatively stable,
you mean ongoing down at that pace?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, Ed, we've been fairly consistent in trying
to look out 90 days because there are so many moving parts with margin. I would say relatively stable, given what I
know today about the yield curve and about rates, but there are a lot of moving parts there, and we'll be sure to update
you every quarter like we've been doing.
<Q - Ed Najarian>: Okay, and then last question, obviously very strong mortgage origination revenue this quarter. Do
you care to make any comments on your outlook for mortgage origination volume or revenue?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. So, Ed, we had about $16.5 billion of
production, a record quarter. Over $20 billion of apps, so another record. So, it was a tremendous quarter given the low
rate environment. The hedge was neutral, so that we didn't benefit at all from the hedge, and as you compare it on a
year-over-year basis, a year ago we'd actually made about $67 million on that. I would expect that third quarter to be
down somewhat. I mean, excuse me, the fourth quarter to be down somewhat just given the seasonality in the mortgage
business.
<Q - Ed Najarian>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: You bet.

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, John.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Hey John.
<Q - John McDonald>: Hi, good morning, guys. Andy, just on expenses if you could comment, give an outlook on
expenses if we kind of think ex the FDIC expense increase that you discussed coming on next year, is this quarter kind
of a good run rate on expenses? Do you have any other kind of puts and takes to mention going forward, that we should
think about at expenses?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Right, so you know, John, we talked a little bit
about this last quarter and I said the third quarter was a pretty good run rate – or second quarter was a pretty good run
rate for the third quarter, and it ended up being that way, we were up $8 million. So, I would say that we have most of
the components included. I think a couple of the unknowns are certainly as you mentioned the FDIC expense. You saw
yesterday that the 3 basis point increase is no longer part of the equation, but the equation is still uncertain, and the
exact rates are still uncertain. So, that's a factor. The fourth quarter is seasonally higher with our CDC, our tax
credit-related expense, so that'll be up a little bit. But I don't see any other material changes.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay. And Richard, you touched on the reserve release or the lack of reserve release,
compared to some of the peers. So, just any more color on kind of what factors will drive whether U.S. Bank has any
kind of recapture of reserves over the next couple of quarters as credit continues to improve?
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, John, I think as I said, all the
other quarters, it's a lot more math than it is art. So, we let the math dictate where we are. And I'd have to say that if we
continue to see a progression in our delinquency improvements and our nonperforming assets, we will probably see a
reserve release in the future quarters. As I also said about a year ago, if we end up doing that, it's because we failed in
our ability to predict perfectly and that will be the case. But I don't think we thought we'd be at this situation today. We
don't ever put it away with the goal of getting it back later. We simply put it away based on the math of what we see on
the current day.

As Bill would say, particularly, consumer loans are based on a four-quarter forward view. Commercial loans are a little
more lumpy and more individual based on company and in both cases they're coming down. But I also want to make
sure that we end this cycle with very, very strong reserve levels, adequate and strong reserve levels for our loan losses
as we go into the improving scenario. So, I think that if we keep following the math like we have, you'll start to see
some reserve recapture, but it won't be significant, and it wasn't intentional.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hi. Question just on the liability management side. We talked about NIM, NIM compression,
what could happen with the long end of the curve coming down. But maybe give us some color as to how you are
handling the liability side, opportunities to bring down your cost of funding there, and maybe could speak a little bit to
the possibility, yes or no, of TruPS redemption.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: So a couple of things. We had two debt
issuances in the last few months, both at the lowest rate ever issued by a bank holding company in the U.S., a 5-year
paper and 3-year. So, and I will tell you that we don't have a lot more issuance planned for the remainder of the year
and we don't have a lot rolling off in 2011.
Secondly, we have been growing deposits as you've seen, low cost core retail deposits, which is helpful in terms of our
funding costs. And we will have the second component or the second half of the IPS transaction that occurs late first
quarter, early second quarter of 2011. Those are the key components. We're watching on the further redemption in
terms of the rules around what counts as capital. But we have no plans to do an early exchange right now.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And Betsy, it's Richard. Let me just
say, I have instructed our team to be aggressive on deposit gathering. So, while you're hearing that there's going to be a
dearth of loan growth, I absolutely believe that we're going to continue to grow based on market share grab. I'm going
to make that assumption, and therefore, we're going to keep growing our deposits. And I think whichever bank ends
this downturn, goes into the recovery with the most customers, with the most deposits, especially core deposits, will
end up winning the next cycle. So, we're not backing down. We have the ability to be aggressive in the deposit pricing
based on relationships, and we're doing it across the board.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: But to the degree the loan growth is not as significant as the funding side, it does give you some
room to bring down sort of the higher costs that you've got on your balance sheet.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, I think also, Betsy, it may lead us to build
our securities portfolio, not material, but a bit as we continue to build our liquidity coverage ratio and strengthen our
liquidity on balance sheet.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: All right, thank you.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
<Q - Nancy Bush>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Bush>: Okay, I realize that asking the question will be an exercise in futility, but I need to ask it anyway.
[Laughter]
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Go for it.
<Q - Nancy Bush>: Okay. A dividend question.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Nancy Bush>: You had said that you would like to pay the dividend or grow the dividend, the first possible
opportunity. Jamie Dimon has said the same thing, Vikram Pandit has said don't expect anything in 2011. Do you have
any sense, Richard, of whether the regulators are going to sign off on the resumption of dividend growth wholesale for
the industry, as they did with the cuts, or are they going to look at it company-by-company and maybe allow some in
2011 and postpone the rest until later?
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. So, this is – you set it up, and
I'll confirm, this is just my opinion and based on the data I collect, I think that it will be the former. I think they're going
to allow banks individually with permission to move forward on dividend resumption and/or stock buybacks. Here's my
current, in my head the timeline looks like this. G20 heads of state meet at the end of November. They confirm what
the finance ministers have said all along. They confirm the capital levels, and they leave to the domestic local domains
to decide what kind of systemic important capital, but for – there may be other things that each country may want to
add.
Once, and when our government and our Fed and Treasury have decided what that is for our banks, I think they'll
continue to pursue this stress testing that we've all been under and that we've all been pursuing for quite some time.
Along with our capital plans and our liquidity plans and if, and when we can attach all of those acceptable actions to
their requirements and we meet the test of the capital levels, then I think banks as they find themselves satisfying those
measures will get out.
And I think – I hope that's the case because I would hate that we have to wait for the lowest common denominator, and
I also think it would be prudent for a lot of reasons for the recovery of this economy to allow banks, significant
dividend payers, to give their shareholders what they've been waiting for for a long time. So, I'm going to stick with
what I believe because it serves us well to believe that will be the case, and we're operating on the basis that each of us
will get out as we have permission, and as we have earned it and we're working hard to earn it.
<Q - Nancy Bush>: Secondly, could you just, I'm assuming you were at the dinner with Elizabeth Warren on this topic
of how she was going to structure her bureau going forward, et cetera. Do you have any greater insight into how that's
going to occur, and what we should be looking at and in terms of timing for product requirements, et cetera?
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, with the same disclaimer I gave a
second ago. And in fact, I introduced her at that dinner in my role at the roundtable and had breakfast with her the
morning of, and I'm quite comfortable that her first, most important activity as she builds the agency – as you know,
she's not running it – is to focus almost exclusively on disclosures, transparency, and simplicity. She's made that clear
to everybody that night. She's made it clear to a few of us even since then.
So first and foremost, the Consumer Protection Bureau, as it's beginning to become an agency is going to focus on
clarity and simplicity of transparent communications and disclosures. We all welcome that by the way, because we
need a safe harbor to help us create these more simplified, easier-to-understand protocols, when in fact, we have so
many issues on the legal side that if we don't put everything in a 25-page document, we'll find ourselves in harm's way.

So I'm looking forward to that as her first effort. I think as you probably know what I know, the responsibility for that
agency to be up and running isn't until mid-2011, at which point I believe they'll have the key players, and they'll have
the key mandate which will then follow some of the rulemaking that we're all going to be eager to get. But I think that's
a mid-2011, so little will come out of it beyond disclosures in the next couple quarters. That's my thought.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Hi. I just wanted to get your take on the mortgage origination business at this point.
You've got a pretty good track record when it comes to this. During the bubble years, you weren't a big player and that
helped you avoid a lot of the issues others were facing or have faced and are facing now, and that you've been gaining
share in the last couple of years, which I think has proved to be pretty profitable. So, a lot of the noise out there relates
to previous originations, but there's just, in general, I think a lot of uncertainty in terms of the processes going forward,
and what spreads will look like. And I'm just wondering what your take is on the business overall, and remind us how
you think of retail versus wholesale channels.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. I'll go first and Andy can talk
about spreads. This is Richard. We like the business as much as we did a couple of years ago when we decided to stave
off and more than double our investment in it. You know we were in the high-teens as an originator and servicer a
couple of years ago and now we're 4 or 5, 5 or 6. Sadly, it's not just because we're so amazing. It's because so many
between us have moved on or consolidated. So, it's a little of both.
What I like about it, though, is we haven't left our old fashioned approach of doing it very, very close to the customer.
We have six locations across the country where we take care of our mortgage business. They're in large centers, which
are handled by very, very capable people, and when we added to our business, we didn't add any new locations, we
didn't add any new capabilities. We just added more people under the current management to do twice as much work.
So, I'm very comfortable with our approach. It's a low-cost approach. We have our largest centers in places like
Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and Nevada, Missouri, and Owensboro, Kentucky. So, we have a great workforce and a great cost
of doing business and we're just going to continue to grow at those points.
Right now we're operating, as you know, on a significantly higher refi market than origination market. That will serve
all of us well to keep people busy for a while, but I think that when the recovery finally attaches itself in probably a
couple of years from now on the mortgage side, you'll start to see the old-fashioned originations out-take the refinances
and we'll be ready for that as well. The mix can be a little bit different based on refi versus origination, but we're
prepared for both of those.
And then, Matt, we also have a pretty good wholesale business. And we've not gotten out of all the broker businesses
because we weren't in any broker businesses we didn't like. Some of our peers are moving away from that and like
everything else we are staying with the old fashioned way, the way we did it in the first place, and wholesale does have
a pretty good volume stream that kind of mitigates some of the peaks and flows of what would otherwise happen on the
retail side, although the margins are a little bit skinnier. So, we're a very blended, very basic mortgage business, just
bigger than we were before. And frankly, we're going to keep investing in it because we think that again at the recovery
point, he whoever has the most critical mass where their customers are not being outsourced to anybody else to
accomplish those needs are going to be better off. That's the kind of growth side. Andy, do you want to talk about the
margin?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, and on the margin side. Matt, again, I'd
say our margins are probably a little higher than what would be normal in this environment, maybe 125 to 150. They
probably will moderate down a bit, maybe 100 to 125, but it will still be a very profitable and well-run business for us.

<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay and I mean, just as a follow-up here, I guess as we think about the servicing side of
the business. Does that need to be repriced, given just the general higher risks, and what seems to be the higher costs of
just the overall responsibility in that business?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I think as we tried to demonstrate with
the numbers in the additional disclosure we provided, we actually have very nominal increases in costs there because
we have run the business very well. we've been very prudent in our underwriting and our processes, and the putbacks
that we have relative to the size of our book is actually quite small and manageable. So, we're very comfortable with
the profitability, and the way we're pricing right now.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Let me frame it another way. The cost of servicing for most of your competitors has gone
up quite a bit. So, I would think they need to find a way to try and reprice that over time, so there could be some benefit
for you. Just in general it feels like the servicing business for the industry wasn't priced for what we're seeing now in
terms of the costs, and the burden.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: I don't disagree with you and I don't disagree
with the fact that that may be a benefit to us given our, the way we run the business.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm glad you concluded that because I
think it's actually a net positive if we continue to stick to our knitting. So, if we're going to – see it as a positive to a
neutral.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Wolf with UBS Securities.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: I understand you guys don't want to make any guidance forecast going into 2011, but can you at
least give us a sense for maybe the dollar value of securities that are coming due in 2011, and what kinds of
reinvestment risks you are seeing currently?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Heather, so the way I'd answer that question is
I would expect our securities book, net, to grow a few billion dollars in 2011. So, nothing significantly material. We're
on a, 50, 49, $50 billion book; it's going to grow a few billion dollars. We're putting on the majority of the, of what
we're putting on are floaters versus fixed. And as I talked about, that 5 to 10 basis points going into next quarter, that's
part of the reason for the decline. But it won't have a significant material impact on neither the balance sheet nor the net
interest margin as we see it today for 2011.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: So you don't think that the existing portfolio poses much reinvestment risk given where tenures
are today?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: It does pose some reinvestment risk, but given
the size of what's rolling off versus what we're putting on, it doesn't equate to a large number for 2011.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: , and what's rolling off is not rolling off at substantially higher yields than what you can find in
the marketplace today?

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Paul.
<Q - Paul Miller>: Thank you. Hey, how you guys doing? On increased loan demand, there's been some stories that,
and I think the Fed released a report saying that for the first time they have seen banks ease their credit standards. Can
you add some color on that? Have you eased your credit standards which has increased your loan demand out there
which helped you grow your balance sheet this quarter?
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'll let Bill answer, but absolutely no.
Go ahead, Bill. Knock yourself out.
<A - P.W. Parker>: I mean, our underwriting standards haven't changed since 10 years ago. But I think when they cite
things like that, what they're talking about is when you go into the down cycle, what used to be maybe 5 year revolvers
for investment grade credit's collapsed back to 1 year and 3 year revolvers, now they're going back out to 5 years.
That's some of the things they're talking about when they talk about that quote/unquote easing. So, for us it's not an
underwriting issue.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Paul, it's Richard. I also think that
you will see, because the regulators are so keen on watching for quality, I think the only thing you might see is pricing
issues, whereas some are going to be hungrier and take some risk on either pricing or maybe even hold levels. But the
regulators are very much on top of this. And by the way, we're all welcoming that because we'd rather that they were
giving us current feedback than late feedback. So, I think you'll find any changes or adjustments will come in pricing
much less than on underwriting.
<Q - Paul Miller>: Because you hear a lot of stories about like people that need credit can't get credit and people that
don't need credit have all the credit in the world. And I'm just wondering, as and we're starting to see people always talk
about loan growth and this is the first time we have seen it. Is things now loosening up a little bit in the world,
including with you guys, not necessarily the underwriting standards, but much more willing to lend out there?
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, so it's not either. We're not
changing lending standards. I don't think the industry is changing its willingness to lend either. I think it's a slow, but
predicted outcome that some of the customers who restructured the way they live, both consumers, small businesses
and large corporate, are now becoming more qualified because they have done all the heavy lifting of getting
themselves back in shape to now incur more debt and we're more attracted to them because they don't have those kinds
of risks. So, it's really more of that, more qualified people and those who became more qualified by their good efforts
over the last couple of years. A long recession is something we're all trying to figure out how to live within and among,
but it's helped us get more clarity around those who took early actions, and they're now getting more prepared for a
better future.
<Q - Paul Miller>: Okay, thank you very much, gentlemen.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Good morning. First on Basel III, are you running Basel II right now?, and how many more
quarters till you can get off running parallel, assuming you are on parallel?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Mike, we are running Basel I and reporting on
Basel I today. We would enter our parallel run in 2011. The numbers I have given you are Basel I with Basel III rules
applied. When you think about Basel II with Basel III rules applied, they actually would be better than the ratio which I
showed you, up 90 to 100 basis points.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: So if you run parallel in 2011 maybe if all goes right in 2012, you could get off running parallel?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: That is the typical plan for the parallel run is 4
quarters, correct.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And right, we begin January 1 of '11.
So, remember, we weren't $250 billion at the beginning of the Basel activity, so we had to opt in a few years ago when
we hit the 250. So, we are ready to roll on January 1.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. And as far as the eventual target, you said you needed to make sure that you knew what the
rules were which makes sense. But would that mean you have to wait till the U.S. decides on what the minimum ratios
are which could be another year or so?
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I guess the answer is better, whatever
the Fed decides, right. So, the Fed will, along with the Treasury will decide what the U.S. answer will be to all of the
requirements in Basel and once they decide what qualifies in terms of where the buffers would end, where the systemic
important companies would be charged, that's what I'm waiting for. And so I'm not even trying to figure out what
America is going to do. I'm just waiting for the American response to whatever the G20 says and counting on people
like the Treasury, and the Fed to be thoughtful enough to let the banks that have shown and proven themselves to be
ready to do that to get on and move on with the dividend.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay, and then separately, loan utilization I guess 26%. That's still the all time low, isn't it?
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: As long as we've recorded it, it is.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And so on the one hand, we have an all time low on loan utilization, on the other hand you're
growing loans a little bit more.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Right.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And we've been hearing this from, everyone is kind of cautiously optimistic. Would you still call
yourself still cautiously optimistic or is this the real deal, we're getting loan growth back and it's going to take off?
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm definitely cautiously optimistic
because I do think we're starting to see the first glimmer. Now, one quarter doesn't a trend make, but boy it's a lot better
than having the continued decreases. For us a flattening utilization is exceptionally exciting because if our loan
utilization – remember, we just do wholesale, so a lot of banks have higher utilization levels. They've been in credit
cards and consumer and all that. This is wholesale for us, just in absolute dollars as Andy mentioned in the call, we are

down $3 billion on wholesale commitment adjustment, just the same outstandings being used less. So, those
commitments start to kick in, that's on top of the growth that you're seeing today because as you said we're not getting
it from the utilization, we're getting it from old fashioned new customers and new growth. So, we're actually quite
optimistic that this can't get much lower, and it will be the first thing we'll see as a consistent behavior of people
starting to use our balance sheet again over themselves.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then just one last question, a more general question. So, your revenue growth target is 7% to
8%. What would you need in the environment before you could achieve that sort of revenue growth target? In other
words, I imagine 10 year rates at, wherever it is right now, 2.55% is not going to do it. What kind of normal
environment would you need before you could realistically say you might be able to get that sort of revenue growth?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: I think you said it. Mike, this is Andy. I think
you said it correctly, it would be a normal economic environment. So, a normal GDP growth may be 3% to 4% with
normal long term rates or a normal yield curve and finally, normal levels of unemployment back down to the 8s. So,
this isn't the environment that we're going to achieve that because we're not seeing the loan growth because yields are
at, the long end is very low. But when we get to that normal environment, same-store sales, spend, all those things get
back to normal economic levels, that's when we would achieve that.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Just one quick follow-up there. If you had 4% GDP growth for, over the long term, how do you get
from 4% GDP growth to 7% to 8% revenue growth?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: By a couple things, pricing and taking share.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right, thank you.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure, thanks, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Konrad>: Hey, good morning. Just a really follow-up to Matt's question on revenue warranty and more
specifically, the servicing. I mean, if the bulk of your market share came kind of relatively recent phenomenon, would
it be fair to assume that the vintages in the servicing portfolio are relatively recent rather than kind of driven by an '05,
'06 period? And I just wondered if you had any comment on exposure to private label servicing if there is any?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay, second question first. No exposure to
private label. Our vintages have actually, are pretty steady stream if you think about it. we've been growing throughout
the years as Richard mentioned. One of the reasons we have moved up in the rankings is because some people are no
longer on the list. So, I wouldn't say we have a heavily weighting one way or the other. It's fairly linear.
<Q - David Konrad>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

<Q - Matthew Burnell>: Good morning, guys. Just a couple of quick questions. On slide 29, taking a look at the home
equity delinquencies, they're up a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Is there any color you can provide on that or was that
largely expected?
<A - P.W. Parker>: Yes, I mean, believe it or not, there is seasonal patterns to the home equity, and the seasonal
increase this year was down substantially from last year, and the prior year. So, it has been trending down. So, I'm very
comfortable with the outlook there.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It's one of our best portfolios. When
this thing is all over, we'll look back and will herald fewer portfolios in the quality of our home equity portfolio. So, I'll
also give it a bit of a pass because it's at a very low level and I think the movement is pretty small. If we saw an upward
trend over a couple of quarters, I might start to worry. But I think it has passed the high water mark test and you're
going to see it steady out here for a while.
<Q - Matthew Burnell>: Okay. And then just a second question on net interest margin. What assumption are you all
embedding in your assumption for fourth quarter NIM in terms of loan growth?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Similar to what you see here in the third
quarter.
<Q - Matthew Burnell>: Okay, so basically no ramp up in loan growth?
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Correct.
<Q - Matthew Burnell>: Okay, super, thanks very much guys.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: You bet.

Your final question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisory Group.
<A - Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Meredith.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Good morning. I have a bit of an unorthodox question. When I go and speak to the much
smaller banks that would be below the radar screen for any type of acquisition, they obviously are very challenged by
the cost of regulatory burdens. And I'm wondering what opportunities you have as a banker's bank, what you can do for
the smaller community banks, and how that may provide a growth opportunity for you that doesn't – you're not seen –
you're in between, so you're seen as more of a friend than necessarily a large competitor.
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I like that question. we've got over
2,000 banks that we bank to in a number of significant ways, and what we're doing now is we're trying to go back to
them and talk to them about their cost structures and telling them that if they want to give us their credit card portfolio
and let us private label that; if they wanted to give us their corporate payments business and give them something that
they don't have; if they want to hand off to us some of our correspondent banking capabilities; we can help them reduce
their cost structure. We can take the scale we enjoy and both of us can do better by performing something like that.
Also, on servicing ATM machines, we're finding a lot of interest. And so if I was a small bank, I'd say look, if I'm
going to make it and I want to get my cost structure down, I'm going to have to go somewhere I might have not gone
before and let someone I trust do that for me on a white label basis. And therefore, I can go out and have some of this
stress in the revenue side until I can get to the other, the end of the recession. So, actually it's a quite – you're very – it's
not unorthodox, it's a great question. We feel it's a very positive. I thought you were headed to small banks being

available for sale and this is actually in our case more attractive because it's got a long and permanent approach to it.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Sure. And is that something that we'd be able to see, the growth structure, is that something
that's going to be material to earnings? Is that going to be a growth channel that's going to be meaningful to investors?
<A - Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The correspondent banking business
for us is very big and because it's already big it doesn't move a lot in terms of volume to show it. But to the extent that
that's – that's a really good idea. I think I'll introduce something in our next presentation to give you guys a sense of
where it is today and that we can use that as a measure to track, because I'm expecting that to be one of our growth
initiatives as you just cited. So, we'll have that.

And this is Richard, let me thank you for your attention to our call. We're standing ready any time you have any

would cause us to make mistakes by trying to guess too far forward. But I think you just heard a very consistent,
predictable, repeatable story and as much as it may not be that exciting, because it doesn't have a lot of unexpected
outcomes, it is one we're proud of and we're excited to tell the story. So, any time, give us a call. Thank you.
