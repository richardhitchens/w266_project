MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2012 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions]
And now, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please
proceed.
Amy Gilliland
Thank you, Grant, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter conference call.
As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. The
estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties, additional information regarding these factors is contained in the
company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson
Thank you, Amy, good morning, everyone.
General Dynamics' third quarter sales totaled $7.9 billion, up modestly from last year's third quarter on strong
Aerospace volume. Operating earnings were $905 million, while earnings per share from continuing operations were
$1.70 on a fully diluted basis. Third quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $594 million, nearly 100% of
earnings from continuing operations. This result is particularly strong given the $321 million of pension contributions

we made in the quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion is a healthy 90% of earnings from continuing
operations and I expect the fourth quarter to be another strong cash quarter.
In terms of capital deployment, we remain cautious given the unprecedented uncertainty in the coming months caused
by the threat of sequestration. For that reason, we did not repurchase any shares this quarter and may not do so until we
see more clearly what happens at the start of 2013.
We did take advantage of opportunities to deploy $261 million this summer to enhance our defense portfolio with four
bolt-on acquisitions. These new businesses, which I will detail later in my remarks, better position each of our three
defense segments for significant future opportunities. In addition to these accretive acquisitions, our multi-year
Gulfstream Campus Investment project continues. Year-to-date, we've returned approximately 70% of free cash to
shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Orders this quarter were the strongest of the year, driven by improved award activity at Aerospace and IS&T. At the
end of the quarter, backlog was $51.5 billion dollars while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog and
the value of unexercised options and IDIQ contracts, stood at $77.5 billion.
Let me briefly address what we are experiencing in today's Aerospace and Defense environment. Defense, bottom line,
up front – there has been very little change to the situation for our U.S. Defense businesses since my last update on the
second quarter call, except that as predicted, we are now in a continuing resolution through March of next year, and we
are closer to the fiscal cliff.
The same uncertainty regarding the defense budget adjustments that has challenged our industry for the past year
continued to impact our customers' behavior in the third quarter, particularly in our shorter-cycle businesses, where
bids awaiting awards are at record levels and de-scoping action are becoming more common practice. We are likely to
see more of this in the fourth quarter.
We would hope to receive some clarifying details over the next two months as this election cycle ends and the
Congress returns to address the many important fiscal issues confronting our country. In light of the significant
legislative workload in the limited lame-duck timeline, however, it remains difficult to predict whether sequestration
will be resolved before January.
With that said, discussion about the negative implications of going over the fiscal cliff at year-end has escalated in
recent weeks. We hope that a bipartisan solution can be brokered to address these serious issues before they take effect
in 2013.
With limited detail on how sequestration would be implemented, planning for next year is difficult at best. Our
government customer continues to assert that there are no ongoing planning efforts to prepare for implementing
sequestration, should it be triggered.
The indiscriminate across-the-board nature of sequestration cuts are troubling for Defense as well as other federal
agencies. Given the lack of planning to date, however, we are also extremely concerned about the profound disruption
and paralysis that implementing these cuts will likely have on our customer, and thus our entire industry.
We continue to focus on managing for earnings and cash, cutting costs and positioning our businesses to better navigate
further defense cuts.
In Aerospace, we remain encouraged by Gulfstream's sizeable large-cabin backlog and healthy order pipeline. Several
multi-aircraft orders from North American customers which we had originally expected in the second quarter
materialized in the third quarter. Relative to other periods, however, the order cycle remains somewhat protracted with
a number of factors causing deal closure times to increase. Global economic sentiment, particularly in Europe and Asia,
and political uncertainty here and abroad continue to influence the velocity of order activity. We continue to believe
that we will realize several multi-aircraft international orders in the coming months, although their exact timing, for all
the factors I just explained, is difficult to predict.

Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, beginning with IS&T. IS&T's sales were $2.5 billion
in the third quarter, off somewhat from our expectations, but relatively flat compared to this year's second quarter.
Sales through the first half of 2012, as in 2011, reflected continued pressure in our Tactical Communications business.
In the third quarter, however, Tactical Communications volume was close to our forecast as encryption demand
stabilized, albeit at lower levels. Common Hardware Systems-4 Program awards improved, and development program
contract awards including JTRS and WIN-T progressed. Volume at our IT Service business, on the other hand, was
somewhat lower than expected due to delayed award activity, scope reductions and award losses spawned by renewed
customer interest in lowest-priced technically acceptable solutions that favor price over experience and product quality.
The group's third quarter operating earnings and margins were $201 million and 8.1%, respectively. These results were
negatively impacted by a $25 million charge taken on ruggedized computing equipment inventory at our Tactical
Communications business. We are reorienting that portfolio to focus less on volatile, lower-margin commoditized
products and more on cutting-edge solutions that better align with our core customers' current and emerging priorities.
Without the charge, group margins would have been 100 basis points better at 9.1%.
This return on sales reflects an overall portfolio mix shift toward service work, an altered mix and lower level of
Tactical Communications volume and continued competitive pressures in this segment as more bidders pursue fewer
contracts.
Although delayed award activity impacted group sales through the first three quarters, IS&T enjoyed its strongest order
quarter in two years in the third quarter, causing backlog to increase by approximately $800 million to $10.1 billion,
award activity was particularly notable in our Tactical Communications and IT Service businesses.
Several of the awards received are long-awaited and exemplify the customers' continuing focus on network
modernization. These included the $346 million award to continue fielding the Warfighter Information Network,
WIN-T Increment 2 capability and a $54 million award for an additional 13,000 JTRS HMS Rifleman radios and
accessory kits. Subsequent to the quarter, we also received an award for another 3,700 JTRS HMS Manpack radios.
Awards in our IT Service business included a significant opportunity to provide supply chain management services to a
relatively new customer, the Department of State, as well as myriad other contracts to provide critical IT support
capabilities to existing customers across the Federal Government.
Additional details about contracts received in the quarter are included in today's earnings press release. IS&T's total
estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ to total backlog increased $1 billion to over $32
billion at quarter end, an improved opportunity set both year over year and sequentially.
We further enhanced our IS&T portfolio in the third quarter with two acquisitions that bolster our presence in priority
areas. Open Kernel Labs, now a part of our Tactical Communications division, brings to our portfolio solutions that
enable the secure separation of corporate data from a user's personal data stored on the same device. This technology
has wide-ranging commercial and government applications as employers increasingly look to better manage IT costs
through bring-your-own-device policies. And Fidelis Security Systems, now a part of our industry-leading Cyber
business, offers highly regarded software capable of identifying network intruders and preventing hackers from stealing
proprietary information. Fidelis' product complements our unique portfolio of cyber incident response capabilities and
better positions us for new opportunities as cyber investments grow.
Looking ahead, fourth quarter sales will be the group's largest this year as the Tactical Communications and IT
Services businesses begin to realize revenues associated with the delayed award activity added to backlog in the third
quarter. For the full year, I expect Group sales to be down around 8% to 9%, a reduction from my previous guidance.
Volume will depend in large part on how rapidly our recent orders translate to sales. Margins for the year will be
around 9%.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat Systems third quarter sales total nearly $2 billion, reflecting growing foreign military
light armored vehicle sales and ground combat vehicle volume offset by lower Stryker, Abrams, MRAP and European
vehicle work. While the decline in these vehicle programs was expected, the Group's volume in the quarter was
somewhat lighter than we anticipated due to the delay in several anticipated awards. With many of these awards now in

hand or imminent, we expect to realize this incremental volume in the fourth quarter. The Group's earnings were $274
million, resulting in a 14% operating margin. This margin continues to reflect excellent performance across Combat's
portfolio of domestic businesses.
Our European Land Systems business continues to confront profitability pressures driven by delays in international
awards, which reflect the Group's challenged indigenous markets and absorption impact from lower than anticipated
volume. ELS is aggressively going after cost and has reduced 20% of its workforce, consolidated or closed numerous
facilities around Europe and implemented a variety of continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives.
Total backlog for Combat Systems was $9.4 billion at the end of the quarter. Notable orders in the quarter included $50
million to provide additional Foxhound vehicles to the United Kingdom, $135 million to supply ammunition to Canada
and $400 million for research and development efforts to enhance the Abrams tank.
Over the next few quarters, we will continue to track several meaningful international order opportunities, including
tank upgrades from Morocco and Middle Eastern customers, EAGLE vehicles for Germany and light armored vehicles
for several international customers. Although it does not add to today's manufacturing workload, the sizeable eight-year
Abrams R&D contract received this quarter clearly demonstrates the Army customer's long-term commitment to
improving the tank's capabilities.
Per its current planning documents, the Army envisions incorporating Abrams' improvements arising from this R&D
contract in the 2017 timeframe. Consequently, it's important to preserve a healthy and reliable tank industrial base in
the interim. The Congress continued to support this notion in the 2013 budget process, with all four Committees adding
tank manufacturing funding to the President's budget request.
Looming future budget cuts have inhibited the ability of the Pentagon and, in turn, our Army customer to solidify the
size and shape of the future force. We remain confident, however, that our incumbency in the force will yield a wide
range of opportunities to provide our customer affordable, enhanced war fighting platforms. The Stryker Double-V
Hull is an excellent example of GD leveraging our experience to bring cost efficient solutions to the customer.
The life-saving benefit of the Double-V was established in Afghanistan over the course of the past 18 months.
However, prior to the customer's second quarter conversion order, we had not demonstrated our ability to transform
Flat-Bottom Strykers into the Double-V Hull configuration. I'm pleased to say that the very first Double-V Hull
exchange program vehicle is on exhibit at AUSA in Washington as we speak. Production of our initial conversion
vehicles is running on time and budget and we have decisively established the Double-V Hull exchange program's
value proposition creating more durable combat vehicles at a far lower cost. The Army is currently analyzing the
benefits of this program and working toward solidifying additional Double-V Hull requirements in conjunction with
broader force structure studies. Given the success of the program to-date, we anticipate additional conversion orders.
Similarly, our Combat Systems group remains involved in a variety of development programs for our Army and Marine
Corps customers. Our work on these development programs will help the customer identify and incorporate key
technological advancements into today's vehicles and tomorrow's fighting force. GD's focus on bringing affordable
solutions to our customer is also evident in our acquisition of Gayston Corporation's defense operations this quarter.
Gayston expands our critical manufacturing capability to more cost efficiently produced high precision parts on core
franchise programs such as the Hydra rocket and provides us with more opportunities to participate in high
performance weapons programs.
Looking ahead, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest, with each of the businesses contributing their
largest volume of the year. Margins will be somewhat lower due to mix shift as our newer international vehicle and
development programs accelerate and our mature, domestic vehicle production work slows. For the full year, the Group
remains on track to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales and mid-13% margins. Now I'll discuss Marine Systems.
The Marine Systems group delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. Sales of nearly $1.7 billion were
relatively stable when compared with the prior year period as Destroyer, Mobile Landing Platform and repair volume
grows and the T-AKE program winds down. The Group's repair related sales increased primarily due to the third
quarter 2011 acquisition of Norfolk-based Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk. Earl Industries, we

acquired in the third quarter of 2012 also enhanced the Group's repair sales.
Earl provides General Dynamics a role as prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier multi-ship, multi-option MSMO
contracts and extends the reach of our repair capabilities in the two major East Coast Navy ports, Norfolk and Mayport.
Earnings totaled $186 million, up modestly when compared with both last year and last quarter.
The Group's third quarter operating margin was 11.1%, driven primarily by continued strong performance on the
T-AKE program, which will see delivery of the 14th and final ship this week. I also want to highlight the performance
across several of our newer programs has been very good. In September, NASSCO completed the structural assembly
and weld-out of over 26,000 tons of steel to erect the entire structure the first MLP. Construction of this first-of-class
ship is progressing on schedule and under budget with delivery planned for the second quarter of 2013. At Bath Iron
Works, progress continues on Zumwalt, the first DDG-1000, which is 70% complete in manufacturing and provides a
most impressive site on BIW's waterfront. Fabrication and unit assembly on the initial DDG-51 restart ships are also
underway as we demonstrate our ability to simultaneously produce two different types of Destroyers in our Maine
shipyard.
Marine's backlog totaled nearly $16 billion at the end of the third quarter while total estimated contract value, including
backlog and unexercised options was $17.3 billion. Orders this quarter included a $94 million award for planning
activities on USS Miami, which you may recall was badly damaged by a fire earlier this year. The Navy has valued the
total repair bill for this submarine at several hundred million dollars and we anticipate additional repair work following
the planning activities.
Third quarter 2012 orders are well down from the year ago period when Marine Systems booked three Destroyers and
several substantative engineering and development contracts. But as you know, this merely reflects the very lumpy
nature of Marine's award activity where ship-building awards come periodically in large tranches and provides several
years of backlog. We expect several of these sizeable awards next year, including the Navy's DDG-51 multi-year
program and the Block IV Virginia-class submarine program. Other meaningful order activities on the horizon, include
the Ohio-replacement class design contract and a fourth MLP ship planned for procurement in 2014.
Marine Systems fourth quarter volume will be lower than the previous three as the T-AKE program concludes while
margins will approximate year-to-date profitability. For the full year, the Group remains on track to achieve 2012 sales
slightly below last year with margins in the mid-11% range. Next I'll move to Aerospace.
The Aerospace group enjoyed a very successful third quarter, marked by improved order activity and the achievement
of FAA-type certification on our G280 and G650 aircraft. Group sales were $1.8 billion, up 30% from the year ago
period due to higher green G650 deliveries while earnings were $261 million.
Margins were 15.2%, down year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to lower Gulfstream R&D supplier
payments. As a reminder, these payments vary from quarter to quarter and, therefore, can distort profitability
comparisons. Profitability was modestly lower at Jet Aviation this quarter as the business works aggressively to
confront overhead absorption issues exacerbated by the European debt crisis which is impacting aircraft utilization and
service work across the continent. With that said, Jet Aviation continues to take positive steps forward. In the
Completions business, the Jet team recently delivered the fourth narrowbody/widebody aircraft of the year and added
another narrowbody to the order book. Jet's service operations are seeing mixed demand with pockets of strength in
some regions and continued weakness in Europe. The leadership team at Jet is working aggressively to address this
dynamic situation by optimizing their maintenance and repair footprint to better address the requirements of the
installed base moving forward, with a particular focus on right-sizing facilities situated in slower markets and investing
in our facilities and customer outreach in growth markets.
Gulfstream reported its best order quarter of the year, driven by several multi-aircraft deals placed by North American
companies. Year-to-date, North American customers represent nearly 60% of Gulfstream's order book. This metric
represents the resurgence of North American demand and some softening in the international demand driven by
political uncertainty in some regions and the overall negative impact of the European debt crisis on global economic
sentiment. Even so, Gulfstream's international customer interest remains very healthy and we continue to expect to

solidify several multi-aircraft international deals in the coming months as I previously mentioned. Customer defaults in
the quarter were at their lowest since the economic downturn began in 2008.
On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated Gulfstream book-to-bill was a little over 0.8 times, reflecting improved
overall award activity offset by continued G650 deliveries. The Group's backlog at quarter end stood just over $16
billion, including approximately five years of G650 backlog and around 18 months of G450 and 550 deliveries. As I've
reiterated previously, because new orders for the 650 currently have this five-year entry-into-service date, we don't
expect new orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. That said, our sales force booked healthy orders for the
G650 and each of our other aircraft models in the third quarter.
In terms of pre-owned, Gulfstream took two aircraft in trade this quarter, delivered one aircraft at breakeven and
brokered another one for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, we had three pre-owned aircraft in inventory.
Gulfstream's installed fleet flying hours were at pre-economic downturn levels again in the third quarter, a reality that
helped our service facilities enjoy another record volume quarter. In part, this continued success reflects Gulfstream's
number one ranking in worldwide product support. In the quarter, Gulfstream product support was voted number one
for the tenth consecutive year in the annual Aviation International News Product Support Survey.
Similarly, Gulfstream received the top service ranking in the yearly Professional Pilot Survey. To meet growing
customer demand, Gulfstream continues to invest in its product support network including plans to open new
company-owned service centers in Brazil and China. Our enhanced global service network is particularly timely as we
deliver new G650 and 280s. Both aircraft are enjoying robust customer interest following type certification and we are
proud to showcase them at the NBAA Convention in Orlando next week. The fact that together these aircraft have
already amassed six city-pair records including one Transatlantic record each is a testament not only to the capabilities
of these aircraft, but also to the entire Gulfstream team.
Entry-into-service when we deliver these aircraft to our first customers is just weeks away. All necessary preparations
to support EIS are proceeding apace, including retrofit work and pilot training.
Looking to the fourth quarter, the Aerospace group expects its strongest sales quarter of the year, including
entry-into-service deliveries for the 650 and 280. The composition of our planned 2012 deliveries has changed
modestly. For initial stage deliveries, green deliveries, we now expect to deliver 24 G650s, that's really unchanged, 80
450s and 550s, that's up modestly and 15 to 20 mid-cabin aircraft, that too is up modestly. Planned completion
deliveries for 450s and 550s and mid-cabins remain unchanged while G650 completions will be somewhat lower than
the 17 originally planned solely as function of the later than anticipated type certification.
For the full year, I expect Aerospace group sales to grow approximately 16% to 17%, up somewhat from my prior
guidance and operating margins to be in the mid-15% range. In summary, General Dynamics made progress on several
important fronts in the third quarter, including Gulfstream type certifications and JTRS and WIN-T orders. These
franchise programs are now set to realize their full market potential. Given our year-to-date performance, I expect
earnings per share from continuing operations to be $7.00 to $7.05. However sequestration is resolved, all of us at
General Dynamics will continue to aggressively manage our businesses for profitability with primary emphasis on
nailing execution in order to maximize earnings and cash. We remain focused on affecting what we can control to
include leveraging our incumbency and experience to provide our customers with affordable, dependable and proven
solutions. With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh.
L. Hugh Redd
Thank you, Jay, and good morning.
I would like to cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period. First, net interest
expense was $39 million for the quarter. Based on current net debt position of $900 million, we expect net interest
expense of approximately $155 million for the full year.

Next, the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 31.2% for the first nine months compared with 30.6% for the
same period of 2011. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of slightly less than 32%, rising slightly over 2011's rate
of 31.4% due to the less income from international locations where tax rates were lower and expiration of the R&D tax
credit here in the U.S. Finally, during the quarter, we contributed approximately $321 million to our pension plans. To
date this year, we've contributed approximately $430 million to our plans with full year funding expectation of $500
million. Amy, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it to you for the Q&A.

Thanks, Hugh.
I'd like to highlight that a summary of the guidance provided this morning will be posted on our website alongside the
webcast link. Also as quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to
participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue, and, Grant, could you just please remind
participants how to enter the queue?

Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Jay, I would like to follow up on your question that you felt that the uncertainty about the outlook
held you back from buying back shares this quarter, yet you still felt confident enough to make a series of acquisitions,
and I could wonder about how you could contrast those two decisions?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, I think I've been fairly consistent in saying that one of the things we're trying to do right
now is shepherd our cash and I'm trying to provide my successor with as much cash as I can. So, why the acquisitions?
I said before and I'll repeat it here that we always are looking for acquisitions that make sense for our businesses and
when you take a longer view of what these acquisitions can provide, it takes you through the trough we're dealing with
here into another space where we believe these things, as I said in my remarks, will give us significant opportunities.
They were priced right when they come to market, you've got to take them if you want to build that business and that's
exactly what we did in all four cases. So, it's setting them up for longer term opportunities and we felt that was
appropriate.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: But isn't there a possibility these assets might have been cheaper if you would have waited a few
more months, six months perhaps for sequester kicks in?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, maybe, maybe not. They may not have been there. So, they made sense for us at the time
and we took them with no apologies.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Okay, thank you.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning and, Jay, I just want to wish you all the best as you, I'm sure, do
something that's not just sitting around, but not doing what you're doing today. So, all the best from all of us.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Thank you.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: I had had a quick question and just a clarification on something you said earlier. I think you
recall the big contract that Vangent has with CMS is in recompete. I wonder if you might update us on where that
stands and what the expectations are for award and what sort of impact that may have?
And then a clarification of your comments on Abrams, sort of short term, long-term and as you think about the Lima
facility. Is it correct to assume that since you had Committee support and we're operating under a CR, this is a sort of
wait-and-see what happens with the election and the budget outlook, before we know ultimately what will happen with
that program? Thank you.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Okay. The latter first. As I said, we're fairly confident – well, let me back up.
The ECP1, as it is called, which I alluded to in my remarks – the long-term Abrams R&D contract – was very
important to lock down, if you will, the long view on the Abrams. So we'll be working that on the engineering and
development side as we approach the 2017 timeframe.
But in the interim, as I said, it's really important to keep that facility in the industrial base intact, if you will. The 2012
budget supports Abrams through 2013, and what we believe will come out of the 2013 budget will push that out at least
another year.
That's kind of – so, are we taking it a year at a time, in this instance? Absolutely. But we're all sight-lining to the 2017
longer view. So we're confident with the support we have, and so that will work itself out here in the coming months,
okay?
In addition to that – and recall, I believe we talked about this before – but we have international work that also will
reside at that facility, with the Moroccan tanks, which we expect the order by the end of the year or shortly thereafter,
and we've got the Israel Namer, Merkava hulls. We've got the Egyptian kits. So we've got a number of international
programs that work through that facility, as well.
So our view is that we're getting the requisite support we need, and we'll do everything we can to keep that facility very
functional for – as we've discussed many times, it's actually more about the supply chain than it is about General
Dynamics with the 560-some suppliers that are tied to the Lima facility that we cannot afford to lose.
So that I think perhaps answers the tank.
The Vangent Beneficiary Call Center, I believe I'm correct here – and Amy nods her head – that this will take place
now next year. So we continue to work, we continue to execute, but the contract recompete will be at some point in
2013. Which is a change. They pushed it out. But we continue to work since we're the incumbent.

<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I was interested, on Gulfstream, when you talk about the G650 and the fact that your
backlog extends five years out, could you just refresh us on the rate plans for that? Because what I'm trying to
understand is, when you look at that five-year backlog, what would lead you to raise rate? Is that limited by demand,
limited by operational considerations? How do you look at that?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I mean I guess my serious answer would be kind of all of the above.
But we have – as I mentioned, we continue to take orders for the 650. We're working through the production side now
to get entry-into-service in the coming weeks. So we're hitting our battle rhythm or our flow, if you will.
And as I've said many times, the production – the delivery schedule, if you will, of record – has 24 green deliveries this
year and adding nominally 10 deliveries to 15 deliveries a year for the next few years, with completion deliveries at 17,
33 and 33.
Now I just mentioned the 17 deliveries will change a little bit because of the lateness of the type certification. But
nonetheless, the point is that's the program of record, if you will. To change that – to wick it up based on the demand,
based on the five-year backlog – is certainly something we are desirous of doing, but we're not going to turn the
rheostat up until we've hit, as I call it, our battle rhythm. And we're just not there yet.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: It looks like certainly internally, you would have the capability to do that. And I just was
trying to understand if you saw – sort of what timeframe you might see supply chain limitations? Or when could the
flexibility occur to take that rate up?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I mean, my view of that is probably – if you look at what we've gotten now and the work that is
taking place to complete the airplanes that have been green-delivered – and to get the flow going, okay? – because of
the late type certification – my sense of that is it will take probably another year or so to work that flow out smoothly,
and then, again, hit what I would call a steady production rate that then is capable of being accelerated.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning. Jay, best of luck to you.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Thank you.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: If I look at Combat and the backlog, if I just look at what has been historically a backlog to
sales ratio there, it's run well above one. If you look at the backlog today and the sales, say it's right around 1, which
would seem to imply – obviously you talked about orders that could come through the rest of the year, but would seem
to imply what could be a significant drop-off still to come over the next 12 to 18 months. Could you just address that,
Jay, and what we might be looking at in Combat here over the near term?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, I mean, look, I'm not going to try to project the 2013 plan for Combat because that is
what is being worked right now, as is our methodology every year.
But the comment I'd make ties back to what we were talking about earlier with Abrams. We know domestically – and I
mentioned this in my remarks – what's the size and shape of the force ultimately going to be, as things get recocked
here, as a function of the Afghanistan return and the reshape, based on sequestration or no. And all of these things get
sorted out. So how that force shapes itself will have impact on Combat, quite obviously.
So domestically, it comes down to Stryker, which we've talked about. Abrams, which we've talked about. It comes
down to Ground Combat Vehicle. It comes down to AMPV replacement, things like that – that we're an integral part of
either competing for, or already doing all of those things. How that shapes itself is yet to be determined.

We're confident in the longer view, as I said earlier, on Abrams. Stryker, we've got work to do. But we're very
encouraged by the exchange program of the Double-V's, as I mentioned in my remarks, and we're fairly confident that
they're going to continue converting – we will continue converting Flat-Bottoms to Double-V's.
But the long-term opportunity on the domestic side will become more granular, I would say, frankly, within the next six
to eight months, as we determine what's going to happen at the end of the year or the start of 2013.
The international space, though, is really significant business for us. And as you've heard me say before, the projections
there increase that as a part of Combat's portfolio going forward. Both tanks, light armored vehicles – and those are the
two primary movers, no pun intended – but we've got between the Middle East, Morocco, Israel, the Canadian LAV
program – there is significant opportunities there for us going forward.
So Combat is going to have, as I mentioned before – we're integral to the force. We'll stay integral to the Force. Exactly
how that shapes itself will be determined, I think, in the coming months and year.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: On 650, do you expect to have any completed deliveries this year? And can you give us a
little bit more color on exactly what's going on there?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, sure, yeah, I mean I – it won't be 17 deliveries, it will be slightly less than that. But yes,
we will have 650s delivered here within the next few weeks. I think the first two pilot classes – or first one, for sure. is
done. So then you have to go – there is more to do with the FAA. You've got to get the Certificate of Airworthiness for
each of the aircrafts.
So we're marching along smartly, but yes, indeed, we'll be delivering aircraft here within weeks./ Anxious to do it.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go
ahead.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Good morning, Jay.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Morning, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: I was wondering if you could give clarity on what R&D – how much lower R&D or higher
R&D was this year versus last year and also sequentially, just so I can get a feel for how much that hurt the operating
margin?
And also, was the Completions business worse than the second quarter, in terms of its loss? And how did it compare
year-over-year? Because I know it lost money last year, as well.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, I think – my answer to the latter is I think it was about the same. Pretty nominally close,
at least. That's off the top of my head, George.
Your R&D question – it's interesting. If I look at the stream of R&D at Gulfstream across the year, it sounds like the
way I describe the backlog at the Marine group. It's very lumpy. And that's exactly what this is.
And, oh, by the way, it just happens that the year-ago quarter and the sequential quarter were the lumpiest. So what can
I do? That's just the way it hit. And almost by a factor of like 3.5 or 4 to 1. So it just – that really is it.
I mean the margin impact derives – there is a little bit, as I think I said in my remarks, that you could attribute to Jet
absorption costs, but – and some for liquidated damages or – but that's in the noise, quite honestly. It really is the R&D,
and purely a function of the comparators.

<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay, wondering if I can get one last one in here. If you took out the 650, was the
book-to-bill for the other planes – 550, 450 – at one or above one? Because you had mentioned the backlog was 18
months, and I think in previous times, you said 18 to 24 months. So was looking for some clarity on that.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, I mean, I'll put it this way. And you know I always – I look at it in backlog months, as
you just described. And we really are kind of closer to the 18-month side of it right now. But I'm not that concerned. I
mean I'm not concerned at all about that.
But it's interesting. We expect, as I mentioned in my remarks – back to my favorite word today, lumpy – but we expect
some multi-aircraft orders that were there last year, about this time, that haven't manifested themselves this year at this
time, which will help put that backlog out even further.
But I'm very comfortable kind of at the 18-month point right now – and we're selling the mix of aircraft – I mentioned
this was a great order quarter for us. The mix of aircraft covered the spectrum of all of them really. But almost equally
weighted in the 450, 550, 650, 280, and a little lighter on the 150. So that is a good story, as far as I'm concerned.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Okay, George. Thanks.

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning, Ron.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that it's taking longer for deals to close, and the
global environment is a little bit different. Can you give some color around that, right? Because I guess, globally,
corporate profits are pretty good, right? It seems like North America is getting a little bit better. If you can just give
some more detail maybe just around the broad business Jet environment?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, I mean, North America has been very – is very strong this year. And we're at about – is
that me? Okay. We're at about 59%, I believe I said, of the backlog for this year-to-date is North American. So the
pent-up demand in North America is being serviced.
Within that, I should add consistent with earlier comments I've made that the Fortune 500 as part of that is back, which
is I think very good for everyone. We are seeing internationally if you look at the whole backlog, backlog writ large,
it's still about 60% international, okay. I was talking about 2012's inject into that. 60% international, but it's fair to say
that we're seeing not surprisingly, less activity in Europe and less activity in Asia-Pacific, believing that to be frankly I
think tied to things like the government transition in China and just some slowness in bringing orders to the fore.
We anticipate, as I said in my remarks, getting several multi-aircraft orders out of the international space in the coming
months. So, the dialogue and the interest level is still there, it's the translation into orders that is not occurring. As I
think maybe we mentioned the last call, there is also in the financing world, there seems to be more of a requirement if
you're going to finance your aircraft that you have to get the financing locked in before you order the aircraft, which
wasn't the case in earlier times. So that's kind of the – those are the big points.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay. And then can I ask just a follow-on on Defense if that's okay?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Sure.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: When you look at the current budget environment and all the uncertainty, I mean, maybe I'll
put you on the spot, right, what do you think the odds of sequestration actually playing through are and how do you

think about that when you plan for the company?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I wouldn't even place that bet with your money, Ron.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I mean, there is no one on earth who can answer that question with any precision right now. As
I mentioned in my remarks, there is a lot of activity and chatter and hand-wringing and concern and angst and you pick
the word, but until we sit down as a government and decide we're going to solve this before the 2nd of January 2013,
it's the law of the land and it will execute. So, planning for that is very difficult as I mentioned. So, our team, I'm sure is
working with Phebe, to develop the plan for 2013 based on all the information we have at our disposal and you then
have to be prepared, I think, to be able to stay agile enough to recock if you have to.
And what that means right now nobody really knows. So, you have heard me talk and I think I said it in my remarks
this morning, it's still about, for us, you prepare for that strange outcome that nobody can define just a few months
ahead by staying agile, staying lean, cutting costs and not losing your discipline in terms of your ability to execute. And
then you are as prepared as anybody can be and that's what we are.

Thank you for your question there. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey, Jay, best of luck to you, as well.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning, Jason. Thank you.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: From the guys here at Citi. One question on just a clarification and then one on the IS&T
business. On the clarification point, the guidance, I just want to make sure, includes the charge that you took in IS&T
this quarter?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Affirmative.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: I'm sorry?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: That's affirmative.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. Great. And then on IS&T, lots of commentary here, the charge being related to a
specific program. You also made some commentary about maybe some changing strategy or approach to the IS&T
business. Can you just give us a sense of whether this changing strategy is going to have an impact on revenues, as well
as margins, because it sounds like from a margin perspective, it's going to have a positive impact. But the revenue
outlook on this kind of change in tact wasn't quite as clear.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, the – that – the write-down didn't have to do with a specific program, if that's what you're
alluding to. It was – we're moving out of that commoditized, ruggedized computer business and putting our efforts
where it makes more sense for our customers right now. That was a business that was driven by price with lots of big
competitors and, frankly, it's not a space we need to stay in. That's what that was all about. The top line impact of all of
that's, I think, been reflected in our results over the last year or so, so I don't see any strategic shift other than what I've
just described there.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. So, what was the revenue run rate of that business that you're now exiting?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: We don't even – I don't even break it down that way.

Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Jay, on the Aerospace margins, I hear you on the lumpiness of the R&D. It strikes me that
that's probably lumpiness of the offsetting supplier contributions rather than your engineering spend.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: That's affirmative, that is correct, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: If so, the question is since that's probably fairly predictable, it's contractual and you have your
R&D plan set, looking forward, can you give some color on the profile? Is it going to look more like Q2 or more like
Q3? Have we ended some chain of payments or any kind of color you can provide on that?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I'm smiling because I wish it were so in terms of the predictability of the supplier launch
assistance as we call it but it really isn't that predictable. So, I don't have a stream I can give you except to say that our
R&D investment, as you well know, is constant and committed and they feed into that at varying intervals and we just
saw two big lumps, comparators this time. But I don't have a stream out ahead of me that I can describe for you today.
There will be more, obviously, as we go and we're always in product development. So, targeting 2% to 3% of
Gulfstream sales and – as our benchmark.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: And that's for net R&D?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Affirmative.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay, and then just on the 550, 450 rate, you're at the lower end of your – but confident, like
you say, in orders coming. If those orders don't come, would there be any consideration to lowering that rate of 80
aircraft or are you just lock set no problem at all for 2013 right now?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Oh, no, well, first of all, we're not giving 2013 guidance, but in general terms to your point,
we're not going to keep producing airplanes if we don't have the demand for them. We believe the demand will be there
and so we rate to that. But we don't keep the rate going if the demand isn't there. So I – but I'm very confident in both
the 450 and the 550. I'd say 2013 looks pretty good. I'm just not prepared and it's not fair frankly to Phebe, for me to
say, well, here is what I think it's going to be in numbers, we're just not there yet. But I anticipate, when I listen to the
earnings call, next time, I anticipate hearing that the Gulfstream projection is a good one.

<Q - Heidi Wood>: Oh, good. Batting cleanup here, so, Jay, I'm going to add my sentiment for good luck to you, as
well.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Thank you, Heidi.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: A question I have is on IS&T, I was wondering if you could give us a flush out a bit, kind of the
color that you're seeing on contract terms and margin outlook? And how should we think about the trends that you see
emerging ahead, sort of division by division if you don't mind putting a finer point on it? Just again, I know you don't
want to provide guidance, but just so we can kind of think about it looking ahead.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, let me -
<Q - Heidi Wood>: The most competitively vulnerable division that you have.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, let's take a whack at it this way, Heidi. We've got – the most impact we're seeing right
now is in the short cycle businesses, a.k.a., IS&T. That's a blinding flash of the obvious. But in point of fact within that,
you recall earlier discussions we talk about the mix within IS&T and the service mix has increased from my memory
thinks maybe it was in the 20%, 20%s back some couple – three years ago is now almost half of IS&T's business. So,
there is a margin reality that is attached to that. Oh, by the way, our IS&T folks in that space have done a tremendous
job of executing at good profitability, but that's a reality that's there, okay. There is more service work.
The Tactical Communications business, which is significant for us, most out of our C4 Systems business, I alluded to it
I think once or twice in my remarks, but what we're seeing there now all of a – not all of a sudden, we're finally getting
the volume coming back to us, but the mix within that volume is less on the higher margin encryption type products
and more on more moderate margin things, but we do have the franchise programs in there of WIN-T and JTRS which
have taken perhaps longer than originally anticipated. But in both cases, those franchise programs are building now and
within the next year, we'll build even further. So, we're very encouraged for that and that will be significant business
going forward for C4 Systems, but for IS&T and General Dynamics.
So, we've had – we've seen award delays. I've talked about that. We've seen descoping. We've seen a lot of the lower –
lowest priced technically acceptable, which is in Jay Johnson's opinion not very helpful to anybody in the long-term,
but – and then we've seen increased competition. So, those are all factors that are upon the IS&T world. The long-term
view for IS&T for us is a very healthy one. They are just as short-cycle business, the most impacted by kind of where
we are in the world right now dealing with what's right ahead of us in the next six months.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: All right. Great. Jay, thanks very much.
