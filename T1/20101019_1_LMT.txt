continued exceptional cash flow generation. Our focus on operating cash has been the centerpiece of our strategy that
enables sustained investments in the business and sustained returns to shareholders through share repurchases and
increases in our dividend. And I think this strategy is working well, as evidenced by our ability to increase the quarterly
dividend by 19% this quarter, extending our double-digit dividend increases for three consecutive years.
Let me start with an update on matters relating to the external environment, which we're operating in and address some
emerging trends. When we last spoke in July, I highlighted what we termed the new reality that we're facing: greater
security needs emerging with fewer resources available to meet them. To address this environment, the Defense
Department has continued to clarify its objective of implementing major changes in the way equipment and services are
procured from contractors, with a goal to save more than $100 billion over the next five years from overhead and other
accounts, without negatively affecting war fighters. Once realized, these savings would be invested in new equipment
and applied to preserve troop strength, even as military budgets flatten in the future.
On September 14th, Under Secretary for Defense Acquisition, Dr. Ash Carter, provided additional detail into 23 areas
of improvement to make the Department's procurement offices and defense contractors more efficient. These actions
were broadly characterized into 5 major areas: targeting affordability and controlling cost growth; incentivizing
productivity and innovation in industry; promoting real competition; improving trade craft in services acquisition; and
reducing non-productive processes and bureaucracy. Within each of these categories, there are more specific areas of
focus, like advancing the use of should-cost modeling, eliminating redundant government reporting and review
requirements, shortening acquisition cycle times and increasing the use of fixed priced incentive type contracts.
Since implementation of these initiatives by the Department was planned to be phased in over time, we've not yet seen
their total effect on our business. And we've been advised that some areas will require additional study and be subject
to more detailed future guidance. We have, however, agreed to the use of a fixed priced incentive type contract on our
F-35 Program in the Lot 4, Low-Rate Initial Production Lot, which I'll cover later in greater detail. And we certainly
welcome the focus on shortening cycle times, as we're seeing the opposite effect. Components of the acquisition
process have been consuming more time. Some negotiations have taken longer. Some awards have been delayed, all
having the effect of putting pressure on future growth prospects. So we're looking forward to working with the
Department and seeing some tangible results from these streamlining initiatives and we'll keep you posted as they
unfold.
Relative to our strategic focus, cost reduction and efficiency initiatives, we're making good progress. We've entered
into an agreement to divest our Enterprise Integration Group to Veritas Capital for $815 million in cash. While this
transaction is subject to government anti-trust review, we expect to close before year-end.
Our Pacific Architects and Engineers Unit continues to see solid interest from potential buyers and we're on a timeline
that supports closure either late in the fourth quarter of this year or early in the first quarter of next year. These actions,
plus the rebalancing of our Global Logistics and Training business will provide a more crisp focus for our operations.
We also previously announced implementation of a voluntary executive separation program designed to rightsize the
company, reduce layers of management, enhance supportability, tighten reporting relationships and allow for more
direct lines of communication both inside the company and with our customers. This program has been a solid success,
with approximately 600 employees participating. We will backfill some of these positions but not all of them. And
we've already begun the process of organizational transition and knowledge transfer as we move to a more efficient
model.
I want to thank those executives who are participating for their valuable contributions and many years of service to our
company and to our customers. Their work has been professional and it's been highly valued.
Our focus on reducing overhead costs, travel expenses and capital expenditures continues with a renewed emphasis on
working with our supply chain. With approximately two-thirds of the cost of our products procured from vendors, we
must continue to drive down costs and improve quality, delivery and reliability. These actions are essential to enable us
to deliver the best value to customers and financial performance for shareholders.

Turning to operational performance, we had a solid quarter, with key accomplishments across all business areas. In
Aeronautics, I'll highlight three programs where special attention's warranted. On the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we
continue to see progress across many areas of the program but challenges remaining in others. In the flight test
program, the overall tempo of flights continues to ramp up as evidenced by completion of 133 flights this quarter or
almost as many flights in the quarter as the 136 that were completed during the first 6 months this year. This
acceleration in the flight test program was planned and expected.
Flight test performance continues ahead of plan on both the conventional takeoff and landing and the carrier variance,
while the short takeoff and vertical landing flight completions remain behind schedule. Overall, we're 26 flights ahead
of plan through September and are tracking towards achievement of the planned 394 flights for the year.
Looking at some detail, the CTOL variant is 61 flights ahead of plan and the carrier variant is 5 flights ahead of plan
while the STOVL variant is 40 flights behind plan. STOVL aircraft component reliability continues to be the principal
focus area. We're pursuing a multi-faceted approach to improve tempo that is working to obtain higher levels of spare
components and parts from vendors to keep the aircraft in a flight-ready condition, while completing the analysis and
corrective action planning to address the root cause conditions.
On the software front, we're about 85% complete with the development of over 15 million lines of code but much work
remains. The software flying now has shown good stability and good functionality but more resources will be needed to
complete software build and test. We're adding an additional software integration line and additional staff to increase
capacity and improve productivity.
I thought it might be interesting to give you an example of a day in the life of complex systems development. During
routine ground testing of the F-35 fuel management sub system, a software anomaly was detected. While we never
experienced this problem in flight, testing indicated the potential that a fuel boost pump could shut down. Upon
detection, flight operations were immediately suspended as a prudent precaution, a corrective modification to the
software was immediately undertaken by the fuel system supplier, and flight testing was resumed, limiting the impact
to the flight schedule to about a week. To the uninitiated, this may not seem like all that much but from my point of
view, it's a model of professionalism in the government-industry partnership where testing was undertaken with rigor,
roles and responsibilities were clear, high standards were maintained, and safety was paramount. The process was
transparent and effective and resulted in a better airplane without taking on any unnecessary risk.
Production activities continue to ramp up at Fort Worth with low-rate initial production work yielding good progress on
factory cost performance, but with some schedule pressure. Solid cost performance and learning curve data enabled us
to reach agreement on price with the government this quarter on the Low-Rate Initial Production Lot 4 contract for 32
aircraft under a fixed priced incentive-type contract structure. With a 50/50 share line and a 120% ceiling, this contract
will be challenging and will require focused attention on execution. We're working through the normal process to
definitize the contract and once finalized, the Lot 4 contract will bring the total backlog of production aircraft to 63.
International support for the program continues to evolve. We were pleased with Canada's announcement to acquire the
F-35 as their next generation fighter aircraft, as well as the Israeli government signing a letter of Offer and Acceptance
for procurement of the F-35 for their future fighter fleet. The United Kingdom is completing a far-reaching strategic
review, the results of which will be known shortly. In fact, I believe Prime Minister David Cameron is presenting the
details of the plan now. Our sense is that the plan will result in the reduction in the number of Joint Strike Fighters to be
purchased from below the original planning number, which is 138 aircraft.
We also believe they are likely to go to the carrier version of the airplane as compared to the original planning, which
was the short takeoff and vertical landing variant as they proceed with two aircraft carriers, one configured with a
catapult that supports the carrier variant operations. As I said, the Prime Minister is, I believe, releasing some additional
details of the plan now, even as we speak.
We further sense that both partner and non-partner countries will continue their planning for the F-35. Some have made
reduced quantities or delay the onset of production, and others, they increase and accelerate thereby and we'll do all that
we can to be flexible and supportive as our customers evolve their concepts of operations and their recapitalization

needs.
In the system design and development program, the government's technical baseline review, or TBR, continues and is
scheduled to be complete next month. While the results of this comprehensive assessment are not yet available, let me
give you my overall sense of the progress. I believe the many independent government assessments of the inherent
capabilities of the F-35 system confirm its fundamental value, not just in low observability but in the power of its
mission systems.
Work done today on the air vehicle supports expectations of low signature and sound structural integrity and durability.
The propulsion system is performing well and the on-board systems are phenomenal. And pilots immediately recognize
their strength. The combination of an advanced radar and sensor system along with an integrated communication suite
not only distinguish the F-35 but enhance and enable many other military assets that the F-35 will work with, thereby
improving their value as well. This capability is needed and valued and continued investment in the program is
warranted.
The TBR then is specifically focusing on both areas of accomplishment and areas of need. With the negotiation of Lot
4, it appears the costs of the production program are likely to be favorable to prior estimates, while the development
program will need more resources in software development and flight tests. The TBR process is dedicated to
developing a solid set of realistic and executable planning assumptions so that the program can be re-baselined as
directed in the Nunn-McCurdy process and that additional resources can be applied. We recognize that long-term
confidence in the program must be earned over time by executing and meeting commitments, and the baseline resulting
from the TBR process is an essential foundational requirement.
Moving to the C-130J, we continue to ramp up production levels as customers expand their fleets. The government of
Oman recently executed a new contract for two air lifters, and on the production line, we delivered seven aircraft and
remain on track to a planned delivery of 26 aircraft this year. Robust domestic and international demand remains
consistent with our planning assumptions.
The C-5 Galaxy achieved an important milestone in the modernization program with delivery of the first production
C-5M aircraft to the Air Force Mobility Command. With current plans calling for the modernization of 52 C-5 air
lifters by 2016, delivery rates on these modernized aircraft will be ramping up to meet customer requirements. This
ramp-up was supported by the government's approval to proceed to full-rate production. I'm very proud of our team's
contribution in fielding the modernized C-5M as it provides significantly enhanced capabilities and improved mission
readiness to the United States Air Force. With the C-5M providing twice the capability and costing less than half of
other U.S. strategic air lifters, the value to the user community and the taxpayer is compelling and the program aligns
well with DoD initiatives on cost savings, efficiency and affordability improvements.
While accomplishments in aeronautics are many, I was disappointed by the de-certification of our EBMS system.
We're committed to the highest standards in process and performance measurement systems, and at Forth Worth, we've
not maintained these standards. We will correct the deficiencies that have been identified. We know what to do. We
know how to do it, and we're working closely with government subject matter experts on corrective actions. Among
other factors, implementation of accurate earned value management system measurement criteria requires stable
fully-defined baselines for each program as well as some performance measurement history against which validations
can occur. This takes time.
For the F-35, we will need performance history against the baseline that will be produced by the TBR, a process that
will likely take 18 months or so, but when we're complete, we'll have a best-in-class system.
Turning to electronic systems, the team is doing a good job across the portfolio. Two areas merit special recognition
this quarter: the Littoral Combat Ship and Missile Defense activities. On the Littoral Combat Ship program, our second
vessel, the Fort Worth, remains on cost and on schedule with more than 60% of the construction completed. Lessons
learned from construction of our initial ship have resulted in improved efficiency and a 30% reduction in labor hours on
our second ship. We look forward to the Navy's decision expected later this quarter to select a single design, and the
initial award of the 10-ship order. Current Navy procurement plans continue to support a 55-ship fleet.

In Ballistic Missile Defense, key progress was achieved with successful completion of the critical design review on the
Medium Extended Air Defense System. This next-generation mobile air and missile defense system will replace
currently fielded defense capabilities. MEADS provides full 360 degree coverage and can defend up to 8 times more
area than current systems. Cost efficiencies are also achievable in the MEADS design due to fewer system elements
and lower life cycle costs.
Moving to Information Systems and Global Solutions, our team working on the Airborne and Maritime Fixed Station
Joint Tactical Radio System, the program known as AMF JTRS, successfully transferred data and live streaming video
over an Internet protocol wide band network between multiple air and ground nodes. I know that's a mouthful, but what
that means is that this exercise demonstrated the technical maturity of key AM/FM JTRS hardware elements in a rotary
wing environment and brings secure, real time, inter-operable communications to the war fighters one step closer to
reality.
In the area of new contract awards, I was very pleased to see our IS&GS team extend their multi-decade relationship in
providing information technology support and solutions to the Social Security Administration. Under the $2.8 billion
seven-year IDIQ contract, IS&GS will compete for task orders to provide a broad range of IT support. We've watched
the ongoing transformation at the Administration as they work to support the heath and economic well-being of
millions of Americans, and we're proud to play a role.
Finally, let me cover two important satellite programs and space systems. The team successfully launched the first
Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite. This is a technologically advanced military communication system that
provides highly secure, survivable global communications for war fighters operating on ground, sea and air platforms.
Advanced EHF remains a top priority in DoD and there's a potential for future additional satellite awards above the
three satellites currently under contract. After launch, the first satellite experienced a failure of one of its orbit
ride-raising engines. We're now working on an alternative method of moving into final orbit while still preserving the
full planned orbital life of the satellite.
We also completed the critical design review on the Global Positioning System III contract. Completion of this
milestone validates the design to ensure it meets war fighter and civil requirements, and allows the program to begin
the production phase. GPS III improves navigation, position and timing services with signals three times more accurate
and powerful than current GPS systems. Space Systems is currently working under a $3 billion contract to build up to
12 satellites for the United States Air Force.
Finally, I've described for you many times my admiration for our workforce and the quality of our leadership team. I
was very pleased to see Linda Gooden, Marillyn Hewson and Joanne Maguire recently named among the 50 most
powerful women in business by Fortune magazine and our General Counsel, Maryanne Lavan recognized by the
Washington Post. They are exceptional leaders whose talent and contributions are widely recognized inside and outside
of our company and we are very, very proud of them.
In the near term, we recognize we're working in a more challenging environment as our customers face more volatility
that will likely pressure our revenue growth and as we face pension headwinds that will likely increase pressure on
earnings. I have unshakeable confidence in our future, however, because of the quality of our portfolio and the quality
of our people and our collective willingness to do all that is necessary to effectively navigate this new reality.
Let me turn the call over to Bruce now, to provide some additional detail on the third quarter financial results and some
initial color on emerging trends and their potential impact on 2011's financials. And then Bruce and I will come back
and take your questions. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President

you to open the charts and follow along with me as I make my comments.

Let's begin with Chart 3 and a summary of significant portfolio shaping and affordability actions we took this quarter.
First, we're pleased with the value we will receive with the announced sale of our EIG business for $815 million. And,
as a reminder, with the announced sale, the operating results for EIG have been classified as discontinued operations.
As a result, we've lowered our 2010 sales and segment profit outlook by the amounts we expect EIG to contribute.
Other than this movement to discontinued operations, our guidance remains unchanged for the year.
And finally, we do anticipate that this sale will close by year-end. As for PAE, as Bob said, we will expect to close that
transaction later this year or early in 2011. And moving down the same chart to our voluntary executive separation
program, we had about 600 employees participating in the program. And I'm sure you saw our 8-K announcing the
$178 million pre-tax charge for the program.
Over the next few weeks or months, we'll be working with our customer to agree on the timing of recovery of the
program cost and the amount of recurring savings that it will generate going forward. We would expect to recover a
majority of the program costs in the future as we price new business.
If you now turn to Chart 4 and our third quarter sales summary. Overall, the corporation grew 6% in the quarter.
Electronic Systems had the strongest growth at 10% due primarily to the third quarter deliveries of our Persistent
Threat Detection System or PTDS in the quarter. This contract began earlier this year and all deliveries occurred in this
quarter. Both Aeronautics and IS&GS grew at 7% in the quarter with the growth in Aeronautics driven by the F-35
program and C-130 deliveries. Growth at IS&GS was driven by the 2010 Census program and our efforts at the DoE
Hanford site.
Space Systems sales were 5% lower than last year due to the absence of a commercial satellite sale. We had none this
quarter versus one in the third quarter of last year.
Chart 5 shows our revised sales guidance with EIG and discontinued operations. Again, the only change was removing
the sales for EIG from the IS&GS projections. Looking at the end of the year for each of the business areas, I would
expect Electronic Systems and IS&GS to be at the high end of their ranges, Space Systems to be at the low end of its
range and Aeronautics to likely to be in the middle of its range.
Chart 6 shows the same guidance changes for segment profit. Again, looking at where we expect to end the year, I'd
expect Electronic systems, Space Systems and Aeronautics to be at the high end of their ranges, while IS&GS will be
towards the lower end of its range.
Moving to Chart 7 and our cash flow performance. Again, this quarter cash was very strong as we generated over $500
million in cash while contributing over $1 billion to our pension plans. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $3.4
billion in cash from operations while contributing $1.4 billion to our pension plans. Without this contribution, our
operating cash through the first three quarters would have been $4.8 billion or more than $1 billion more than last year
through the same period.
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we were able to keep our guidance at $3.4 billion of operating cash, while
planning for an additional 800 million of pension contributions in the fourth quarter, bringing our full-year contribution
level to $2.2 billion.
Turning to Chart 8, we'll look at our dividend and yield increases over the last five years. With the 19% increase in
dividends we announced in the quarter, our yield at the current share price is just under 4% and if you annualize the
dividend increase, the yield exceeds 4%. Combined with our share repurchases, we've returned 76% of our year-to-date
free cash flow to shareholders.
We'll speak to our share repurchase activity on the next chart, Chart 9. Year-to-date, we've repurchased almost 20
million shares for just under $1.6 billion. That brings our current shares to outstanding 360 million, a 4.1% decrease
since the beginning of the year.
On our next chart, Chart 10, we'll show our continuing earnings-per-share outlook compared with last quarter's outlook.
In June, we provided guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share. Of course, in this quarter, we had the $178 million charge
for our vest, which impacted the outlook for the year by $0.31 per share. And moving the results of EIG into

discontinued operations lowered our continuing earnings per share by an additional $0.11 per share. A number of other
items netted to an overall $0.02 increase resulting in our new EPS guidance of $6.75 to $6.95 per share.
Finally, I'd like to give you a brief update on what we see as emerging trends as we head into 2011. We still plan to
provide our detailed guidance in January but wanted you to have an idea of the trends we're seeing as we sit here today.
For the top line, we expect our sales from continuing operations next year to grow at low single-digit growth rate over
this year.
Aeronautics will have another year of strong growth, driven by the F-35 program and C-130 deliveries.
Electronic Systems will be flattish compared with this year; losing the benefits of the PTDS sales we have this year in
addition to delays and expected awards for the Littoral Combat Ship and additional THAAD production.
IS&GS will likely have a slight decrease as we finish the 2010 Census this year and lose that activity in 2011. In
addition, we are expecting the federal IT market to shrink some 2% to 3% in 2011 compared to 2010. Between the to
PTDS and Census programs, we had nearly $1 billion in 2010 sales that will not be replicated in 2011. Space Systems
will also remain relatively flat compared with 2010 as we've been saying for some time now.
We expect segment profit to be similar to the 2010 level with resulting lower ROS compared with 2010, and as we look
at our pension expense on a FAS/CAS basis, our asset returns thus far are favorable compared with our long-term
assumption of 8.5% return, while the rates used to determine our discount rate have declined significantly throughout
the year.
In addition, we are now assuming that CAS harmonization will be effective in 2012 rather than in 2011. The
combination of each of these items leads us to believe that the FAS/CAS drag on our EPS will grow considerably in
2011. With that, I think we're ready for your questions. Javon, if you'd please open up the lines.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Safran with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Richard Safran>: Hi, good morning.
<A>: Hi, Rich.
<Q - Richard Safran>: I wanted to ask you first is some metal suppliers have been talking about increasing demand
and then they're raising prices for some strategic metals. And specifically, I've been noticing it for stainless titanium
alloys and nickel alloys. I was wondering if you could comment on how this could impact your costs near- and
long-term. And also in your comments if you would, would you talk about any capacity constraints you might be
seeing?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Rich, let me take a shot at it and I'll
see if Bob has anything to offer up after I finish. It may surprise some folks that in all honesty we don't by a lot of the
commodities and the metals and so forth that we use to build our products. As it turns out, we tend to aggregate the
demands for that – for those products and commodities and instead we let a lot of our suppliers use those aggregated
demands to purchase those materials. And so what we've tended to do in the past is establish some fairly long-term
purchase agreements that provide us stability in both the supply as well as the pricing. But think of that ability to
aggregate the overall supply amongst a lot of different suppliers in our base is bringing us the best prices. And I'll tell
you relative to the specifics that you cited, I'm not aware of any issues with our ability to acquire or price fluctuation of
that, that's out of the ordinary in what we're seeing today.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Rich, let me extend just a bit on Bruce's comment.
However, notionally we've had discussions with the Department of Defense acquisition team as we've extended these

conversations about affordability initiatives in thinking through the prospect of increasing material prices and the
greater need for us to act like a strategic buyer. And that's why this notion of long-term contracts, long-term
predictability, multi-year procurements have been advanced by the – I think the industry community broadly because
that will allow us to get the best possible prices really in any set of market conditions even if there were to be some
upward price pressure.
You also asked a question about capacity constraints here. We planned our programs in a flexible way so that we're not
experiencing any capacity shortfalls today at all. And on our major programs, you take the C-130 as an example, we've
been able to go from 16 to 26 to approximately 36 based on optimizing the investment that we've made. To date, we'd
be able to do the same thing on the Joint Strike Fighter. We think our Littoral Combat Ship offering has been thought
through in a similar set of circumstances. So we've tried to balance our view about capacity in assuring that we have
gated investments.
We call them gated, or we want to get greater knowledge before we make entirely speculative investments about what
the future horizon will look like. We try to build as much flexibility in the capacity that we have. We also have thought
through the prospect of potentially building down. If there were more headwind, can we build down and still not lose
the bubble on affordability or profitability, and the F-16 line is probably a good historical example of the ability to
scale up as global circumstances change and customers' recapitalization needs vary and then to build down and then to
build back up. So the lessons that we've learned there we've tried to populate throughout the company.

And our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi Investment.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A>: Good morning.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Hey, good morning, thanks. I was just wondering if you could offer a little bit more detail on the
LRIP 4 contract, particularly maybe some commentary about the longer-term margin profile and how you envision
revenues and margins ramping over the next several years taking into consideration this contract, just in particular
relative to the way you've talked about the program in the past.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah, Jason, I'll jump in here, and
Bob gave you some color relative – in his prepared remarks, relative to the contract structure that we agreed to. I would
characterize it as still enabling us to have the kind of margin expansion on the production program that I've been
talking about in the past. I'd think in past calls, I've talked about the thought that we'd like to be able to achieve about a
10% ROS, about the time we hit the middle of this decade or when we hit full rate production profile on our production
contracts. And I still think that's the case. I still think this contract enabled us to do that. We wouldn't have agreed to it
if we didn't think we could execute to it. It's probably a little tighter in terms of the risk elements of it on the share line
and the ceiling that I would have otherwise liked. But, yeah, I think that puts a little bit of a premium on us to focus on
our execution. But I think we're capable of doing that.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And, Jason, on the other side, a significant and
important element, when we move from cost-reimbursable to fixed-priced environment is assuring we've got a known
configuration, that the requirements are stable. So there's additional discipline in the process and that's not just on our
side, it's on the government's side. And notwithstanding Lot 4, but let me give you just a sense about this movement
from cost type to fixed-price type contracts. There's less flexibility overall in a fixed-price type contract, and that
requires, let me say some behavioral change and I'll make up an overly simplified illustration. It doesn't really help
much to do it with Lot 4 but in a cost-reimbursable environment, if we agreed that we were going to meet every
quarter, and the government would say, "We'd rather meet monthly," our first response is, "Where and when and what
subject matter experts should we bring?"

Under a fixed-price contract, we will say, "We're going to need to submit a change order to you to change the contract
budget baseline" and that'll include a provision for the cost of meeting monthly. That's a behavioral difference. So I
think we're all trying to go into this environment with our eyes open. As Bruce said, the risk band gets a little tighter on
our side, the discipline, I think, gets cranked up on both sides, we lose a little flexibility. But we think the advantages of
the taking on modestly more risk or diminishing flexibility will be borne out by improved performance on the program,
and that's what we're all focused on.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Harned>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Hi, Doug.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning.
<Q - Doug Harned>: In the release, in your discussion on 2011 earnings, there's a sentence that says that you're seeing
– the industry is seeing delays and cancellations in programs, and then also adjacent markets are turning out to be less
mature than anticipated. I wonder if you could talk about this a little bit. In particular, if you look at where the overall
budget is right now and you look at the 2011 budget, it's actually a pretty strong budget. So to think about that in terms
of a lot of delays and cancellations, I'm trying to understand how you fit that together.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.
<Q - Doug Harned>: And then, on the adjacent side, what are the adjacent markets that you are seeing as more
difficult right now?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah, Doug, let me start the
conversation then I'll turn it over to Bob. Last year about this time, we provided you guidance not just for the year 2010
expectations. We tried to give a little longer-term view of what we're expecting to see. And I think during that call, I
talked about sales in 2011 as kind of being at the mid-single digit level. We're now talking about more like the
low-single digit level. And the three – the items that you mentioned from the press release were the reasons for that
diminished outlook.
See, I'll give you a couple of examples maybe to highlight each of what we were talking about there. One of them, on
the delays, think of programs like the Littoral Combat Ship, which we are assuming in our numbers in 2011 as a win
when we talk about the growth rate we're seeing over 2010. But we had expected, when we were talking last year, for
that award to have been sometime in the early summer of this year. We're now talking about a November award
potentially. So think of that being almost 6 months of delay there. It doesn't change, obviously, the overall expectations
of sales or the Littoral Combat Ship but it does change the phasing. So we're going to shift some of those sales to the
right and push some of the early ramp right in 2011 over into 2012. Same exact thing is happening with the THAAD
production loss. We'd expect to get those earlier in the year. Looks like they'll be later in the year and it's the same kind
of delayed ramp up in the higher THAAD production that we're seeing there.
On the cancellation side, I mean the best example I think I can give to you there is we do have contract for IS&GS
called the FBI Sentinel Project, which is really a case management study or a case management program where we
were doing the development to enable a lot greater capability of that system. And I think in large part due to budget
pressures within the federal budget, the decision was made to stop doing further production on that activity. And
instead, potentially do with what you've got and go more into an operations and maintenance phase going forward as
opposed to a development phase. So not so much a cancellation as a scope production, in fact, reflecting, I think, the
new reality we're talking about.

And then on the adjacent market scenario, really what we're talking about there is the energy market. And specifically,
there it's the concentrated solar power market. When we talked to you last year at this time, we had in play a potential
deal we were looking at providing for Arizona Power Municipality, that as it turns out, didn't happen for a number of
reasons, but we also thought there were a number of smaller arrangements around the country that were going to
materialize. And as we sit here today, again, I think because – and frankly, because of some of the fiscal pressures
we're seeing and the tax revenues going down, I think we're seeing a delay in those particular types of projects. And,
Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything to that or...
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Doug, I would tell you that obviously we
always think for ourselves, but I'm going to guess we're not the only ones seeing the phenomena that Bruce has
described to you. Even as early as April of 2009, when Secretary Gates had a number of program decisions and
announcements, some of which impacting our company, some of which impacted others, we began to communicate
with you and others our sense and the phrase we've used is this new reality. And a big part of that new reality was the
fiscal challenges that our nation's facing and the need to adapt to some fiscal discipline. As a result, we're seeing, I
think, some building of the pressure on that horizon, and Bruce gave you some illustrations about delays and
cancellations.
As we watched the bills work their way through the Congress, I think there was a level of interest that drew our
attention in the Senate Appropriations Committee mark, because they talked about a number of programs. I even think
that – if I get the math right, I think the number's 41 programs they may have described as being delayed in some
fashion, the result of which was they're withholding some funding to see if those delays were going to be recovered or
whether they were going to be persistent.
So I think there's a broader observation of the process slowing down a little, and that's why among the affordability
initiatives that Dr. Carter released, we are keenly interested in adding our full [inaudible] voice in any experience we
have in our energy and focusing on shortening this cycle time, not only because it will help remedy the discussion that
Bruce just had with you now about the onset of revenue recognition, but we can flow that all the way through to force
structure and military capability that can be fielded. And we don't want to see that process delayed either, because the
real value of the systems we work on if you think of returns on their value, it commences when they get fielded and put
into operational service. So I think we have joined objectives and initiatives with the Administration in getting this
right, but our job here is to make sure that we're as clear and transparent and can give you the best of our professional
judgment as we look out over a pretty complicated landscape and give you a feel that we have for the future.
I'll also say, we've not hesitated in taking actions here that would be consistent with our appraisal of this future. Even as
far back as 2009, we began consolidations where our program baselines were being changed. We've gone through some
pretty painful reductions in force and that's something we work hard to avoid. But we can't avoid the reality of sizing
the workforce to the volume of work that we have to accomplish for the government.
We've elected some divestitures here that we've described to you fully to help us focus and really meet new sets of
expectations in the markets that we serve, but also to help us get greater operational focus. We talked about the
Voluntary Separation Program. We've been scrubbing our expense budgets and our capital budgets and really focusing
on generating operational cash, which we think is a very important focused area as we adapt to the new reality, which
we are committed to adapting to in running this business well. We think it's very sound judgment on our part to focus
on cash so that we can certainly weather any financial challenges we have, but also very much prepare for what we
believe will be a re-establishment of a growth trajectory for the business in the future, as we go through these early
rounds of budget examination to see what new baselines will look like.
I like the priorities our programs enjoy. I like the support that we've had in the President's budget and with the
Administration. I like the support that we've had in Congress overall as a statement about the portfolio. I think we align
well with military and intelligence community needs. And some markets will probably accelerate and some will have a
little pressure and we'll do our best to have sound judgment here as we allocate resources, do not over invest in
emerging or adjacent market areas so that we have then difficulties in returning value on those investments and we'll
stay very focused and we'll do our best to keep you advised in the stance of our experiencing these challenges.

Our next question comes in the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan Securities.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Morning.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: My question is on cash deployments. You had very strong cash flow in the quarter and you
effectively upped your guidance pretty significantly for the year ex-pension, but you made some significant changes
with regards to deployment: big extra deployment into the pension fund; raised the dividend very significantly; and you
cut back pretty significantly on share purchase. And since it's a zero-sum game, I was wondering if you could offer us
some insight into how you're thinking about those three buckets relative to each other going forward. Also, if you could
shed any light on what the net proceeds from EIG should be and how you're going to use those proceeds. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Thanks, Joe. I'll tackle this one.
You asked about pension dividend, share repos and the actions we took in the quarter and what that means for the
future. Maybe I'll start off with pensions just to begin with because that's such a big moving piece of the whole
discussion. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are now assuming that the cash harmonization is effective in 2012
versus 2011. That actually has the effect of lowering the CAS number in 2011 from what we expected. That's one of
the contributors to the additional FAS/CAS gap relative to the EPS that I talked about earlier. Discount rates have – are
significantly lower. I don't think that's a great surprise to anyone. They're lower now that they were at the end of last
year and we still need to see how much change we're going to see between now and the year-end.
Relative to the $2.2 billion, let me give a little bit of a tutorial relative to the ERISA funding requirements for our
pension plans. The ERISA, which obviously is the law that governs our pension plans in general, basically treats the
discount rate different than either our FAS evaluation or our CAS in that a discount rate for ERISA is for all intents and
purposes kind of set now going into next year. So think of it as a 24-month moving average. So we kind of know what
that is now and with the contributions, that get us to the 2.2 and where we expect our asset returns to be by the end of
the year, we think that this additional contribution amount will get us to the 80% funded level at the start of 2011
relative to an ERISA measurement perspective, which gets us in line with the expectations of the PPA, the Pension
Protection Act, that becomes effective for us in 2011.
And in that scenario, unless there are future changes beyond in 2011 in the form of lower discount rates or obviously
lower asset returns, we would not expect to have to make additional discretionary contributions into the fund as we've
done for the last few years and that's since the baseline – I'll call them the baseline ERISA requirements for
contributions, will be what it takes to keep the fund funded not just at the 80%, to actually grow that number over time.
So a lot of what we've talked about recently in terms of discretionary contributions, we would not expect to have to
make anywhere near that level going forward.
On the dividend, we took a look at where we sat from a dividend perspective and our growth prospects and we just felt
that – and I should say we talked to an awful lot of investors as well who felt that in today's environment, a strong cash
generating company with a strong dividend yield was looked upon favorably. And so we did that consciously under
that assumption.
And on the share repurchases, we probably were a little bit lighter in the quarter here this year. We still expect to
continue, although if you compared the first three quarters of last year, actually we're up compared to where we were
last year. I think some of that was just the phasing what we did in the first half of the year. I don't see that changing,
Joe, as we go forward because we're still – the 50% of free cash flow going forward that we've done for quite some
time is still our plan.
And I think your last question concerned the EIG net receipt that we expect to get from that, and we would expect to
net out about $0.5 billion, think of it relative to EIG sale. And we would continue to use them in – I'll just characterize

it as our general purpose use of cash for all the sorts of three things that we talked about earlier.

Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Thanks. Did have a quick question I think on the C-130J and looking at your mobility
commentary in the discussion. It was one of the first times I've seen air mobility EBIT come down on a year-on-year
basis, and also given how many more you delivered in the quarter year-on-year. I'm just not sure how to read that. Can
you help me with that one?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah, Miles, this is Bruce again.
I'm sorry. One of the reasons for that, the year-over-year change, was we're kind of getting towards the tail end of the
original multi-year contract, and as we typically get towards the tail end of contracts, we do have more profit
adjustments recognizing the performance on that contract. That's exactly what we experienced in this scenario last year.
So we had more inception-to-date pick-ups. As we start into kind of the new contracts post multi-year with the volume
coming there, as you point out there are higher numbers of aircraft, though we've not yet had the kind of experience on
these contracts early on to warrant the sorts of Inception-to-date adjustments as we did with the prior multi-year
contract.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Okay. And how much of a headwind is that on a run rate margin basis?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Well again, it's going to be
quarter-to-quarter dependent because we didn't have those sorts of inception-to-date step-ups every quarter last year. As
I look going forward in 2011, I wouldn't expect to have a significantly – you'd call it a headwind going forward for
C-130, I wouldn't expect to see that from 2010 to '11. So kind of think of it as the run rate we're doing now is about the
run rate we're going to expect to have in 2011.

Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: A question on margins. I guess it looks optically like if you're calling for modest revenue
growth in '11 but segment operating income flat, that that would imply margin pressure in the business. Is that right?
And where are you seeing it and why?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah, that's actually what I've tried
to tee up in the prepared marks, exactly as you just said it, Noah. And you know when – again, I'll harken back to when
we spoke a year ago this time and I did give a longer-term guidance for both 2011 and 2012, at that time. I thought at
that time that we were trending more towards going into margins in the 10, 10.5 to upper 10 range and I still think even
though sales have come down a little bit, with the portfolio changes we're seeing, the higher F-35 sales growth I mean
just as an example, I'm still seeing next year the F-35 program's going to grow some 20% above the level it is in 2010
for instance. So it is bringing with it lower margins overall and with that kind of portfolio shift, I do expect the margins
to come down somewhat from where we are today down into the 10s, probably in 2011.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: When you think about the margin longer-term, we hear a pretty concerned effort out of the
Pentagon to transfer more risks to the contractor and make it more about performance and not upfront contracting. How
concerned are you internally that that pressures defense contractor margins?

<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Noah, this is Bob Stevens. The answer to that is it
all depends. But right now, we're not concerned. Say, if you look historically we've had a good number of fixed-price
type contracts where we execute very well. So the discussion in my mind is not whether or not risk is transferred or the
contract type is cost reimbursable or fixed price. It's what are the underlying conditions and behaviors that align with
the contract type. There is no magic in a contract type. The magic is in alignment, and that's not just from our point of
view. That's the government's point of view. So as a matter of professional discipline on our part, we're going to
continue to advance discussions that say if we want to undertake a different kind of contracting architecture here, let's
also undertake all the responsibilities that are necessary to align the conditions that make that contracting methodology
successful for you, the government, and us, the industry. And so far, I believe we've been able to do that, and I tried to
highlight a little of the Lot 4 F-35.
There will be some behavioral changes and there will be some discipline and there will be some reduction in flexibility.
We won't jigger around the configuration. We'll have a tighter bandwidth on performance all around. And I believe the
government is up for that, and we are certainly up for that, and we know how to do this. We have – the breadth and
depth of our portfolio has been such that we've got lots of experience across the company.
And what we're working on now is to make sure that we're populating that experience across the company, so that
perhaps if there are organizations who in the recent past have not had familiarity with fixed-priced incentive type
contracts, they're becoming a lot smarter about fixed-price contracting environments today, as we think our government
customers would want us to be so that we don't fail to meet the execution responsibilities and commitments that we
make. So I mean it is a concerted focus here, we're not overly concerned about it. We believe we have to find financial
returns and generate value there as we have to deliver commitments under contracts to government customers.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Javon, this is Jerry. Because we've got a bunch of

No problem, sir. And our next question comes from George Shapiro with Access 342.
<Q - George Shapiro>: Yeah, Bob, I was wondering if you could provide for that F-35 contract the target price and
the target margin, and also how that relates to either what you're experiencing now on LRIP 3 or the implied learning
curve that you're expecting to get. Just so we can make some judgment on how achievable this might be given the
tighter ranges that you talked about on ceiling.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, George, I'm not going to give you the target
price and I'm not going to give you the target profitability or the margins, and I'm sure you'll do a good job in making
estimates about our performance in the absence of that data. I will tell you we have about a 74% learning curve
expectation on production. We're about walking down that curve, and of course there's lots of negotiations and even in
the back of my mind, George, some competitive landscape for the F-35. If you look broadly around the globe, we think
there's going to be strong international interest and I'm really not leaning forward in giving very specific pricing and
other information about it. That's the only reason I don't want to offer it at this time.
But I will tell you as we look at the transition from the SDD program into production, if we look at the movement of
cost, if we look at the likely returns from the cost reimbursable environment through the transition of production and
the transition to fixed-price contracting, I tell you this is in line with historic standards, save for maybe two
observations that we did share with you and others; a 50/50 share line in Lot 4 is a little more aggressive and a 120%
ceiling is a little tighter.
But then we believed we had a constructive and valuable discussion about the content of the program, the configuration
of the aircraft, what's expected to be delivered, and those are the areas that tend to put pressure on cost. When you don't
have as thorough an understanding about content or what is exactly deliverable, we try to take that on earlier with full
cooperation from our customer because our customer wanted us to step up and embrace some of this fixed-price

incentive contract modeling. So it isn't again that we say, "No we can't do that." Our viewpoint honestly is we can do a
lot of things provided that conditions are consistent to warrant the contracting methodology and the architecture in the
contract.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: George, I'll offer up one other
maybe observation for you. First off, if I go back to my early days when I was starting my career in Forth Worth
working the F-16 program, every single F-16 contract in production was an FPI contract. So we've had this experience
now for in my case almost 30 years. And as I look at the F-35 in particular, not to directly answer your question relative
to target price and margin and so forth, but I found one of the interesting things as I looked at it is if you take a look at
the cost, the target cost on the LRIP 1 aircraft, so that was for a two-aircraft buy, and compare that with the target cost
of LRIP 4, the cost of the LRIP 4 aircrafts are about half as much as the cost of the LRIP 1 aircrafts. So think of that in
31 aircraft down the production line, we've lowered the cost on those aircraft by half. And the other aspect as I look at
it from the risk perspective that Bob described as far as working this contract is, I very much view the LRIP 4 contract
is the risk we're taking on is continued, I'll say, performance down the learning curve. I think we have a good
understanding between ourselves and the government relative to concurrency risk with new findings in the SDD
contract, the development contract, such that, that will not sort of bleed over onto the LRIP 4 contract. And it's because
of that, that I openly felt comfortably signing the – or getting the agreement to the contract with the terms that we have.

Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Gleacher & Co.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Good afternoon, Bob.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Bob, could you just give us maybe just some more color on this U.K. F-35 decision to swap out
of STOVL and conventional? I realize it's kind of real-time but it sounds like you've been briefed a little bit. Maybe
what are the puts and takes away we should think about this on the program for the long-term? And then, if you could
also just tie it in with your views of the international, in general, for the entire corporation. I mean, you're seeing real
cuts in the U.K., by 8% in Germany. And I think expectations are there's further pressure here in the U.S. But how
should we think about the international market place? Thanks.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I'll take it in sections there, Peter. Actually,
I think, we probably know about as much of the U.K. decision on F-35 as you do. As you – you have to sort of filter out
the things that are being described and discussed as the processes is unfolding from the actual results of the process. It's
a very comprehensive review that's been undertaken in the United Kingdom. It's very broad. It's very deep. It's very
forward-looking. I don't even think the exact numbers of airplanes to be procured have been determined as I'm sure –
which is typical of all national security planners that we deal with in our international and domestic community. We try
to work through concepts of operations, likely future scenarios, how much equipment will need to be capable on what
date to accomplish what tasks.
So I believe we're watching the results flow out of the U.K. sort of in process, where some determinations have been
made. I think the judgment to move away from STOVL to the carrier variant, and I'm going to make some guesses
here, Peter, but that decision might be made to enhance interoperability, to enable potentially U.S. aircraft to land on
U.K. aircraft carriers or French aircraft or vice versa.
So I think the experience we've had is that judgments are made on capability, total expense, lifecycle costs,
interoperability, flexibility and that's what we're seeing in the U.K. And we'll have to see what ultimate judgments are
made about airplanes. But just stick with the F-35 for a while. We have long expected that there would be substantial
movement over time in the total estimated volumes of airplanes to be procured, whether they're U.S. airplanes for the
Air Force, the Navy or the Marine Corps, or whether they're for our international partners. The model we've offered
before is the one that we think is the most relevant to the situation we face today on the F-35 is the F-16, started at a

little more than 900 airplanes, grew into 4,400 airplanes in 26 countries. We're still seeing follow-on orders from those
countries to backfill support and extend their fleet. I very much believe that will be the case for the F-35.
And I know governments now are facing tough economic conditions, but they're also facing very tough security
environments. I do believe this airplane has already demonstrated the fundamental capabilities that cause individuals to
recognize its enormous value. So I rather suspect we'll see, as in the case of the U.K., a reduction in the quantity but
we'll also see cases like Israel who was not an investing partner in the core program, who has come forward in the
queue. They've talked about 75 airplanes in total. They'd like to get the first tranche, I think 18 to 20 or whatever that
number will be, sooner. I believe other governments and countries in the Middle East, in the Asia-Pacific theater are
also recognizing very significant security challenges.
I think some of those countries are feeling less pressure in their fiscal environments. They might have more resources
and may look at the current circumstances with regard to the U.K. or maybe other countries who are lessening the buy
or delaying the buy as an opportunity to get in the queue and to buy airplanes. Our focus here has to be on execution,
and we're not going to allow ourselves to be distracted. We are certainly not overly concerned or hyperventilating. I
expect there will be some ebb and flow in quantities and timing and even aircraft types but we've got a very capable
program foundation here.
And we talk a lot about the STOVL because it deserves to have the conversations. If it's 40 flights behind its test
schedule and we're having some component failures, the time we spend there causes us to talk less about the CTOL and
CV version that are really flying very well. And I assure you that the United States Navy and the United States Air
Force are very excited about the prospects of performance in this program and recognize the contribution we can make
by delivering this capability as do our international partners. So I'll tell you again, get a seat with a seatbelt on it
because this is not the first discussion we're going to have with international partners about quantities or aircraft types
or timing, there will be more.
Our goal is to stay close to those customers, support them in every possible way we can, give them very realistic
appraisals about our performance and what they should expect not just on cost and pricing and availability but aircraft
capability, extending the discussion beyond the F-35. When we look at the international marketplace, we still see
growth opportunities for our business. Our portfolio is well populated with the kinds of capabilities that governments
place a high priority on like missile defense.
And I know we can't get – talk definitively about the Littoral Combat Ship but I really believe deeply in that mission
and deeply in the concept of a ship of this class in the Littorals and I am confident other international governments do
as well. So there would be international opportunities there. For the C-130, we believe there's strong interest. We're not
done delivering F-16s yet and have a significant campaign underway that support the evolution of F-35 quantities.
So our sense is we're living in a world that has a lot of security challenges notwithstanding the economic pressures.
What's really going to matter is do you have a mature portfolio, have you demonstrated that the systems that you're
working on actually work when they're placed into service they do and can you deliver according to the commitments
that are under the contract. And those are the fundamental details we focus on without allowing ourselves to be
distracted. So I don't see a dramatic diminution or a change in the expectations for international growth. We're
committed to staying on that pattern. We'll redouble some efforts in our international support community. We'll flow
resources, talent, people, executive presence there and then we'll work with the U.S. government here as we develop
the budget for 2012 figure out what will happen through the continuing resolution and the potential lame duck session
for the 2011 funding and keep you advised.

Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Co.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you very much. So your pension guidance for 2011 of 1.2 billion is 550 million
higher than what you gave us at mid-year, despite the fact that you're putting 800 million more into the pension fund,

despite the fact that you're now in positive territory in terms of returns. And based on kind of what you told us, the
discount rate was about 100 million per 25 bps. That's probably some 350 million negative. So by my numbers, you're
200 million off. How much of that is CAS harmonization? And if you could walk us through the other items and then
give us some rough color as to what should we expect in 2012 because you gave us some color on that the last time.
Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yes, Cai, your numbers are I'll say,
very directionally accurate. Think of the discount rate change. And by the way, I'm not here to suggest that the discount
rate is 5% today. We tried to give you some sensitivity in the press release and we take that number thinking if things
continue down the path from an interest rate perspective, that's where it could be. I don't think we're there today, by the
way. But sticking with that number, if you assume the 5%, that's about 400 million of the 550 or so that you're talking
about. And then the CAS harmonization, from what we considered last year to now, moving that out from 2011 to
2012, that accounts for the full difference. Think of that as being about 150 million bucks next year. And 2012, I'll be
honest with you; I hate to even speculate on 2012 given that I don't know where we're going to end up in 2010. I'd just
as soon wait until we see what that looks like and perhaps I'll give you some more color on that in the January call.

Your next question comes from Troy Lahr with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Troy Lahr>: Yeah, thanks. I'm wondering if you could maybe talk about how you're managing the loss of
knowledge at the executive level. I guess it sounded like maybe three times more people took the offer. And are the 600
people leaving kind of at different phases and maybe can you talk about how that's split between your four segments?
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I'm happy to. And just an editorial note, at
least from my point of view, I've heard some discussion about what was expected versus what's happened. What
happened was what I expected, so I won't comment more about that. I just find it interesting. So more than 70% of
those who have accepted the Voluntary Executive Separation Program are retirement eligible, which means they could
walk out the door today. And I'll be very candid in my selection of language with you. It isn't as though the actions that
we've taken or that I've authorized here are taking us off a cliff. These folks were going to leave in the next couple of
years anyway. And the question in our mind was how do you want to orchestrate the environment in which seasoned
senior folks are going to leave? And we elected to take ourselves to a position rather than allow circumstances to
envelop us and take us in a place that we had not planned for or couldn't adequately predict what the outcome would
be.
So years ago, we began planning through a series of executive rotations, perhaps you're familiar with the phrase full
spectrum leadership, the investment in a center for leadership excellence here, to begin to populate a set of experience
through rotational assignments and broadening experiences in this company, a cadre of talent that was not retirement
eligible today, recognizing we've got a demographic shift not just in our company and in our industry, but throughout
our government, where the Baby Boomers are going to go to retirement and they're going to go no matter what you and
I do.
So the VES Program was part of a much broader articulated strategy of how to transition through generational change
in our company without losing the bubble on execution or programs. So we began to link executives through mentoring
programs and through experiential relationships so that we would grow the population underneath the senior leaders
who are about to depart. And you added an important component here, the phasing of executive responsibility.
So let's do some math. 600 or so people will leave between now and February. Our sense was that they would be
leaving in the relatively near-term anyway. We've begun early phasing in a variety of ways where it makes sense to do
that. We won't backfill the entire complement of 600 executives because a principal goal for us is to get leaner, more
streamlined, to rightsize this business but we will backfill while we consolidate and realign our organizational focus.
We think that makes us stronger, not weaker. And we'll have people who will be placed into these realigned executive
responsibilities who have had experience, who do have contact with those who will be departing, in some cases under

the direct tutelage of those who will be leaving. And I will say this about the professional workforce that we have
including our retirees today and our soon-to-become retirees who are in the VES Program. They care deeply about the
mission. They care deeply about this company and there is not one who would fail to help a colleague even after they
were to depart in February.
So I think we're very well aligned to face the reality that we're all facing. And others I guess will go about this in an
approach that they think makes sense. This approach in our judgment was exactly the way we ought to navigate in this
new reality, knowing we're going to face the challenges that we're facing. So I think we're very well positioned here. I
don't expect a single blip on a program. I don't expect any difficulty. We have plenty of phasing-in time, which we are
doing now. And we'll continue to stay very focused on this. It's not just going to be through February. But when new
people go to new assignments at any time under any set of conditions, we try to give them more rather than less help to
make sure we're all getting grounded and our expectations are clear and communications are crisp and we are prepared
to do that and have means and mechanisms in place now to help facilitate that.
So I'm pleased you asked the question because I think we haven't talked a lot about beyond the numbers, what do you
expect in an operating environment from the company as you move forward, and your question gave us an opportunity
to highlight that a bit.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Javon, I think we have time for one more call, if we
could please.

Okay, our final question comes from George Shapiro with Access 342.
<Q - George Shapiro>: Yeah, Bob, I had one other question just in general here that with the – you sold EIG for 12
times EBITDA, your own stock's selling for 5 times, we've seen other transactions in the 10 to 12 times. I mean, why
won't this get you to want to take a sharp look at some of the other business that you have and potentially take a look at
them for sale if the valuations between the public and private markets don't close?
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well there's several observations I'd offer you
there, George. First and I hope we conveyed this with clarity when we talked to you about EIG and PA&E, we do
routinely look at every aspect of this business strategically, operationally and financially relative to its short-term,
intermediate-term and long-term fit with regard to delivering value to customers and value to shareholders while we
create a vibrant environment here for our employees.
If we trigger a threshold then anyone of those domains, as was the case with EIG on the organizational conflict of
interest or PA&E where growth opportunities were progressively misaligned with our core strategy, we won't hesitate. I
will also tell you, we're not pleased with the trading multiple of our stock and damn well believe we can do better.
So in the short horizon, I don't think we're going to be looking at wholesale divestitures here before we look at
operating the businesses better, navigating through some near-term turbulence, recognizing the quality and strength of
our portfolio and our ability to execute going forward because we have the leadership and the professional capability to
do a better job. And that's got our focus. It won't cause us to fail to look at the quality of our portfolio on a recurring
basis. But I don't think you should expect from us wholesale divestitures because at a moment in time, there's a little
more pressure here than any of us would like. Our job is to go execute better and relieve some of that pressure. George,
I thank you for the question.
Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Let me thank you, Javon, for your help on the call today and thank everybody who joined us. We're going to focus, as I
said, on execution and on streamlining and on becoming more efficient as we learn more about our budget priorities
and program priorities here on the domestic business front and in the international community. And we'll be able to
