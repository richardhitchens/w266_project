MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July
26, 2012.
I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.
Matthew Ginter
Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter business review. With me today are Inge
Thulin, 3M Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I'd like to mention just a few calendar items. We will announce our third quarter earnings on Tuesday,
October 23, and our fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, January 24. And as I mentioned back on our April call, we're
planning to host our next Investor Day here in the Twin Cities on Thursday, November 8, so please hold this date on
your calendars.
Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call, we will make
certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base
these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to
differ from our predictions.

So let's begin today's review, and I'll turn the program over to Inge. Please turn to slide number three.
Inge G. Thulin
Thanks, Matt. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. As you have seen, Q2 was very similar to
our first quarter. We again saw superb operational execution by our team. We continued to grow our earnings, and I'm
pleased with our broad-based margins performance.
Second quarter EPS was a record $1.66, up nearly 4% year-on-year. We grew operating income nearly 4.5%, to $1.7
billion, with operating margins of 22.9%, up 1.3% year-on-year. All six of our businesses posted margins above 20%,
reflecting strong execution across the board.
The revenue side was also similar to the first quarter. Sales were $7.5 billion, down 1.9%, including a negative
currency impact of more than 4%. Against a continued uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, organic local-currency
growth was up about 2%, with increases in all of our businesses except those affected by weakness in consumer
electronics.
Geographically, the Americas once again led the way, while Asia-Pacific was down slightly. Our teams in Western
Europe operated with very good discipline in that very challenging environment. In fact, operating margins improved
almost two points there.
Overall, Q2 demonstrated 3M's ability to deliver against weak segments and regions, but to me, the real story goes well
beyond our second quarter performance. We approached 2012 with caution and a conservative plan, a plan we continue
to execute with discipline and diligence. Clearly, it was the right plan, and we got a quick start on it.
Our plan called for tight control over discretionary spending, and we certainly did so in the first half of the year.
Needless to say, that level of cost control will continue for the foreseeable future. Last but certainly not least, we
returned over $1 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter.
Now David will take you through the detail of the quarter. David?
David W. Meline
Thank you, Inge. Let's begin by reviewing the income statement. Please turn to slide number four. As Inge said, our
business operated well in the second quarter, as we delivered outstanding profitability in the continued soft economy.
We drove excellent factory performance, and costs remained under very good control. Sales declined 1.9%
year-on-year, impacted by weak overall economic conditions and also by the stronger U.S. dollar. I will elaborate on
sales in just a bit.
Conversely, gross profit dollars increased by 0.7% versus last year's second quarter. SG&A costs declined 3.3%
year-on-year, reflecting prudent caution on discretionary spending, and R&D investments increased 1.1%. We continue
to invest to support future innovation and technology development.
In total, operating income grew by 4.4%, and operating margins were a solid 22.9%, an increase of 1.3 percentage
points year-on-year. Major components of the change in operating margin are detailed on the right side of this chart.
Selling prices increased net of raw material price changes, adding 1.6 percentage points to operating margin, and
foreign exchange impacts net of hedge added 0.3%. Higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense hurt operating
margins by 0.3%.
Earnings for the quarter were $1.66 per share, an increase of 3.8%. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 3.3%
year-on-year, to $702.6 million, resulting in a $0.05 positive impact to earnings per share. The second quarter 2012 tax
rate was 30.1%, up three percentage points year-on-year, which hurt earnings by $0.07 per share. As a reminder, in the
second quarter of 2011, we realized a one-time tax benefit from reorganizing one of our international subsidiaries, a

benefit which did not repeat this quarter.
During the quarter, we recognized insurance recoveries related to last year's earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which
added $0.02 to earnings per share. And finally, we absorbed $0.03 of costs in the second quarter related to relocating a
portion of our manufacturing operations from Western to Eastern Europe, along with consolidating certain
manufacturing and the supply chain support activities within Western Europe.
Once again, operating margins improved by 1.3% points, to 22.9%, as our teams are executing very well. Please turn to
slide number five for a more detailed look at our sales change for the quarter.
Sales for the second quarter were $7.5 billion. Organic local-currency growth was 1.9%, driven by higher year-on-year
selling prices, and volumes were flat versus last year's second quarter. Acquisitions added 0.5% to sales in the quarter.
Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 4.3 percentage points, as the U.S. dollar strengthened considerably against
the euro and other currencies. On a total dollar basis, sales declined by 1.9% year-on-year.
Organic local currency growth in Latin America/Canada was 11.4%, another strong showing by our teams in that part
of the world. All six of our businesses contributed to the increase, with three businesses growing double-digits; namely,
Electro & Communications, Health Care, and Safety, Security & Protection Services. Organic sales growth in the
United States was 3.6%.
Organic local-currency sales declined slightly in Asia-Pacific, as strong sales in both Health Care and Industrial &
Transportation were offset by slower year-on-year demand in the consumer electronics industry. Japan declined 2%,
and China was up slightly year-on-year. We expect to see improving growth rates in China in the second half of the
year.
On the ex-Electronics basis, organic local-currency sales growth was 6% in Asia-Pacific. We anticipate that our growth
rates in Consumer Electronics will begin to improve in the third quarter and continue into the fourth. This improvement
is due in part to easier comparisons, as our sales to this market slowed in the second half of 2011, but of course there
are other factors in play, such as the timing of customer new product launches.
In EMEA, or the combined Europe, Middle East, and Africa, second quarter sales declined 1.9% on an organic
local-currency basis. Regardless, challenges remain in Western Europe as these countries work through their economic
and physical issues. We remain focused on what we can control, such as driving for additional market share and
maintaining firm cost discipline. So now let's dig into our six business segments. Please turn to slide number six.
Industrial & Transportation generated sales of $2.6 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 4% on an organic
local-currency basis. The growth was very broad-based, led by double-digit increases in both automotive OEM and
aerospace. We also posted good growth in industrial abrasives and in our energy and advanced materials businesses.
On a geographic basis, organic sales in local currencies increased 8% in Latin America/Canada, 7% in Asia-Pacific,
and 5% in the United States, while EMEA declined just slightly in the quarter. Operating income was $614 million, a
year-over-year increase of 13%, and margins in the business improved by 2.8 percentage points, to a solid 23.4%.
Industrial & Transportation is the largest of our six segments and continues to generate significant productivity and
profitability.
Now let's move to Health Care. Once again, our Health Care team delivered superb results. Sales were $1.3 billion, and
operating income grew 13%, to $414 million. Operating margins exceeded 32%. Sales in the second quarter increased
more than 5% on an organic local-currency basis. All businesses and geographic areas contributed to this growth, with
particular strength in food safety and Health Information Systems, or HIS. Both HIS and food safety are priority
investment areas for us, and we are pleased to see another quarter of high growth in these spaces.
HIS also closed the acquisition of CodeRyte in the second quarter. CodeRyte is a leader in clinical natural language
processing technology and computer-assisted coding solutions for outpatient providers. It is a great business and an
important technology area, and a natural adjacency to our core coding and classification technology base. There are
early signs of strong synergy between our businesses, which will enable further growth for HIS.

Looking geographically, we are pleased with our progress in the emerging markets. These countries naturally seek
higher-quality health care, and our investments in these areas are beginning to pay off. In the first half of 2012, organic
local-currency growth in emerging markets was more than 14% for Health Care, led by our skin and wound care and
infection prevention businesses. Of particular note this quarter were China and Mexico, each of which exceeded 20%
organic growth in local currencies.
In developed markets, we posted positive organic local-currency growth despite weakness in Europe. This is a
testament to the strength of our Health Care portfolio and the quality of our teams. Profit margins in Health Care were a
strong 32.3% in the second quarter. Our factories continue to run very efficiently, discretionary spending is under firm
control, and the portfolio mix was excellent.
Now let's look at Consumer & Office Business. Sales were $1.1 billion this quarter, up 3% on an organic
local-currency basis, and operating income rose more than 10%, to $222 million. Operating margins rose 1.5
percentage points year-on-year, to 21%. From an end-market perspective, top-line growth was quite good across the
mass retail, DIY, grocery, and drug channels. This growth more than offset continued weakness in office wholesale and
retail, which continues to be impacted by high unemployment levels.
Acquisitions added nearly 3% to second quarter sales, largely related to the October 2011 purchase of GPI Group. GPI
is a producer of tapes, hooks, insulation and floor protection products for the home improvement channel. Integration is
moving along well, and the business is on track towards its financial objectives. On a geographic basis, organic
local-currency growth was 9% in Latin America/Canada, 5% in Asia-Pacific, and 4% in the U.S., while EMEA
declined 6% during the quarter.
The Safety, Security & Protection Services business also had a good quarter. Sales were just shy of $1 billion in the
second quarter, and operating income grew 6% year-on-year, to $258 million. Operating margins rose two full
percentage points, to 26%. A number of factors drove the margin improvement, including a net positive impact from
price and raw materials, improved factory utilization levels, and positive mix.
Total organic local-currency sales growth for the business was 3%, with significant contributions from the
infrastructure protection, personal safety, and building and commercial services businesses. Second quarter sales
declined year-on-year in the security systems business. Looking geographically, sales rose more than 20% in Latin
America/Canada and 2% in both Asia-Pacific and the U.S. Sales declined 4% in EMEA.
Let's take a look at our Display & Graphics segment. Sales in the second quarter were $882 million, down 7% in
organic local-currency terms. Optical systems sales fell 20% versus last year's second quarter, largely driven by LCD
TV. On a sequential basis, sales improved by 8%. We continue to see good growth in 3M films for battery-powered
devices such as smartphones and tablets, where 3M's value proposition remains very strong.
Also in D&G, architectural markets and commercial graphics continue to grow nicely. Sales in traffic safety systems
declined slightly in the quarter on an organic local-currency basis. On an organic local-currency basis, sales grew by
9% in the United States and 8% in Latin America/Canada. Sales declined 14% in Asia-Pacific, largely
electronics-related, and 6% in EMEA. Operating profits in Display & Graphics were $179 million, and margins were
20.3% for the quarter.
Lastly, let's review Electro & Communications. Second quarter sales in this business were $824 million. Operating
income was $195 million, and operating margins increased 60 basis points, to an impressive 23.7%. Sales were down
year-on-year in our consumer electronics-related businesses. Our 2012 plans in this space called for a challenging first
half, which has been the case. We continue to believe that growth will improve in the second half of 2012 due to a
combination of improved industry demand and easier year-on-your comps.
Organic local-currency sales increased in our electrical markets business, while telecom supplies business declined a
bit. In geographic terms, Latin America/Canada rose 13% and the U.S. increased 6%, while Asia-Pacific and EMEA
declined 5% and 8%, respectively.
That concludes my discussion of the business segment results. Please turn to slide number seven.

Free cash flow for the quarter was just over $1 billion, down $125 million year-on-year. This amount includes a
voluntary $250 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit plan. We made a similar size voluntary contribution in
the first quarter of this year, putting total year-to-date discretionary cash contributions at $500 million. This amount is
consistent with our plan for the year.
In total, second quarter pension and OPEB contributions totaled $335 million, which was $271 million higher than Q2
of last year. For the full year, we anticipate total contributions of about $1 billion to our pension and OPEB plans, and
we remain very well-funded at the moment.
On the positive side, free cash flow benefited from lower working capital investment and higher levels of net income.
Capital expenditures were $358 million, up $63 million versus the second quarter of last year, and we remain on track
to invest $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion for 2012 in total.
Free cash flow conversion was 88% in the quarter, versus 100% in last year's second quarter. Adjusting for pension and
OPEB contributions, conversion was 117% this quarter, versus 105% in Q2 of 2011.
We returned over $1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter, including $410 million in cash dividends and $639
million in gross share repurchases. On a final note, during the second quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of long-term
debt, spread over five and ten-year terms, at record low corporate yields.
So that concludes my discussion of our second quarter financial results. Now Inge will address our forward outlook.
Inge G. Thulin
Thanks, David. During uncertain times like this, I'm especially appreciative of 3M's business model, a model flexible
enough to allow investments to improve the business and yet disciplined enough to deliver earnings and superior
margins when economic growth is challenging. We are well-known for our culture of innovation, but just as real is our
culture of continuous improvement. For example, in the first half of this year, we absorbed restructuring cost of $0.07
per share.
Given that most knowledgeable observers see slow or stalled global growth in the second half of the year, we will
continue the approach that served us very well in the first half: strong execution and productivity, good cost discipline,
and continued investments and actions to improve and build our businesses around the world.
We are, in fact, increasing our momentum to move 3M forward. For example, in the quarter, we announced the
acquisition of Federal Signal Technologies Group. FCTech (sic) [FSTech] (21:17) is focused on electronic toll
collection, parking management hardware and software services, key adjacencies to our traffic safety systems business.
On last quarter's call, we talked about the investments in Aerospace and a newly-formed business, Mining, Oil & Gas
Solutions. They both progressed very well this quarter. Aerospace grew 24%, and Mining, Oil & Gas at 20%,
significantly faster than the market. I look for great things from these businesses, as they both operate at the crossroads
of advanced technology and megatrends.
As you know, 3M is a true pioneer of international business. Many of our international companies have existed for
decades. For example, 3M Brazil dates back to 1946. Over the years, we have developed global capabilities that are
second to none.
Our newest frontier is sub-Saharan Africa, where we just launched an initiative to broaden our presence in this
emerging market. In Q2, we announced the formation of a new subsidiary in Nigeria and reactivated our operations in
Kenya. We believe sub-Saharan Africa holds long-term opportunity for 3M of more than $0.5 billion.
Also, in the second quarter, we took steps to establish a standalone subsidiary in Saudi Arabia. 3M already does sizable
business there, and with a wholly-owned subsidiary, we can make a step change in our growth there. We expect 3M
Saudi Arabia to be in full operations on September 1. Here, again, we see long-term opportunities in the $500 million
range.

We took actions this quarter to fully realize opportunities like Africa and Saudi Arabia by increasing the effectiveness
of the way we go to market and serve customers. In addition, we just appointed a new Vice President for Global Sales
Operations to increase sales skills, competence, and productivity around the world. The new VP for Global Sales is an
experienced sales professional, a proven leader, who has led 3M businesses in Europe and North America with great
success.
Also, with the increasing importance of digital platforms in the marketplace, we have elevated eTransformation with
the appointment of a vice president for this function. The new leader has both the understanding and experience to lead
our company-wide efforts, as he has led similar efforts at the number of companies before joining 3M. The objective is
to build and scale our ePlatform to realize rewards and increase sales, brand presence, and productivity.
These two appointments, along with the previous appointment of a Vice President of Global Marketing Excellence, will
significantly increase our sales and marketing horsepower at the center of the company and improve our capability to
drive growth and penetration everywhere.
That is a quick summary of some of the ways we are moving the company forward. I now turn to our outlook for the
balance of the year. Please turn to slide eight.
First, my confidence in the company's ongoing performance lead us to affirm our EPS outlook in the range of $6.35 to
$6 50 for the year. We do so with full consideration of additional headwinds from currency in the second half. Looking
upon sales, we expect organic local-currency growth of 2% to 5% for all of 2012.
We trimmed the high end of the range by a point based on the first half and our views about global economic activity
going forward. Strong pricing should offset slightly lower volumes, and comps become easier as the year goes on.
After the good margin performance in the first half, we are raising the bottom end of the margin range from 21% to
21.5%, and the tax rate remains unchanged.
To me, the second quarter demonstrates that 3M continues to operate very well, with alignment, discipline, and always
with an eye toward opportunity.
Thank you for your attention. We will now take your questions and comments.

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning, Ajay.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: So getting really impressive pricing here of up nearly 2% in the quarter, so maybe if you can
talk about the outlook for the rest of the year, how should we be thinking about pricing, and then also raw materials, as
they moderate, is that a benefit to the spread and margins.
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure, Ajay. So what I would say first on pricing, as you probably recall, we had indicated
we'd get somewhere between 0% and 1% on the year, and what we expected, given the way prices developed last year,
is we would see some level of decline as we move through the year. So if you look at the first half, we've been pretty
solid and stable there. We did 1.7% in the first quarter and now 1.9% in the second. But again, as you look at the trends
for the year, we'll see that moderate somewhat. On the other hand, we had said 0% to 1%, and it looks now like we'll
probably come closer to 1% for the year than flat.

In terms of raw materials, what we're seeing, like everyone else, we are seeing that the raw materials are certainly softer
than we might have expected at this stage. So we had raw material price inflation of 2% in the first quarter. We had
indicated we thought we'd come in at 1% to 2% for the year. The second quarter actually now declined, so from that
2% level, we were around flat in the second quarter on raw materials, and we think for the year in total, it's most likely
we'll be closer to flat than those higher levels. So, yeah, it's contributing, certainly, to our margins presently, and that,
we expect to continue at some level through the balance of the year.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Good. Thank you for that. And then on the discretionary spending, Inge, maybe talk a little bit
about the initiatives you have put in place. And then we are obviously seeing the benefit on the SG&A rate there. Could
you maybe talk about what's the opportunity you see on costs tightening?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, we continue the rest of the year as we started the year, which, as I said earlier, we went
into the year with a plan that was conservative, and we've been very cautious. And you have some parts of the world,
like Western Europe at the moment, where there is challenges relative to economic outlook, so we are managing that
very, very tightly. At the same time, when we see opportunities for growth, we invest. And we talked at the last call
specifically around health care, which is everywhere around the world, and we see very good traction. We also invest in
personal safety. We have those two new units that we talked about last time in terms of mining, oil and gas and
aerospace, where we continue to invest when we see the opportunities.
But we are just cautious as we go, and specifically, I think big credit should be given to our West European team, that
are on that the whole time, day by day. So we hoped at the time that we can let up, but the important thing here is we
have the plan, which we now look upon to say it was a good, solid plan we rolled into the year on, and we are very
pleased in how the team are executing it. And as you saw also in terms of research and development, went up 1.1%,
meaning that we are committed to growth for the future in terms of the investment, so I think it's a good balance here.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Very helpful. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Thanks, Ajay.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: I actually want to ask you to dig into a little more detail on the pricing question. So Latin
America looks like it was up 440 basis points on pricing, and the U.S., 290; EMEA, 270. This kind of pricing power
continues to be extraordinary and the question I have is can you give us a better sense for the kind of actual actions
you're taking on pricing? Is this – whether it's material contract, escalators, what things are you doing? It's not mix, I
know, so what are you doing that's allowing you to get that kind of pricing quarter-in, quarter-out lately?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So, Steve, basically, as you know, and we've talked about a number of times over the
last, now, couple years that the company really started gearing up to make sure that we were adequately recovering our
material costs as we moved through last year, and that continued into the first and second quarters here. So 1.7% in the
first quarter overall, 1.9% in the second, would indicate that we've taken some fairly limited additional increases here in
Q2. And not surprisingly – for us, at least – we have very good price retention, the products that we offer in these
markets around the world, and we work very hard to keep them differentiated and fresh, which enables us to maintain
our prices and offer things that are attractive to the market. So I wouldn't view it as something different today than
we've been experiencing in recent times. Perhaps just the comps are showing up a little bit more strongly right now.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Does that explain Latin America, particularly?

at a depreciating currency environment, such as Brazil has a 20% decline in currency year-over-year, we do pick up
some price on a portion of the products as they're pegged to the dollar.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, so that's separate from all the currency impacts you call out, and you -
<A - David W. Meline>: Yes.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, got it. And then, secondly, when you talk about that second-half top-line guidance
baking in a more conservative view of the economy, it still looks like there's something like somewhere around at least
low-single-digit and potentially mid to high-single-digit growth baked in on the organic side. How are you thinking
about that for the second half? Because it sounds like there's still acceleration here, and you mentioned comps. Is it all
comps-based, or what are you planning on?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, it's a good question. So if you look at the range for the year, we've got a range of now
2% to 5% for the year in total. We did 2% in the first half, so obviously the scenario in which we'd be at that low end
would be such that we would continue on the same path, and the high end, of course, does indicate that we'd have some
pickup. Where do we see that pickup coming from? Several factors. One, certainly, that's been impacting us, as you
know, is the electronics sector, which we do see the recovery developing in the second half exactly as we'd previously
indicated in our planning, so that's contributing to our second-half outlook. And then certainly there's a component of it,
which is the comps, which again, last year in the second half we had a deterioration, so even with stable revenue, we
would see some level of pickup there.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: The electronics, what gives you confidence that that could materialize?
<A - David W. Meline>: We were seeing – as we exited the quarter, we're starting to see that turnaround develop in
terms of the volume. So it starts with looking at indicators of forward demand, including areas like semiconductor, fab,
and our consumer electronics outlook that we observe, and then observing what is in our forward orders. And we see,
importantly, the inflection developing now as we've exited the second quarter, and again, there's a comp issue that helps
that as well.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Thanks, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Hi. This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A quick question on pensions -
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Based on some of the recent pension funding policy changes, I guess, will you opt for
some of the funding relief options, and how should we think about your funding requirements looking to 2013?
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Sure. So in terms of our overall pension funded position and how we think about pensions, we
have a view that the right approach to this is to be targeting a range of funded status, which is quite a healthy one, so
somewhere bracketing the 100%-funded position. We were in the mid-80%-funded status as we ended last year due to
declining interest rates, and so we made a decision this year to do this extraordinary additional funding to make sure
that we don't vary from our longer-term goals, so hence the additional funding that we put in this year, which we expect
to be $500 million. So the point there is to keep the pension fund well-funded.
Secondly, as to the change in the funding requirements, that doesn't impact us because that would give relief to
companies that are facing mandatory contributions, and of course, based on the way we manage pension funding, we
don't face that kind of a situation.

So it doesn't have any impact on 3M. If I look into 2013, last year about this time, we were expecting to see pension
expense requirements actually decline in 2012 and thus not have the additional requirements for also additional
funding. But the reality was is we saw interest rates decline as we went through the year, so we actually had a pension
increase in our expense last year, and also our funded status declined, which we've been addressing this year. So, as I
look into next year, what's true is that we would expect, from an expense perspective, to be stable or see some
additional decline, but quite honestly, I'm a little cautious to make a call at this stage, given our experience recently and
where interest rates seem to be wanting to go.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay, fair enough. And then a quick follow-up question on the electronics side of the
business; could you talk a little bit about some of these share gains that you're seeing in the semi markets and some of
the drivers behind this, and are there any regional factors behind the business wins?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, we are broad-based, as you know, in consumer electronic, everything from
semiconductor to data storage to smartphones to notebooks to tablets and touch panel. We are [indiscernible] (38:40)
moving with the market, and when we looked upon the outlook a quarter ago and then look up on it now again,
basically, we can confirm the movements in the market. There is a slight uptick on tablets versus notebooks, but
overall, the growth is coming as we're expecting as for the rest of the year. The other thing we see on semiconductors,
you know, which is an early indicator, we see that, in fact, continue to improve, which is good. And the other thing is
also, if you go back a year ago in comparison, the Thailand flooding is now – restructuring there is done, meaning we
see a positive comparison for us as we move forward.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay, great. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Guys, do you have a sense of what your customers are doing with their inventories right now,
whether we are past the destock, or is there's another round of destock that's ahead of us?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, as you can imagine, we are following that very closely. And when we are scanning our
many businesses and end markets, it looked like overall there is a very good line in between demand and inventories.
So we don't see an issue there, and in fact, I think since the last recession, almost all companies are now managing
inventories very, very carefully. So there is not an issue there as we see it. So inventory versus demand is well under
control, so that's our view at this point in time.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, if I could, the one exception would be we did see that LCD panel inventories have
risen to a pretty high level. Not a big factor in the business any longer, Scott; last quarter, optical systems represented
now 4% of our total revenue as a company, and of course, only about a third of that is in the LCD business. But,
nonetheless, that's the one area that we observe a buildup of inventory.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: I think that was the only place we saw a small tick-up on the running rate, which is now close to
seven weeks, I think.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Thanks for that. And just as a follow-up, I know there's been a lot of questions on
margins, but in Europe specifically, where it's pretty hard for us to imagine how you could take margins up by a couple
hundred basis points in such a tough environment, how much of that is a benefit of past restructuring? You talked about

discretionary cost and things that are under control, but is there some permanent step-up in that margin rate that we can
expect going forward, just from past work that you've done there in Europe?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, first of all, let's talk about Western Europe in terms of perspective. We have been
on Western Europe for quite some years. And you maybe recall that we made a restructuring probably two-and-a-half
years ago, when we made very clear that there is a difference in between Western Europe, Central/East Europe, and
Middle East/Africa. So we started that very early, and at that time we also regionalized Western Europe. So I think,
first of all, we have to say this is nothing that is coming here as a surprise for us. We were very early into the game in
order to make sure we prepared ourselves.
There is a combination, of course, of benefit of restructuring in terms of when we did the regionalization, where we
reduced the layers of management and made sure that we continue to have a local execution in terms of sales and
marketing, but as much as we could in terms of management and back-office type of consolidated that on a regional
base, meaning Nordic, Alpine, Benelux, Iberia, et cetera. So I think that is one of the things that is now paying off for
us, so we are very pleased we were early on that game.
Secondly, of course, they are now holding very tightly the spending in that part of the world, and have a hiring freeze
and, in fact, also, reduced, I think, over 300 people here during this year. So it's the combination of all of it. And at the
same time, Patrick Deconinck, that is leading our West European organization, as his team is focusing as much as they
can to gain market share in the market and elevate elements relative to customer interaction. So I wouldn't us like to
look upon Western Europe now like this is one quarter that just everything came through. This has been a longer period
of time that we were working very diligent plan.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. I would just add, Scott, what's also true is there is a mix effect. If you look at – one
area of the business that grew in the second quarter was health care in Europe, and that certainly helps our mix.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. I'll pass it on.
<A - David W. Meline>: Thanks, Scott.

<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Was hoping to start first on the [ph] FXTech (sic) [FSTech] (44:15) acquisition in road
tolling. It seems like this would be a good fit for 3M. Can you just discuss the competitive landscape – you do have
some entrenched competitors there – and maybe reflect a bit on what the mix might be in terms of systems and
consumables in this business?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, first of all, this is very much a business into United States, right? So it's United States
and U.K. a little bit. And whereas if you look upon the mix for it, I would say it's 25% of each relative to parking, toll
software, cameras, and the hardware in terms of polling, so 25%, 25%, 25%. There is a competitive landscape that we
are now taking on, but this is a great move for us because this is an adjacency that's growing into TSS for us, where we
have a global leading position on signing. So it's absolutely perfect for us in terms of making sure that we build out
more relevance in that market space for us, and I think all those components that we will be ready to integrate them and
execute very well.

And we will focus in on the pieces that we have the business today, which is United States, to most portions, and then a
smaller piece in U.K. And as soon as we've gone on the integration and built it in, after that, we will see how we can
expand it on a global base. But we have very good base, and that's what we will start to make sure we integrate it to a
very strong division we have in Traffic Safety System Solutions.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you, Inge. And then over on the optical film side, a lot of discussion about the next
iPhone and the implications of this new, what they call in-cell technology, where they're going to eliminate the
touchscreen layer. What are the implications for the optical film content where, if you remove that layer, it sounds like
they're already getting better display graphics on this, but is there a difference in content potential for 3M?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, as you can imagine, we are working very close with all the companies in these areas,
right? And whatever new technology that is coming, we are in the middle of that in order to help and support with
solutions. So I would say that we have seen a still big opportunity for us, specifically in handheld and smartphones, as
we move ahead. So, again, I can make sure for you that we are in the middle of it and there probably will be more of
upside for us than anything else, broad-based, in what I call tablet and handhelds.''
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. Just last one for me, on the consumer side, back-to-school, third-quarter, what are
you baking in in terms of assumptions year-over-year, and any comment on the Avery Dennison consumer
performance this quarter?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, in terms of the consumer and office business overall, we continue to expect – we'd set
out a range of growth for the year for that business, and we don't see any reason why that won't come to pass. Certainly,
the retail consumer, as we commented, has been – it's been relatively tepid, the demand in the space. Our performance,
we saw improved from first to second quarter, so we were pleased with that. And certainly there's indications that some
level of improvement in that particular area is going to continue now into the back-to-school period. So don't really
know the answer, but I would say, on an overall trend basis, we're confident and feel good with the outlook for the
business for the year.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: And the pending Avery Dennison acquisition?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, nothing new. We still expect to close that in the second half of the year here, and we are
still in the negotiations. So nothing new; we look upon it positively, and we hope that we will be closing it here before
the year is over.

<A - David W. Meline>: No, actually. If I – well, first of all, on the second quarter, it was pretty stable through the
quarter, so we didn't see – and obviously we're looking very carefully -- we didn't see any indications of a change in
trends. And that's true through July now. So some, obviously, individual sectors, individual geographies one month
versus another, you can have some ups and downs in an economy like this, but net-net, we don't have anything that
would cause us to say there's a material change in the outlook, which is how we characterize the second half now.
And then in terms of CapEx, not sure – if you talked about as that drives our own demand, we haven't seen again, any
discernible change. If we look at our own deployments, which is at some level an indicator of longer-term
requirements, we continue to get a bottom-up view that says we have demands for capital, based on the view of the
business that we need to continue to support growth, and there's no reason to vary from that. And if you see some
sectors – like our traffic safety had a very good second quarter, which is partly related, if it were, to government
funding in that particular case.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. And I was wondering, just as a second question, could you elaborate a little bit
more on China, the better performance that you're expecting? Is it just this ramp in the electronics supply chain that
you've already discussed so far here this morning? Are there other things going on there that are giving you a little bit
more confidence into the back half?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, let's first look upon the facts for us. First of all, revenue in the quarter was stable
versus Q1, so we had very similar growth rate for the second quarter versus the first quarter. Health care is growing
very fast for us, 20%-plus; and we also saw I&TB show improvement versus Q1, which is a good sign. So when you
take out electronics from China, we grew in the quarter 10% organic locally, versus 8% in Q1, so we make a
step-change relative to growth, generally speaking. And when we look upon the rest of the year, we look upon it to be,
from a dollar perspective, similar to the first half of the year, but due to the comparison, we see a growth rate
accelerating.
And as we talked about last time, there's a couple of things that have impacted China for us, which is, of course, export
specifically to Europe, electronics, and then the local consumption. And we will look upon it as we move ahead,
electronics will improve and also local consumption. We don't see any improvement relative to the exports to Europe.
So I think you can look upon it that they will be similar in terms of overall dollar sales, but improvement relative to
percentage due to the comps in electronics, and we also see health care improving quite a bit. We're very happy with
our health care business in China, as we speak, growing very, very fast.

<Q - Jason Feldman>: Good morning.

<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason Feldman>: Some very nice margin improvement. When you were talking about discretionary cost
controls, and specifically discretionary component, should this kind of SG&A level be something we should think of as
a sustainable run rate, or was it really just at this level given the uncertainty, and some of those cost controls are going
to be lifted when, hopefully, things improve?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. Yeah, as you know, Jason, we are always trying to balance cost control with investment
in the business and growth. Certainly, as we looked at this year coming into 2012, we didn't see the opportunity
materializing for the kind of growth that we foresee on the long-term basis for the company, and therefore we set for

ourselves a much more conservative plan in terms of our discretionary spending. And as you know, that's what we've
been actually marching to. At the same time, that plan, we continue to invest in the business. That investment, both in
SG&A and R&D, is very steady, so it's not as if we're carving out and starving investment in the business over time. So
is that sustainable?
Is that SG&A margin or expense sustainable? I would say I don't view it as extraordinarily constrained right now, to be
honest. We're always working on becoming more efficient. We're always trying to leverage the business as being a
larger business on an efficient back office, et cetera. So, to me, there's nothing that jumps out in terms of that
performance in the context of the current economic environment.
<Q - Jason Feldman>: Okay. I guess another way I guess I was thinking about it is y you've distinguished, I think very
appropriately, between the growth investments that you haven't cut back on. In fact, I think last quarter you talked
about accelerating them – I think it was $30 million to $50 million for the year – as distinct from these discretionary
cost controls. And so I guess the other way is, assuming that you continue to invest in growth whether times are good
or times are bad, is there additional non-growth areas where there's still opportunities for incremental cost cuts?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, as I said earlier, we are well-known for innovation, but we're equally good at continuous
improvement and make sure that we constantly look for operational excellence and functional excellence. And I think
that's what is driving us the whole time. So I think it's an important element to make sure that we, and you, know that
we are driving productivity in all functions, specifically in the back office. So that's an opportunity for us.
But we are not backing off relative to investment for growth in the front, and I think that's a very, very important
distinction to make. And again, it's not the same cut for every business. It's based on some opportunities where you can
see it as short-term, mid-term growth opportunities for some businesses. Like in this time for health care and consumer
and office, we let them grow in a different level than some other businesses that have a tougher economical
environment at the moment, like electronics.
<A - David W. Meline>: And if I could just add one other perspective on that, we talked – Inge talked now about, I
think, $60 million – $70 million that we've directed toward some form of consolidation and restructuring through the
first half, which is, quite honestly, very typical of the business, which we're constantly working on productivity, we're
constantly looking at how we can improve and be competitive. And eventually, hopefully sooner than later, the benefits
of, if you will, those investments in terms of getting the business rightsized or in the right kind of posture, reaps
rewards for the company. And that's something that we've been doing continuing basis. So I think it's all within the
same theme. Obviously, in times like these, you have an extra sharp focus on the area, but it's something that the
company's always doing.

<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So – yeah, so obviously we're very pleased with the way the businesses running. If you
look at the quarter, it's a continuation of a story that we've seen for some time now, which is not only very strong
margin performance, but also if you look at the growth of the business, quite solid and very broad-based, so we're
pleased with the way health care is running right now. Why is that the case? Well, we're seeing growth in all of our
divisions. The factories are running as well as we've ever seen them run. Health care, like our other businesses,
obviously, have a close eye on cost. And so in terms of the margins, as I look out, I think it's realistic to expect that
we'll probably run in the 30%-plus range here for a period of time into the future, certainly if I look at 2012 in total.
And also we expect to see that in combination with some continuing steady growth.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Let me make an additional comment here. First of all, we have a very strong and diverse health
care portfolio. And if you looked upon the growth rate, emerging markets now grew 16% as of late, and the investment
we have done there start to pay off due to the fact that the portfolio there is becoming more relevant for those countries.
So I think it's important that we are targeting good growth and strong margins in this business, and they are delivering.
And as David said, there's many elements there in terms of mix of portfolio, the efficiency in manufacturing, the
go-to-market capabilities. But we are still doing those investments, as we have talked about on other calls. But based on
the business model there, I think for the foreseeable future, we should see low-30s as more likely the margins for us,
which is very good.

<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Sorry, was that last question about the health care margin?

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, that was the health care, yeah.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, great, so I won't – I'll just go back to the transcript, but sorry if I missed it. The price/cost,
so on the pricing side, jut quarter-by-quarter, does that step down gradually over the next couple quarters, to going like
basically flat in the fourth quarter? Or how is that – price was up 2% in the fourth quarter; it stepped up a little bit. So is
that how we should think about it? Will it be another big quarter in the third quarter, and then step down? Maybe you
could just give us some visibility around the comps.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, Steve, so we're looking for around 1% for the year, and it does imply a step-down. I
would treat it as we think it will be a step-by-step move.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then the raws, will they be negative in the second half, or similarly?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, so we ran about flat in the second quarter, which was certainly an improvement from
the first. We think we'll be flat for the year, so that would imply slightly negative in the second half.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Gotcha. And then one last question; we're looking at it year-over-year, obviously very strong
improvement, but I guess sequentially as well, your profit was up $95 million; your revenue was up, I guess, $50
million sequentially. Was there something that kind of dropped out of the first quarter into the second quarter? Was that
FOREX? Maybe you could just give a little bit of color around the sequential bridge.

<A - David W. Meline>: Steve, one thing that changes Q2 versus Q1 is we front-end-load our stock options expense.
We grant options in the first quarter of the year, so our options expense is the highest in Q1, and that's typically about a
$50 million sequential change Q2 versus Q1. But if I look at -
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And that's happened in prior years? Because last year you had -
<A - David W. Meline>: Yes, it did. Yes, it has.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, because in the last two years, you've had more like a 50% incremental instead of 200%
incremental.
<A - David W. Meline>: Right. Yeah, I was just going to say, on your revenue question, if you look back at the way
we set out the year, we expected the first half to be as it's been, which is basically pretty flat to the second half of last
year. It's turned out to be the case. Certainly, second quarter was negatively impacted on a revenue basis by exchange
more than the first quarter. But it's very much in line with the first half/second half type of a situation, where the first
half would be most modest, and some level of recovery in the second half, but obviously, still something that's quite
contained.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, so how much more positive was price/cost in the second quarter versus the first quarter?
<A - David W. Meline>: I'll have to follow up, Steve, on that. I'm not sure off the top of my head.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the info.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yep. Thank you.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: I just want to pick up on the price/cost, sorry to keep on beating this thing to death. So you've got 50
bps good news on price versus your prior expectation. You've got, sounds like about at least 0.5 point on inflation. I'm
just wondering why the 50 bps low-end raise to the margin levels. It seems that you should be – are you more of a
buyer towards the high end of your 50 bps to 1.5-point margins target? It just seems that if you just put those [ph]
through to [indiscernible] (1:03:24), 0.5 point seems very achievable.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, so if you look at the margin plan that we've got in place, what we set out for ourselves
this year was to achieve a 1% year-over-year margin increase, which we ran at just slightly short of 21% last year. The
midpoint now of the margin guidance for the year is 22%, so I think it reflects correctly our continuing level of
confidence that we had that we'd deliver on that plan. If you also consider other factors that would be impacting
margins in the second half, you certainly have things like the Avery acquisition, which is not yet in there, so that would
have some possible impact. And then, secondly, we still have a range of growth that varies several points, and that
could impact margins. So we think it's a reasonable outlook. What's also true for us is first half and second half, your
margin trend, you normally have a weaker second half in margins, specifically in the fourth quarter, which is also being
reflected in the way we're guiding right now.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And if I can just ask it a slightly different way, if sales come in towards lower in your range,
which seems at this point to be more likely, can you still make the high end of your margin range, given the price in
raw material good news?

<A - David W. Meline>: Boy, that's a -
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Ex -Avery Dennison?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, that's a hard one, Nigel, to exactly connect those dots as to what the other elements of
the equation will give us in terms of things like raw material cost and how it flows through, so I would tell you I
couldn't give you a straight answer on that.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And if I could just follow up, it looks like you're taking about a point out of your volume
expectations for the full year. How does that look by segment?
<A - David W. Meline>: Repeat that, please?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, so there's the one point of lower volume for the full year. How does that look by segment? So
are we losing two -?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yep, got it. What I'd say is, if you look at – and again, we gave some full-year segment
guidance in December and also full-year guidance in terms of the regional split for the growth. The way it looks right
now is that we're still foreseeing us being very much in those ranges by six business sector for the year. The fact is, is
by trimming the top end, it's more likely you'll have more of them sort of in the middle than perhaps some being at the
top of their range, which was a scenario that we had as we entered into the year. So I think from a planning perspective,
you should think about those ranges still being good on a business sector basis.
And then, quite honestly, on a geographic basis, the scenario in which the top of that original guidance would have
occurred for 3M would have involved, quite honestly, a stronger Asian performance, which is not materializing. So if
you wanted to articulate those ranges by region, we still don't see the ranges being – we still see them as being good
geographically, but if you want to identify the differentiating factor, that's what I would say.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yep.

And our last question comes from the line of Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Thanks. Inge, I'm wondering if you might shed a little more light on how your thinking on
capital allocation is evolving, and maybe describe a little bit how the M&A pipeline looks at this point.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, we have started to work on the plan for next year, so we are just in the middle of that,
right? And as you know, I think capital allocation is an important element for us in order to make sure we prioritize the
right businesses as we move ahead. So we are just in the middle of that, and I hope we can share more with you in
November, as we meet again. In terms of the pipeline for merger and acquisitions, it's solid. I would say, as we have a
bottom-up process there, we have still, business by business, very solid pipeline, and we take a look upon them one by
one as they are moving forward. As you saw, we announced one this last quarter. We have made a commitment to one
earlier in the year. So it's still robust, and it's part of our growth strategy as a tactic as we move ahead.
So [audio gap] first of all (1:08:14), organic growth for us, complemented with acquisitions, but the pipeline is healthy
and improving, and we are now prioritizing it day by day, I would say, in order really to understand how it will fit in
strategically for the company as we move ahead. And the target we have given out earlier in terms of spending, we're
standing behind that.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, if I could add, on capital allocation, at least as it relates to the current year, again, go
back to the fact that we're tracking very much to the plan we laid out for the year from an operating perspective. If you
look at kind of the big goalposts that we've got on how we allocate capital in the year, we said $1.3 billion to $1.5

billion on CapEx. We still think that's a good range. We said $2 billion to $2.5 billion on buyback gross. I think we've
done here in the first half about half of that, so I don't see any reason right now to say that there's a dramatic change in
our view there, but obviously we need to be cognizant of intrinsic value of our shares in the market.
And then we pre-funded – as I mentioned, we pre-funded some debt maturities that are coming up later this year and
into 2013, so that was an action we took. And we've got the M&A guidance out there of $1 billion to $2 billion. The
announced transactions would indicate deployment of slightly less than the bottom end of the range in the first half. But
I think $1 billion to $2 billion is still, from a planning perspective, a good range, recognizing we can never precisely
plan size and timing of those things.
<Q - Terry Darling>: And appreciating that the update in November is forthcoming, I'm wondering, though, if you
can, Inge, just put any light on what's any of the sort of debate that you're having with regards to how the plan going
forward could shift at all relative to where it's been in the past, and perhaps specifically within the M&A realm,
whether larger acquisitions is something that you're considering in that mix.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, as we have talked earlier, I don't think it's larger by definition. I think it's a prioritization,
where we have to make sure that we connect them strategically into some of the very important businesses that is
coming out from the prioritization process, and then we are, in fact, making a step up relative to integration, and make
sure we can do that faster and more professionally as we move ahead. It's an ongoing process, as you know, when you
look upon your business and evaluate the opportunity based on your base, and that is what we're in the middle of
talking about as we speak.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. And then just lastly, David, I wonder, on the improved outlook on raw materials, other
than steel and copper, which is obviously pretty visible to most of us out here or all of us out here, what other key raw
materials are driving that lower inflation outlook. And to what degree are some of those raw materials derivatives of
U.S. natural gas, and perhaps you've got a longer tail to the benefit of that reduced inflation as we think about, again,
this ongoing question of sustainability of margins into 2013?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. Yeah, if you look at our key raw material inputs, there's certainly a portion of those that
are pegged to the price of oil and natural gas now. You get into this issue of the amount of these derivatives that are
coming out of cracking slates, whether they be oil versus natural gas. But the answer is, polypropylene-based products,
which feature as inputs to a number of our products, we're seeing softer pricing there at the moment. Certainly, we've
seen price trends improve on things like paperboard, which is an important input to our products. And in some of those
areas, we also see capacities reacting to, put a floor on pricing. Certainly, our experience has been, as demand improves
and as the outlook for economic activity improves, we'd be naïve if we thought that prices would stay down. So I think
it's going to continue to trend up and down as the market outlook changes.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Thanks, Terry.
