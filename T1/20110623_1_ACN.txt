MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Accenture's Third Quarter Fiscal 2011 Earnings
Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over
to your host, KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
KC McClure
Thank you, Rochelle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2011 earnings
announcement. As Rochelle just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today
are Pierre Nanterme, our Chief Executive Officer, and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and the balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third
quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning and progress against our growth strategy. Pam
will then provide our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 201,1 and then we will take your
questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements, or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking, and you should keep in mind that these
forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to

differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not
limited to, general economic conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the Risk
Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news
release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com.
As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me
turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm very pleased to tell you about our excellent third quarter
results which demonstrate this true momentum we have seen our business. Here are a few highlights. We generated
outstanding new bookings of $7.1 billion. Our highest in 11 quarters. Consulting bookings were $3.7 billion, and
outsourcing bookings were $3.4 billion. We grew revenues 15% in local currency, to more than $6.7 billion, our
highest quarterly revenues ever.
Earnings per share were $0.93, also a quarterly record. This represents an increase of $0.20, or 27%, over Q3 last year.
We grew quarterly income 18% to $949 million, and delivered operating margin of 14.1%.
We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, with a cash balance of $5.3 billion. And we continued to return cash
to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend.
We are particularly pleased that our growth is broad-based across industries, growth platforms, and geographies, both
mature and emerging. And given our strong year-to-date performance, we have raised our outlook for revenues, EPS,
and cash flow for the full fiscal year.
Now, I will turn the call over to Pam who will provide more detail on the numbers.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for listening today. I am pleased to tell you more about Accenture's fiscal
year 2011 third quarter financial results. We delivered very strong quarterly revenues, hitting a new record. In fact,
each of our five operating groups hit a new quarterly high, driven by, as Pierre just said, broad-based demand. We also
achieved record high EPS results for the quarter as we continue to drive and sustain profitable growth.
Now let's get to the numbers. Unless I state otherwise, all figures are U.S. GAAP except the items that are not part of
the financial statements or that are calculations. New bookings for the quarter were $7.1 billion, and reflect a positive
6% foreign exchange impact compared with new bookings in the third quarter last year. Consulting bookings were $3.7
billion, and outsourcing bookings were $3.4 billion.
Let me give you some details, first, in consulting. In management consulting, clients are hiring us to help them target
and action opportunities to deliver value in their operations, to reduce their cost, to grow their top lines through sales
and services differentiation, to implement improved compliance in risk management, and to integrate operations they
acquire.
In technology consulting, our unique position in the technology ecosystem continues to serve us well. Clients value our
independence and track record. We are helping our clients to rationalize their infrastructures through virtualization and
consolidation, and to build IT strategies for transformation and streamlining of their global operations.
System integration bookings continue to reflect strong demand for ERP, particularly to support global expansion and to
extend ERP for data management and analytics. We saw an uptick in bookings for application modernization, both

replatforming and replacement. Client focus is also increasing around web development and new technologies to
support growing wireless services demand. In addition, software as a service demand is building in key functions such
as sales management and ERP.
Turning to outsourcing. In technology outsourcing, demand remains strong as clients continue to be focused on
reducing the costs of their legacy systems. At many of our clients, we are being asked to do more in enhancements and
add-on work. Also, some clients are now integrating newer mobile technologies and upgrading their networks and data
centers.
Finally, BPO bookings in Q3 reflect continued demand for both our horizontal offerings, especially finance and
accounting and procurement, and for our industry-specific solutions, particularly health.
Now, turning to revenue. Net revenues for the third quarter were $6.7 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and
15% in local currency over the same period last year. These revenues reflected a foreign exchange impact of positive
6% compared with Q3 last year. These revenues were above our guided range of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion, a range
that had assumed a foreign exchange impact of positive 4%. Adjusting for actual exchange rates, we are $120 million
higher than the top end of the range we provided in March. This was partly driven by Japan results that were better than
we expected then.
There was strong double-digit revenue growth and record high quarterly revenues across many dimensions of our
business. Record consulting revenues were $3.97 billion, an increase of 23% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency.
Record outsourcing revenues were $2.75 billion, an increase of 17% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency.
I'll take you through some details by operating group. Resources revenues grew 22% in local currency and were
dominated by very significant growth in consulting. Consulting growth continues to be led by demand for ERP
programs in many parts of the globe. Outsourcing revenues continue to be driven by operational effectiveness in IT and
financial business processes.
In financial services, revenues grew 19% in local currency and reflected strength in both consulting and outsourcing.
Our clients are continuing to invest in replacing their core systems and are also generating continued demand for
post-merger integration, operational effectiveness, risk and regulatory services, and global operating models.
Communications and high tech revenues increased 16% in local currency and reflected balanced consulting and
outsourcing growth around the world. Consulting demand continues to be driven by a focus on operational
improvements, improving customer service, and supporting new products and services through provisioning platforms.
Strong outsourcing revenue growth reflected clients continued focus on improving their operations, particularly in
supply chain procurement and finance.
The products operating group had local currency revenue growth of 14% that was driven by very strong and
well-balanced growth across the products industries in consulting. ERP and infrastructure offerings provided the
foundation of the growth, which also reflected demand for operational effectiveness, supply chain, NCLs, and customer
solutions.
Finally, health and public services revenues increased 3%, driven by health, where we continue to experience very
strong demand for our health offerings, including connected health and electronic medical records.
Public service revenues declined due to continued budget pressure and economic uncertainty, particularly in U.S. state
and local and several countries in EMEA and the Americas. Modest growth continued in U.S. federal. We expect
public service to remain challenged. Our repositioning of the public service business continues and will continue over
the medium term.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 34.4%, compared with 34.7% for the same period last year,
reflecting a 30 basis point decrease. Our contract profitability improved during the quarter as we made strides in
improving pricing and resource mix on our contracts. Sales and marketing expense was $832 million, or 12.4% of net
revenues, compared with $714 million, or 12.8% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, a decrease of 40 basis
points.

General and administrative expense was $527 million, or 7.8% of net revenues, compared with $410 million, or 7.4%
of net revenues, for the third quarter last year. Included in G&A for this quarter was a provision for litigation matters in
the amount of $75 million, which had a negative impact of 110 basis points, offset by management of other G&A cost
at a growth rate lower than revenues, for an impact of positive 70 basis points. We booked the provision as part of our
ongoing process of assessing litigation matters and making adjustments when appropriate.
Operating income was $949 million, reflecting a 14.1% operating margin. This compares with $804 million, or 14.4%
operating margin in the third quarter last year, a decrease of 30 basis points.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%, compared with 29.8% for the third quarter last year. This difference was
primarily due to pay number of factors that impacted geographic mix of income, partially offset by a net increase in
reserves related to ongoing tax audits.
Net income was $699 million for the third quarter, an increase of 24% over the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings
per share for the quarter were a record $0.93, an increase of 27%, compared with $0.73 in the third quarter last year.
The $0.20 increase is made up of $0.08 from higher revenue and operating results in local currency, $0.04 from a lower
effective tax rate, $0.04 from favorable foreign exchange rates, $0.03 from a lower share count, and $0.01 from higher
non-operating income.
Now, let's turn to some key parts of our cash flow and balance sheet. Free cash flow for the quarter was a record $1.24
billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.35 billion, net of property and equipment additions
of $113 million. Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding were 32 days, consistent with 32 days in the second
quarter and up from 30 days at the end of last fiscal year. Our total cash balance at May 31 was $5.3 billion, versus $4.8
billion at the end of August.
Now turning to some key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with global head count of more than 223,000
people, with close to 130,000 people in our global delivery network. In Q3, our utilization was 85%. Attrition, which
excludes involuntary terminations, was 15%, compared with 14% in Q2. Lastly, we are on track to hire at least 66,000
people around the world this year.
Before I turn things back to Pierre, I will comment on our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through
share repurchases and dividends. On May 13, 2011, we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal '11 in
the amount of $0.45 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to $644 million. Also in the third
quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 11.4 million shares for $644 million at an average price of $56.40
per share, and are on track to deliver the 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding this fiscal year.
Year-to-date, we have purchased 29.7 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion and $48.57 per share. At May 31,
we had approximately $1.7 billion of share purchase authority remaining.
To sum up, our strong results in the third quarter of fiscal '11 are evidence of our consistent ability to drive profitable
growth across the dimensions of our business and notably in technology-related services. As fiscal '11 draws to a close,
we remain focused on positioning the business for continued profitable growth in the future.
Now let me turn the call back to Pierre to give you an update on some key aspects of our growth strategy.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, Pam. Clearly our excellent results in Q3 show that we are leveraging marketplace opportunities and
executing our growth strategy with great discipline. Our focus remains on superior execution, driving sustainable and
profitable growth through technology leadership and industry differentiation, and delivering value to our clients and
shareholders. We continue to bring the best of Accenture to our clients, growing both the number and depth of those
relationships. We are the partner of choice for the world's leading companies, helping them with their most complex
mission critical issues. We are supporting our clients in every major geographic market in which they operate,
including our ten priority emerging markets which together grew at a significantly higher rate in Q3 than Accenture

overall.
We are expanding our technology leadership through our new initiatives, leveraging our unique position as a leading
partner for preeminent technology companies. In mobility, we just announced a major agreement with Nokia to their
support their strategy to transition to the Windows phone. This agreement will greatly enhance the scale of our mobility
practice through the addition of highly skilled technologists who complement our existing mobility resources and
capabilities. In analytics, we opened new innovation centers in Dublin and Barcelona to develop assets and solutions.
These new centers combined with our analytics capabilities in Milan, Delhi, and Mumbai, form the core of a growing
global network of analytics innovation centers.
In cloud, we are developing a leadership position in implementing software as a service solutions, helping our clients
with everything from creating their cloud strategies to implement public and private clouds.
We are investing in our industry expertise, which continues to be a key differentiator for Accenture. We have an
unmatched depth of industry skills, with more than 100,000 people in our operating groups and growth platforms
aligned with specific industries. To accelerate the execution of our growth strategy, we have prioritized our investments
around specific industries where we see opportunities for even greater return. One of these is health, where this year,
we have made great progress in accelerating growth through our differentiated assets and offerings.
Finally, we continue to run Accenture as a high performance business. As a result, we've been able to deliver strong
financial performance and grow market share in virtually every segment of our business.
Before I hand over to Pam, I would like to comment on the macroeconomic environment. Clearly there is still volatility
and uncertainty in the marketplace, as governments, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, deal with the challenges of
deficits and debt. However, we also know that the global economy is focused to grow in the range of 4% this year, and
the Global 2000, our clients, are accelerating their investments to compete on the global stage. They are dealing with
the challenges of globalization, increased regulation, and the need for operational efficiency. Transformation continues
to be an imperative for our clients, and this is driving demand for our services.
Now, let me turn the call back to Pam who will provide our business outlook.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre. This business outlook for fiscal year 2011 includes fourth quarter revenues and our final view on the
year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, or local currency
growth of 10% to 14%, reflecting some moderation in the year-over-year growth rate, as we had expected. This range
assumes a foreign exchange uplift of 8% for the quarter that is based on the rates over the last couple of weeks.
Turning to the full fiscal year, we are now assuming a foreign exchange impact of positive 3% for the full fiscal year,
which has trended up from the positive 2% assumption we provided last quarter.
Based on our year-to-date results of 16% revenue growth in local currency and the outlook just provided for Q4, we
now expect our fiscal '11 revenue to be in the range of 14% to 15% growth in local currency.
Turning to bookings. After three quarters, we have over $20 billion in bookings year-to-date. We now expect new
bookings for the fiscal year to land at the upper end of our previously-guided range of $25 billion to $28 billion.
Turning to operating margin, we are at 13.5% year-to-date. We do expect year-over-year operating margin expansion in
the fourth quarter. We continue to expect operating margin for the full fiscal year to be in the range of 13.6% to 13.7%.
We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%, a reduction of 1% from our
previously-guided range.
We now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.36 to $3.40. This increased range reflects U.S. dollar growth
of 26% to 28% year-over-year, and includes our latest, more positive assumptions on revenue, foreign exchange, and

the annual effective tax rate.
Finally, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion, with property and
equipment additions now expected to be $400 million, and free cash flow in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion.
This represents a $100 million lift in our cash flow outlook.
At our Investor and Analyst Day on April 14, I provided a preliminary view into our fiscal '12 targets for revenue
growth in local currency, the growth rate of our earnings per share in U.S. dollars, and cash to be returned to
shareholders. These targets, including annual revenue growth of 7% to 10% in local currency, continue to be our
preliminary view at this point. Our business is expanding, and we could expect it to continue to, albeit at a lower rate of
growth going forward. I will provide our full business outlook for fiscal '12, including any impact of updated currency
assumptions, when we do our Q4 earnings call at the end of September.
In summary, we are pleased with how well growth has returned to our business this fiscal year, particularly in the four
commercial operating groups, as well as in the health part of health and public service. Of course, we are vigilant, and
prepared to navigate the economic volatility and uncertainty in markets around the world. We believe we are well
positioned to drive profitable growth based on our commit to industry differentiation and technology leadership and our
proven ability to manage our global business at scale.
KC, let's take some questions.
KC McClure
Thanks, Pam. I would ask that you each keep your questions limited to one question and one follow-up to allow as
many participants as possible to ask questions. Rochelle, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hi, thanks so much. Hey, Pam. I – great quarter. Couple questions. First, just on the – I guess
the guidance obviously you gave for the fourth quarter, 10% to 14% is pretty strong, better than we expected, despite a
tough comp. I mean, given this run-rate, I'm curious, should we be changing our thinking on the 7% to 10% in fiscal '12
at all? I know you're not going to give us guidance, but just at a high level, given the high run-rate, but also the tough
comp that it creates, just trying to rethink about recasting that fiscal '12 number. Any comments?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Tien – well, no. I mean, as I just said, 7% to 10% is where we see it at this point, and we have
taken into account that the year is coming out a little stronger.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Got it. The – yeah, figured I'd ask, just given that the strength is definitely there. My
follow-up is I guess on the consulting side. Obviously the revenue number there was quite good. But the book-to-bill
actually came in a little bit lower than we expected, and it looks like below recent trends. Anything to read into [ph]
them on that, (26:17) Pam?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: No, and I think I may have even mentioned last quarter that we were expecting that this
quarter in consulting. And the bookings last quarter $3.8 billion, this quarter $3.7 billion, but our consulting business is
– does continue to expand, and we expect it to tick back up next quarter.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Got it. Yeah, because it looks like, just based on your bookings guidance, it implies a pretty
big booking number for the quarter. So anything chunky in there that is already booked [ph] that is (26:54) worth
calling out?

<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, we announced a deal that – this week with Nokia, and I'm not going to tell you the size
of it, but it is one of those ones that's over $100 million.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: All right. Great. Good stuff. Appreciate it.
Operator
Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: All right, guys. Great to see the revenues continuing to come through. A question on the
bookings front. Were your May quarter bookings affected by any year-to-year change in duration, or are there other
factors causing your recent bookings to convert into revenues at a faster rate than what is normal?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: It's interesting, Rod. We did see the bookings convert quickly to revenue, maybe a little bit
more than we expected, which I think makes up for the other part of why the revenues came in a little higher than we –
even more over the top end of the range. So – but there's nothing else, to your – to the first part of your question, that
we see in there.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Okay. Well, I mean, at this stage of the cycle, it would seem natural that you would be seeing
somewhat of a shift from the high end consulting business where you're helping clients plan things, more into the
systems integration business where you're helping clients implement things. Is that sort of a transition that's now
occurring that's affected the near-term bookings, but then as the year wears on and systems integration and the
implementation work picks up, does that – is that sort of why you signaled that bookings, I think even in consulting
next quarter, should be stronger? Is there a transition happening along those lines, or is there some other factor that
causes bookings to improve as you move into next quarter on a year-over-year growth basis?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: It was really just about the pipeline and how we saw the stuff coming through. I think in
management consulting and technology consulting this year, we've been running really, really hot, and so it just sort of
kind of a catching-up piece that's happening here. But we continue to see strong demand across all three parts of our
consulting business.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Okay. And then on – just a real quick clarification on the margin front. I'm assuming your
guidance for operating margin, which is you're guiding to slight expansion for the year, that's after including the impact
of this litigation reserve that you took in the recent quarter?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Okay. So that's a true GAAP operating margin expansion number?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes, it is.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: All right, perfect. Thanks, guys.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you, Rod.
Operator
Julio Quintero, Goldman Sachs.

<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Well, I'm going to get -
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: This one's for you, Pierre.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: I was going to get to you, too, Pierre. On the revenue productivity, maybe we'll just talk
with Pierre on this one, because actually, it's probably more directed at you. The revenue productivity per head, looks
like it's actually up a little bit, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. I'm trying to get a sense very directly about
what this means in terms of pricing, or is this more mix shift as you kind of think about global delivery versus
consulting, maybe you're seeing more consulting work. Can you talk a little bit about the environment for pricing and
maybe what's driving some of the benefits to the revenue per – revenue productivity on a kind of a per head count
basis?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, to comment on our productivity, indeed, from a pricing standpoint, as we mentioned
probably in the prior quarter but we confirmed that in this quarter as well, we definitely see stabilization when it comes
to the pricing, and even some potential uplift in some part of our business. But definitely, it's moving in the right
direction.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Got it. Okay. And then on the head count plan for the year, I believe the 66,000, that's up a
little bit from the previous number that you had. I think it was 64,000 before, if I'm not mistaken, for gross heads? Is
that -
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: That's right, Julio.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Okay. And then, is there a sense on where that mix is going? It looks like a big part of the
head count addition is still very overweight via the global delivery model. Should we think about that as still kind of the
plan here relative to sort of building out the SI capabilities on the offshore side, or is there something – maybe
something different to be thinking about there?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: It – go ahead.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, I think the answer is, indeed. I mean, we continue to grow our people in our global
delivery network, and we will continue to do so next year as well. Now that being said, given the nature of the demand
we are facing and the nature of the work as well, we continue to hire people on – more on onshore and country basis.
So it's a mix of both. But clearly, we continue to hire very significantly in our global delivery network.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Great. Okay, guys, thank you. I'll yield the floor. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Jamie E. Friedman>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Jamie.
<Q - Jamie E. Friedman>: So you're lifting the free cash flow by about $100 million just in the near term. I know the
board meets this summer to discuss – I was wondering if you could talk at least philosophically about what to do with
the $5.3 billion in cash when you're balancing the consideration between the repurchase, as the stock is – continues to
rally, versus the dividend? Yeah, if you could talk between the repurchase and the dividend? Thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Sure. And as you correctly stated, we will be meeting with the board next month and doing
our planning for fiscal year '12, where we will indeed plan both of those pieces and look at the allocation between both
of them. So it would be premature for me at this point to signal anything there. We're certainly well aware that we do

have this cash balance. We do believe it's a nice problem to have, and we will continue to look for tactical tuck-in
acquisitions to use that cash as well.
<Q - Jamie E. Friedman>: Okay. And then maybe if I could just follow up, Pierre, on the operating side. Look, these
numbers were tremendous. It's just human analytical nature to focus on the one – how bid – how bad is the public
service sector? Because you don't – you're not – don't decompose that between healthcare, and so I – how bad is that?
And is there – is it going to get worse in fiscal '12?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Well, it's declining is not that bad. It's, like you said, moving in the right direction, given the
overall environment we probably all know what's happening with the government, especially in some specific regions,
and I think about U.S., some part of Europe, and even some part of Latin America, is raising some question around
their further investment. Now that being said, we are repositioning that practice with our public sector leadership to
make sure that we – we're going to capture the opportunity for growth moving forward. And specially we doing that in
three areas, all going to be related to the human services, specially all around the welfare benefits and pension which
going to be a growing market moving forward. All this related to operational management, all the finance and HR
operation. But as well, we see some good opportunities in all the defense and public safety, especially around border
protection and other activities. So we see some future areas for growth and we are repositioning our practice to take
those opportunities in the coming months.
<Q - Jamie E. Friedman>: That's a great answer. Thank you very much.

Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Hi, guys. Congratulations to a very good quarter.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you, Ashwin.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Yes, Pam, my first question is the CapEx of $400 million, modestly lower than what you
expected earlier, even though you see pretty good outsourcing bookings here the last couple of quarters. Can you
comment on some of the things you might be doing around capital efficiency and what should we expect going
forward?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, that was really just a tweak, and most of that capital does indeed go into building out
our global delivery network. And, again, that's where most of that goes, and has gone, and will go.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Okay. And Pierre, you had a comment there about the top ten emerging markets growing
much faster than the core. I guess that's why they're emerging, but how big are they put all together? And what changes
should investors expect in either operating or financial metrics as that becomes an increasingly material part of the
business?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, thanks for the question, and indeed, in the IA Day, I think we mentioned that those ten
markets put together represent in the range of $3 billion in Accenture revenues, to give you a sense of what that is. And
our objective is to move from $3 billion to $6 billion in the next horizon of 2015.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Okay. And the second part of that question, if you could, what changes should investors
expect in either operating or financial metrics? That becomes, the $6 billion, is a pretty big number. That's very good
growth in four years.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I think – I mean, we've – as you know, philosophically, our objectives in terms of revenue for
Accenture overall are to grow ahead of the market. And then in operating margin, balancing all the puts and takes and
everything that goes in there, including investments which we will make in these emerging markets, is to strive for

<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Okay. If I can squeeze in a housekeeping. The highest share count, even though you did a
big repurchase of 11 million shares, can you explain what's going on?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah. What happened there was we actually didn't go into the market until after our IA Day
on April 14. So the repurchases that we made this quarter were very weighted to the end of the quarter, and so that just
– the way that calculation is done, it looks that way, but you'll see it go down next quarter.

Nathan Rozof, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The one thing I wanted to delve into here, just to kind of
focus back on demand. In particular, when you guys were going through the drivers of growth on the operating group
level, you kept referring [audio gap] (37:53) ERP as being one of the primary drivers, and I think that might surprise
some folks, just given the kind of lingering concerns about the macro environment, just since ERP projects tend to be
larger and more complex. So I was wondering if you could give us any color on the client behavior that's driving those
investments in particular? And are you seeing similarly strong demand from ERP in your bookings as well as revenues?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, so to understand what's happening in term of drivers, we – I mean first, we working
with all those large company belonging to the G2000. So you need to figure out what their needs are. And indeed, they
are facing a huge transformation when it comes to globalization. They made acquisition they need to integrate now.
They need as well to significantly improve their operational efficiency in order to compete in [ph] that new world.
(38:47) So indeed, they need to rationalize their operation, and one way to do it is through ERPs. And when we talk
about ERPs as well, they all developing new features, if you will, especially around mobility and analytics. So it's a
natural extension of the ERP implementation we are doing, but you need to put that in the context of acquisitions and
globalization. There's a need for them to better run their operation with more efficiency.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Okay. Thanks for that, Pierre. And then I just wanted to follow up with you on your strategy of
expanding the business and Accenture's footprint more into developing countries. I just wanted to follow up and see,
one, can you give us any update on the regions that you've highlighted before that may or may not be growing as – the
fastest. As well as, are you seeing any impact from buyers in those countries as it would relate to concerns about
contagion from macro concerns in the developing world?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, when you look at this and in our ten countries, I mean, you will find the usual suspect
of the break, and you would have – you would add South Korea, you would have Mexico, Turkey, Middle East, South
Africa, and you get into the kind of ten core emerging markets, and we want to have a footprint in each and every
continent as well, which is very important for us. They growing faster than the average of Accenture. We want to be in
those economies because indeed, they're growing as well – faster than the more mature markets, and today, we are very
pleased with our progress so far.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Thanks so much.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Do you have another question?
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Nope, that's good. Thank you very much.

Arvind Ramnani, UBS.
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: I think [indiscernible] (40:34) my question. Hi. A couple of quarters back, you talked
about your transformational type concerning deals being funded in a more piecemeal fashion. Has there been any
change in the dynamic, given sort of the macro scenario?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Not really, Arvind. I mean they – I think that funding them in sort of more – smaller chunks
more carefully is indeed the trend, and we see that continuing. And we do see transformation projects indeed
continuing.
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: Great, great. And is any notable change in the duration of your consulting bookings?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: No, there really isn't at this point. We looked at that, and it was roughly stable.

David Grossman, Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - David Grossman>: Thank you. Yes, you've had great results, and your business is frequently viewed as
late-cycle. However, given this backdrop of concerns about economic growth slowing, can you help us understand how
we should think about the risks or the buffers that are already incorporated in your 2012 guidance in a slowing
environment?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, I think – I mean, as you know, I think we really try to be as thoughtful as we can about
that. And one of the things that's just clearly the case – and certainly we all recognize how much uncertainty and
volatility there is out there – but as Pierre mentioned earlier, I mean, we work with the Global 2000, and all of them are
focused on very strategic agendas when it comes to globalization, all the new regulation that's going in, the need to
innovate, the need to compete on the global stage. And so we see – I mean, all of this planning is done very bottom-up,
top-down, sort of every which way, based on the kinds of things we do, the kinds of offerings we have and the kinds of
needs of these clients.
So we do our best to take all that into account, and also recognize that demand patterns do change. For example, in
Japan, there will be different things that our clients there will need, both the public sector, as well as their commercial
clients. So part of that is anticipating that, being proactive about that, and then being positioned for that.
<Q - David Grossman>: Got it, thanks. That's actually very helpful. One other [ph] cat (43:13) is on global delivery,
and the proliferation of global delivery has had a fairly prolific impact on the delivery of professional services in
developed countries over the past several years. Perhaps you can share with us your view of how global delivery is
evolving within those markets, and contrast it to the role global delivery will play in the emerging markets, given how
important those are becoming?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, I mean, global delivery network for us is where we are delivering, is our industrial
strength, it's all about the manufacturing of the technology of Accenture, if you will, and it's going to remain extremely
important. We want, in our delivery network, to move to the next level of operational efficiency. We want to drive
more and more end-to-end programs, we want to develop skills around very specific assets and solution, or around very
specific technology, such as the mobility and the cloud, or even the analytics, as I mentioned, with Mumbai and the
Delhi delivery centers. So that's playing a big role in supporting our expansion into mature market. But as well, when
you look at the more emerging markets, we are leveraging our global delivery network, because for us, as you know, it
is in multiple countries. So it's not only India, but as we said, the Philippine. We have as well the global delivery
network in Latin America, in Brazil, in Argentina, as as well in China. So this is the way we see the global delivery
network in the way to support mature and emerging markets.

Dave Koning, Baird.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Yeah, hey guys, thanks. In EMEA, you had one of the strongest Q3s ever, I think the
strongest Q3 ever sequentially in terms of revenue growth. And I would imagine, I know some of that's
currency-related, but regardless, very strong. And I'm just wondering, any change in tone out of Europe later in Q3 or
into June, or has that growth maintained a very strong pace?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I think so far, we see a strong demand in Europe. A double-digit growth, when you look at
the result we have delivered. We do not see any dramatic change in the buying pattern over there. Again, we working
mainly with the large multinationals in Europe, and many of those companies are of course operating outside Europe as
well, and we are supporting them, yes indeed from Europe, but in many of their programs which are much more global.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, and it was – there was very strong growth in consulting, and interestingly, nearly every
country posted up-growth.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Great. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, BPO, you mentioned bookings were also strong
in the quarter. Some of the pure-play Indian BPO terms talk of – or firms talk about strong pipelines, but they've had
longer sales cycles, and I'm just wondering – I'm sure your pipeline's also strong. I'm just wondering, has there been
any change in I guess sales cycle shortening now and getting deals signed?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I think that trend of longer sales cycles, we have seen a bit of that as well, and it doesn't
particularly concern us. I think, from the standpoint of, we're confident about how those bookings will come on, but we
have seen a little lengthening there.

Darrin Peller, Barclays.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Hi, thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Darrin.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Hi guys. Pierre, just first, on the big picture. I mean, can you help us understand – we saw
very, very strong growth again in financial services and in products and some other areas. Seems like there's some
underlying drivers that some might argue are less sensitive to the macroeconomic picture than others. Could you just
talk about the other drivers that should theoretically continue to support growth, regardless of sort of the macro picture
and how it plays out, given how uncertainty things are at the moment, into next year. Is there enough power in these
drivers to support growth, even mild growth, if there was a scenario where the economy continued – turned down?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, and we'd see, as a minimum, four main drivers, just coming in my mind as we speak. I
mean, the first one is the power of globalization. I mean, despite all what we could hear on protectionism, we believe
that globalization will continue and is a key trend and force for clients. And to be more specific, they all been making
some significant acquisitions these last couple of years, and now, they will have to integrate those acquisition to drive
more synergies and more efficiency.
Of course, the second big driver is around the increased regulation, and that's something which is a kind of must-do.
Clearly in financial services, you all know about the sort of [ph] uncertainty to (48:07) about the Basel III, but you can
take the same imperative in the chemical industry, in the pharma industry, and in many of the industries outside,

especially in energy as well. And most of those clients, especially the big one, will have of course to comply with those
regulation.
The need as well for operational efficiency. I mean, productivity is the name of the game. If you want to complete, you
need to drive more efficiency out of your operations. And if you're operating on a global stage, I mean that requires a
lot of work, and this why – this is why you see more BPO, more outsourcing kind of work, more of those activities.
And finally, especially in the efficiency, all those new technologies are kicking in. And if you combine the cloud, I
mean, the mobility, with all the analytics, all our clients that need those technology in order to drive more efficiency.
So efficiency, globalization, regulation, I mean, those are big trends and big forces which should be outside there for
quite awhile.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Yeah. I mean, it just seems like there's enough drivers underlying the business today that
might make this somewhat of a different time in terms of resilience in almost any cycle.
Pam, just a quick follow-up for you. You maintained margin guide of 10 to 20 basis points despite the year-to-year
decline in the quarter. And just – you noted the underlying contract profitability improved during the quarter, given
pricing and the mix improvement I think, but can you help us understand the trends in the cost structure underlying
that? Maybe just higher level also. Is there an opportunity for that to really see a further benefit down the road [ph]
from the GDN? (49:42)
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, as we discussed on Investor Analyst Day, and Kevin was there, I mean we never will
give up on continuing to drive efficiency and productivity in our cost to serve. And that did indeed yield well for us in
the third quarter, and we expect that trend to continue in the fourth. And that is why I feel confident at this point about
our operating margin expansion for the year.

<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Hi.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Hi, how you doing? I guess my first question here is, we've seen consulting and people
characterize it as sort of a late-cycle recovery. I wonder if you could characterize for us what stage you think that the
demand for that offerings in? Are we in the early stages of the rebound? Are we peaking? I know you've reported
record numbers again this quarter, and maybe you could give us some color on why you feel that way?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Well, we feel that the demand is remaining robust because of the – those big trends I
mentioned before. So I'm not sure we can characterize whether we are early in the cycle or late in the cycle. We are in a
cycle -
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: In the cycle.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: – where indeed – and again, many of those large corporation, they have to act now. They
have to do something in order to, again, compete at those regulation, being compliant with the regulation. So we are in
a cycle, which seems to be providing good demand for our services.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Okay. And then just secondly, I know we talked about the public sector, but is there any other
area that I guess is potentially concerning to you, either from a macro perspective or on the ground through any of your
services, verticals, and offerings, something that maybe you're keeping an eye on right now, and maybe why that is?

else, nice job.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thank you.
<Q - George A. Price>: A lot of questions around demand, so I'm going to switch over to something else. Can you talk
a little bit more about the litigation reserve and kind of what's going on with that? Is that for one or a small number of
specific matters? Is that related to tax matters at all? Why the timing now? Just a little bit more color around that?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, it's not related to taxes. The reserve was primarily related to one matter, but we're not
going to comment specifically on any matter. And we don't expect to be accruing at that level going forward, and we
don't see a significant change to our profile at this point.
<Q - George A. Price>: Is this matter a recent matter, or more ongoing?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Not going to comment on it, George, okay?
<Q - George A. Price>: Okay. Okay, fair enough. Then, I guess, maybe I guess I will switch over back to a – from a
demand perspective.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, go back to demand. We like demand.
<Q - George A. Price>: So I guess I can't help a little bit maybe in feeling like the tone seemed a little cautious maybe,
a little hesitant, despite everything that's going on, just in talking about fiscal '12, and at this point, you still see things
the way that they are. There's – there are a lot of concerns, a lot going on out there. I – in looking back at consulting
bookings, I mean, sometimes you see fiscal 3Q is the strongest one, sometimes fiscal 2Q. And I guess what I want to
get to is, is did you see anything unusual in terms of movement around, any cancellations, any deferrals? Because you
mentioned that you expect consulting bookings to kind of tick up next quarter. So is that that you had some stuff slip,
and why did it slip, and if you could maybe comment on that?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, be happy to. There was nothing unusual. I think I signaled last quarter that I thought the
consulting bookings might moderate a little bit, and I think it was just, when you're running so hot, and as we have been
this year, we just expected just a little kind of breath-catching and then back to it. So there really isn't anything unusual
that we see at this point. Even looking at last year, I'm just looking at the consulting bookings, the third quarter was the
lowest of the year. So there's nothing really funny happening here, and there is – is there really isn't anything we – as I
said, I – we expect them to tick back up next quarter.

some of these macro concerns did start to weigh and did start to influence their decision-making, would you expect to
