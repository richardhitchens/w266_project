O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, List, and good morning to all participants. We appreciate your time and interest and welcome everyone to
Regions' second quarter earnings conference call.
I'll begin today's call by covering highlights and business results. Then David Turner will provide additional details on
the financials a little later.
Regions' second quarter 2011 results further demonstrate that we are executing our business plans and making
substantial progress. Regions earned $55 million, or 4 cents per diluted share, marking the third consecutive quarter of
profitability. Core business performance continued to improve as core pre-tax, preprovision net revenue rose to $500
million, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008.
We continue to see improvement in quality loan demand, as we originated $16.7 billion in new or renewed loans and
commitments. A 26% increase from first quarter's 2011, $13.3 billion.
Credit related costs, which include our loan loss provision, OREO expense, and held for sale losses, declined to a
2-year low, or an estimated 22 cents per share after tax.
Additionally, Morgan Keegan reached a settlement with the SEC, FINRA and state regulators. The financial impact on
second quarter earnings related to the $210 million settlement was a $44 million tax benefit on a portion of settlement
which had previously accrued as nondeductible.
Furthermore, with respect to Morgan Keegan, we also announced our intention to explore strategic alternatives. As a
result of this decision, we announced the formation of a new wealth management organization that will integrate trust,
private banking and insurance business into a single business within the bank. Establishing this new organization
enables us to focus on key profitable customer segment with a goal of increasing noninterest revenue, deepening
customer relationships and enhancing value.
During the quarter, we repositioned our investment securities portfolio, shortening the duration, resulting in
approximately $24 million in security gains, or a penny per share after tax.
On the expense front, as a continued focus on productivity and efficiency initiatives, we made the decision this quarter
to consolidate approximately 40 branches and dispose of property and equipment, resulting in charges of $77 million or
$0.04 per share.
Sequentially, net interest income was steady, and fee revenues reflected lower brokerage income, offset by robust
service charge income. Noninterest expenses, adjusted for the $77 million in charges, declined 4% first and second
quarter, demonstrating disciplined execution in our efforts to improve productivity and efficiency.
Recent macro economic indicators reveal further weakness and uncertainty in the economy, and we continue to
experience an uneven recovery, particularly in the Southeast. However, these economic and global risk concerns do not
lead to material changes in our economic outlook of below trend growth. We continue to focus on what we can control
in this environment, delivering continued improvement in our operating results and long-term franchise value. Our plan
focuses on servicing our customers, enhancing enterprise-wide risk management, and building sustainable profitability.
Building sustainable profitability starts with continued improvements in asset quality. Key credit metrics continue to
improve as formation of nonperforming loans are down for the third consecutive quarter, and nonperforming loans
excluding loans held for sale have declined five quarters in a row. The loan loss provision was down 17% linked
quarter, and business services criticized loans decreased another 14%. Notably, our investor real estate portfolio has
now been reduced to $13.4 billion, nearly 50% below the 2006 level.
In addition to credit quality, core business performance continues to improve. We are targeting a more diversified,
balanced and profitable business mix. As of June 30, business services accounted for approximately 61% of our loan
portfolio, and consumer services comprises 39%. Over time, we are targeting a better balance with a focus on building
the generally higher margin consumer portfolio, and appropriate pricing on our business services portfolio.

Although consumers continue to deleverage, our consumer services loan production was 14% higher, year to date 2011
compared to 2010, and 8% higher on a linked quarter basis, led by an increase in mortgage, indirect auto, and direct
lending.
Indirect auto was particularly strong, as production rose to $291 million in the second quarter, or 14% higher than the
prior quarter. We continue to expand this business and now have signed over 1,000 auto dealerships, and expect to
reach 1,200 by year end.
An example of how we're keeping our business focused on the customer is our reentry into the credit card business.
Late in the quarter, we acquired a portfolio of approximately $1.2 billion. The portfolio consists of Regions' branded
consumer and business check card accounts – credit card accounts – of which 2/3 have two to five other banking
services with Regions today. Our plan is to gradually grow this portfolio over time by controlling a positive customer
experience, strong cross-sells throughout our customer base, and disciplined pricing and underwriting.
We believe that keeping focused on our customers requires strong knowledge of customer needs and expectations. As
such, we're committed to adding new products and services to further expand our business and add value. We continue
to look for opportunities to expand our consumer banking product line to address the ever-changing needs of our
customers. We are committed to serving the needs of our consumer customers with various credit products, payment
and cash services, convenience of branches, ATMs, Internet and mobile, and providing financial protection products to
give customers confidence and trust. New products and services not only allow Regions to meet evolving customers
needs but also to diversify and grow dependable revenue streams.
Although we're focused on profitably growing our consumer business, we remain committed to adding and deepening
relationships with our commercial portfolio as well. Our business services loan production for the second quarter
totaled $14.6 billion, a 14% increase over the same period a year ago and a 32% higher first to second quarter.
We're continuing to see strength, middle market commercial/industrial, driven by both existing and new customers.
Specialized industries such as energy, health care, and franchise restaurant are particularly strong, with new
relationships accounting for much of the activity. Commercial industrial commitments have increased 7% year to date,
and line utilization has remained relatively stable, even with the growth in commitments.
Another area also performing well is small business. With year to date production up more than 8% over 2010, this
business remains a priority at Regions, providing not only loans but also contributing fee income streams and deposits,
as well.
Our strength in gathering low cost deposits continued this quarter. Average low cost deposits rose 4% compared to the
second quarter last year, and as a result, total deposit cost declined 26 basis points year over year to 53 basis points.
Total funding costs have also declined 31 basis points over the same period, ending the quarter at just 80 basis points.
Fee income is and will remain a significant component of our plan to diversify and expand our revenue streams. Here
again our focus and emphasis on service quality is paying off, along with our ability to quickly adapt to changing
environment. Despite legislative and regulatory rule changes, we grew service charge fee income 2% year over year,
and 7% linked quarter.
Along with the industry, we faced challenges required by the Durbin amendment, which are to be implemented in
October this year. Based on the final ruling, the company estimates that the impact on annual debit interchange revenue
will be approximately $170 million, unmitigated. However, we plan to promptly adjust our business model to deal with
new rules, and over time, we will be able to offset this impact through revenue enhancements and disciplined expense
management.
Improving productivity and efficiency is a foundational part of our business strategy. We have and will continue to
aggressively identify opportunities to reduce costs without adversely impacting service quality and business
development and our opportunity to grow.
And with this concluding review, I'll turn it over to David for an update on the financial details.

David J. Turner
Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our second quarter results, beginning
on slide 3.
Results demonstrated solid linked-quarter progress, including strong service charge fee revenue, lower core expenses,
and broad-based credit quality improvement. Earnings per share totaled $0.04 and net income available to common
shareholders amounted to $55 million. Pre-tax, preprovision net revenue, or PPNR, totaled $447 million; however,
excluding security gains and branch consolidation costs, and property and equipment charges, adjusted PPNR increased
to $500 million, the highest level in 11 quarters.
Within PPNR, net interest income was essentially steady linked quarter, and the resulting net interest margin was
3.05%. Excluding securities gains, adjusted noninterest revenue declined $7 million or 1% linked quarter but was
relatively flat on a year-over-year basis.
Noninterest expenses adjusted for $77 million of branch consolidation and property and equipment costs were lower
than the prior quarter by $46 million, or 4%, reflecting reduced professional and legal fees as well as the decline in
salaries and benefits expense.
Included within income taxes for the quarter is a benefit of $44 million related to the announced Morgan Keegan
settlement. Last year, at the time of the accrual, we believed the entire amount would be nondeductible. Upon final
settlement, a portion was determined to be deductible, resulting in this quarter's $44 million tax benefit.
Let's now take a look at our improved credit quality trends, beginning with nonperforming loan inflows.
As shown on slide 4, inflows of nonperforming loans declined $175 million, or 24% linked quarter, to $555 million, the
third consecutive quarterly decline and the lowest level of inflows since the first quarter of 2008.
On an absolute basis, almost all loan categories experienced a decline in gross inflows. Notably, income-producing
commercial real estate and the land, condo and single family portfolios demonstrated some of the largest
improvements. On the right side of the slide, note that 42% of June 30 total business services nonperforming loans
were current in paying as agreed, 4 percentage points higher linked quarter.
Turning to slide 5, nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, declined $303 million or 10%. This quarter, we
sold or transferred to held for sale $620 million of criticized loans, consisting of $75 million of loans that were sold and
$545 million of loans moved to held for sale. I would like point out that these loans that were in held for sale at June 30
have now been subsequently sold at the marked amount and are now off of our balance sheet.
Early stage credit indicators demonstrated improvement, with total delinquencies decreasing for the 5th straight quarter.
Additionally, business services criticized loans were down approximately $1.2 billion or 14% from first quarter's level
and have now declined each quarter since fourth quarter 2009. These two leading asset quality indicators serve as
important measures in estimating future inflows of problem loans, and once again support our expectations for
continued improvement in nonperforming loan migration.
Accruing troubled debt restructurings or TDRs increased modestly this quarter to $1.66 billion. We expect to see an
increase in TDRs as a result of recent accounting literature that will be effective in the third quarter. However,
importantly, we do not anticipate there will be a material impact to our loan loss allowance resulting from this rule
change.
Moving on to slide 6, second quarter's net chargeoffs were impacted by the $620 million of loans that were sold or
moved to held for sale. This disposition activity resulted in $207 million of chargeoffs. Net chargeoffs totaled $548
million and exceeded the loan loss provision by $150 million, primarily associated with allowances allocated to these
loans.

Excluding net chargeoffs related to this quarter's disposition activity, net chargeoffs declined 9% and reflected
broad-based improvement in almost all categories. Looking forward, net chargeoffs are forecasted to remain elevated
for the balance of the year.
Due to this quarter's disposition efforts, our loan loss allowance to nonperforming loan coverage ratio increased from
103% to 112% at June 30. Additionally, we also sold $289 million of OREO and nonperforming loans that were
previously held for sale at approximately break-even.
Turning to the balance sheet slide 7 breaks this quarter's change in loans and loan yields. Average loans declined 1.6%,
with declines in investor real estate offsetting strong middle market C&I growth. However, ending loans were
relatively flat linked quarter, reflecting our late-quarter credit card purchase. The aggregate loan yield declined 4 basis
points compared with the prior quarter to 4.27% as the average 30-day LIBOR rate declined 6 basis points this quarter.
We continue to see strength in our commercial loan portfolio, with average and ending loans up 6.1% and 6.6% from
one year ago respectively. Growth in our middle market C&I is particularly strong, driven by specialized industries,
which include energy, health care, franchise restaurant, transportation, technology, defense, and asset-based lending.
Customers refinancing, mergers and acquisitions, and capital expenditures are major contributors to this growth.
Again this quarter, we experienced increases in 65% of our markets and total commercial/industrial commitments have
risen $1.8 billion year to date, ending the quarter at $28 billion. On an ending basis, investor real estate declined
another $1.4 billion and now totals $13.4 billion.
As noted earlier, second quarter's credit card portfolio purchase demonstrates that we are focused on being a full
service provider and is yet another way for us to rebalance our portfolio between commercial and consumer lending.
Moving on to deposits. As noted on slide 8, we continue to benefit from our strength in gathering low-cost deposits,
which on average grew $1.3 billion linked quarter, while our average time deposits declined another $485 million. As a
result, average total deposits rose $865 million or 1% over the first quarter.
Average low cost deposits as a percentage of total deposits has risen from 72.5% in the second quarter of 2010 to
76.6% this quarter. This positive mix shift led to another 6 basis points decline in second-quarter total deposit costs to
53 basis points.
Second-half deposit costs should continue to benefit from an improving mix through additional repricing of maturing
CDs at lower market rates. For the second half of this year, $6.1 billion of CDs will mature and carry an average of
1.48%.
Turning to slide 9, taxable equivalent net interest income was flat, totaling $872 million, with a resulting net interest
margin declining 2 basis points to 3.05%. Our margin continues to reflect our excess liquidity held at the federal
reserve.
During the second quarter, we took advantage of long-term rates declining and repositioned our securities portfolio,
shortening the duration to just over three years. Specifically, we sold $4 billion of 3.5-year agency mortgage-backed
securities and reinvested the proceeds primarily in 2-year agency mortgage-backed securities, resulting in $24 million
of security gain.
Barring unexpected movement in interest rates, net interest margin should be relatively stable with an upward bias for
the balance of this year.
Let's now shift gears and look at noninterest revenue on slide 10. Excluding security gains, second quarter noninterest
revenue amounted to $757 million, down 1% sequentially. Second quarter's noninterest revenue reflected lower
brokerage revenues, offset by solid service charges and mortgage income growth. Lower private client and capital
markets revenues were the primary factors contributing to the sequential quarter decline in brokerage revenues. The
linked quarter increase in service charges reflects the ongoing restructuring of our accounts to fee eligible.

Also, interchange income was higher, benefiting from increasing active debit card usage, as total transactions year to
date are 12% higher compared to a year ago.
New product innovation, such as the launch of short-term, small dollar cash advances for relationship customers and
identity theft protection will serve to further diversify and build our revenue streams.
And just to reiterate what Grayson said regarding the Durbin amendment, we believe, based on the final ruling, we will
be able to mitigate the lost revenue over time.
Lastly, mortgage income was up 11% from the first quarter, due to improved mortgage servicing right and related
hedging performance.
Turning to expenses on slide 11, second quarter noninterest expenses totaled $1.2 billion. However, excluding $77
million in charges, primarily related to branch consolidation and property and equipment charges, adjusted noninterest
expense totaled $1.1 billion for the quarter, a solid 4% below first quarter's level.
Key drivers of this quarter's decline were a 6% reduction in salaries and benefits expense and a $20 million reduction in
professional and legal fees.
Credit-related expenses, which include other real estate expense, gains and losses from held for sale, and credit-related
personnel costs, declined modestly, accounting for 8% of second quarter's adjusted noninterest expenses. FDIC
premiums increased $20 million linked quarter, reflecting new rules which went into effect on April 1.
As Grayson noted, we will consolidate approximately 40 branches as part of our ongoing and routine efforts to
strengthen the franchise through productivity and efficiency initiatives. These branches will be closed later this year
and will have minimal customer impact. We reported associated property evaluation charges and equipment expenses
of $77 million this quarter, and expect to realize pre-tax future net cost saves of approximately $19 million annually.
Including these announced branch closings, we will have reduced our branch count 19% and disposed of or exited 5.7
million square feet of company space since 2006. In addition, since 2006, we have reduced our head count over 25%
and 568 positions year to date. We will continue to rigorously and diligently review our expenses to ensure they are
tightly managed without sacrificing investment opportunities or our high standards for customer service.
Slide 12 provides a snapshot of our healthy capital ratios and favorable liquidity position. Tier I common is estimated at
7.9%, and our Tier I ratio stands at 12.6%. Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company is solid, with a loan to
deposit ratio of 84.3%.
Overall, this quarter's results demonstrate that our strategy is working, as our core business performance continues to
improve. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for his closing remarks.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, David.
Before taking questions, I want to spend just a moment summarizing the actions we're taking to both improve Regions'
performance and to build a stronger organization for the future. Focusing on the customer, enhancing enterprise-wide
risk management, and building sustainable performance are the three priorities that we're executing. As second quarter's
results show, we are making continued progress, and taking deliberate and appropriate steps to deliver on this business
plan.
To recap, this quarter, we continued to derisk our loan portfolio. We purchased our Regions' branded credit card
portfolio. We grew our commercial/industrial business. We organized a new wealth management line of business
within the bank. We introduced a new suite of products and services for our consumer base, and we announced
continued efforts to rationalize our expense base in a disciplined and continuous manner.

Another critical component of this strategy is to ensure that Regions has the appropriate level of capital to support its
long-term plans. To that end, as we previously mentioned, as part of our capital planning process, we announced our
intention to explore potential strategic alternatives for Morgan Keegan, which we believe is in the best long-term
interest of both Morgan Keegan and Regions Financial.
All in all, I'm encouraged with our second quarter progress. We still have work ahead of us. But we are committed to
the ongoing successful execution of our business plans, and we are delivering improved results.
Before we open the line for questions, I want to address an issue that has received some attention recently. In June, a
federal judge denied our motion to dismiss a civil lawsuit and suggested in her opinion that the audit committee of our
board of directors and government authorities are investing accrual status of certain loans in 2009.
That prompted media coverage and questions from investors, so in the 10-Q we will file in the next week or so, we are
going to include a disclosure which will say that the company has received inquiries and subpoenas from government
authorities related to 2009 and earlier periods, regarding accounting matters that have also been the subject of pending
civil litigation against the company. The company is cooperating fully in providing responses, and the audit committee
of our board of directors is conducting an investigation with the assistance of outside counsel and consultants.
I think it's important to note these inquiries relate to 2009 and earlier periods, and do not have any bearing on our
present financial statements, including our level of nonperforming assets or our loan loss reserves. Please recognize that
we're limited in what we can say beyond this disclosure.
With that, operator, I'll open the line up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Banc.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Hey, guys.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: I think in general the expense management has been very strong, which is good to see,
given the revenue environment is tough for all banks, including yourself. You highlighted the additional $19 million of
run rate savings. How do we think about the expense base going forward, once we adjust for that, once we back out
some of the restructuring charges? What would you think about the trend of expenses incorporating that – once we
incorporate that?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Matt, this is David. We still have a lot of environmental expenses embedded in our
income statement. You know, roughly – call it $300 million a year that we're continuing to work on. You also saw our
increase in FDIC premiums during the quarter, which is based on an estimate of what we think the premiums will be.
They're still ongoing discussions on the new definitions that are embedded in the new rules there.
So we will continue to focus on expenses. Part of our – we look at head count, we look at branches. We'll continue in
this type of environment, where revenue is harder to come by, you have to be diligent with regard to expenses. So we
are going to continue to work on getting them down.
As I mentioned before, we expect that over time, that we ultimately settle into an efficiency ratio which is in the lower
60s or higher 50%. And we're not there yet. So we still have some work to go.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Matt, this is Grayson. Given our projection for a slow and somewhat uneven economic
recovery, our focus on expense disciplines to drive efficiency and productivity will continue. As David mentioned
earlier, we're down over 500 positions since the first of the year. You know, I'm encouraged to say that we did that with
improving service quality. Our service quality metrics continue to improve.

I think, as David mentioned, you can divide our expense into two categories, discretionary expenses and also
environmental expenses. The environmental expenses are starting to improve, which is – in their elevated nature, has
been a great turn of events for us this quarter. But our discretionary expenses will continue to trend downward as well.
Because all across the franchise, every business manager we have is focused on this issue, and we believe we will have
to for some time to come.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay, thanks. Then just separately, you did mention about the TDRs increasing in the
third quarter, with the accounting change. Do you have an early estimate of what that might be?
And then similarly, the reserve impact, you said not going to be meaningful, but any estimate on what that might be in
dollar terms would be helpful.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Matt, we haven't. We're working through that right now, to be able to quantify the
increase. We don't have that yet.
We do think that maybe more important component is the expectation of the driver of any additional reserves, and we
do not believe that that change in accounting of TDR definition will impact our reserves meaningfully.
So as soon as we get the number, we will be posting that up. We don't have that today.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Hey, I wanted to ask two questions. One was, as we move the securities portfolio shorter, are we
just increasing our asset sensitivity and kind of giving up some of our future earnings, if rates stay at this level?
<A - David J. Turner>: We do, Marty, but we also enter into some fixed – receive fixed slots with that that protects us
with a lower rate environment. So again, our expectation is rates will be down here for a while, and – but we've
protected ourselves on the downside.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Okay, so the combination of the swaps with the shorter securities weren't going to impact going
forward?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's right.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Okay. And then the other question was, in your release, kind of in the back, this is more of a
detailed – you had about a 2% impact from Basel I to Basel III risk-weighted assets. And the footnote, we say we're
developing systems and the calculation.
The 2% number seems a little slight to me. I was curious what you were including. If you were including any shift in
the asset quality calculation or any of the net interest margin volatility or things like that in the new calculation for
Basel III.
<A - David J. Turner>: Marty, it wasn't a credit-related – honestly, these are all estimates right now, trying to come
up with what the risk-weighted assets are. It's a little early for that.
The purpose of us putting Basel III in there to begin with was there was a lot of noise about what that might mean to
some of the money-center banks. And we wanted to answer the question – our transition to Basel III is not going to be
that difficult for us. We just don't have the same construct that the larger money-center banks do.

We do believe we'll be in compliance. Obviously we think we'll have higher ratios than what you see when it comes

Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jeffries.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks, good morning. Just a couple questions on credit quality. I'm wondering, can you help us
understand, of the reserve release this quarter, how much of it was related to the actual loan sales versus how much of it
was just related to the other parts of the portfolio improving?
<A - Barb Godin>: This is Barb. I'll go ahead and respond to that question. The majority of it was related to the actual
loan sale that we did. Although there was a small portion that was related to otherwise.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And then as far as the comments, David, your comments earlier on chargeoffs remaining
elevated, understanding that a portion of this quarter's was again related to the loan sales. Are you generally expecting
chargeoffs to remain at the level that it was this quarter, going forward?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, clearly our chargeoffs were up because of our derisking. And we provided, if we had
had not had that, chargeoffs would have been a couple hundred million dollars lower.
I think the point we need to make is we think that from a chargeoff standpoint, a core chargeoff, they will be elevated
compared to what our expectation is on a normal run rate. We have the reserves established for that. We're holding a
pretty large reserve at 3.84% today. So you would expect chargeoffs to continue to remain elevated.
The bigger issue is what will the provision look like over time, and you saw us provide lessened chargeoffs for the first
time in a while this past quarter. So we don't have any planned transactions, if you will, at this time that would cause
that chargeoff level to be where you saw this past quarter.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: But that's my last follow-up, just on your last point there. So if the majority of the release this
quarter was specifically against loans that were sold, and there's not much release in the rest of the book, then is it fair
to assume that you won't necessarily be planning on releasing reserves outside of incremental sales that you might
conduct in the future?
<A - David J. Turner>: Ken, I don't think you can look at it that way. You know, chargeoffs are chargeoffs, and the
provision is a separate calculation that relates to any new issues that you may have coming up or any degradation in
loans that you already had reserved for.
And I think we let our allowance model work for us. And we book whatever reserve the model tells us we need to have.
So I don't think, just because we had chargeoffs – specific reserves attributable to those – that you can imply, we would
not provide lessened chargeoffs going forward.
We're not committing that we're going to do that either. We're just saying don't look at it that way.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I do think you have to look at the leading indicators in terms of criticized classified assets,
in terms of early and late stage delinquencies. When you look at our credit metrics, they continue to show a favorable
trend, albeit slower than we would like. But a favorable trend nonetheless.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Of course. Thanks a lot, guys.

Your next question comes from Erika Penala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Good morning. My first question relates to the $620 million in loans that were reclassified in
the quarter. Could you give us a sense of how much of those loans came out of the NPS bucket versus criticized but
accruing? And what the associated mark was on that $620 million, before you took the additional chargeoff?
<A - David J. Turner>: Erika, I think I have your question. Out of that $620 million, $255 million of those were
accruing, and the remainder were in nonaccruing status. Those were the book value numbers. And you saw our
chargeoffs of $207 million on that $620 million.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Right. I guess what was the previous mark on that $620 million? I assume that when you
reclassified it to nonaccrual, there was a reserve associated – of the -
<A - David J. Turner>: The $620 million is the net book value that does not have reserves ascribed to it. We ended
having chargeoffs of $207 million, and we released our reserve $150 million. So that ought to give you some idea about
the additional charges that we would have taken on that pool of loans.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Okay. And Barb, I was wondering if you could give us a update in terms of the redefault
trends that you're seeing. How that's tracking on the resi TDR book? And also if you could give us a refreshed LTV on
that $1.2 billion.
<A - Barb Godin>: I'll start with the trends that we're seeing. The redefault rate continues to hold in around 20%. So
that really has not moved over the years. As you can see from the numbers this quarter, we did add a little bit. Both in
home equity and resi pure TDRs, we continue to apply our customer assistance program in helping customers.
Relative to the second part of the question, which I need you to refresh me on?
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Sorry. The refreshed LTV of the – just specific to the RESI TDR book, please.
<A - Barb Godin>: I don't have that broken out that way, Erika, but I can get that back to you.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Okay. And just one last question. In terms of your comments on really retooling your deposit
product offerings to adjust to a new regulatory reality, I was wondering if it's too early to give us a sense of how much
of the Durbin income you can end up mitigating, and how long does "over time" mean?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, Erika, let me answer it this way. One is we've put together a plan mitigating the
impact of Durbin that includes both revenues and expenses. And we will – as you've seen us over the past year, really
moving from a free checking environment to a fee-eligible environment.
You know, I think from a strategy standpoint, our strategy is not going to be that different than many of our
competitors. But most of those strategies are speculative at this juncture.
But we intend to increase the hurdles, if you will, for our checking accounts. We certainly have under consideration
specific charges around debit cards themselves. And our implementation of that will occur between now and year-end.
And we will be disclosing the impacts of those as we start seeing how customer behavior starts to modify in the new
environment.

Your next question comes from Scott Valentin of FBR.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just regard to the margin, you mentioned
stable margin with maybe an upward bias. I was just curious, looks like CD rates – there's still room to reduce CD
rates. Maybe cost of funds can come down somewhat. Another question would be liquidity, room to reduce liquidity
and maybe see asset yield improvement. I thought maybe there would be a brighter outlook for margin given what

looks like low hanging fruit to improve margin.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Scott, you're right. That's why we put upward bias to it. We also have nonperformers,
and as those continue to [ph] yield (44:39), there's a pick-up there.
You know, one of our issues that we've been facing is, from a liquidity standpoint, we've had tremendous liquidity.
Over this past quarter we had an average of right at $5 billion at the Federal Reserve. And we'd like to put that to work
on a more efficient basis. So we've been working to return to sustainable profitability and improve credit metrics and
get our credit ratings improved such that we can take – become a little more efficient with regards to how our balance
sheet is positioned.
And when we can do that, you can see that we can do a lot better earnings than 25 basis points with that $5 billion over
time. So the question is when can we do that? And we're working hard on that.
You're right to point out we do have some more benefits to pick up from deposit costs. We're at about 53 basis points
today. And I think that we will continue to improve there. And then we layered on a roughly, a little over $1 billion
credit card purchase that should enhance our loan yields going forward.
So if you're trying to imply we're being a little conservative in terms of the call, I'm with you. But I don't think, until we
can get our balance sheet positioned as efficient as we want, that we're going to have a run-away margin.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: And Scott, this is Grayson. If you look at it from a deposit cost standpoint, we do continue
to believe that we've got more opportunity there to reduce our cost on the margin.
From a loan yield perspective is we're seeing new production. Across all asset classes, product types, we are seeing
improved yields and rates on new production. Obviously there's more competition that we're seeing out in the
marketplace, but the rates that we're able to put new production on the books is still at levels higher than pre-crisis
levels. And as we add new production to the book, we are seeing improvement in overall yield outlook on the loan
portfolio.
That being said, most of our commercial loans are tied to 30-day LIBOR. We did have a pretty challenging operating
environment in – as relates to LIBOR in the second quarter.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Okay, thanks. That was immensely helpful, all the color. Thank you. I just have a follow-up
question.
You mentioned about Morgan Keegan, long-term you think it's the right thing to do. I was curious how you weigh the
tradeoff between losing some earnings power on the sale of Morgan Keegan versus maybe the capital it frees up.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, we had to go through – and have over the past several months – a fairly extensive
review of our businesses. We continue to do that across our portfolio of businesses within the company. I think that the
settlement that we were able to achieve with the SEC, FINRA and the state regulators in regard to Morgan Keegan
really provided an opportunity for us to look at that business more strategically and decide where we go.
It's a very valuable franchise. It's been part of this organization since 2001. And we do – our preference is to sort of
maintain some type of strategic alliance as we move forward. But we continue to believe that, as we look at our capital
planning process, that taking a strategic review at this point in time is the right answer.
We will be giving more clarity on our financial pro formas as this process matures. We're not in a position to give that
clarity today. But it will be forthcoming.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Okay, thanks very much.

<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: I was going to follow up on Erika's question. I think that the – I don't know if I'd call it a
concern, but the biggest issue I think people have is with all banks right now is what they can sell the problem loans for
versus what they're marked now.
And if you're taking a $207 million loss in addition to a $150 million reserve on $620 million of loans moved, it seems
like that the loans aren't – for all banks, not just you guys – but able to sell for close to where they're marked, then it's
going to take them a long time to get through this whole cycle.
I guess can you comment on that? And can you give us some comfort about the marks and the future losses, and how
long it's going to take to work through those problem loans?
<A - Barb Godin>: Jefferson, it's Barb. The $150 million that we released was not in addition to. It was part of the
$207 million that it cost us. We already had these loans pretty well marked at the time that we sold them.
So you know, if you look at that rough delta between what we sold, $620 million, and the difference between the $207
million and the $150 million, it's roughly $60 million. So roughly a 10%.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Okay.
<A - Barb Godin>: So we chose those assets because – as part of our continuous credit servicings. We looked at each
of the accounts. We looked at how long it would take us to accomplish our workout strategy. And in several instances
and knowing at that time that the market was pretty enthusiastic for some of these individual assets, we felt it was in
our best interest to go ahead and pull that workout strategy forward and go ahead and sell it.
And again, the 10% therefore I would reflect as being more of a liquidity premium in the market than it was a credit
mark.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Right. Thank you very much. Can you just comment on the – you mentioned the
pull-ahead of problem loans. Should we expect more of that type of thing? Or is it going to – as the inflows are slowing
down, are we going to slow down the disbursements?
<A - David J. Turner>: Jefferson, this is David. We don't have any current plans for a disposition that we – similar to
what we just had. We do have loans in held-for-sale and OREO, which we would continue to market and sell.
But we are continuing to evaluate our portfolio, and if it makes sense to have a further transaction, then we will mark
loans to held for sale, take our mark, put them in there and sell them. But right now we do not have that currently
planned.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: All right. Thanks.

<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: Barb, my first question, when it comes to the investor real estate TDRs that are up
about 30% this quarter, and that's before the accounting change next quarter. Can you refresh my memory as to what
type of collateral you have on those investor real estate TDRs and what the average LTVs would be?
<A - Barb Godin>: I don't have the average LTVs in front of me, but let me just give a general comment on the TDRs,
if I could.
Remembering that we have decided as a strategy on our workout side to keep all of our durations short. So all of our
renewals are short. We typically don't go beyond a year.

And so because of that, as we look at these loans that are coming up that we actually are going to renew this year, a lot
of those are going to fall into TDR status. Because what will happen is one argues that, would you ever make a loan to
a classified credit? And could you ever get the appropriate rate around it? And so again, we've taken the position,
conservative perhaps, but we certainly have taken the position that the answer is no, and so therefore they would
become TDRs.
The collateral behind it is all manner of things. You know, income producing, in general. But that would make up the
majority of it.
<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: David, what is the book value of Morgan Keegan?
<A - David J. Turner>: We haven't shared that book value number.
<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: Well, if you sell it for less than book value, that loss goes to the income statement.
Would it be a similar hit to Tier I common?
<A - David J. Turner>: It would be, if we ended up having a loss, yes.
<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: Okay -
<A - David J. Turner>: And if we had a gain, it would increase the Tier I common.
<Q - Christopher M. Mutascio>: Right. My last question is – and David, long-term debt yields were up about 22
basis points sequentially. Any reason – is that swap related, why the yields would go up on your long-term debt?
<A - David J. Turner>: It was just a maturing piece that was – because we had it swapped out; it was on a weighted
basis. It was a lower rate. And so when it came out, it just forced everything else up.

<Q - Kevin P. Fitzsimmons>: You all have been fairly active over the last few quarters, just pulling out structural
changes – the branch sale, entering indirect auto, reentering credit card. Now you're evaluating Morgan Keegan. Can
you give us a sense for – are there other levers, other options that you have on your planning board that are possible, or
are you kind of at a point where that's really it?
And it kind of plays into the earlier question about how do you evaluate – or how do you weigh that loss or shortfall of
revenues, if you part with Morgan Keegan? Just wondering what other kind of levers are out there that you're
evaluating. Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, you know, let me start and I'll let David sort of respond also.
We have been continuously reevaluating our businesses, our products and our markets. And we've got a fairly full
agenda at the moment with all the activities going on. We certainly continue to run through that process on a quarterly
basis, as we go through a fairly extensive capital planning process and making sure that we're looking at these
businesses the right way.

I think the announcement we made around indirect, around credit cards, and now around reviewing strategic
alternatives for Morgan Keegan, have been part of that planning process for several quarters. I think you will continue
to see us do those types of evaluations. We're not at a position to share what our thoughts are today on future events.
But I think you can have a certain amount of confidence that we are in a continuous review of all the businesses we're
in, to try to strengthen this organization for the future and put us in a better position to be successful in delivering the
results that our shareholders desire.
<A - David J. Turner>: Kevin, this is David. We've had a strategic plan in place that our board has approved, and
we've been executing in accordance with that plan.
Certainly, if you look at an example of Morgan Keegan, we needed to be in position to settle the regulatory issues that
we've talked about before we could move forward with evaluating strategic alternatives for Morgan Keegan. So we will
continue to look at all options to continue to enhance the value to our shareholders.
You know, specific to Morgan Keegan, you asked at the end of your question, kind of how do you replace the revenue
hole to the extent that we execute on a – as something comes out and we actually dispose of Morgan Keegan. You need
to look at Page 10 of the supplement, which carves out – and this is not apples to apples, but it does give you – most of
that is Morgan Keegan included in the evaluation. It does include on Page 10 Trust and Asset Management, which is
not part of that strategic evaluation.
But you can look at the numbers that come out of that. And as you think about how you replace revenue, you need to
also consider about the expense that won't be there, to the extent we pull that trigger.
And also note that whatever proceeds raised in the transaction, if one happens, serves to offset the amount of debt
perhaps that we have to raise as we position ourselves for – at the parent company, as we position ourselves for
repayment of TARP. So that's interest carry that you save by not having to go out in the marketplace and raise that
debt.
So you need to keep that whole type transaction, not just focus on the revenue.
<Q - Kevin P. Fitzsimmons>: Okay, great. Just one quick follow-up. You've talked a lot about the movement of
customer accounts to fee-eligible status. I'd assume not all banks are moving at the same speed in that process. I know
it's early, but are you seeing any early signs on what the customer reaction is to that?
<A - David J. Turner>: You know -
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: This is Grayson. It's going to be an uneven approach by the industry. You know, I think
that it's too early to call at this juncture.
You know, we're yet to see in the marketplace what all the participants – what strategies all the participants will deploy.
We believe we've put together a good strategy. We stand ready to modify that strategy, though, if the market
necessitates that. But I think at this juncture, it's just too early to call what the customer reaction will be.
We've certainly done a lot of research, we've tested a number of theories and we've had customer groups in that we've
listened to and spoke to. But you know, we really got to wait to see what the behavioral changes of our customers turn
out to be.

It relates to, if you look at the change in classified of the past year. It looks like from the slide that it's roughly about 3.4
billion criticized adjustment in the last 12 months. And if I look at the chargeoff you've taken plus the $200 million for
the held for sale today, works out to about a 40% loss.
Is the loss content going forward similar to what you just experienced the last year in business services? Or should we
be thinking of a number that might be a little bit less than that, given just what's remaining in the classified and
criticized bucket?
<A - David J. Turner>: Christopher, this is David. I'll start, and Barb, you can add on.
Obviously, the marketplace is changing dramatically each and every quarter. You're looking at a lot of history. In some
cases, asset values are stabilizing. And in some cases, there are still challenges there. So when you try to forecast losses
that are built in based on the history, it gets difficult to do.
I would tell you, as you think of our losses and look at the reductions in our most problematic loan portfolios – investor
real estate's down 50% from where we were at the beginning of the cycle, down to $13.4 billion.
So we expect chargeoffs to be there. That's why we have a reserve of 3.84%. We believe we're adequately reserved for
the credit risk that's embedded in the portfolio.
When you have dispositions outside of the normal course, if you will, and we've had some of those over time, you
introduce a liquidity discount that you have to take. And in some cases, that liquidity discount is worth taking, and
sometimes it's not. We clearly have disclosed the fair value of our loans. That's assuming we would have a – sell every
one of our loans, and that's not the case. So predicting that those losses will be at that same level is difficult.
But you know, we continue to evaluate the best strategy of our portfolio. And like I said, today we don't have any plans
to market and sell. And if that changes, then we'll take our charges and move on.
<A - Barb Godin>: This is Barb. I'd add to that that [ph] our land (1:01:45) single family and condos being our most
distressed parts of the portfolio, those balances did fall. This quarter 2.5 billion down from 4.4 billion, just a year ago.
They've fallen substantially.
The other comment I would add to that is as we look at the number of customers and the percentage of our customers in
nonperforming loans that are paying as contractually agreed, that continues to go up each quarter. Compared to a year
ago, as well, it was 24% retained as contractually agreed, and now we're at 42%. So that too suggests that the quality of
what's in the nonperforming loans is a different quality over the last several quarters. And I would expect the same
going forward.
<Q - Chris W. Marinac>: Okay, great. Then just a quick follow-up. Is there a rough percentage of the allowance that

<Q - Chris Gamaitoni>: Thanks for taking my question. On a broader level, when you were speaking about credit
card cross selling, were you – I was unclear. Was the strategy to bring customers in with credit cards and then cross sell
them, or cross sell existing customers with credit cards?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Understand, this portfolio we acquired has been Regions branded for years. And so it's on
a Regions card, it's predominantly sold to Regions customers. And our strategy is to cross sell Regions customers with
a credit card, not the other way around.
As I said in my comments today, when you look at this portfolio, the vast majority of these customers already have
banking relationships with Regions bank. We have got about two to five products already sold to these customers on
average today.
