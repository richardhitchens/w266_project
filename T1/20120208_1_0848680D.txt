MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Gina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Sprint fourth quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Brad Hampton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may
begin.
Brad Hampton
Thank you, Gina. Good morning and welcome to Sprint Nextel's fourth quarter 2011 earnings call. Thanks for joining
us this morning. For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter.
Then Steve Elfman, our President of Network Operations and Wholesale, will provide an update on Network Vision.
And finally, our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are
both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide two is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning we will be discussing
forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings,
which I encourage you to review, including our Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended September 30, 2011; and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Turning to slide three, throughout our call we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our
non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to

our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation.
Turning to slide four, with today's earnings release we are providing a number of new disclosures related to our
network platforms. We are providing this new disclosure to give you a better understanding of the underlying trends
our operations and the growth of our core Sprint platform business. In our disclosure and throughout today's call,
Nextel platform refers to our iDEN business, which we will begin decommissioning in 2012. And Sprint platform
refers to our core ongoing business, which includes CDMA, WiMAX, LTE, and other network technologies.
Let's move to earnings per share on slide five. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the fourth quarter was $0.43
compared to $0.10 in the third quarter and $0.31 in the year-ago period. Basic and diluted loss per common share for
the full-year 2011 was $0.96 compared to $1.16 in the full-year 2010.
The loss per share increased as compared to the third quarter partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential
change in adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call. In addition, loss per share increased
sequentially due to higher equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other as well as higher net tax expense. The
current period net loss per share includes $0.04 pre-tax loss per share related to an impairment of our holding in
Clearwire as well as $0.03 pre-tax loss per share related to the impairment of certain network assets related to Network
Vision. The fourth quarter net loss per share also included a $0.01 pre-tax loss per share impact due to severance costs.
We recorded a net tax expense of $106 million in 4Q 2011, which included $6 million related to changes in corporate
income tax laws enacted in the quarter. For the full year 2012, we expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150
million to $200 million. Also please keep in mind that Clearwire's fourth quarter 2011 results from operations have not
yet been finalized. Please refer to the press release and our Form 10-K when it is filed for additional detail.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse.
Daniel R. Hesse
Thanks, Brad, and thank you for joining us this morning.
Sprint has shown continued momentum in recent quarters, and Q4 is no exception. Before I recap our overall
performance in 2011 in the context of our broader turnaround effort, let me take a moment and touch on some of the
key highlights from the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide seven, I am pleased to report today that we had a very successful launch of the iPhone, with total
activations in the quarter of over 1.8 million, above our expectations. 40% of those activations were new customers to
Sprint, a proof point of the renewed strength of the Sprint brand.
I'm also pleased to report today a year-over-year growth of $3.69 in our Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate, which is
the largest increase on record in U.S. wireless industry history. This historic ARPU growth was achieved in the same
quarter that we delivered our best postpaid voluntary churn number for any quarter since 2005 and in which we also
delivered our highest postpaid gross add volume for any quarter in four years.
As you know, voluntary churn is churn based on the customer's choice, churn determined by the strength of the brand,
the customer experience, and comparative pricing. To improve postpaid churn in 2011, more than any major U.S.
carrier and delivering the best annual postpaid churn in Sprint history while simultaneously increasing prices to an
extent that delivered industry record-breaking ARPU in the same year is nothing short of remarkable.
The significant upfront costs associated with the introduction of the iPhone and the beginning of the ramp up in
Network Vision operating expense lowered adjusted OIBDA below historical levels, but the $842 million of adjusted
OIBDA in the quarter topped the high end of our forecast and analyst estimates. This marked the third time in 2011 that
quarterly OIBDA exceeded Street consensus estimates. And on a pro forma basis, full-year 2011 adjusted OIBDA
topped analyst consensus by over 5%.

Finally, I am also pleased to announce continued progress on our Network Vision deployment. Today, we're adding
Baltimore and Kansas City to the list of cities that are expected to have Sprint LTE service plus improved 3G service
by the middle of this year, bringing the major cities to be launched by midyear to six.
As we closed the fourth quarter of 2011, I completed my fourth year at Sprint. I told you on my first call that our
turnaround would be difficult and not quick. Although we're far from finished, our progress nevertheless has been very
significant. 2011 caps what I would consider the first phase of our turnaround, the recovery and strengthening of the
business to the point that we're ready to enter the second phase in 2012, investment for future growth.
I will organize the balance of my remarks today, as usual, around our three unchanging priorities: improving the
customer experience, strengthening the brand, and generating cash. Given our special focus on OIBDA and cash
generation, I'm going to change the order today, however, and start with cash.
Please turn to slide eight. We maintained our strong liquidity position by generating $275 million [sic] [$257 million]
(7:12) of positive free cash flow for the quarter in addition to raising $4 billion of cash through our recent debt
offerings. Joe will provide more details on the impacts of Network Vision and iPhone on this quarter's OIBDA. But
absent the estimated impacts of these two investments and excluding 2006, which had a one-time blip associated with
adding the first year of full-year Nextel results, 2011 full-year pro forma OIBDA performance reflects year-over-year
improvement for the first time in seven years. The growth in our core Sprint platform business finally overtook the
declines on the Nextel platform and wireline.
Driven by strength in postpaid ARPU, Q4 represents our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in
total operating revenues, and the 4.7% growth from Q3 to Q4 represents our largest sequential increase in over five
years. As mentioned, the Sprint platform postpaid ARPU increase of $3.69 over the fourth quarter of 2010 is the largest
quarterly year-over-year improvement on record for the U.S. wireless industry.
Please turn to slide nine. 2011 culminates the efforts of our cash strategy over the last four years as we prepared for the
investment that lies ahead with Network Vision. We focused first from 2008 to 2010 on slowing down the subscriber
and top line revenue declines that followed the merger. We also focused intensely on reducing both capital and
operating expenses these past four years. We minimized our CapEx investments in 2G and early 3G radio technology
to keep our powder dry for investment in our new world-class Sprint Direct Connect service and in 4G LTE.
Compared to our CapEx run rate in 2007, between 2008 and 2011 we saved an estimated $15 billion in capital. Even
when you consider our cash investments in Clearwire and the increase in OIBDA-reducing roaming expenses we
incurred over this period, which are effectively a trade-off with our decision to spend less on 2G and 3G CapEx, we
achieved estimated savings in the last four years of over $10 billion of cash. Whether the accountants classify a dollar
as OpEx or CapEx, it's all cash in our view. From 2008 to 2011 our wireless CapEx investments were approximately
one-third the spend of Verizon, one-third of AT&T spend, and one-half the spend of T-Mobile USA.
Additionally, compared to our run rate in 2007, our total cost of service and SG&A in 2011 excluding roaming expense
and subsidy, which is really driven by competitive pricing versus spending behavior, are down by approximately $5
billion per year, with G&A expenses down almost 50%; marketing and product down 32%, even though we have
invested more in increasing and improving Sprint retail; and IT and billing expenses are down by a third. Over the
same time period, our total labor expense is down by 33%.
A primary tool in previous years used to satisfy customers and stem churn was for our care organization to provide
credits on customer bills. Not only did Sprint offer the lowest level of care credits in our history in 2011, but customer
care credits have decreased by $1 billion on an annual basis since 2007, so we're not buying improvements in customer
satisfaction and churn.
During 2011 based on the improvements in our customer experience and in our brand, we were in a position for the
first time to increase prices. We implemented an increase of $10 for our smartphone data plans in the first quarter of
2011. We also increased our other prices and fees during the year, eliminated our loyalty program, and lengthened
upgrade eligibility, all actions aimed at improving our OIBDA and cash generation.

Please turn to slide 10. Improving the customer experience has been our top objective and the most important
contributor to our turnaround. In the 2011 American Customer Satisfaction Index, we were the most improved U.S.
company – period – across all 47 industries studied by the ACSI over the past three years. Sprint was in a statistical tie
for first place for best overall choice by Consumer Reports in 2011, up from a distant last place in 2007 and in 2008
among major wireless carriers. Sprint was recognized five times in 2011 by J.D. Power & Associates. And we were
recently informed that Virgin will receive the J.D. Power award for the highest customer satisfaction among
non-contract brands. Boost placed second. Atlantic ACM just awarded Sprint a network award for global wholesale
excellence. And Frost & Sullivan just awarded Sprint the North American Customer Value Enhancement award for the
machine-to-machine space.
Our customer service organization continued their momentum to achieve customer service excellence. Sprint achieved
best-ever results in 2011 for customer satisfaction with customer care, customer satisfaction with repair, and customer
satisfaction with retail. We also achieved best-ever results for the number of calls per subscriber to care and for first
call resolution, in addition to the best-ever performance in fewest care credits given, as previously mentioned.
In spite of some temporary pressure on involuntary churn, which we mentioned on last quarter's call and which Joe will
describe in more detail, we continued to make steady progress on postpaid voluntary churn, which is an important
indicator of customer satisfaction. 2011 represents our best-ever annual total postpaid churn at 1.86%. And in Q4 we
delivered our best postpaid voluntary churn performance for any quarter since 2005. Like we did in 2010, we again
improved voluntary postpaid churn year over year in every quarter of 2011. Prepaid churn of 4.05% for the year is also
best ever, and Q4 prepaid churn was Sprint's best in the last 24 quarters. Churn improved sequentially for each of our
prepaid brands: Boost, Virgin, and Assurance.
Turning now to brand on slide 11, I'm very pleased to report that once again all Sprint brand metrics or health metrics
are at record highs. As measured by an outside third party, most want to investigate, purchase consideration, positive
brand momentum, and first brand preference are all at best-ever levels in 2011. In a well known independent survey,
Net Promoter Scores again indicate Sprint is the only one of the four major carriers to show improvement sequentially.
And our improvement has been so significant, we have moved up two spots in the major carrier rankings in the past
two years.
Perhaps Q4 2011 will be most remembered for the collapse in December of AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile
USA. We believe the industry outlook would have been bleak had this takeover succeeded. And we also believe that
Sprint's successful championing of a healthy industry and customer choice will have lasting benefits for the way
business customers and consumers view Sprint.
Please turn to slide 12. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, our total net subscriber
additions in the fourth quarter of 1.6 million are the best in six years, bringing our full-year number to 5.1 million net
adds, which is Sprint's highest number of net adds since 2001. Total customers served on the Sprint and Nextel
platforms reached 55 million at the end of 2011, yet another new all-time company record. I'm pleased to report that for
the Sprint postpaid platform, 2011 is our second consecutive year of being net port positive against our competition,
which means more customers switched to Sprint from our competitors then switched from Sprint to competitors, and
total postpaid net adds are our best since 2006.
Our 161,000 postpaid net adds in the quarter represent our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement.
We entered the fourth quarter expecting an even better performance. But during the quarter, we saw unprecedented
discounting on devices, especially for Apple products, which we decided not to participate in. We made a conscious
decision not to chase meeting our net add guidance under these unforeseen circumstances, believing it was more
prudent to shoot for delivering an OIBDA result exceeding the top end of the OIBDA guidance range we had provided
instead. This was a tough decision for us to make during the fourth quarter. Not only had Sprint never missed a single
guidance metric in the past four years; but for me, personally I had never missed one guidance number during my long
career. So Sprint's streak and my streak are now broken, but we believe we made the right decision.
Sprint's 40% iPhone gross add mix far outpaced our competitors. The gross add mix of sales is the best early indicator
of long-term profitability with the iPhone, and we were pleased with the results. We continue to believe the iPhone will

bring significant value to Sprint over the long term, and early results are in line with or better than our business case
assumptions.
Turning to slide 13, in addition to success with the iPhone, we continue to see strong demand for our other compelling
devices, including our industry leading portfolio of 4G devices. The Samsung Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch not only has
the longest device name in wireless industry history, but it was recently named the best Android phone by Kiplinger's
Personal Finance and America's number one smartphone by PC World. In the fourth quarter, 86% of our Sprint
postpaid handset sales were smartphones; and penetration of our Sprint platform base reached 66%, both all-time highs.
We also had a strong quarter and year and wholesale and in prepaid, which Joe will cover later.
Turning to slide 14, in conclusion, we've come a long way in four years. Our top line is growing again. Our customer
experience has gone from the worst to arguably the best in the industry, and our once battered brand is strengthening
and gaining momentum. Offsetting the downward revenue and earnings pressures of a subscale wireline business and a
declining business on the Nextel platform, we have a vibrant, growing Sprint platform that will fuel our continued
growth. Since 2007, Nextel platform annual revenues are down approximately $9 billion annually and wireline
revenues are down another approximately $2 billion annually, but our Sprint platform revenues are up over $4 billion
annually since 2007.
We've exercised financial discipline in the past four years, including large reductions in CapEx and OpEx to gain the
financial stability to give us the confidence to begin the investment phase of our turnaround. 2011 marks not only the
first annual service revenue increase, but also our first positive operating income since 2006. And as mentioned,
excluding the one-time events of the Nextel acquisition and last quarter's iPhone and Network Vision overlays and in
spite of the continued declines associated with our Nextel platform and wireline, 2011 delivered our first sequential
improvement in pro forma adjusted OIBDA in seven years.
Since I arrived four years ago, we have known we eventually needed to deal with the ever-increasing cost drain of
running an additional 2G network. During this period, we simultaneously improved network performance but also
saved every dollar possible so we can invest our money not in the technology available in those years, but in new
technology not available until now.
To help buy time, we launched Boost Unlimited in the first quarter of 2009 using our spare iDEN capacity. Boost has
generated $5 billion in incremental revenues on the iDEN platform since that time. We waited until network
infrastructure was developed that was: one, multimodal so that we could refarm the valuable iDEN 800-MHz
frequencies; two, that could also provide an iDEN quality push-to-talk experience on the new network, what we now
call Sprint Direct Connect; and three, which was capable of providing 4G LTE service on our FD or Frequency
Division spectrum.
Steve Elfman will speak next to give an update on our deployment status and plans for this year, but I am pleased with
our progress to date. I periodically discuss Network Vision support with my CEO peers and our key partners, and I am
very confident in their commitment to this effort and the significant opportunities they provide Sprint.
I'm proud of the accomplishments we've made in this first phase of our turnaround, and I look forward to the call two
years from now when we'll be looking back o the second turnaround phase, our investment phase, the successful
deployment of Network Vision, and looking forward to Phase 3, the margin expansion which will follow.
I will now turn the call over to Steve to discuss our Network Vision progress. Steve?
Steven Lawrence Elfman
Thank you, Dan.
Turning to slide 16, we are pleased with the progress of Network Vision, which continues to be on schedule and on
budget. In fact, as Dan mentioned, I'm pleased that we announced today the launch of our fifth and sixth major cities,
Kansas City and Baltimore, by midyear 2012.

I want to remind you of the objective of Network Vision and then discuss our progress and some milestones. Network
Vision is expected to allow us to achieve several key objectives. First, we expect to greatly improve our cost structure
through the consolidation of our networks as well as improving the coverage within our 3G footprint and reducing our
in-footprint roaming expenses. Second, we expect the program will allow us to optimize our spectrum assets through
the redeployment of our 800-MHz spectrum to both 3G and ultimately 4G LTE, which is expected to improve the
performance of our network and improve customer experience. Third, our multimodal technology is both more cost
effective and provides the flexibility to enable spectrum hosting. Lastly, through the implementation of new PTT,
push-to-talk, technology and devices on the Sprint platform, we can maintain our leadership and eliminate the Nextel
platform.
Turning to slide 17, we are excited about the improvements to the customer's experience and the technological
flexibility that Network Vision is expected to produce. But the greatest advantage to the company and to our
shareholders is the expected financial benefits. The project should finally remove some of the duplicative fixed costs
that come with running two wireless networks. We expect to reduce our total tower position by more than 44%, from
approximately 68,000 towers down to 38,000 towers; and at the same time, greatly reduce both 3G and 4G roaming
costs.
The consolidation is not only expected to improve our operating costs, it should also significantly improve Sprint's
carbon footprint, reinforcing that Sprint's commitment to our green initiatives is integral to cost efficiency. And
Network Vision is expected to improve our capital efficiency, reducing our per-unit cost of both gigabytes and minutes
by approximately 50%.
I also want to remind everyone of the high degree of cost certainty we have written into our vendor contracts to support
Network Vision. Essentially, all labor and execution costs in our contracts are predetermined. In other words, the
majority of the expense risk associated with getting the build done lies with our vendors, and our only exposure to
additional costs our scope changes.
Turning to slide 17, so where are we? We are on track with our 2012 goals for deployment, and things are going very
well. We have executed against all of our major 3G and 4G technical milestones. The detailed deployment and resource
plans have been completed by our three vendors, and they have been staffing up to meet the build-out demand. We're
well underway on leasing, zoning, and tower construction on our 38,000 sites, with a goal of having 12,000 higher
density sites on air by the end of this year.
In addition, we expect that approximately 9,600 Nextel platform sites will be decommissioned by the end of 2012. We
continue to expect that the build will be largely completed by the end of 2013, with some overflow of smaller markets
in the first half of 2014.
During the fourth quarter, our first true multimodal permanent site went on air, and the first cluster of cell sites
launched in Kankakee, Illinois, and they are meeting our performance and coverage targets. The development and
deployment is proceeding within our budget targets. Our agreements with the major tower companies were finalized in
Q4. In January, we announced four major markets scheduled to launch LTE by midyear, to which we added two more
today.
In addition, we announced our first three LTE devices, which are coming by midyear 2012. And we have been
launching phones that are 800-MHz band Class 10 compatible since the middle of last year. This means that as we
redeploy our 800-MHz spectrum, many of our 3G customers should get an immediate and very noticeable benefit.
And in the fourth quarter, we launched our Sprint Direct Connect product, including three new phones on the Sprint
platform, which we are confident is the best push-to-talk product that is available in the market today and is central to
our customer recapture strategy as we decommission the Nextel platform. And while people are focused on the
build-out of LTE, it's important to remember that every site we build is expected to provide immediate improvement in
the network experience for all our customers and roaming cost reduction for Sprint.
Going forward in 2012, we plan to provide an update each quarter on cell sites on air, sites decommissioned on the
Nextel platform, and any significant build milestones. My entire team and I and our three vendors have a strong focus

on cost containment and capital efficiency and will continue to drive the program forward to remain on schedule and on

Thank you and I'll now turn it over to Joe to review our detailed financial results.
Joseph J. Euteneuer
Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
As Dan outlined, the past four years, culminating with 2011, have been years of recovery in which Sprint has worked
hard to put in place the operational and financial improvements we needed to support our next phase of investment. The
recovery effort has been very successful. In a highly competitive market, these successes were hard won and do not
come without a huge amount of work and ingenuity. We have effectively turned our core business around, producing
the financial and operational stability that now allows us to invest for future OIBDA growth and margin expansion. I
will go through the detailed Q4 results in a moment, but first I want to discuss how we are looking at 2012.
As 2011 was a year of continued year over year improvement, 2012 will be a year of even greater focus on the bottom
line. We expect to continue to grow the customer base in our core business on the Sprint platform while focusing on
hitting our bottom line numbers as we invest in network architecture, which we expect will be the foundation of future
margin expansion. We will provide additional visibility into our key metrics in 2012 to give you more detailed
information on the operational components of our business.
With the launch of the iPhone, the implementation of Network Vision, and the thinning of the Nextel network, we have
a lot of moving parts. And we want to give you more tools to understand the underlying dynamics of our business. This
commitment is reflected in the new disclosures we have provided today.
With that, I will review the fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results. Total service revenues for the fourth quarter were
$7.8 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2010. The growth of our total net service
revenues is primarily due to the growth in postpaid subscribers and ARPU on the Sprint platform as well as the strong
growth of prepaid subscribers on the Sprint platform, partially offset by declines in our Nextel platform postpaid and
prepaid subscriber bases and Nextel platform postpaid ARPU as well as wireline revenues.
In the full year 2011, wireline revenues declined by approximately $714 million. And revenues from the Nextel
platform declined by almost $2 billion, which means that service revenues from our core ongoing Sprint platform
wireless business grew by nearly $3.5 billion or 17%.
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter was $842 million, which includes approximately $54 million in
Network Vision related expenses and an estimated $630 million in net OIBDA impact related to the launch of the
iPhone. In order to provide appropriate comparables to our numbers, we have estimated the incremental impact of the
iPhone launch to our adjusted OIBDA results for the fourth quarter.
The estimate of $630 million includes only the cost of estimated incremental gross adds and upgrades as well as the
subsidy rate variance resulting from the mix shift from other handsets, and backs out the estimated incremental revenue
benefit that comes from additional customers. Going forward, it will become increasingly difficult to estimate the
incremental impact as the iPhone becomes an integrated part of our handset sales. Thus, in the future we will only
provide the total impact of the iPhone on the quarter and will not attempt to estimate the incremental impact.
Excluding the estimated $684 million of Network Vision and iPhone cost in Q4, pro forma adjusted OIBDA was over
$1.5 billion, up $211 million or 16% year over year and up $89 million or 6% sequentially. Excluding these
investments, consolidated pro forma adjusted OIBDA margin was 19.6% of net service revenues, a 100 basis point
sequential improvement and a 200 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Now let's turn to slide 23 and discuss our wireless results in more detail. Total wireless service revenues for the fourth
quarter were $7 billion, which is a 2% sequential increase and a 7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding
the revenues from the Nextel platform, fourth quarter wireless service revenues from our core Sprint platform were

$6.2 billion, up $207 million or 3% sequentially, and up $912 million or 17% over the fourth quarter of 2010.
Dan has taken you through the trajectory of our very strong subscriber improvements over the past year and
historically, and now I'd like to review our Q4 results in more detail. Total company postpaid gross adds for the fourth
quarter were just over 2.1 million, a 275,000 improvement sequentially and a 213,000 or 11% improvement from the
fourth quarter of 2010.
Total postpaid churn was 1.98%, which was seven basis points higher than the third quarter and 12 basis points higher
than the same period a year ago. As Dan mentioned, postpaid voluntary churn was at its best level for any quarter since
2005, so over 100% of the churn increase his involuntary churn. The vast majority of the increase in involuntary churn
was due to two related items.
First, in the second and third quarters, some of our indirect partners self-funded the retail price points of certain
handsets down to zero. We tightened our credit standards during the third and fourth quarters to stem further impacts of
these types of promotional activity. In the second and third quarters, we also launched an instant rebate promotion in
the direct channel. While these actions were taken separately and attracted both prime and subprime customers, they
both had the effect of significantly reducing the out-of-pocket expense for customers at the point of sale, which for
subprime customers has a high correlation with early-life involuntary churn.
Another lesser impact was due to higher customer balances. As we have steadily increased ARPU throughout the year,
we have seen some increase in customers churning because they are unable to make their monthly payments. This is the
expected impact of the strong ARPU growth we have seen. And with these increases and ongoing customer revenues,
we understood we would see some negative impact to customer churn. However, as expected, the strong ongoing
revenue growth of the subscriber base more than offsets this impact.
So let me be clear. While we are experiencing some temporary impact to our involuntary churn due to the actions taken
in the second and third quarters and due to our extraordinary ARPU growth, we believe the underlying fundamentals of
our business are extremely sound, and we expect them to continue to improve. Our voluntary churn is the lowest since
2005, and we expect to see involuntary churn improve after Q1 once the impact of these items has had the time to move
through our subscriber base.
Going forward, we expect the launch of the iPhone will continue to have a positive impact on our core Sprint platform
postpaid churn. This benefit will happen over time as our customers hit their upgrade eligibility and the iPhone
becomes available to them. As Dan mentioned, ahead of the iPhone launch we strategically standardized the term of
upgrade eligibility for 20 months, and we increased smartphone early termination fees in order to smooth the impact of
upgrades and reduce the financial impact of the iPhone investment. This means that the churn benefits of the iPhone
will layer in over time, but also that the profitability profile of our broader customer base should be improved as
changes to ETFs and upgrade eligibility have been applied to many other devices, not just the iPhone.
The company's total postpaid net adds for the quarter were 161,000, comprised of 539,000 Sprint platform postpaid net
adds, which included approximately 168,000 customers recaptured from the Nextel platform. This was offset by a net
loss of 378,000 postpaid customers on the Nextel platform. We expect this negative trend on the Nextel platform to
continue and to accelerate throughout 2012 as we commence decommissioning of the Nextel network and work to
recapture customers on our core Sprint platform.
Concurrent with the strong postpaid subscriber growth we have seen on our core Sprint platform, we have also been
very successful in growing our Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU is now over $61.00,
which is 6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010, due largely to the adoption of our $10.00 premium data smartphone
charge. 86% of postpaid Sprint platform handset sales in the fourth quarter were smartphones. And the Sprint platform
postpaid handset-based penetration has now reached 66%, which means we expect to continue to see additional ARPU
improvement in our core Sprint platform postpaid business throughout 2012.
Moving on to slide 24, prepaid ARPU for the full year 2011 was over $27, which was 1% lower than for the full year of
2010. While total prepaid ARPU for 2011 was lower, the prepaid business had strong ARPU growth throughout the
year on the Boost and Virgin Beyond Talk brands, offset by the growing mix of Assurance customers, which while

lower in ARPU, have a very favorable churn and profitability profile. Boost in particular had very strong ARPU growth
of 5% versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
One of the most positive trends in the prepaid business is our very strong results in prepaid churn. In the fourth quarter
for 2011, total prepaid churn was 3.68% compared to 4.93% in the fourth quarter of 2010. While the growing mix of
Assurance customers helps to keep our total prepaid churn rate low, it was not the biggest factor in the year-over-year
decline in rate. Larger impacts were due to year-over-year rate reductions in both the Boost and the Virgin brands due
to the shift from the Nextel platform to the Sprint platform on Boost and the shift from pay-by-the-minute customers to
monthly smartphone customers on Virgin. The prepaid business has been a strong and important growth mechanism for
our company, and we expect to continue to show growth in subscribers and revenues in our prepaid business in the
coming year.
We have also seen very strong growth during the year in our wholesale business. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we had
954,000 wholesale and affiliate net adds, which is 143% growth from the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 14% sequential
increase. This very strong growth in the fourth quarter was fueled by prepaid MVNO [Mobile Virtual Network
Operator] agreements made in 2011, which represents profitable growth for Sprint with little to no upfront investment.
Let's move on now to wireless expenses on slide 25. Sprint platform variable network expenses, which consist of
roaming, long distance, backhaul, and premium service expense, were $845 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and
were up approximately 20% over the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase is due to an increase in 3G and particularly
4G roaming cost. 3G roaming costs in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $215 million, up 4% from the fourth quarter of
2010. 3G roaming cost increases are primarily the result of the growth in the number of Sprint platform postpaid
customers, the growth of data usage by our customer base, and our strategic decision over the past four years to
decrease our capital spending on legacy network improvements in order to reserve investment dollars for Network
Vision.
4G WiMAX roaming costs in the fourth quarter were $162 million, up more than 500% from just the $26 million
versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Because of the launch of Network Vision, our 2012 3G roaming expenses are
expected to be capped at 2011 levels. As a result of the Clearwire agreements we announced in the fourth quarter, we
now have cost certainty on our quarterly 4G roaming expense, which will decrease by approximately 25% from our 4Q
exiting expense to Q1 and is expected to remain constant for the year. Despite these increases to roaming costs in the
current period and because of our strong Sprint platform ARPU growth, we have been able to maintain stable, variable
network margins on the Sprint platform. With cost certainty on our WiMAX related 4G expenses in the next couple of
years as well as significant 3G roaming savings as we light up Network Vision markets, we believe we have a clear
pathway to margin improvement as we execute on our network improvement plans.
Total wireless cost of service in the fourth quarter was $2.3 billion, a $41 million or 2% improvement sequentially, due
largely to seasonally lower data roaming cost and lower service and repair cost. Of our total cost of service in the fourth
quarter, approximately $352 million, or 15%, were network costs related to Nextel platform, which we expect will be
eliminated upon the completion of Network Vision.
Total wireless subsidy expense increased $540 million, or 46%, from the fourth quarter of 2010; and $561 million, or
48%, sequentially. Approximately 20% of the sequential increase was due to higher volumes and approximately 80%
of the sequential increase was rate related, largely associated with the launch of the iPhone. While the upfront
investment in the iPhone is substantial, we expect that these customers will produce a strong return on investment in the
later years.
Wireless selling, general, and administrative cost increased $136 million sequentially and $65 million over the fourth
quarter of 2010. The sequential increase was largely associated with a $76 million higher cost in sales. $75 million of
which was a new expense in the sales line due to reimbursements for point-of-sale discounts for iPhone, which are
directly sourced by distributors being accounted for as a sales expense. These kinds of handset discounts where not
directly sourced by the retailer are recognized as subsidy.

For the full year 2011, wireless SG&A increased by $257 million, due largely to an increase in selling expense as a
result of higher postpaid and prepaid gross adds as well as the direct sourced iPhone sales cost. This was offset by a
$120 million decrease in customer care cost, which we have been able to streamline even as we've been making huge
strides in the quality of our service. While total wireless SG&A has increased year over year, wireless SG&A as a
percent of revenue has improved 100 basis points, even with higher variable costs associated with higher volumes,
reflecting our continued strong cost discipline.
Wireless adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter was $668 million, which was $546 million lower than the third quarter
and $378 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the estimated impacts of the iPhone and Network
Vision, pro forma wireless segment adjusted OIBDA improved sequentially by 8% and showed year-over-year
improvement of $306 million or 29%. Pro forma wireless adjusted OIBDA margins excluding the impact of the iPhone
and Network Vision were 19.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 16% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Wireline OIBDA in the fourth quarter declined $89 million or 33% from the fourth quarter of 2010 and $290 million or
27% for the full year 2010. Approximately 78% of the wireline OIBDA decrease is due to a decline in revenues related
to resetting of our intercompany transfer rate to reflect current market prices at the beginning of 2011, which is neutral
at the consolidated level. Wireline OIBDA in 2012 is expected to decline by approximately $350 million.
Approximately $180 million to $220 million of this decline is expected to be due to intercompany rate changes, which
are neutral to consolidated OIBD. And approximately $70 million to $80 million is related to cable voice-over-IP
migrations.
Moving on to cash and liquidity on slide 26, we ended the fourth quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately
$6.7 billion, including $5.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under
our revolver.
During the quarter, we raised approximately $4 billion through private placement, including $1 billion of 11.5%
unsecured notes due in 2021 and approximately $3 billion of 9% guaranteed notes due in 2018. The proceeds of these
notes significantly enhanced our liquidity position, allowing us to pay down $2.25 billion of notes due in March 2012
ahead of schedule. Our next loan maturity totaling $300 million is due in May of 2013, followed by a $1.5 billion
maturity in the fourth quarter of 2013. We believe we have a clear runway to allow us to continue the investments in
the iPhone and in Network Vision.
I previously gave you guidance that we would be raising approximately $5 billion to $7 billion excluding the Clearwire
investment we announced in Q4, and this remains our intention.
Our discussions regarding vendor financing are progressing well with all of our vendors. It is a time-consuming process
because it involves multiple parties, but we are pleased with our progress to date. Our continued expectation is that we
will have an agreement in place before the end of the second quarter. In the meantime, we continue to watch the debt
markets and we will be opportunistic with our options.
Our accrued capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest of $109 million and including $370 million of Network
Vision capital were $900 million in the fourth quarter compared to $760 million in the third quarter and $608 million in
the fourth quarter of 2010. Total capital expenses for the full year 2011 were approximately $2.9 billion, which
includes $590 million in capital expenses related to Network Vision.
Rebanding spend for the calendar year 2011 was approximately $123 million, net of a $135 million MSS settlement
from DISH TerreStar. Inclusive of this settlement, total spend on the rebanding project to date has been approximately
$2.95 billion. We estimate that we have approximately $600 million to $700 million of rebanding work remaining,
expected to be split between 2012 and 2013, and with the possibility of going into 2014 depending on the timing of the
Mexican rebanding plan.
Free cash flow was $257 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to negative $273 million in the third quarter of
2011 and to $913 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The year-over-year decrease in free cash flow is primarily
associated with lower OIBDA and higher capital expenditures. Free cash flow sequential improvement of $530 million
was primarily associated with a sequential decline in working capital of $1 billion, primarily associated with the timing

of vendor payments and lower accrued dealer commissions and rebate reserves as we wound down our instant rebate
promotions in our retail stores during Q3. Free cash flow in Q4 also benefited from the one-time payment of $135
million for the MSS settlement.
Finally, I want to outline our expectations for 2012. Total adjusted OIBDA for the full year 2012 is expected to be
between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, including the impact of the iPhone and approximately $1.1 billion of dilution
associated with Network Vision. To achieve this, we expect total net service revenue growth of approximately 4% to
6%.
With the Network Vision project ramping up, the quarterly timing of OIBDA is expected to be somewhat fluid.
However, our expectation is that OIBDA in the first half of the year will be slightly lower than in the second half. In
general, our quarterly OIBDA will also be affected by the timing of the launch of any subsequent versions of the
iPhone. The expectation is that our OIBDA trough will be U-shaped through 2012 and then will start to ramp in 2013,
followed by strong margin expansion in 2014.
As we have discussed previously, we expect that 2012 will be an aggressive investment year with regard to capital
expenditures as we pursue a rapid and efficient execution of Network Vision. Total capital expenditures are expected to
be approximately $6 billion excluding capitalized interest.
In addition, based on the plans outlined by Steve earlier, in the first quarter of 2012 we have revised our estimates of
the expected useful lives of certain Nextel platform assets through the end of 2013. Accordingly, approximately $2
billion in net book value of these assets is expected to be accelerated through depreciation expense, of which a
disproportionate amount is expected to be recognized during 2012.
The exact timing of the acceleration is dependent upon when the assets are expected to be phased out of service. These
estimates are derived from our internal decommissioning plan, which is still evolving. We estimate the incremental
effect of accelerated depreciation related to Nextel assets in our 2012 results to be in the range of approximately $1.2
billion to $1.5 billion, of which approximately $450 million to $550 million will be recognized in the first quarter of
2012. We will continue to update you on these amounts quarterly as we refine our plans for Nextel decommissioning.
I want to end by reiterating my confidence in the strength of our core underlying business and in the pathway we
believe we have created to future OIBDA growth and margin expansion. We are confident in the steps we are taking to
improve our profitability and in our ability to execute on our strategic plan. The entire management team has a sharp
focus on execution and profitability through the next few quarters of investment, and we are excited about the future.
I want to thank you for all your support, and I'll turn the call over back to Brad for Q&A.

<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi, thanks for taking the questions, two questions. First, just given the fast pace of iPhone

And then, Dan, turning over to the strategic side, slide 14 that you went through, you went through a lot of the
operational progress for Sprint. But can you talk more about where Sprint is positioned strategically? With T-Mobile
still in the market, cable choosing to work with Verizon, it seems like you have some real competition to go after the
remaining partners who have spectrum, capital, or both. So can you just put in perspective for us what Sprint is doing to
put the company in the best position to either partner or buy spectrum as we move forward over the next 12 to 24
months? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Let me take the second part first, Michael. There's no question with our equity currently where
it is and the other investments we're making over the next couple of years that we won't have perhaps as many options
as we normally would have. We certainly will entertain any kinds of transactions, partnering opportunities, or what
have you that we believe are in the interest of our shareholders, and I still believe there will be a number of them that
could present themselves over the next couple of years.
The importance of the decision of AT&T to abandon its acquisition of T-Mobile is it clearly provides many more
opportunities for us and for companies outside of the top two to become much stronger competitors over time. So we
will continue to evaluate and look at all the opportunities that present themselves over the next couple of years. So the
first question, I'll let Brad handle.
<A - Brad Hampton>: Hey, Mike. We're not going to give specific guidance on iPhone units or mix, but we continue
to be pleased with the results we've seen consistent with what we told you about in Q4.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin [Credit Suisse].
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Hi, thanks a lot. I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more color, Joe, on the churn
trends that you expect through the course of the year. So as the temporary impact that you saw in churn in the fourth
quarter eases, how should we expect churn to come down? And how does that translate into subscriber, postpaid
subscriber trends during the course of the year?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: So I think look, on churn we said that once we get through the first quarter, which we
think is the clearing period of the stuff that happened in 2011, we plan on having continued progress in the churn
number. We haven't given any specific guidance. But when you think about the overall revenue growth we need to
achieve to hit our OIBDA results, it's blended in there.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: I'll hit the second part Jonathan. This is Dan. We haven't provided specific guidance with
respect to postpaid net adds. I think that was the second part of your question, for the year. This will be the year that we
really begin. It already has begun, but much more aggressive active migration of customers off of the iDEN platform.
So what you can expect is continued strong performance and growth on the Sprint platform. That momentum will
continue, but you'll see larger than historical declines on the iDEN platform as we start working toward – we're going
to be decommissioning iDEN cell sites during the year, which will save money. We'll be overtly, proactively migrating
customers off the iDEN platform; so you'll see, if you will, iDEN platform churn go up.
So you have really, like what we've been describing today, you have these, if you will, these three buckets at Sprint.
You've got a very healthy, strong, growing Sprint platform. And you have, if you will, declines year-over-year on the
wireline and on the iDEN platform or Nextel platform side. And those declines on the Nextel platform side will
accelerate in 2013 as we aggressively begin the migration efforts.

<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions; I guess two, if I could. Just first, maybe Joe or
Steve, if you're still on the line, just on the Network Vision pacing, I guess we're targeting maybe 12,000 cell sites to be
on air and running in 2012. But I think, Steve, you mentioned this idea that we're going to be actually taking the whole
network and grinding it down from 68,000 down to 38,000 cell sites. So it sounds like there's quite a bit of work to do
in 2013. But, Joe, it sounds like you're expecting the benefits to start coming through in 2013, even though the bulk of
the work is still being done. I wondered if you guys could just tie out the thought about how to think about Vision
pacing and spending and how it all ties with guidance.
If I could just – the second question, Joe, in the fourth quarter you did a lot of work to try to pull out the Vision spend
and the iPhone subsidies. It looked like something clearly had changed in the underlying cost structure of the company
in 4Q versus 3Q. And I was wondering if you could talk about what levers got pulled to try to get the margins where
they were, net of those things. Thanks.
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: This is Steve. I'll answer the first question for you. I think that really the way to look
at it is the first 12,000 sites, if you will, what we're doing this year is in really the larger cities, densely populated,
higher use cell sites where we can get rather quick return on reduction in roaming and in coverage. So that's why the
pacing is as it is in 2012. But also, we will be decommissioning, as I said, 9,600 sites this year from our Nextel
platform and getting the associated benefit in utilities, in maintenance, and a certain amount of rent also in 2012. So
we're going to see good benefits starting to accrue this year and will also improve in 2013 as a lot of our sites begin to
go on air as well in 2013. Hopefully, that helps.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: David, in regards to the second part of your question, I think we talked a little bit on the
call about the service and repair, what happened on the cost of service line. But I think if you look across the expenses,
we have been focused not only in the last couple quarters, but over the last four years of taking expenses out of the
business, as Dan demonstrated in his slides. And I think all you see is some additional culmination of the focus we put
in the fourth quarter to deliver the strong OIBDA results we posted.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen [Macquarie].
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Thanks. I wondered if you could tell us when we could see an inflection point on the Network
Vision dilution, i.e., when is the peak deficit quarter between the cost and some of the anticipated savings on both
roaming and lower iDEN tower expense?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: I think on the call I tried to tell you that it's pretty fluid as we time all of the Network
Vision activity, and we anticipated it's going to be more like a U rather than a V. And it will be – OIBDA will happen
first, so it will be probably towards the latter part of 2012; and then a quarter, give or take, where you'll see then the
free cash flow follow it. But it will clearly be definitely in a U pattern versus a V.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Dixon [FBR Capital Markets].
<Q - David M. Dixon>: Thank you and good morning. I wondered as we look at the churn strategy for FY 2012, Joe,
you tried to dimension the impacts in the fourth quarter that we saw, the RadioShack channel and the premium plan
withdrawal and the pricing increase. So I was wondering if you could help us quantify each of those effects. I'm
concerned whether there's any change in your credit policy. And then perhaps give us some insight as we look forward
on iPhone churn, leading indicators there, perhaps just in terms of customer satisfaction and network performance after
the initial hiccups. That would be terrific. Thank you.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: David, this is Dan. I think as far as the churn is concerned on the postpaid side, and this again
is really Sprint platform that we described, is we saw some impact, as we mentioned in Q3, involuntary, that

continuing, if you will, increasing in Q4 and then in Q1. And then we would expect to see that begin to lower. You
asked a question about credit. We tightened credit in Q3 and in Q4 after we saw what was going on in the channels, so
we have taken actions in that regard.
With respect to the iPhone and churn, that obviously is a very important element of, we'll call it the overall profitability
of the iPhone, the customer lifetime value, and we won't see that over time. What we've seen early on in terms of the
profitability metrics are first of all, a very high gross add percentage. The other thing from a churn perspective is, again,
you have lifetime churn, but you also see historically what happens to Sprint voluntary churn in the quarters where
iPhones are launched. And in each of the previous five quarters when iPhones have been launched, our voluntary churn
has gone in the wrong direction. And so this quarter, this past quarter is the first quarter of the six quarters where the
new iPhone has been launched where we've seen both a sequential and a year-over-year improvement in voluntary
churn. So early on, we definitely are seeing those churn characteristics.
The other thing I would say is that from a cost of service perspective, not only are we seeing lower usage of the
network on iPhones and Androids, so our business case is continuing to perform there; but our calls to care early on –
again, it's only the first few months, is lower than it has been for any of our high-end devices in the early months. So, if
you will, our operating costs are also looking good in terms of the investment and compared to our business case.
And again, the last piece on iPhone is we also sold more of them than our initial plans had indicated as well, 1.8
million. So we see, at least early on, no reason to be concerned at all about our volume commitments, which has come
up on previous calls. So we feel good about the early indications of the iPhone, especially the 40% gross add number,
which is almost two times the rate that we've seen on the other two major carriers.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong [Goldman Sachs].
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Dan, maybe first question just on the handset upgrade
percentage in the quarter, I guess I would have expected that to really hit an all-time high with the iPhone launch; but at
9%, more in line with your average over time. It definitely indicates some discipline on the handset upgrade cycle. But
can you help us think through your ability to really keep this metric under control as you move through 2012?
And then, Joe, just quickly on the EBITDA guidance, just helping us think through the pacing through 2012, I think
you're implying an average of about $950 million a quarter. You mentioned first half lower than second half. Just
maybe to put some parameters around this, do you think the fourth quarter result that we just had, the $842 million,
represents the trough for company EBITDA? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Jason, the first part is, again, getting back to the iPhone discussion as well, what we did in
advance of the iPhone is we extended, if you will, the period of time that customers would have to stay with us before
they'd be eligible for upgrades, and we did away with our loyalty program. In addition, what we did in the later part of
the year, and that we will continue that discipline in 2012, is be selective in terms of, we'll call it customer outreach on
upgrades. That has traditionally been a way that we keep churn low is to get customers to sign new two-year contracts.
But our customers on contract is at a very strong level compared to historical levels, so we feel good about that. So
you're exactly right. There's a discipline associated with upgrades, and that's another reason why 40% gross add mix on
the iPhone is good to see. We'll watch this in 2012, but we're not providing any specific guidance with respect to what
our upgrade percentages will be in 2012.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: And in regards to your OIBDA question, you've got to remember about the seasonality of
the business. So as you're going into the first quarter, you're not really going to expect much. The second quarter, you
might get a little more. Remember, the third quarter you typically have those added expenses, and then your fourth
quarter ends up being your strong one as you exit the year. So it is pretty fluid. Remember, I want to give you a caution.
We don't know whether there's going to be another iPhone, so that can always throw off the timing of what happens on
our OIBDA. And again, we're just starting Network Vision and we're working through that and trying to be on an

accelerated pace. So I would look at the seasonal pattern as you try to market this out on a quarter-by-quarter basis.

Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik [UBS].
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, thanks. I guess, Joe, first a quick follow-up to that last question. So does the guidance
that the second half OIBDA expected to be stronger than the first half EBITDA not include expectations for a fourth
quarter refresh on the iPhone? That's first.
And then, Dan, a quick follow-up on some of your earlier comments; can you just talk about, I think you said that you
didn't hit the postpaid guidance for 2011 because of discounting with the iPhone or Apple products. If you could just
give a little bit more color on that, and then maybe just talk about the competitive environment as we look out into
2012. I think Jason touched on the upgrade rates and the eligibility changes that most of the major carriers have made.
But T [T-Mobile] had a data price increase. Are you seeing any lessening of the overall competitive intensity in the
industry as, seemingly, carriers focus more on margins rather than market share? Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: So in regards to your first question, remember; as we start getting through the year and
Steve continues to execute as he's laying out, we're going to get the benefits and start seeing benefits towards the back
half of the year. So we are considering the iPhone, the timing of which is really hard to determine. But as we start
getting better roaming and start eliminating sites on iDEN and stuff, we'll start seeing those benefits as we exit the year.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: For the second part, generally you tend to see more promotional activity and more aggressive
pricing in Q4 because it's the holiday period. You see it in retail. You see it across all industries, and we're not immune
to that. So as we talk about 2012, you're going to see some seasonality in terms of the aggressiveness of pricing. And
we generally, we'll probably see some of it come back in this Q4 as well in 2012, but things get a little bit more rational
now in Q1 and Q2 and perhaps in Q3.
But what we saw in Q4 of 2011 was unusual even by traditional seasonality history in that generally, you just don't see
any discounting on iPhones. And we saw it be very common in both Verizon and AT&T to see $30 per device and up
discounts from the, if you will, the normal pricing, the $200 or the $100 or what have you, they would be, if you will,
$170 and $70 instead, and that was unusual. We saw some 4G LTE devices at very low rates that we don't normally
see. So the device pricing in Q4 was much lower than we had anticipated and discounting on devices that traditionally
had not been discounted, and we just decided that we weren't going to go there.

And you last question comes from the line of Brett Feldman [Deutsche Bank].
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Thanks. And just to follow up with some of the handset discussions that we were having earlier,
when you had your analyst meeting, you talked about how important the iPhone was going to be to the business going
ahead. But since then, you signed a new deal with Clearwire to basically have unlimited WiMAX access to their
network. How has that influenced the way you're thinking about the way you're putting handsets into the market this
year? Are you expecting to be maybe a bit more aggressive around the WiMAX devices? And if so, to what extent has
that been factored into the EBITDA guidance you gave?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: We obviously have a very large base on WiMAX. A lot of customers currently use, if you will,
the Clearwire or the WiMAX platform, and we'll continue to market and sell devices this year that operate on that
platform. And as you know, what really distinguishes Sprint as well is the fact that our pricing for handsets is
unlimited. It's not unlimited on data cards or on mobile hotspots, but it is on handsets. So the pricing arrangement that
we have with Clearwire is very helpful in that regard, that clarity, that surety, that ability for us to continue that offer
with these devices for the next couple of years.

Our focus with Clearwire really going forward in terms of handsets and technologies has to do with LTE-TD, which
they've announced that they'll be putting into their networks. So expect, we hope again, these things are fluid, but
probably in the 2013 timeframe you'd begin to see devices that we'll start offering that will work on Clearwire's new
LTE network that they will begin to build in 2013. So we would be, if you will, using Clearwire's WiMAX network for
a number of years as we have a lot of devices that are out there. But we'll begin introducing in 2013 devices on the new
LTE network that will utilize that capability that Clearwire will be bringing to market, so we have a mix of those over
time. And yes, that was all, if you will, considered as we built our OIBDA plan for 2012 and going forward, but the big
element is what Joe mentioned in his remarks was, if you will, both a reduction and a derisking of, if you will, the
roaming expenses associated with Clearwire's 4G service in 2012 because it's a fixed amount. Thanks.
