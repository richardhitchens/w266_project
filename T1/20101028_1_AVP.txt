MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Tiffany and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to Avon's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over
to your Amy Chasen, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. Miss. Chasen, you may begin your conference.
Amy Low Chasen, Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss Avon's third quarter results. With me on this call are
Andrea Jung, Avon's Chairman and CEO; and Chuck Cramb, Vice Chairman and CFO.
I'll refer you to the cautionary statement in today's earnings release as well as our non-GAAP reconciliation in the
Appendix to today's slides and also available on the Investor Relation's section of our Web site. Today on the call, we'll
focus only on adjusted non-GAAP financial measures as we always do. With that I'll turn the call over to Andrea to
give her perspective on quarter and then Chuck will take you through the details of the quarter. Then we'll take your
questions. Andrea?
Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Amy. I just want to begin this morning's call with my own qualititative perspective on Avon's performance
during the quarter and then as Amy said, I'll turn it over to Chuck and he's going to provide more details, outlook, at

our results and then we'll take your Q&A.
So after a strong first half sales performance, Avon's overall revenue growth in the third quarter was lower than we
expected at 6% in constant dollars, 4% from the core business and 2% from acquisitions. Our Beauty sales were up 5%
in constant dollars with 1% from units and the remainder from net per unit growth.
Active representatives were up 4%. Top line growth was impacted by a combination of weaker Skin Care results and
some tougher Color comparisons versus year ago as well as some tactical challenges in Brazil and Russia that tempered
sales in the quarter.
Despite this, we maintained our commitment to strategic investments in our key geographies. We'd always planned
higher spending levels in this particular quarter especially in terms of the flow of advertising expense in the year. The
timing of these investments impacted operating margins this quarter.
Specifically in terms of the revenue growth, just a couple of comments on my key takeaways. In Latin America, we're
still pleased with overall sales growth of 13% in constant dollars as very healthy increases in Mexico and Venezuela
balanced Brazil's 7% growth in the quarter. While Brazil has consistently experienced double-digit constant dollar
growth, we had average order challenges in this market in the third quarter.
Our active representative growth was very healthy. However results were pressured by weaker performance in Skin
Care and Color versus year ago record launches. To a lesser extent, service disruption that was unique to Brazil also
contributed to loss sales in the quarter. And there may be some lingering impact from these issues in the fourth quarter.
In Central and Eastern Europe, we had indicated to you in July the third quarter would continue to see single digit
growth. Average order was impacted even more than we thought by weaker demand in both Skin Care and Color.
Active representative growth is comparing against record additions in last year's second half, particularly in Russia.
And we're also facing some macro challenges in Ukraine and Romania where our results are being affected by
economic weakness and new tax legislation in those two markets.
In North America results in the quarter remain pressured. The fields continue to be challenged as we lap last year's
record recruiting drive. From a macro perspective, the overall beauty industry has declined year-to-date in this market
which added headwind to the quarter's performance.
In terms of the overall turnaround plan for this region, we are on track to deliberately reshape the portfolio to Beauty
and to achieve our cost savings targets. However, our key objective to improve representative productivity remains the
largest challenge. This is proving tougher and taking longer. The team is aggressively focused on this critical pillar of
the turnaround as we work to stabilize the North American business and deliver respectable margins in the longer term.
In terms of the operating margin in the quarter, third quarter was always planned to be a heavy investment quarter,
although the lower than expected revenues added further pressure. Advertising was up 36% in this quarter, $31 million
incremental, against key fragrance launches as well as new category opportunities including Hair Care and the Acne
segment. The results of these investments were all strong. We also continued to invest at significant levels in the
representative value proposition, spending an incremental $27 million in the quarter, largely against longer term
channel innovation.
For the full year we continue to expect sales growth of at least mid-single digits in constant dollars. We now expect
adjusted operating margins to be roughly flat. This is after absorbing significant FCPA costs as well as the cost of the
Venezuela devaluation which exceeds 100 basis points. So excluding these items, the company is making progress
improving our underlying profitability while continuing to make the requisite investments for the long term.
So despite quarterly variations in performance, we continue to have our eye on the long term of the business. We've got
a carefully crafted strategy to gain market and channel share. And that remains our consistent strategic roadmap.
Nothing changes in terms of our commitment to the achievement of our corporate financial objective, which includes at
least mid-single digit constant dollar revenue growth and mid teens operating margin by 2013.
So with that, I'll just turn it over to Chuck who's going to give your more details about the quarter.

Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer
Thank you, Andrea. I'm going to jump right into our regional results starting with Latin America. As Andrea said, we
had strong revenue. We had growth of 13% in constant dollars and it was well balanced, well balanced between active
rep growth of 8% and average order size of about 5%. When we think about the countries, in Brazil we were up 7% in
constant dollars. That was dampened somewhat in terms of the comps. New product launches in Skin and Color in
2009 were very, very strong. And then as Andrea mentioned, we did this quarter have some short-term service issues
unique to the Brazilian market.
In the case of Mexico, very strong performance, 14% growth in constant dollars. I think great evidence that that
turnaround has worked and one of the drivers in terms of the Mexican performance is the growth or expansion of our
leadership ranks. Remember, there were a lot of field fundamental issues we were addressing. Really believe those are
well behind us.
And in Venezuela, a great market for us. We've got strong rep growth. We're gaining share. We're obviously benefiting
some from pricing and net revenue then was up over 50% in constant dollar terms. Not only do we look at it from a rep
and average order basis, but also when we look at price mix versus volume, well balanced, 7% on the price mix and 6%
on the volume.
A common theme that you're going to hear throughout this morning when we do the regions is lower manufacturing
costs as manufacturing productivity has been a key element in terms of our overall performance. And the improvement
in gross margin that occurs in Latin America is due to lower manufacturing costs. However, the adjusted operating
margin is about 160 basis points lower than it was a year ago. Significant here are significantly higher investments
primarily in Brazil, both on rep value proposition investments and advertising. In addition, in Latin America we had
some high distribution costs. These are some labor agreements that we had; you know that labor cost increases in Latin
America are higher than in most other parts of the world and it did impact us particularly in the overall distribution
area.
Moving on to North America, and these numbers exclude Silpada, although for external purposes we include it. We're
trying to give you a view of the business with and without Silpada. There's an overall revenue decline in North America
of 10%. It does reflect what's really been another challenging quarter in the U.S. and a part of it is due to headwinds.
The beauty market by our numbers and research is down about 2% year-to-date. In addition, our field numbers are
struggling in terms of comparing to last year when we, at this time, had a very high record recruiting drive. Overall,
then, the Beauty sales were down about 6%, non-Beauty down about 15%, and that's in line with our overall strategy to
emphasize or de-emphasize, I should say, non-Beauty in favor of Beauty business. And our mix for the quarter was
roughly 60-40 Beauty versus non-Beauty showing how that is evolving and working.
From a margin point of view, the operating margin is 110 basis points less than it was last year. With that kind of a
sales reduction, obviously, there will be an impact as we have the deleveraging impact from lower sales. We've also
maintained and actually increased our advertising investment and these have been partly offset by continued cost
reduction activities, although you can't really see it or feel it because of the reduction in sales. But we're well on track
to the commitments that Geralyn has shared with you in terms of her $100 million overall objective.
When we put Silpada in, this chart just quickly shows the Silpada impact. It really impacts the revenue growth by about
seven points. So that minus 10 becomes minus three. And it also impacts the operating, adjusting operating margin by a
full 100 basis points. And I say in here despite amortization, because I want to make sure that people understand that
part of the purchase acquisition price, about $175 million of it are intangibles that will be amortized over 10 years. So
roughly we have about $1.5 million of amortization each month as we work through the overall P&Ls. That's a
non-cash charge to the business.
Central and Eastern Europe, we had sales growth of 2% in constant dollars. We did have a reduction in the average
order size here. And one of the key elements of this is weaker than expected product launches, particularly in the Skin

Care business. We also, as in Latin America, had soft comps against Color where we had very strong growth from new
Color launches this quarter last year. Russia, as a country, revenues were up about 4% in constant dollars.
In terms of active reps, we did have growth of about 3%. Our field fundamentals remain strong in the region. And the
adjusted operating margin was actually 60 basis points higher than it was one year ago. And as I said, common theme,
we've got manufacturing productivity gains. Strong benefits from SSI are really helping us on the margin. And this is
only partially offset by advertising which is up 85% quarter-on-quarter. And remember, we talked about phasing where
second quarter was light, third quarter was going to be heavy in terms of the overall advertising flows.
Moving to Western Europe, Middle East and Africa, very strong revenue growth, we're up 16% in constant dollars and
it is driven by the active rep growth which is up 14%. On country-by-country basis key areas, these have been growth
drivers for us throughout the year. Turkey revenues up 15%. South Africa are up over 60%. In the U.K., which
arguably has some of the same economic challenges that the U.S. has, again we're showing revenue growth of 1%. That
excludes the Liz Earle growth.
Liz Earle, in terms of the total region, did contribute about four points to the region's growth, so the 16% growth, 12%
core business, 4% due to Liz Earle. The adjusted operating margin is up 430 basis points from a year ago at this time.
We're benefiting from the high sales growth. We're leveraging that in terms of the margin but again improved
manufacturing productivity including SSI key elements are driving gross margin in this region.
Asia-Pacific, it really looks pretty much like what we've shown throughout the year. For the quarter, the revenues were
down slightly. We have growth in the Philippines offset by continued weakness in Japan. The operating margin, the
adjusted operating margin is 190 basis points lower than a year ago and that's primarily due to increased investments in
RVP.
In China, we continue to see revenue declines, that's reflecting our transition. Moving away from the hybrid model to
one that focuses on direct selling. In terms of where we are in that transition, we have now launched the new sales
model in 16 cities. Remember last quarter we reported three pilots. We've added 13 more cities at the end of third
quarter, beginning of fourth quarter and early feedback and it really still is very early but the early feedback, both from
our Beauty Boutiques and our representatives, continues to be favorable. In terms of that performance, it generated an
adjusted operating loss a small loss of about $3 million which reflects the sales reduction.
Moving now to the income statement, $2.7 billion of revenue in the quarter. That's up 6% in constant dollars, up to 4%
in reported dollars. We also have acquisitions of 2% impacting those numbers.
As we look now to gross margin, we see 62.8 expands to 64.7 or 190 basis points. Here we're seeing that currency does
help us. We have favorable transaction gains in the quarter offsetting some minor translation losses. Price mix is about
neutral but again, we are getting pricing so pricing is favorable while mix is unfavorable, but the two are netting out to
about 10 basis points. But the real story is in manufacturing productivity, another 110 basis points improvement from a
year ago.
We are continuing to invest in both our brand and our channel. I think that's a key element of this quarter's P&L. Think
about advertising; it's up $31 million in the quarter. That spending is in our key markets: Brazil, Russia and the U.S.
Total spending is $115 million, a 36% increase.
RVP, the rep value proposition, increased investment in RVP, ahead of what you would expect with a sales growth of
$27 million. It's focusing on investments in sales leadership as well as our web enablement tools and the service model
transformation initiative that we started to discuss with you last quarter.
In terms of our overheads; our overall overhead – that's the 2.6 billion or so that we tend to define as overhead – that is
up in the quarter about $25 million. The 2.6 billion, by the way, is for the total year. Of that 25 million, almost all of it
is tied up in the higher investigation costs related to FCPA and then the impact of higher labor costs in Latin America.
By the way, in that number, I've excluded the overheads for Silpada and Liz Earle, because those would be added on,
wouldn't be any comparable base in the prior year. Those overheads would have been about $23 million.

What that does then, if we put it all together, is it shows us with an adjusted operating margin that declined 110 basis
points year-on-year, from 11.4 to 10.3. In terms of currency, overall transaction is significant, both in terms of what
happens to gross margin plus to some benefits in the operating expenses. Translation is somewhat unfavorable, but the
real measure in terms of how we're operating is the 200 basis point reduction.
And if we think about that 200 basis point reduction, our investments in the business, investments that are not just for
today, but they tend to be for longer term as well, between advertising and the rep value proposition, are in excess of
200 basis points. In addition to that, there's about 60 basis points for the FCPA incremental cost, and then distribution is
about a 50 basis point increase, heavily in Latin America because of the labor cost increases. Those elements alone are
about worth well over 300 basis points, and that's been offset by the productivity improvements that we're making at
gross margin, which is 120 basis points overall. So strong, strong investment period, which is key element in terms of
margin decline for the quarter.
Just a quick snapshot, because we shared it with you in the past in terms of what's happening on transaction exchange.
Because of what's happening in Venezuela with the freeze up in dollars, we actually haven't had a significant cost
element coming through the P&L. Overall we now look to believe we're going to finish the year with about $35
million, $36 million of favorable transaction if exchange rates hold where they are today.
And then to bridge you, GAAP versus adjusted EPS, the GAAP EPS $0.36 last year, $0.38 this year, an increase of
$0.02. However, last year was dampened by restructuring of $0.06, this year only one, and the special items in
Venezuela are about $0.02, giving us the adjusted EPS movement which is basically flat, down $0.01, year-on-year.
Moving into the balance sheet, in cash flow starting with receivables, they continue well below 30 days outstanding.
That is our business model. I would not expect that to change any.
In terms of inventories, we have had an increase in the quarter of about six days and it's actually benefiting from some
currency and it's near a 12, 13 days operationally. Really handicapped I think by the weaker sales than we had expected
and as we think about that, two things. Number one, we don't see this as creating an obsolescence issue. The products
where we've got the inventory build; they're still scheduled for flowing in future catalogs, so I don't think there's any
concern there.
The second thing is, however, that with a significant operational increase at the end of the third quarter, while we're
looking for a substantial improvement against that by the end of the fourth quarter, it does mean that we will not get our
inventory objectives this year and we'll be somewhat above last year's end, somewhere probably three, maybe four days
up.
On accounts payable, strong performance here. It's an increase of 15 days from a year ago. We're up to about 85 days
now. And I want to just remind people, this is not because we're just not paying people. This is really process change.
We've changed our terms of trade. We've done benchmarking exercises. Something we started at the middle of last
year, it's now embedded in the SSI process which is not only about the vendor selection, skill selection, pricing, but
also incorporates payment terms and we're seeing real, real benefits here.
Capital expenditures, our run rate right now is about $45 million higher than it was last year at this time. Significant
investments in supply chain infrastructure, as well as the web enablement tools, and right now we think probably it's
somewhere between 300, 325 million for the full year. That's down a little bit from what I shared with you last quarter.
We said between 300 and 350. In 2009, I think we did around 300 million in CapEx.
Moving into the operating cash flow, shows an improvement of almost $100 million and it really looks like it's all
coming from adjusted net income, which is your net income add back in non-cash items of favorable $100 million.
Within that, we then see inventories are up, but they're being offset by the accounts payable improvements overall.
However, what doesn't show, which is also I think a good achievement coming through these numbers is two other
things; one is, you know we've always had a mismatch between restructuring expenses and the cash related to the
restructuring programs. That mismatch is close to $100 million unfavorable year-to-date. However, it's being fully
offset by the flow of the collection and recoveries on Brazil VAT. If you remember, our refunds or rebates are being

hung up with the government with some process changes on the government side. We expected to get somewhere
between $80 million and $100 million improvement in cash flow from that this year and we're actually marching a little
bit ahead of those objectives. So what is happening is the Brazil VAT collections are occurring and they're offsetting
the restructuring mismatch.
So, thinking about the rest of the year. We are on track to deliver at least the mid-single digit constant dollar revenue
growth that we've discussed. Despite having softer sales than we expected, we are maintaining our commitment to our
strategic growth investments. Those are investments that don't deliver any sales this year but are investments for longer
term sustainable sales growth.
In terms of the operating margin on an adjusted basis for the full year, we expect it to be roughly flat after offsetting the
cost for Venezuela that specializes devaluation and FCPA cost. So roughly flat on the adjusted operating margin. And,
our commitment is still long-term. The company generates sustainable profitable growth.
And with that I'd like to turn it back to the operator to open us up for question and answer.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation then pose your
question.
<Q - Lauren Lieberman>: Thanks. It's Barclays Capital. So I guess when you went through the spots of revenue
disappointment versus your expectations, what stands out to me as the most notable is really Brazil. I think North
America, it's a matter of it's still not good. I think we all knew that. It's just every quarter fingers crossed, it might
change, but Brazil's the one that stands out.
So I guess, just more information on exactly what are these service disruptions, why the intended and planned very
significant step up in spending and if the service disruptions were temporary, why would it be lingering into the fourth
quarter? And I guess finally as an add-on, because you mentioned the labor cost inflation as well, does that stick with
us? You talk about higher distribution costs, I'm not really clear if that's a one quarter issue or something I need to be
thinking about longer term. Thanks.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Do you want to take the financial
stuff?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: Why don't I talk first, but I'll let Chuck deal
with the systems disruptions and service disruptions, but let me just tell you about the quarter as it related to some of
the comps that we had and some of the weaker skin care launches as well as the continued commitment to spending.
So again, I think we had some particularly tough comps in Color. This actually was true of Russia as well, but we were
up 35% in Color a year ago in 3Q, and 35% to give you an idea, in fourth quarter. But we had restaged and relaunched
the entire Color line and our Color brand across the whole company, and we don't do that very often, probably once in
every four some years. And so we had some good launches, some products, a lipstick, a mascara, but certainly against
the whole thing, we didn't do as good a job lapping Color.
In terms of Skin Care, in Brazil in particular, our mid-tier line, not so much our new line, but our mid-tier line solutions
was down significantly versus some of the products they had a year ago. So that was really from a category point of
view, the active rep growth was good, continued to be very good in Brazil, activity continues to be very good so it's
really the average order size pressured by those two categories.
So that was really more the lion's share of the issue and then we did have the service challenge, which Chuck will talk
through, but just on the spending, I think it's fair to say that obviously key, key market for the category. Brazil
continues to be projected to be one of the fastest growing beauty markets. We love being in direct sales in Brazil, but

we know we've got a lot of competition, retail investments as well as direct sale investment. And the investments that
we're making, both in terms of the brand as well as the channel innovation, are really critical long term defend share
investments that we feel are very, very important.
<Q - Lauren Lieberman>: I'm sorry, Chuck, before you start on that, I just wanted to follow up, Andrea, because the
comp issues just what strikes me is that, that would have been known, right, at least internally, right, that you were
comping against the 35% Color increase, so I'm still not quite clear on why was there – what is it that didn't work?
Because the comps were a known issue for you guys going in.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: I just think we didn't do as good a job in
some of our offsets or our product launches which weren't cold brands restages, and we thought that they would do
better. They did nicely but not as much as I thought we would do. So clearly, they fell short.
<Q - Lauren Lieberman>: Okay. Thanks. Sorry, Chuck, go ahead.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: That's fine, Lauren. I've got a little
extra piece of it anyway. But in terms of the systems, I think as everyone's aware, the government has required us to go
to, us and everyone else, go e-invoicing systems and it really gives the government visibility for how each of our
individual representatives operate. It gives them the ability to track their revenue, their income.
While we were successful in implementing e-invoicing, it did have some impacts; knock on impacts in terms of our
older legacy systems. And there is – I would call it a maze of legacy systems down in Brazil. Net result was, as it
impacted some of those legacy systems, we did suffer from some delays in processing. We had some unfulfilled orders.
We had orders that got fulfilled late and then got returned because they were late.
So it became an issue of how the interfaces between e-invoicing and the legacy systems operated. We think most of
those technology issues are behind us, or certainly, are significantly reduced. But I think when you start to talk about
legacy systems, you have to be cautious in terms of, is it really behind us or are there going to be some minor hiccups
right now? But our feeling is, as we're going into November I guess, is that pretty much most of the problems are
largely behind us.
<Q - Lauren Lieberman>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation; then pose your question.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Hey. It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Guys, I guess the turnaround markets, two of
them that you guys have been talking about, the U.S. and China. It feels like both of them are kind of pacing worse than
you thought and I get that there was a 2% Beauty headwind in the category in the U.S., but you still don't seem to be
showing very much progress in either front. China actually decelerated.
And then, I guess, broadly, you're seeing a continued ramp-up in RVP, yet it looks like globally, you're losing share. So
I guess, broadly, is there – do you feel like there's something executionally that's not going on that should be going on
across the company? Or do you just kind of feel like it's a perfect storm in a number of different markets? I'm sorry for
the long, drawn out question, I'm just trying to understand just how broad based this is relative to the amount of
spending you guys are putting through the system.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. I guess to answer your question, Chris,
at the end, and then go back specifically to the U.S. and China. I think there are a confluence of issues, some macro and
some in terms of tactical issues that, while we certainly don't like them, I don't think there's a structural thing in terms
of the strategies. I believe the strategies are right and that's obviously why we continue these investments.
Obviously, investment levels are flexible. So if I didn't think that they were the right thing for the medium to long term,
that would be an ability to relook, but just taking the U.S. and China. So just hopefully that answers your question as it

relates to the investments that we're making in brands in RVP for the corporation.
U.S., I think it is tougher and it's taking longer but the two things that are challenging that obviously, are field
productivity and getting growth in a declining market. When we talked about timing for, I'll just call it stabilized sales,
the assumptions were at least a tiny bit of growth in the Beauty market in the United States, a couple points we never
were looking for, nor was there projected to be significant North American industry growth.
But the decline year-to-date is a little bit more challenging I think for us, as I'm sure for others, just than we had
thought and that's part of the macros of the U.S. But just getting growth as we move more towards Beauty and
deliberately get out of non-Beauty, you know what I'm saying, Chris? Mathematically it does challenge the
stabilization on the top line. The field productivity obviously is the biggest challenge and that's one thing that all efforts
are being focused on in terms of aggressive approaches to get that productivity up. So that's the U.S. and certainly the
macros don't help.
China, I think again, we said it'd be 18 months before the model is expected to take hold in 2012. I don't think you can
look at this thing quarter to quarter. We did have some spend last year that got us some Skin Care sales and we're not
lapping that launch, but that's really not germane as much as it is, I don't think you can look at it quarter to quarter. I
think we're doing the right thing. We've got that new model that's just rolled out at the end of the quarter in 13 new
zones and really it's about the feedback and how our Beauty Boutique, who we think, I believe, will participate in this
new model. Our feeling, and that's generally positive, I feel very good about our new general manager there. I think
he's off to a very good start and that whole management team is just 100% focused on direct selling fundamentals
which we know how to do. So despite the current negative impact as we transition away from retail, I think that we
think we've got the right structural model in place.

Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy Nicholson>: Hi. With Citigroup. My first question is on advertising. Was the advertising in RVP
investments shifted toward late in the quarter or why do you think all that investments funding just didn't have more an
immediate impact if you will on helping out some of the sales growth issues?
But the second question and the bigger picture is, I think ever since you guys entered into the last restructure in 2005,
2006, it seems like every year there is something that prevents you from getting any margin expansion. And I know,
Chuck, you've been out talking to a lot of investors over the last six weeks and in every meeting you've said, hey we
feel really good about the long-term margin target. You say it again on the press release and I just struggle to
understand what gives you that confidence when it just seems other than FCPA eventually hopefully going away, why
are you going to turn into a margin expansion story when you just haven't delivered it in a long time? Thanks.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Okay. Let me try to – I think the
real question you're asking is when is it coming, how is it coming and I think we're starting to see, when I look at the
margin performance we're starting to see supply chain margin improvement and that's coming through in your gross
margin. And as we look to the future, with mid-single digit growth with significant margin, gross margin improvement
that's going to come from productivity through the supply chain and remember we haven't even started to close those
two factories yet that we talked about, the German factory and the U.S. factory.
When we think about the pricing opportunities that we've had and we continue to get pricing, right now your mix has
been running unfavorable and offsetting it somewhat and that's the Skin Care softness relative to the rest of the line, but
also in terms of the pricing dynamics we have with discounting, I think pricing can continue. And then we see the
Health change, in terms of overall mix. I think we're going to see some sizeable improvements in gross margin.

I think as I run through the rest of the direction on it, advertising and RVP, they will continue to grow somewhat ahead
of sales, not step changes, but somewhat ahead of sales. And on the overhead line, I don't want to point to a quarter, but
if you just look at this quarter in terms of performance overall, it's not bad if that's reflective of an extended period of
time. We are getting positive leverage from containing our expenses. We are seeing the restructuring benefits flow
through, there are still more to come in terms of both of the programs. And so I continue to believe we're going to get
the leverage there.
The other thing that's going to happen is, as we think about margin improvement, that the assumption is that the U.S.
and China will be performing at different levels than they are now, as part of the turnaround for the U.S. and also China
with a big, or not big, but not small loss this year. It'll be a larger part of our business and it will become profitable by
that time period. So I'm still confident that we are going to see that kind of margin recovery and I'd still think that we
have the right guidance out there which is the mid-teens margin by 2013.
<Q - Wendy Nicholson>: Just one follow-up on that, Chuck. I think you gave us that guidance just about a year ago at
your last analyst day and I think most of us would have expected that we would have seen sort of ratable margin
expansion. In other words, a little bit in 2010 to help get you to that target. Is there anything that we should be thinking
about in terms of 2011? Is 2011 going to be a year where margins are up?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: It should be.
<Q - Wendy Nicholson>: Okay.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: You know we don't give guidance.
I'm not going to quantify it, but yes. This isn't all going to happen at the very end of the plan period. We need to start
making progress against it.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: Just a quick one, I know it wasn't a germane
part of your question, Wendy, but on advertising, on that incremental 31 million, it really was driven by Fragrance,
which was heavy against a launch of the main fragrance that we launched with Fergie, our Fergie fragrance. Fragrance
was up 12% so again, we had challenges in some other categories, but what we advertised, a big piece of it was in
Fragrance and another big piece of it was against Lotus Shield, which is a really important Hair Care entry, where
again, the Hair Care segment for us is smaller, but I think you probably heard me talk about just sort of catalyze that
business and get it going, but you're not going to see the total absolute dollars because it's smaller. But Hair Care was
up significantly, and it was the largest Hair Care, actual SKU we've had, but again a smaller percent, up 17%. Hair
Care was up 17% so a lot of money went against that, Fergie and Hair Care in the U.S., to give you an example.
And then when I look at the rest, we launched Acne within skin care. There's a lot of Acne advertising going on, it's a
pretty competitive segment in a growth segment, and that was up significantly as well.
So, again, it's sort of new adjacent categories and Fragrance, so those did well. And then just a comment, it's really
about timing and flow. The advertising is up significantly in this quarter, and having nothing to do with relative sales
now. We had always planned the fourth quarter flat to down. So when you understand timing and flow, you have that
unusual impact, if you would, in 3Q? Okay, that's the way we planned and the way the product launches timed out.
In terms of RVP, it is an incremental 27 million. A lot of that is on – we've just launched technology enhancements and
improvements in some of our major markets, you know the e-tools, whether it's intelligent ordering, leadership
management tools, e-brochure, as well as we talked a little bit about the service model, which really gets us looking at
things like turnaround time, improving returns, things like that for our representatives, which are the absolute, right
things to do for the business. So again, weighted heavily, probably weighted most heavily in this quarter on both those
two fronts.
<Q - Wendy Nicholson>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Doug Lane. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: Yes. Hi. Jefferies & Company. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: Hi.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: Hi. Yeah, I want to follow on the same thread on the marketing front. I mean if you're
accelerating your investment spending and your sales are decelerating, then something's got to give. So I think what
might help us just for some examples, some insights in whatever geographic region you want to go through where some
marketing messages are getting good traction and that you might be able to replicate elsewhere and where some
marketing messages may not be getting traction and need to be corrected in the upcoming quarters?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I'll just make an overarching comment
because I think this probably was implicit in what Chuck talked about, but the future spend rate for a 5% sales growth
versus an 8% sales growth, we spend differently. So there's the flexibility obviously, I'm only going to make a one
quarter rash decision because I don't think we have a structural marketing issue. And I think there are some tough
comps and some tactical issues, particularly in Brazil obviously as well as in Central and Eastern Europe where it's
structurally sound, but slower growth which we started to see last quarter and talked about and there's a confluence of
things that affected that.
But I still believe that the category growth opportunities, the investments we're making to improve the channel would
very much directly on what we identified and said were important for the medium to long term. But just to the level of
spend, obviously as we said, our sales were weaker than we thought they would be so we weren't thinking we would
have 4% core, if you would, comps in dollar sales. And we would – if you look over the 2011 to 2013 period, that
spending is different. It would be different had we had the flexibility to adjust.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: No. I'm thinking right now in terms
of it does pop as a big numbers in the quarter. If I think about RVP and we think about the investments we're making in
the service model – and that will be a long term investment program. Investments we're making in web enablement, it's
– you're not going to see the impact of those, well the service model, for quite a while, web enablement, we're just
really putting those tools in place.
So there is a mismatch between when you invest and when you get it out and as Andrea said, we are investing – our
portfolio of investments has a very long-term focus to it in terms of returns to sustainable growth.
In addition, when we take a look at some of the variable expenses in advertising, we always said that it's just the
phasing between second, third and fourth quarters, this was going to be a large quarter particularly in Russia where we
were soft in the second quarter, probably a bit softer than we should have been. And within that, I think Andrea's spot
on in terms of, what are you spending against? And there are, what we would call white space. White space means
categories that we haven't been engaged or involved in whether it's Acne, whether it's Hair Care, which were significant
increments but those are categories that we are definitely long-term interested in. So we're building, or are starting to
build those businesses now.
I don't know if that helps or not. That's kind of how we're kind of thinking about it. It isn't all to deliver revenue growth
in the quarter or even in the year. It really is a combination of matching up the product launches, matching up the
marketing plans, and also sustainable longer-term growth.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: Okay. Thank you.

So just wanted to get your perspective globally on how you're thinking about the Skin Care business. I mean it is very
important for your margins, and how you think about that over the next 12 to 18 months?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. I mean just kind of looking at what the
struggle was and then where we're going. Just China and Japan alone, probably pressure the category, four points alone
with their large skin care market just from geographic mix. And it's four points in Skin Care there, Skin Care growth.
ANEW, again, I think it's still – it's a flagship brand for us. I think that next year major investments in some, I call it
extended segments, Sun Care, looking at Men's because there's lots of intensive investment and innovation given –
again, this is really our flagship anti-aging brand and a lot of competitive activity.
So it's really the mid-tier brand solutions which we did not invest against. I mean, I'm not going to say we didn't. We
just – it didn't make sense because we're not restaging it, there's a major restage in 2011, mid-2011, but this was down
nearly 20%, just to give you an idea. And we didn't invest against this. It wouldn't have been right. We're not going to
advertise against something that we're restaging. And I think that that has just been a harder brand in terms of brand
positioning, so there's a major re-launch coming in 2011. But this was particularly impactful in terms of comparison
revenues in both CEE and Latin America.
Okay, so, it's mid-tier brand launch 2011, extension of ANEW in 2011, and in just terms of other categories and spend
against good innovation, and then, obviously, we want that, particularly the China business and the China resumption
of growth. It does have a big impact on Skin Care for the company outside because of the percent of business of Skin.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation then post your question.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: It's Deutsche Bank. So I don't want to pile on this sort of margin restructuring commentary but I
think its $1 billion restructuring cost since it was announced in 2006, when you look at operating margins and they're at
a 13-year low. So what am I missing? Like I thought this was supposed to be the big inflection year on cost savings at
least versus the plan you introduced in 2005. So has it just been extended forward and we will still see these savings or
is it just that maybe you had to reinvest a lot more than you originally thought? And then secondary to that, do you
think there might be a need for another restructuring program going forward?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Let me answer the last one first
which is no, on another restructuring program. There'll always be restructuring in terms of activities, but a program, no.
In terms of the margin walk, if I think about what I had expected way back in 2005 coming in 2006, Bill, you're right.
These were kind of the inflection periods and let's not kid ourselves; we lost 200 basis points in 2009 because of
currency movements. Let's not kid ourselves in terms of the global economic difficulties that we had which depressed
the sales base that we're operating on. FCPA, a significant cost that we never anticipated that we've been able to offset.
Venezuela, a significant cost in terms of the impact of devaluation that we weren't able to impact. But those are things
that happen. So I have to go back to the roots and say, are we doing what we said we're doing?
And in terms of the initiatives of the restructuring, number one, the 2005 program, 2009 program we're pretty much on
the mark on those programs. I think the 2009 program, we did fall a little bit short and it looked like we're going to fall
a little bit short this year but more than made up with gains and strategic sourcing. So I think those benefit streams are
coming through.
And we also did what we said we'd do, in terms of we're going to invest a lot of the benefit stream into the business.
Remember this company had advertising of $130 million in 2005 and it's going to be 400 million plus this year. RVP is
up substantially, investments not only for the current business but very importantly for the long-term business.
So yes we're not quite where I thought we'd be four years ago. No question about it. But as I look to the things that
we've been able to offset, as I look to the pressures we've had and as I look to how we feel about the sales revenue

growth, the ability to continue to gain on the gross margin line, the ability to continue with the mentality we have on
overhead expenses, I think directionally the guidance we're giving about mid-teens margin, operating margin 2013 is
still appropriate.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Is there a chance that maybe direct selling doesn't respond to advertising? Because you're the only
direct seller who has decided that this is going to be a big focus, and I know the macro is not great, but there is still 8%
or 9% growth in some of these emerging markets and your business is clearly still very emerging markets heavy. So I
know you have a big analytics framework, but would you ever think that maybe there's not a really a big payout in
advertising?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Our analytics still show the lifts
that we expected. If I had Mike Schwartz with us, he would take you through chapter and verse on this, but we don't
just do an estimate. We also do what I call post auditing to look back and say, hey are we delivering the kind of lift we
expected? Are we getting the product performance or category performance based on where we're advertising? Are we
getting the rep recruiting that we expected, given the advertising we've done in terms of the opportunity? And we still
think it's an appropriate place to invest money, and we are getting those kind of returns.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Great. Can I ask you one quick follow-up question?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Sure.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Yeah, it seems like you resolved some Brazilian tax matters, is there going to be a big release of a
reserve going forward or was that not reserved for?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: No, those are not reserved for.
Those are just contingent liabilities, Bill, but you're right. We're very, very pleased that we're getting a lot of those
behind us now.

You're next question comes from Dara Mohsenian. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Dara Mohsenian>: Thanks. Morgan Stanley. Can you discuss your comfort on the balance between pricing and
volume in the quarter? You guys are clearly relying on pricing to drive organic sales growth, which calls into question
the sustainability of that growth going forward. So I'm just looking for commentary on your level of comfort with that
mix in the quarter and what you'd expect going forward.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I mean, again, the thought here is
balance growth between volume and price mix. And that is – so I've just been looking at the core here, if I looked at the
4% core, 1% in terms of volume, three in terms of price mix. It's a little heavier on price. I feel good about the pricing
that we're taking. We've taken over $200 million in the last two years, in terms of strategic pricing, very analytically
done and there's nothing that I'm seeing that's showing the strategic pricing that we've taken our challenge as it relates
to any kind of weakness versus what we thought. It's not because of taking strategic pricing and as you all know, we
really work very hard to improve brand image, R&D, everything else, and I think that this ability to take pricing is
something that we hadn't had over the last decade.
So I feel good about the strategic pricing and we'll continue to take it. And I think it's – I do think and believe that we're
going to have some balanced growth between units net per units as we go forward. I think really that's the goal here,
and I don't think we're that far off it. Obviously we'd like to have seen unit volumes. But really the whole core business
should be a little bit stronger than 4% that was the disappointment.
<Q - Dara Mohsenian>: Okay. And, Chuck, on an organic basis, just when you strip out the acquisitions, what was
volume pricing in the quarter on an organic basis?

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. I'm from Sanford Bernstein. Just a few questions. One is a – Chuck, you gave an
explanation on the Venezuela VAT being helpful to free cash flows. And that's helpful. But for example, if you look at
this quarter, free cash flow to net income was actually quite poor, 12% free cash flow productivity. And prepaid still
goes up even more than sales. I'm trying to kind of reconcile those two things, so any help there would be helpful,
please.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: The only thing I would say there is
it really, to me, the big nemesis in the quarter from a cash flow point of view is the inventory movement. It...
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So...
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: Those inventories went up substantially with
the softer sales. And we normally have inventory build, by the way, in the third quarter leading into Q4. But what we
experienced – and by the way, where we experienced it was when sales was softest, U.S. and Central Eastern Europe.
And that to me is the one big negative in terms of cash flow in this period.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: But it – it's a consistent theme, as for the other Q quarters for this year as well. Where inventory was
a little bit more benign to you. So I'm just trying to understand what is going on there with the disconnect.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: I'm not sure why there's a
disconnect. The pre-paids have to with things like when we're buying paper for brochures, how that brochure flow
works. There's nothing untoward in there. It really is all about assets that are still continuing to have value.
To me the important thing in this quarter was that we now have measurable returns on that Brazilian VAT, which is
pretty much government controlled. And there's always a concern that it may get held up again. But I think we've been
pleased that that in money is flowing. I think the other thing that has happened and always happens, and I look at the
cash flow by the way on a more to year-to-date basis than anything else because of some of the swings and
roundabouts, but the other thing that is big in the year is the mismatch between restructuring expense and restructuring
cash, and that's in the high $80 million range.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. I'm not quite there, but let's – let me ask you a different question. You mentioned retail
growth in Brazil and other places as being something you have to struggle with. It sounds like, yes, it's retail growth,
it's also, in fact every other one of the CPG manufacturers that we hear about are focused on the emerging markets and
with a particular penchant towards your categories. So are you, not to mention some of direct sellers are also spending
more back – how much has that, have the other CPG companies had an influence on how much you have to spend and
the return on that spend? And is that, as you look forward, a true long-term kind of secular pressure you're going to feel
in your core emerging markets?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Well just a slight clarification, Ali, I
mean – and this was second quarter year-to-date. Direct sales had gained significant share and retail had lost share in
the category. So we as well as other direct sellers had gained market share two quarters to date. I don't have the

numbers yet on 3Q.
But I'll just say, I was talking less about retail – I was talking more about retail – I mean I think everybody is investing,
to your point, whether you're in direct sales and/or in retail in the market, but we feel very good about our share and
we're not looking – we do believe that Brazil will continue, for example, to be a very profitable market after
investments. We're going to continue to invest. It's not about just because there's retail competition coming in, but
we've got obviously strong direct selling market there and it's a big business with I think important but still very
profitable opportunities even after investments in both the channel and the brand.

<Q - Alice Longley>: Hi. Good morning. I have a couple of questions about Brazil as well. The first is on the cost side.
I think you explained why there's incremental cost for tracking reps in a different way, but why was distribution up as a
percentage of sales by 50 basis points? You have new distribution facilities in the U.S., and more importantly, now in
Brazil. Was that increase because of that cost of tracking reps or...
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: No.
<Q - Alice Longley>: Where did the labor – what was the increase in labor costs? Why – when does distribution start
contributing to margin expansion as it was supposed to with the new facilities?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Yeah. And each of those is a
different question by geography, it also has to do with when your average order size goes down because you're
shipping boxes, then you end up unfortunately having what I would call deleveraging cost per value of that order to
ship goes up but what we're referring to specifically in terms of distribution cost increases was pretty much double-digit
labor cost increases in Latin America in general. And for instance in Venezuela they're very, very significantly up and
that's because of some union contracts that get settled this year with substantial increases. So it really is the labor
component.
<Q - Alice Longley>: Is that peculiar to you or is that widespread in your view?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Each of us negotiates in our own
timeframe with the unions. I believe it's not uncommon. I believe it's we're not unique at all. I think where we are
unique is in terms of the number of packages that we ship, the number of cartons, the number of boxes we ship to
representatives and they have a relatively fixed freight cost that's in distribution and that freight cost is a percent of
sales if the average order is under pressure it will come down. That's unique to us.
I think that the other question you've asked though is something that we do have to be a little bit aware of and that is as
we transition out of one distribution center or distribution configuration into another, there are some duplicated cost or
costs as we run two distribution centers, closing down one, opening another. That has not had an impact yet in Latin
America but coming out of the end of this year and through next year you will be hearing about some pressure on
distribution cost as we move into the large Brazilian Adonis facility.
<Q - Alice Longley>: So the labor cost have just gone up so we have to anniversary those for the next – that big hike
for the next four quarters?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Well that labor cost is now
embedded in our numbers, yes. But its labor cost and it's going to be, yet in terms of ratios, it's also when you have
average order pressure then your percent discretionary expense as a percent of sales will go up.
<Q - Alice Longley>: So just to come back to this over the next four quarters I'm going to have labor cost up
year-over-year because of those union agreements and also I'm going to have the incremental cost of transitioning to
this new distribution facility in Brazil. Is that right?

<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Alice Longley>: So the distribution may increase as a drag on margins from that 50 basis points?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: For a short period of time, yes.
<Q - Alice Longley>: For like the next four quarters?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Yes. I think that's, the next four to
five quarters.
<Q - Alice Longley>: Okay. And then so that distribution...
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: For most of next year I think.
Obviously our objective is to make that transition as quickly but as smoothly as possible as well so we don't disrupt the
relationship with the representatives.
<Q - Alice Longley>: Okay. And then my other question about Brazil is, you had all this strong innovation in Skin I
guess a year ago which is why you're talking about the tough comps and then Color as well. What were you thinking up
for this year. I mean why wasn't there a lot of strong innovation this year? It sounds like you've got something for next
year, but that's not for a few more quarters before that even gets launched. So, what did you try to do anyway this year
to generate more sales growth in Brazil? It doesn't sound like there's much.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: We had a new launch. We had a new launch
for a product called Luminosity. We had a lineup of new Color, not restaging the entire brand, but a lipstick and
mascara launch that we would do in every year, and again, they were not as strong as they needed to be. I think I made
that clear earlier, to go up against what we thought. So we always knew we had tough comps, so I think we understood
that, but even against that, we had some disappoints in terms of product launches, but again I don't think that that's
something that carries into 2011.
<Q - Alice Longley>: And I guess the last, your restage of ANEW, that's your biggest thing for next year in Brazil?
And it sounds like the focus is on men's and sun care, which is kind of – those are secondary subcategories of Skin.
Isn't there some big...
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: We have very intensive innovation in the
core ANEW brand for women in 2011 as well.
<Q - Alice Longley>: And that will be like in the June quarter?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: I think that it's across the year, but it's more –
it's not in the first quarter.
<Q - Alice Longley>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Linda Weiser>: Hi. Caris & Company. Chuck, when you first came to the company and kind of instituted the
idea of ZOG, I think we were all impressed with that and felt it was a good thing for Avon. And here we have not a
huge miss on the sales line. You're sales results were actually very much in line with our estimate and consensus, so 4%
organic sales growth is not way off unless you were expecting nine.
But you've been talking about mid-single digit, in which case 4% is within that range of expectation. So it seems to me
that on the ZOG if you, you're sort of lightening up on that concept. You're allowing overhead to rise but less than sales
growth, and that is giving you less cushion or insurance when a small glitch happens on the sales line in a particular

quarter.
So can you just talk about that whole concept? There's a lot of leverage in your operating model, and it seems to me,
that that type of leverage and the sales glitches that we sometimes see should make you really embrace ZOG even
more, not lessen up on that. Can you just talk about that?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Sure. I mean it's one of my favorite
topics, and I can tell you that ZOG is alive and well at this company in terms of approach to expenses, in terms of
assessing and evaluating when to invest money, in terms of trying to take lower value added cost to either replace them
with higher value added investments or don't spend any money at all. So I'm not at all concerned about the approach to
cost.
I think – this is one quarter that you talked about. If you go back to the charts that I showed, I remember they had the
little circles on the left. Our overhead expenses – exclude the overhead that you add in for Silpada and for Liz Earle,
because there's no comparison the prior year. But the overhead that we had, I think it was $24 million or $25 million
incremental of which $17 million was the FCPA increment.
So from an overall cost point of view, despite inflation that you have, we really held our cost pretty much flat in terms
of what we reported. And what we have done is we are intentionally investing now because we feel good about the base
we have. We are investing incrementally in initiatives that are not generating sales now but that will for the longer
term. And that's most of the other difference.
So in one quarter we shouldn't look at, but since you brought it up in terms of the margin in this quarter, I think we are
still delivering against what we said we'd deliver on the overhead side. And I think if you really want to look at the
business in terms of the margin movement versus maybe some other people's expectations, that margin movement is
heavily influenced by the over 200 basis points that we put into RVP and into advertising. Those are the real drivers of
the margin reduction in the quarter. And we talked about those at face. One quarter they may be heavier than others.
Remember in Q2 in Central and Eastern Europe, we went light on advertising, probably a little lighter than we should
have. But we had a very heavy plan for Q3 and that is what we invested in. So I hope that helps you a little. I – ZOG is
never meant to be a mathematical number except when you start the initiative. ZOG is really all about attitudes, about
getting people to focus and concentrate, making sure that people do the right analysis. They look for process changes as
opposed to constantly just adding cost because sales are going up. And that very clearly I think is working here in this
company. If I sounded excited about it, I do get excited because I do think our team is doing pretty well on it.
<Q - Linda Weiser>: Can you also – I don't think you really explained exactly what the service disruption issue was in
Brazil. And you've had these before and usually it only impacts sales for one quarter. So why would the affect last into
the fourth quarter in terms of the service disruption?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Well, because, number one, we
were fixing it coming out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. We're almost a month into it right now. So
that's a piece of the lingering impact. And the second one is, I think you have to be cautious when you touch a series of
significant number of interfaces between old legacy systems.
What happened is we put in a new e-invoicing system. It met the Government requirements. It worked well. But in
terms of data transfers, in terms of the processing time that was required as you worked back to those other interfaces,
we did some things that caused disruption in the flow of information. Those are the things that we think we pretty much
got behind us as we end October and go into November but when you talk about legacy systems, there's always
something else that kind of creeps up. We feel that we've done the right things now but we're a little bit cautious and we
do have still one more month of, which is the month of October, of some difficulties.

<Q - Mark Astrachan>: Yes. Stifel Nicolaus. A few housekeeping questions. Just in terms of thinking about the
operating margin. I know you don't give the guidance for it but there's obviously the FCPA cost in there, there's
Venezuela, et cetera. So you put it all together it seems like it's more than 100 basis points in terms of decrement this
year versus what potentially flows through next year so I wanted to get a sense of whether that is correct in thinking
about it. Also, talking about your sales growth for the year of at least mid-single digits in constant dollars, I'm assuming
that's exclusive of acquisitions. And then on China, I just wanted to get a sense of what your sales per representative is
and then your kiosk sales business as well.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Number one, the sales growth
guidance that we give, yes, that – some companies call it core. That excludes the acquisitions. Secondly, in terms of the
120, 110, 120 basis point drag that you talk about in terms of the Venezuela devaluation items and the FCPA costs,
that's an increment versus 2009. We're not – I can't talk about FCPA moving into the future.
What I will say though is that the drag that came from the component that was Venezuela should not be – I'm going to
say should not be as severe next year, but again that all depends upon what happens down there, what Chavez might do,
where exchange rates might go, but we would not anticipate a further drag because of Venezuela. And I can't remember
what your other question was.
<Q - Mark Astrachan>: It was on China, sales per representative and then the kiosk business in terms of the growth.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: I don't feel because we're now just looking at
the whole business as a blended, this hybrid model and not dividing it out Beauty Boutiques versus sales promoter, but
your Retail business or your Beauty Boutique business is down significantly obviously because that's the transition
away from retail into direct sales.
<Q - Mark Astrachan>: I'm going to try to get a sense for representative basis, whether things are actually getting
better there as you're switching over to the different business model.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: It's really too early right now.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: We'll follow up on that, when we have a little
bit more visibility. But I think it will be important to look at that as we fully implement the model, and give us some
time to see. But right now the wait, the average order has been so much from the Beauty Boutique and they're
transitioning out and have significant declines.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer>: Significantly less. But again, it's –
we piloted three cities in the, what's it, third quarter. We only just went into the other 13 areas on cities. So it is way,
way too early to get any kind of a quantitative read.
<Q - Mark Astrachan>: Got it. And just lastly, it's in the press, realize that you probably don't want to comment on it.
But in L'Oreal rumor doesn't seem to be going away. Is there anything that you can or want to add there?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer>: I'm not going to comment on rumors or
speculation. Sorry.
<Q - Mark Astrachan>: All right...

the only thing we've quantified is the incrementally over 2009.
