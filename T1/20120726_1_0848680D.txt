MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Sprint Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks
there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Brad Hampton,
Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brad Hampton
Thank you, Katie. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to Sprint Nextel's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. On
today's call, Dan Hesse will discuss operational performance in the quarter, Steve Elfman will provide an update on
Network Vision; and Joe Euteneuer will cover our financial results.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are
both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning we will be discussing
forward-looking information which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings,
which I encourage you to review, including our annual report on Form 10-K.
Moving to slide 3, throughout our call we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics, reconciliations of our non-GAAP
performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found in the
attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation which are available on our website at
Sprint.com/investors.

Let's move on to earnings per share on slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the second quarter were
$0.46, compared to $0.29 in the first quarter and $0.28 in the year-ago period. There were a few noteworthy items
impacting EPS this quarter that I'd like to cover, the first two of which are related to our progress towards the eventual
shutdown of the Nextel platform. First the loss per share in the current period included incremental depreciation
expense of $782 million, or negative $0.26 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense related to the
expected shutdown of the Nextel platform. We have updated our estimate of the expected useful life of the Nextel
assets, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense this quarter.
Excluding incremental CapEx spend or assets in servicing, we expect depreciation expense to be around $2.6 billion for
the second half of 2012 and around $3.6 billion for 2013 which is expected to be disproportionately weighted towards
the first half of 2013 due to Nextel assets being fully depreciated by the middle of 2013. The current period also
included $184 million, or approximately negative $0.06 per share, for lease-exit costs, which are the net present value
of remaining lease obligations associated with certain Nextel platform cell sites which were taken off air during the
quarter.
In the second quarter we shut down approximately 8,300 Nextel platform sites. However, locations from which we may
continue to gain future economic benefit, including co-located sites, were not included in this charge and represented
approximately 30% – 36% of total Nextel sites shut down in the second quarter. During the third quarter to date we
have shut down approximately 1,300 Nextel platform sites, a portion of which will also incur a charge in our third
quarter results, expected to be approximately $20 million. We expect no additional thinning of the Nextel platform in
2012 at this time.
We estimate that approximately $8 million and $77 million of operating expense would have been incurred in the
second quarter and second half of 2012 respectively for a full year 2012 impact of $85 million if Sprint did not take
these actions. Lastly, we also recorded an impairment of $204 million, or negative $0.07 per share, related to our
Clearwire investment.
Net tax expense was $26 million in the second quarter. For the full year 2012 we continue to expect our net tax expense
to be approximately $150 million to $200 million.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse.
Daniel R. Hesse
Thank you, Brad. Whoops, better turn my mike on. Thanks, Brad, and thank you for joining us this morning and for
your interest in Sprint.
If you turn to slide 6, please, let me recap the quarter's highlights before reviewing performance across our three key
priorities: generating cash, improving the customer experience and building the brand.
Adjusted OIBDA of $1.45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter exceeded both our internal projections and Street
consensus. Adjusted OIBDA margin of 17.9% represents a sequential improvement of 277 basis points from the first
quarter. Notably adjusted OIBDA margin is also up 69 basis points from the second quarter of 2011 even with the
dilutive impact of both the iPhone and our Network Vision investment in 2012.
As I've mentioned before, the two most important wireless operating metrics that drive financial performance are churn
and ARPU. For our Sprint platform postpaid business both churn and ARPU were best ever results for any quarter.
Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.38 is up $4.31 from the second quarter of last year, and for the third consecutive
quarter we posted the highest year-over-year postpaid ARPU increase on record for any major U.S. wireless company.
We set the all-time record for Sprint platform postpaid ARPU in the same quarter we delivered our best ever Sprint
platform postpaid churn of 1.69%. This represents an improvement of 31 basis points sequentially and three basis
points over our previous record quarter one year ago. We also achieved our ninth consecutive quarter of positive net
adds for the Sprint platform postpaid business.

We made progress on our Network Vision deployment. We've launched LTE service in five major metro areas and
today we're announcing early completion of 2012's iDEN network thinning forecast with all 9,600 iDEN cell sites
already off air.
We are now activating new Network Vision sites on air at a rate which, if we maintain our current implementation pace
in existing cities and bring in new cities as planned during the year, we'll achieve our 2012 plan. The current
week-by-week plans from our vendors show us achieving our goal of approximately 12,000 sites on air by the end of
the year.
Finally, based on the ongoing strength of our core Sprint platform business, we are increasing our forecast for full year
2012 adjusted OIBDA performance to a range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion.
If you'd please turn to slide 7 I'll organize the balance of my comments around our three overarching priorities. Let me
begin with cash. In spite of a significant increase in capital investment associated with our Network Vision deployment
this quarter we again improved our liquidity position by generating $209 million of free cash flow. We ended the
second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.8 billion.
During the quarter we completed our first vendor financing arrangement and retired $1 billion of outstanding debt
ahead of its scheduled maturity. Our strong quarterly adjusted OIBDA performance in the quarter benefited from
continued top line growth. We had solid revenue performance in all three areas of our Sprint platform wireless
business. The Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate continues to increase with the ongoing impact of the $10 premium
data charge as a result of the continued customer adoption of smartphones. At $63.38, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU
reached a new all-time best level and is up, as I mentioned, $4.31 year-over-year.
Total sprint platform service wireless revenue is up over 16% compared to the year ago period with postpaid revenue
up almost 13%, prepaid revenue up over 30% and wholesale and other revenue up over 125% year-over-year. On a
consolidated basis, this quarter represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total operating
revenues, and our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Total operating revenues are up almost 6.5%
year-over-year.
As I said earlier, we reported an improvement both sequentially and year-over-year in our adjusted OIBDA margin
performance. While far from where we want it to be, we delivered a meaningful 69 basis-point improvement in margin
from the second quarter of 2011. Although postpaid gross add volume was within 10% of a year ago, we grew adjusted
OIBDA margin while absorbing the dilutive impacts this year of our two key investment areas, Network Vision
deployment and the iPhone.
As I transition to a discussion of our customer experience and brand results, I'd like to begin with a brief overview of
the iPhone which benefits both areas. Turning to slide 8, in spite of seasonal softness in industry gross adds from Q1 to
Q2, we activated nearly 1.5 million iPhones in the second quarter, similar to last year – or similar to last quarter. As
I've said before, the most important near-term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of
activations that are new customers to Sprint because they represent new sources of revenue. In the second quarter, 40%
of our iPhone activations were new customers, well in excess of our competitor's historical results and our third
consecutive quarter at or above 40%.
Longer term, the most important metric of success with the iPhone will be the anticipated lower churn rate of iPhone
customers. All of our early life iPhone customer experience metrics continue to be encouraging. We are beginning to
see benefits from the iPhone, including lower support costs in service and repair. To date, although still young in its
product life cycle, we are observing materially lower early life churn rates for iPhone customers compared to other
smartphone customers. The operational performance so far continues to support our decision to carry the iPhone.
Considering post-paid devices only, we are ahead of the pace required to meet our contracted commitments to Apple.
Turning to slide 9 and the customer experience, I am pleased to report that in the second quarter, in a well-known and
important third party independent measure of customer satisfaction, we matched our all-time best rating for overall
satisfaction for the Sprint brand. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index which made its findings
public in May, Sprint is number one among all national carriers in overall customer satisfaction and the most improved

U.S. company across all 47 industries studied over the last four years.
We also achieved new best-ever levels for customer calls to care across both our postpaid and prepaid customer bases.
We're not buying satisfaction. Customer care credits in the second quarter were the lowest or best for any quarter on
record. Both postpaid and prepaid customer credits each hit best-ever levels, savings that drop straight to the bottom
line.
Our multiyear, intense focus on improving our customers' experience with Sprint is continuing to manifest itself in
improved churn performance. Sprint platform postpaid churn reached a new all-time best of 1.69% and prepaid churn
at 2.53% (sic) [3.53%] matches our best ever reported churn level and is at the lowest level in almost seven years.
Sprint platform prepaid churn has shown year-over-year improvement for 11 consecutive quarters. While the
introduction of the Assurance brand which has a lower churn rate than typical prepaid brands has helped these results,
we have also made progress in improving the churn performance of our Boost and Virgin Mobile customer bases.
Moving to slide 10, Verizon, AT&T and the Sprint platform each reported record low postpaid churn results this
quarter. This is good for the industry as no single metric drives profitability more than churn. But as a result, there are
fewer postpaid decisions or new customers to go after, especially if you adjust out ancillary devices like the iPad. The
two 2G iDEN network has been a source of customers for other platforms, most of all for Verizon for the past few
years. We have data going back 4.5 years, but in a typical year prior to this one, based on porting data, we estimate
Verizon got almost half of all iDEN DX. Sprint recaptured about 25%, AT&T acquired 20% and T-Mobile about 5%.
Verizon benefited from sheer size and by having a push-to-talk CDMA product. From 2008 to 2011, the Nextel
platform provided about twice as much as benefit to Verizon subscriber numbers and almost as much as benefit to
AT&T subscriber base as it did to the Sprint platform. Prior to late 2011, our most effective financial strategy was to do
all we could to maintain customers on the Nextel platform, to reduce churn, until we had Sprint Direct Connect
network technology and devices, and until we needed to begin active customer migration so that we could shut down
the iDEN network in 2013.
So before this year, the best financial strategy was to retain customers on the fixed cost iDEN platform as long as
possible. From 2008 to 2011, we decreased the number of Nextel postpaid DX per year by 66%, and improved churn
by more than 50 basis points. Once we declared the end of life for the iDEN platform, a new strategy was warranted. It
costs us about $200 less to acquire an iDEN customer than to go out and get a new customer from a competitor. We
have described on previous calls how we will give priority to OIBDA over customer growth in 2012. We've spent less
in advertising than we spent last year.
Given the low number of new postpaid phone decisions anticipated in 2012, and the fact that we are now stimulating
high churn on the iDEN network so that we can shut it down in 2013, we decided to focus our limited marketing
resources on acquiring Nextel platform customers because of the advantage that the new Sprint Direct Connect
provides us, as well as because of lower acquisition costs.
So in 2012, for the first time, the Sprint platform is out acquiring Verizon as we're more than doubling Sprint's
historical share of Nextel postpaid DX. We likely will not be able to sustain last quarter's 60% recapture rate, but we
feel we are focusing our limited marketing spend in the best way possible.
Turning to slide 11, as I mentioned before, perhaps the most important brand metric is the net promoter score which is
a brand's supporters, minus its detractors. In a well-known independent survey, the net promoter score for Sprint is at
an all-time high and Sprint is the only one of the four major carriers to show improvement both sequentially and
year-over-year.
In another independent third party survey, the Sprint, Boost and Virgin brands each achieved all-time best scores for
purchase consideration. One of the most tangible proof points of our brand improvement is the net porting position for
the Sprint platform postpaid business. Being net port positive means more of our competitors' customers switched to
Sprint than switched from Sprint to a competitor. Before the third quarter of 2010, the Sprint platform had never in its
long history been net port positive. I'm pleased to report that we just achieved our 8th consecutive net port positive
quarter.

Please turn to slide 12. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, Sprint platform postpaid
net adds of 442,000 represents our ninth consecutive quarter of positive net adds. When measured by net adds over an
eight-quarter period, as a percentage of the customer base, the Sprint platform is the fastest growing postpaid brand
among the national carriers, in spite of not having the iPad, a major contributor to the net add performance of our
competitors, or even until recently, even the iPhone, and as I mentioned earlier, with relatively little advantage
compared to our large competitors from Nextel platform DX until recently. Our total customer base also continues to
grow. This quarter we reached a record 56.4 million wireless customers.
Last quarter, we launched innovative new handsets and products. We are pleased – I think you should be on slide 13 –
with the early results of our new LTE handsets, including the latest edition to the EVO product family, the HTC EVO
4G LTE. In spite of an initial launch delay, it quickly became one much our top-selling devices. We're seeing good
early results for the Samsung Galaxy S3 launched early in the third quarter. We've also seen good market reaction to
our new 4G WiMAX prepaid offerings launched late in the quarter. We are seeing prepaid WiMAX devices in the high
single digit percentages of our total prepaid sales. And finally, at the end of the quarter, we broke new ground with our
Virgin Mobile brand as the first national prepaid carrier to offer the iPhone. It's too early to share results and we have
not yet begun advertising Virgin's iPhone.
Finally I'm pleased to announce today that Sprint will be launching the Motorola Photon Q 4G LTE device in the very
near future, our sixth 4G LTE device of 2012 and the first LTE world phone. The Motorola Photon Q is a ULE
platinum-certified premium QWERTY slider with robust business and consumer features.
We also continue to innovate in business solutions, evidenced by our announcement of wholesale and retail cloud
services and a refresh of capabilities in our Sprint Biz 360 portfolio which provides mobility solutions for small
business customers. In the quarter, we also introduced Sprint Guardian, an industry first suite of mobile safety and
security applications.
As I conclude my remarks, please turn to slide 14. We are early in the second phase of the turnaround investing for
future growth. We're making progress in our core business operations which funds these investments. We know we
have much work ahead of to us achieve the margins we and our investors want. We've achieved all-time bests for the
two factors that are the most significant determinants of the profitability of our postpaid wireless business, churn and
ARPU.
As we work to streamline our network infrastructure and wind down the Nextel platform, we have a vibrant and
growing portfolio of Sprint platform businesses that will be the foundation for our expected margin expansion in phase
three of the turnaround.
Thank you for your ongoing interest and support of Sprint, and I will now hand over the call to Steve Elfman, who will
give you an update on Network Vision.
Steven Lawrence Elfman
Thanks, Dan. I'm pleased to be here to discuss our continued progress on Network Vision during the quarter. We
remain confident in our ability and the ability of our vendors to achieve our goals.
Please turn to slide 16. We are announcing today that we have completed our network thinning effort on the Nextel
platform for this year. We've executed our thinning plans rapidly and nearly three months ahead of our guidance last
quarter. Two weeks ago we completed our thinning in our last market which means we have now reached our goal of
9,600 sites for the year and have reduced the number of towers servicing the Nextel platform by one third.
As a reminder, the network thinning process is not expected to cause any meaningful disruption to on-street coverage,
nor is it complete decommissioning. It is a process of taking certain cell sites off the air and recalibrating the network to
support lower traffic volumes.

The Nextel platform was originally built to support approximately 20 million subs and as of the end of the second
quarter, we were approximately 4.4 million subscribers remaining. The thinning process allows us to reduce our costs
while maintaining service for those customers who remain on the platform. The completion of network thinning is an
important step for Sprint towards achieving our expected margin improvement goals. This quarter, we announced that
we expect to complete the shutdown of the remaining Nextel platform cell sites as of June 30 – as early as June 30,
2013. We have had a lot of questions on costs and the timing of the expected cost savings.
Joe will give an update on Network Vision financial outlook shortly, but I want to provide you with some direction on
our expectations of the timing of savings as we implement Nextel platform thinning and move to full decommissioning.
Within the first six months after we take a cell site off the air, we eliminate utility, back haul and maintenance costs. On
average, these represent approximately 40% of the annual tower costs. And rent represents approximately 60%. By
early 2014, we expect that from an adjusted OIBDA perspective, we will achieve the majority of projected savings
related to the shutdown of the platform.
Please turn to slide 17. As Dan discussed, we've been very successful in our recapture efforts on the Nextel platform,
with 60% of postpaid customers staying with Sprint in the second quarter. One of the factors in our success is the
strength of our Sprint Direct Connect product, which continues to show industry leading push-to-talk call setup times.
We continue to expand and improve our SDC portfolio and we are confident we have the best push-to-talk product
available on the market.
During the quarter, we launched the Kyocera DuraXT, our fifth rugged SDC handset. At the same time, we enabled
Sprint Direct Connect to work on both our voice network and roam outside of our footprint, which means our
customers now have greater coverage than they did on the Nextel platform.
Please turn to slide 18. The next slide of – is the Network Vision scorecard, which I showed you last quarter, with an
update on the solid progress we have made. As I discussed last quarter, a critical part of the project is building a good
pipeline of sites for construction. To date we have completed leasing on over 12,700 sites and zoning on over 13,900
sites. We are either ready for construction or underway on over 6,300 or 52% of the sites we plan to bring on air this
year.
On July 15 we launched 4G LTE in five major markets and 15 cities, including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Atlanta
and Kansas City. We also announced the accelerated LTE launch in Waco, Texas and expect to launch four additional
cities, including Baltimore, by the end of August. The network is performing well and average speeds are highly
competitive. We now have over 2,000 Network Vision sites on air. As Dan has said, we are now activating Network
Vision sites on air at a rate, which if we maintain our current pace in existing cities and bring in new cities as planned
during the year, we will achieve our 2012 plan. The current week by week plans from our vendors continue to show us
achieving approximately 12,000 sites by the end of the year.
You should remember that Network Vision is not just about LTE, it's about modernization of our entire network which
includes voice and 3G. The coverage improvements that we are seeing on these towers are substantial. As we bring the
sites up, early results show a 10% to 20% jump in voice minutes per site overnight, a very important indicator of
expected future roaming savings. We expect these results to continue to improve as we light up 800 megahertz CDMA
voice and handsets with this capability continue to penetrate the base.
Another important milestone in the quarter was the approval by the FCC for the deployment of LTE in the 800
megahertz band. I want to reiterate our confidence in both the Network Vision build and the Nextel platform
decommissioning. The technology is working well and our three vendors continue to pick up the pace to hit our goals.
With, that I will now turn it over to Joe to go through the financials.

Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Last quarter I discussed the key financial measures of our business,
growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers
to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. These priorities remain unchanged in the second
quarter. We executed well against each of them.
I'm particularly pleased with our adjusted OIBDA results. Adjusted OIBDA of $1.45 billion in Q2 was up 20%
sequentially with flat sequential iPhone sales volumes and an increase of Network Vision impacts from approximately
$100 million in the first quarter to approximately $175 million in Q2. Even more gratifying, adjusted OIBDA grew
10% year-over-year while fully absorbing the incremental impact of our iPhone and Network Vision operating
expenses and with only a slight decline in gross adds. This growth in adjusted OIBDA is a direct result of our revenue
growth, lower upgrades due to policy changes implemented last year and cost containment due to our ongoing
commitment to disciplined growth.
Moving to slide 21, our core Sprint platform business continues to show strong growth in both subscribers and
revenues. Total customers on the Sprint platform increased by nearly 1.3 million in the quarter and contributed 3%
sequentially and 16% year-over-year growth in Sprint platform service revenues. Our Sprint platform postpaid business
performed especially well this quarter. While Sprint platform postpaid gross adds of 1.5 million were down slightly
year-over-year, the comparative quarter in 2011 was one in which we acquired some lower quality customers which
resulted in elevated churn for the past few quarters.
I am pleased to say that this elevated churn is now behind us, and our customer acquisition in the second quarter
displays our ongoing commitment to disciplined growth. Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 442,000 grew by 96%
year-over-year and 68% sequentially, aided by our best ever Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.69%.
As we indicated for the past three quarters, we expected involuntary churn to improve significantly this quarter as we
moved past the temporary churn bubble. This improvement in the involuntary churn as well as sequential improvement
in voluntary churn allowed us to post our best ever postpaid churn on the Sprint platform. Going forward we expect
Sprint platform postpaid churn to return to normal seasonal patterns, typically a sequential increase in Q3 followed by a
sequential decline in Q4.
The strength of our Sprint platform net adds was greatly supported by our focus on the recapture of Nextel customers to
our ongoing Sprint platform business. Q2 was our most successful quarter yet in this effort, recapturing 60% or
approximately 431,000 of Nextel platform postpaid customers. This result is well above our original business case
expectation and better than both the 46% recapture rate in the first quarter of this year and the 39% rate in the fourth
quarter of 2011.
As these customers move to the Sprint platform we are typically seeing an increase in company postpaid ARPU as they
transition to a higher mix of smartphones and take the premium data add-on charge. So our focus on the recapture
effort is both cost effective and is revenue accretive to the company a whole although slightly dilutive to Sprint
platform postpaid ARPU.
The success of the program to date gives us the confidence that we should achieve a recapture rate above 40% for the
next two quarters. However, as we enter 2013 and approach the complete shutdown of the network we expect the
recapture rate to decline.
Our current progress with the recapture effort has exceeded our expectations and our overall progress in reacquiring the
Nextel customer base gives us confidence that we will meet or exceed our original guidance of a 30% recapture rate as
we move toward the goal of complete shutdown of the Nextel platform by midyear 2013. To the extent that customers
begin to leave the Nextel platform faster than expected this may move some Nextel postpaid net losses that were
anticipated in 2013 into the current year.
As Dan mentioned, the Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.38 reached its highest level ever this quarter, growing by
7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The sequential increase to ARPU was due to continued penetration of our
premium data add-on charge to the base as well as changes to certain group discount policies which tightened eligibility
requirements and reduced customer credits in the second quarter. We do not anticipate these changes to group discount

policies will provide sequential benefit going forward. 81% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset sales in the second
quarter were smartphones and approximately 72% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset base now have smartphones.
We continue to enjoy strong sequential ARPU benefits on the Sprint platform from penetration of the premium data
add-on charge which we expect to continue through the second half of the year. While accretive to the company as a
whole, the success of our Nextel recapture rate does manifest itself in some ARPU dilution on the Sprint platform,
through both migration credits and the assimilation of lower ARPU subscribers into a higher ARPU base. Because of
the strong recapture rate in Q2, along with the impact of the group discount policy changes I just mentioned could
cause a temporary dilutive effect on the sequential change in Sprint platform ARPU from Q2 to Q3, while providing a
continued sequential ongoing benefit to the company as a whole. We expect Sprint platform postpaid ARPU would
revert back to a sequential quarterly growth in Q4.
Moving to slide 22, our Sprint platform prepaid business also continues to grow as we added 451,000 customers in the
quarter. While the prepaid business continues to enjoy good growth, the second quarter showed lower subscriber
growth due to typical seasonal slowness for Boost and Virgin Mobile, as well as impacts to net adds associated with the
changes in the regulatory environment of the Lifeline industry. Aggressive competitive behavior in the Lifeline
segment ahead of regulatory deadlines, as well as the complexity associated with implementing these new requirements
has had an impact on subscriber numbers across the industry in Q2. The regulatory changes that occurred in the second
quarter are still being implemented and the ultimate impacts are difficult to predict.
However, given these changes, we believe there will be a significant reassessment of overall volumes and thus
competitive behavior in the Lifeline industry. Because of this, we expect our Assurance Wireless and Lifeline industry
wholesale net add volumes to be adversely affected for the rest of the year. We are engaged in ongoing assessment of
the new environment and plan to continue to offer high value service options to current potential new Lifeline
customers.
Despite this impact, the fundamentals of our prepaid business are strong. Prepaid service revenue on the Sprint
platform grew almost 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Our Boost brand on the Sprint platform continues to
produce very strong customer growth, and the total Boost brand is growing despite Nextel platform declines. Within a
very competitive environment, the substantial improvement in churn we have made in the Boost and Virgin brands of
approximately 100 basis points year-over-year has contributed to our strong revenue growth.
Our wholesale and affiliate business also continues to show very good growth, while net adds of 388,000 were also
negatively impacted by seasonality and the Lifeline regulatory changes, wholesale, affiliate and other revenues grew a
robust 20% sequentially and more than 100% year-over-year. We continue to expect strong year-over-year revenue
growth in wholesale and affiliate business throughout the remainder of the year.
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on slide 23. Total wireless cost of service in the second quarter was
$2.3 billion or 31% of service revenues. This is a two percentage point gross margin improvement year-over-year and a
one percentage point sequentially even with incremental Network Vision spend and a seasonal uptick in 3G roaming of
$30 million sequentially.
Service and repair costs were down year-over-year and sequentially, driven by lower transaction volumes and higher
refurbished replacement rates. The positive impacts of the iPhone and the success of the Sprint buyback program which
was recently named the best in the industry by Compass Intelligent Research, are contributing to the improvements in
our cost structure.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the second quarter was approximately $1.5 billion, a sequential decline of $93
million and an increase of $322 million year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in subsidy expense is largely
driven by our iPhone investment, while high end per unit subsidy is already beginning to show operational expense
benefits in other areas of the business, including lower returns, service and repair, and calls to care. We believe our
results this quarter reflect the soundness of this investment.
As we look at the second half of the year, our quarterly adjusted OIBDA results could be impacted by the timing of a
possible launch of a new iPhone. While we do not know if or when a new iPhone may be launched this year, our

adjusted OIBDA estimates for the second half of the year assume incremental iPhone sales associated with a new
iPhone launch. We are also expecting an increase in upgrade activity in the back half of the year as a larger percentage
of our base becomes upgrade-eligible and we experience normal seasonal upgrade patterns. To the extent these iPhone
sales are higher or lower, this will affect our adjusted OIBDA projections.
Total wireless selling, general and administrative costs of $2.3 billion were flat year-over-year and down 2%
sequentially. This means our wireless SG&A expense as a percentage of wireless service revenue improved by three
percentage points year-over-year, even inclusive of an incremental $70 million of selling expense associated with direct
sourced iPhones. Excluding this expense, selling expense would have been reduced by nearly 4% year-over-year. This
strong improvement in our expenses is due to our ongoing, company-wide focus on cost management which is evident
across our business in the second quarter.
As Dan mentioned, we have recently rolled out our new lineup of LTE devices and launched LTE service in 15 cities.
As we look at the second half of 2012, we expect that we will begin to make select additional marketing investments to
support the continued growth of our business.
Please turn to slide 24. The strong core business performance I have outlined has resulted in wireless adjusted OIBDA
growth of 23% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, the total Network Vision impact to adjusted OIBDA was
approximately $175 million during the quarter, compared to approximately $100 million in the first quarter of 2012 and
minimal amounts in the second quarter of 2011. We expect that our Network Vision related dilution will continue to
show sequential increases through the remainder of 2012. The strong underlying growth of our core Sprint platform
business gives us confidence in our ability to continue to invest in our long-term margin expansion goals.
Now switching to wireline, adjusted OIBDA for the second quarter was $149 million, a sequential decline of 7% and a
year-over-year decline of 29%. While declines in this business continue, favorability in switched access, as well as
operational improvements in billing accuracy and collections, are improving our outlook for the year. Because of these
favorable trends, we are now expecting 2012 wireline adjusted OIBDA to be approximately $600 million.
Moving to slide 25, I now want to update our 2012 Network Vision outlook. We estimate approximately $300 million
of improvement in our 2012 Network Vision adjusted OIBDA impact versus our original business plan. We are now
estimating 2012 dilution from Network Vision of approximately $800 million, compared to our previous estimate of
$1.1 billion. Just over 50% of the $800 million dilution in 2012 will impact cost-of-service and just over 35% will
impact the net subsidy expense. Of the $300 million change from our previous estimate, an estimated $220 million of
the benefit from the original guidance is subscriber related, due to lower-than-expected customer losses on the Nextel
platform. An estimated $115 million of the benefit is due to lower-than-expected duplicative site costs as we deploy
Network Vision, better-than-expected Ethernet rates versus our original business case, and lower backhaul and other
expenses related to the accelerated thinning of the Nextel platform.
The third and smallest area of our estimated adjusted OIBDA savings is due to the treatment of tower lease expense for
thinned Nextel platform sites which Brad detailed at the beginning of the call and which is cash neutral. The current
estimated benefits we are seeing to our original business case reflect the success of the project to date. At this point, our
previous estimate of approximately $100 million dilution to adjusted OIBDA in 2013 and the broader economics of
Network Vision remain largely unchanged and, at year end, we will refine these numbers as needed. In addition, we
will be posting supplemental slides on our website that provide additional detail on the 2012 Network Vision update
after the call.
Moving to cash and liquidity on slide 26, we continued to make improvements to our liquidity and capital structure this
quarter. During the quarter, we entered into a new $1 billion secured-equipment credit facility with a syndicate of
international banks to finance equipment purchases from Ericsson for Network Vision. We ended the second quarter
with a total liquidity position of $8 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $6.8
billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility.
We also have an additional $1 billion of liquidity from the secured credit facility of which $500 million is available
currently through May 2013, and another $500 million is available beginning April 2013 through May 2014. We

continue to work with our Network Vision vendors to pursue additional export credit financing. We also retired $1
billion of 2013 debt maturities and now have less than $800 million of maturities due in 2013.
We are confident about our ability to finance the investments we are making in the core business. Capital expenditures
for the quarter were $1.2 billion which excluded $102 million of capitalized interest and included $704 million of
Network Vision capital. Re-banding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was approximately $50
million for the second quarter. Our CapEx outlook for 2012 remains unchanged at approximately $6 billion, excluding
capitalized interest and re-banding. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $209 million, compared to $138 million
in the first quarter and $267 million a year ago.
Moving on to our expectations on slide 27, because of the strong trends we are seeing, we are very pleased to announce
today an increase in our adjusted OIBDA outlook for 2012 to a range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. We are encourage
by the trends we are seeing in our core Sprint platform business and by the early favorable trends in Network Vision
expenses. At the same time we remain ever vigilant in our focus on execution and on maintaining balanced growth in a
highly competitive environment. The first half of 2012 has shown good underlying fundamentals in our business and as
we look to the second half of the year, we expect these strong underlying trends to continue and to support the ramp-up
in our Network Vision investments and a potential iPhone refresh.
At the same time, we will maintain the flexibility to perform competitively in the market. As always, we will continue
our commitment to cost discipline and our focus on executing against our key financial priorities: growth of subscribers
in revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform
and overall profitability in our execution.
We are pleased with our performance to date. We are thankful for the great execution by our employees and vendors
and we are excited about the quarters to come.
I'll turn the call back over to Brad.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. There's a lot to talk about. But let's start with ARPU. Joe,
you talked about customer credits and it sounds like 3Q could be, I don't know, flat, down, versus 2Q. Could you go
into that a little bit more? Thanks
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah, it's really a success-based thing. Because we've had so much success with the
recapture of Nextel subscribers and then with the one-time change in policy on second line discounts, you had a
one-time benefit in the second quarter that then becomes flat for third and fourth quarter, so you have this mathematical
calculation that potentially could cause OIBDA – I mean ARPU to be flat to slightly down, just on the Sprint platform
but not for the overall business. So the overall business ARPU will continue to have sequential growth, but we could
potentially have, you know, flat to slightly down ARPU just for the one quarter in 3Q.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: And then that's a one-time thing and Sprint platform ARPU...
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: One-time thing and then back in...
<Q - Phil Cusick>: ...should grow again in the fourth quarter?

<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: So it's a very minor thing, but we've been trying so hard to make sure we gave you guys
all the visibility and we re-establish credibility in our numbers and stuff, we just wanted to give everyone the heads up.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: That's helpful and if I can get one more in. You mentioned the tower lease treatment is the smallest
help to the Network Vision cost reduction and can you just remind us what that number is?
<A - Brad Hampton>: Yeah, Phil, it's Brad. The change in the tower lease treatment is $85 million of impact to
adjusted OIBDA for the full year, $8 million in the second quarter, and $77 million for the second half of the year, so
$85 million in total for the year.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Perfect. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of David Dixon from FBR. Your line is now open.
<Q - David M. Dixon>: Thanks very much. Good morning. Terrific results. Steve, I had a question on the network
upgrade progress. I'm feeling good about device availability in FY 2013 supporting both your 800 and your 2.6
spectrum band after good discussions with both Qualcomm and the handset manufacturers. But on the network front,
while I'm hearing good news from Alcatel and particularly from Ericsson on the technology front and Samsung in
terms of the cluster approach that caused bit of a lag optically, based on the sites year-to-date, what's giving you the
confidence that you're going to hit that 12,000 site target by the end of the year?
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Thanks, Dave, and a few good things I'd like to talk about on that. You know,
number one, there's about 700 to 800 sites that are really not on air simply because we – oops, I'm sorry. Can – I just
bumped the mike on.
<Q - David M. Dixon>: Yeah, we could hear that, Steve.
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Oh, you could. Okay. Good. So we've got several hundred sites that are done and
ready to turn on and we're waiting for backhaul, fiber basically to the site. We've got several hundred others that
basically we have birds nesting on them and once the birds leave, we'll be able to turn those sites on.
Also early in the quarter with one of our vendors they had backorders on antenna and for a couple of our markets, but
that's cleared now. And most importantly, each one of the vendors has really refined their logistics processes, basically
getting the product out of country to warehouse to the site and up the pole and have ramped up their crews
appropriately.
So that's what gives us a lot of confidence and at the same time, the key, as we've said before, is getting the pipeline
and getting the leasing, getting the zoning. So that, and finally the fact that we started on our key cities early in the year
and we're really ramping up in a new round of cities which gives a pool of call it candidate sites increases rather
dramatically. So that's what gives me the confidence, Dave.
<Q - David M. Dixon>: Okay. That's terrific. Thanks very much.

<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks. A couple of questions for you. If first on the Vision expenses during the quarter,
could you just give us a segmentation of where they broke out in different line items?
And then taking a step back, Dan, what's your reaction to the rate plan changes from your competitors moving to the
shared data plans and the implications on the pricing front and how they compare to where your plans are? Thanks so
much.
<A - Brad Hampton>: Hey, Mike, it's Brad. Let me take the first one on Network Vision. We're going to post a
supplemental slide on our website immediately following the call that gives a little more detail on how the Network
Vision expenses flow across the P&L for the year. So look for that on the website following the call.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Michael, Dan here. Number one, you know, what we want our rate plans to stand for is
simplicity and value and unlimited is still a significant differentiator and we think it's important to maintain, if you will,
very simple rate plans and you know, I think our rate plans are significantly simpler for customers to understand. It'll
take us awhile to assess what the impact will be. We have not seen a significant change, if you will, in customer
behavior based upon some of the new pricing moves. So we will look at it over time. We don't currently have any plans
to make any changes with respect to our rate card or rate structure or prices but we will evaluate – we will evaluate that,
if you will, month by month, quarter by quarter going forward. Right now we see no reason to make any changes. It's
still early.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: And should we expect an evolution in your tablet strategy, whether it's with the iPad or just
new pricing plans to promote more [indiscernible] device adoption?

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen from Macquarie. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Thank you. It appears that your iPhone investment is starting to pay off. Can you just walk
through the impact that the iPhone had on your CDMA churn reduction this quarter and also the sequential acceleration
in ARPU growth?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Yeah, this is Dan. Without getting into specifics that we don't disclose, I will say that the early
life churn, and again, it's early, but the early life churn is significantly better than we've seen on other smartphones, so
the expectation is that we will see better churn performance, and if you will, accretion to our churn numbers over time.
Calls to care are significantly lower than on other devices. Service and repair and returns are significantly lower than on
other devices, so all of the early life metrics tell us that we made the right decision. Churn and other care costs as well
as obviously the 40%, of the customers being new customers, high gross add percentage, all of those early indications
are positive.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: And, Dan, as a quick follow-up, it looks like you took pretty significant market share of iPhone
activations in the quarter, your competitors had significantly down iPhone activations and yours were flat. How would
you attribute that? Is that your unlimited plan, or is this still pent up demand from your install base of smartphone
customers that were demanding an iPhone? What would you attribute the share gains to?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: I attribute it to the simplicity of our rate structure and unlimited. I think that iPhone customers,
a lot of them began use on the iPhone on unlimited plans. They tend to be customers who moved to Apple products
because they are very simple to use. Customers like simplicity and our plans are the simplest, particularly with the
unlimited feature so I think that is the major reason.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thank you. Good morning, guys. So one quick question. Joe, when you laid out your
expectations for Network Vision at the end of Q3, you said you expected 400 to 600 basis points of margin expansion
from Network Vision and then another 400 to 600 basis points from organic improvements in the business. It seems
like the business overall for you and the industry in general is doing better than anybody thought it would be at that
point last year. And it seems like you're, you know, in line with or ahead of expectations on Network Vision. Can you
tell us where that 800 to 1,200 basis points of margin expansion is now based on the trends you're seeing in the
business, and can you remind us what base we should be adding that to? Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah, remember, you add it to the base that was from the 4th quarter of 2010, and, look,
we are very fortunate that our execution to date with lower churn, better recapture rate on the Nextel customers, the
consistent growth in the sequential change in ARPU, the fact that we're moving marketing costs to our own stores
versus third party stores, all of these things that are going on to either create efficiency, reduce costs or improve growth
on the top of the line all contribute to the growth in margin and we are optimistic about the original goal we set. We're
not prepared to change that until we achieve it, but we'll continue to provide you updates in the future.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Got it. Thanks, Joe.

And your next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. You're line is now open.
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Thanks. Good morning. Two questions if I could. First, nice job on getting the iDEN thinning
done early and the benefits for that. I had a question about that. I think I heard 8,300 sites that were decommissioned
through 2Q and 1,300 in third quarter, and the leasing amount, the $85 million that was just clarified for the 2012
impact, what percent of those 9,600 towers leases have you reflected into that $85 million benefit?
<A - Brad Hampton>: Yeah, hey, Ric, this is Brad. About...
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Yeah.
<A - Brad Hampton>: About 64% of the cell sites triggered the one-time recognition of the remaining lease
obligation. The sites that are either co-located or for which we could expect some future use or value were not reflected
in that reclassification, so 64% of the sites in the second quarter.
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Great. Okay. And the second question then, I think I heard that the roaming kind of early
indications 10% to 20% voice increase overnight. Can you talk to us a little bit about when you think you could see the
roaming benefits flow into the numbers? It sounds like that's probably not included in your updated EBITDA guidance
now and then how long would it take to get the 800 at the site and the handsets into the base?
<A - Brad Hampton>: In terms of the guidance, the roaming expense is relatively in line with what we expected.
There is some in-year timing delta of sites on air versus what we originally assumed in the business case but overall
we're seeing early indicators in line, and not expecting any significant change there to the case.
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Okay. And then one quick one since those were quick answers. I think Joe, you mentioned the
upgrade percent, about 9% includes the iDEN recapture. Do you guys look at it without the iDEN recapture and what it
is kind of running that maybe is more apples-to-apples with your competitors?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: You know what? I don't have that number for you right now, we try to look at it in total
just because in our mind, recapturing a Nextel customer is like reselling them and so I have not split that out for you.

<A - Brad Hampton>: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a couple. First on the handset costs into the
second half of the year, you mentioned that there's an assumption underlying that iPhone sales go up. I'm just maybe
trying to get a reference or a frame of reference of what underlies the EBITDA guidance at this point. I think people are
very focused on fourth quarter as a big refresh quarter in the industry. Maybe we can just, if you can compare it to last
year's fourth quarter, the upgrade rate then was 9%, is that roughly what you're assuming for this year, just to help us
think through that?
And then second question, Dan, on consolidation, obviously we talked about this before and the need for M&A in the
industry. I think there's been an admission historically that there were certain concerns that held Sprint back that
included obviously a host of network initiatives on your plate, included issues with currency over time. As you take
stock of this today, the currency has substantially improved, you highlighted obviously a lot of strong progress in the
network initiatives, so to what extent does this change willingness to consider consolidation opportunities at this point?
Thanks.
[05TRBZ-E Joe Euteneuer]In regards to your question on the upgrades, it's 9% or north. So we're – it's a hard one to
peg. We don't know what it is yet and how dynamic it's going to be, so we have assumed higher upgrades just because
we believe there might be a pent up demand for something really new and unique.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Okay. Thanks, Joe.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Dan here. I can't comment on any potential M&A activity. Obviously, Sprint does support
continued consolidation in the industry. I'd say in terms of constraints, the only thing we would want to avoid would be
anything between now and the middle of 2013 that would, if you will, stretch the resources of our network
organization. We want to complete Network Vision which will be largely complete by the middle of 2013 so we
wouldn't want to undertake anything that would complicate that process, the implementation process between now and
2013, mid-2013.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Okay. Thanks, Dan.
