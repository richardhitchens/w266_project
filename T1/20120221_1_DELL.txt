Robert L. Williams
Thanks, Regina [ph]. With me today are Michael Dell, Brian Gladden and Steve Felice.
During Q4 we spoke with many of you about creating a more efficient earnings process. Based on that feedback we are
condensing our prepared comments and expanding our web deck. In Q1, we will add a key topics document. These
materials along with our DellShares VLog will be distributed well in advance of the call and I encourage you to review
them for additional perspective.
Next I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are
forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially

from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, which are
discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement in our press release and web deck.
We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Please also note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin,
operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP measures are
reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the web deck posted in the Investor Relations section at
dell.com and in our press release and 8-K filed today. I encourage you to review these documents. Please also note that
unless otherwise mentioned all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress.
Now I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Rob.
Fiscal year 2012 was a strong year with great financial results for Dell. We also made important progress towards our
key strategic initiatives. To highlight a few key examples, we continue to enhance our Enterprise Solutions capabilities
by adding important intellectual property from acquired companies like SecureWorks, Compellent and Force10. We
improved the cost position, execution and profitability of our Client business, building on the success of the past two
years. We strategically invested in data center capacity and solution center capabilities around the world. And finally,
we significantly increased the number of solutions sales specialists and increased our enterprise R&D spending. These
investments have helped to reshape our business and will do so over the long term.
For the year, consolidated revenue was $62.1 billion and we delivered a record $18.6 billion in Enterprise Solutions
and Services revenue. This business now represents 30% of revenue and almost 50% of gross margin dollars.
Consolidated operating income was 7.1% of revenue for the year, which is right on our long-term target. And cash flow
from operations was $5.5 billion, up 39%.
From here, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Our full year results were in line with the outlook we provided in
our November earnings call. In addition, at the beginning of the year we said we would grow operating income 6% to
12% and revenue 5% to 9%. Despite a challenging macro environment we delivered 24% operating income growth and
1% growth in revenue. We had record gross margin dollars, record operating income and record non-GAAP earnings
per share of $2.13 per share, which was up 34%. While we're very pleased with our strategic progress and our total year
financial results, we did expect to do a bit better. There were a few areas in the fourth quarter that negatively impacted
our gross margins, and I want to address those now.
We called out the global hard drive situation as a challenge for the quarter; and while we were effective in shaping
demand and pricing for hard drive cost increases, we were impacted by the available mix of drives. We prioritized high
end drives to relationship customers, resulting in a product mix that was less profitable than normal in Consumer, and
our after point-of-sale hard drive business. Second, we worked through the remaining inventory of our previous
generation phones, primarily impacting our Consumer business. And finally our Public business growth was impacted
by continued weakness in U.S. public spending, which did not improve during the quarter. This resulted in a more
significant sequential decline and margin pressure than we would typically see in the business in the fourth quarter.
These three areas combined negatively impacted us by about $100 million.
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter P&L. Our key performance metrics and additional details are provided
for your reference on pages 8 and 9 in the web deck. We delivered revenue of $16 billion for the quarter, which
represents growth of 2%; and included a 14th week, which we estimate to be three percentage points of added growth.
Our gross margins were 21.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year but down 140 basis points sequentially. Consistent
with our views going into the quarter we effectively managed operating expenses while continuing to fund strategic
investments. For the quarter, OpEx declined 10 basis points sequentially to 14.6% of revenue.

Operating income was $1.1 billion or 7.1% of revenue. Interest and other expenses were $24 million, driven by a $45
million gain on the sale of an investment. Our tax rate was 18.4%, driven by an increase in earnings in lower tax
jurisdictions and tax benefits that we don't anticipate to repeat in FY 2013.
Earnings per share declined 4% to $0.51 per share. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 36 days. Days receivable
and days of inventory were flat relative to the third quarter. Days payable increased five days from the third quarter,
primarily driven by the extra week that was in the fourth quarter.
We generated $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations and ended the quarter with $18.2 billion in cash and
investments. We repurchased $561 million in stock in the fourth quarter and $2.7 billion or 178 million shares for the
year.
As we enter the fiscal 2013, we will maintain our disciplined approach to capital management, balancing cash needed
for strategic investments and repurchase activities.
Now let's take a look at our lines of business, which you'll find detailed on pages 13 through 18 of our deck. In the
fourth quarter we had record revenue in our Enterprise, Solutions and Services business of $4.9 billion. Dell Services
revenue grew 12% to $2.2 billion, while improving margins. The total value of new Services contracts signed is $1.9
billion on a trailing 12 month basis and Services backlog increased 11% to $15.5 billion led by Contracted Services
backlog growth of 13%. We're very pleased with the progress of our Services business as we head into FY 2013.
Server and Networking revenue increased 6%. Total Storage declined 13%, while Dell-owned IP Storage growth
accelerated 33% to $463 million led by continued growth in all of our Dell IP categories including Compellent, which
saw over 60% sequential revenue growth.
Our Desktop revenue was up 3% while our Notebook revenue was up 1%. Premium Products gained share
year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter.
Revenue for our Software and Peripherals business declined 4% for the quarter to $2.6 billion. This continues to be an
area where we'll see the effects of pruning the low margin elements of the portfolio.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve to provide some background on our business unit and regional results.
Stephen J. Felice
Thanks, Brian. I'll turn now to the segment level performance, which is detailed on pages 20 through 23 of the web
deck.
Our Commercial business approached $13 billion for the quarter, led by the strong performances in Large Enterprise
and the Small and Medium Business, which were up collectively 5% with sequential Op. Inc. growth of 6%. Large
Enterprise saw broad-based growth across both Client and Enterprise Solutions and Services. Our Large Enterprise
Services revenue increased 18% as we continued to expand our Vertical Expertise and develop service solutions that
are relevant to our customers' business needs.
Overall demand continued to be softer in the U.S., but we did see good growth in both EMEA and APJ.
Public revenue was down slightly versus the prior year. Like last quarter, the primary drivers are the continued
weakness in the U.S., Public and Western Europe sectors. For U.S. Federal we continue to see the slower spending
pattern that we saw in Q3 after the government's fiscal year ended in September. Despite the overall revenue decline,
though, Services revenue increased 7% and our Dell IP Storage revenue was up 32%. So these are good examples of
our government customers utilizing Dell Solutions to help drive productivity.
Small and Medium Business saw strong growth across all regions including the U.S. Enterprise Solutions and Services
performance hit an all-time high during the quarter, generating growth of 18%. SMB also delivered the highest growth
in Services across all segments at 28%.

The Consumer business delivered 2.7% Op. Inc. for the full year in line with the expectations that we set a year ago,
but in the fourth quarter results were mixed. Total revenue and margin weakness was largely concentrated in the U.S.
market with a decline of 15%. We continued to see good progress in our high end Consumer Systems as our XPS
Notebook revenue increased 103% for the full year. So while we're disappointed in Q4 profitability, we're pleased with
the overall progress made during fiscal year 2012 as the Consumer business grew Op. Inc. by $259 million versus the
previous year.
Geographically, we saw 10% growth in our Asia Pacific region during Q4 including 15% growth in China, while
EMEA growth accelerated to 8% despite a challenging macroeconomic background. Growth countries continue to be a
key driver as well, growing 8% in Q4 and finishing the year up 12%. With that I'll turn it back over to Brian to discuss
our outlook.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Steve. Before I get to outlook, let me just clarify; our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $1.8
billion.
We're committed to executing our strategy and are encouraged by the progress we've made and the fiscal year 2012
results. We're shifting the mix of the company's revenues and margin and our Enterprise Solutions and Services
businesses now account for 30% of our revenue, up from 24% three years ago. We continue to make the necessary
organic and inorganic investments to accelerate this progress. This will be the same play we run in fiscal year 2013.
For the next fiscal year we'll continue to focus on and prioritize operating income and cash flow as we make the
necessary investments to reshape the company. We expect earnings per share for fiscal year 2013 to exceed the record
$2.13 we delivered in fiscal year 2012. We also expect to deliver strong cash flow again with cash flow from operations
exceeding our net income.
With our primary objective continuing to be one of reshaping the company for the future combined with today's more
uncertain environment and our continued pruning activities, we're not providing a revenue outlook for the year. We feel
this will allow us to focus both externally and internally on our key strategic priorities. We plan to update our
longer-term outlook at our Analyst Meeting in June.
We're committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy. This past year we allocated $2.7 billion to share
repurchase, $2.6 billion to acquisitions in our enterprise portfolio and increased our R&D and CapEx by over 30%
respectively. For fiscal year 2013 we plan to allocate 10% to 30% of free cash flow to share repurchase and we expect
to spend approximately $700 million on capital expenses. We anticipate interest and other to average approximately
$60 million a quarter and are projecting a full-year tax rate between 19% and 21%.
For the first quarter and consistent with what you've heard from others in the industry, we're still seeing some
uncertainty around the hard disk supply and pricing. We expect drive mix management to continue to be challenging
but not as impactful as in the fourth quarter. We also anticipate good customer receptivity to the launch of our 12th
generation server line, which will occur in the first quarter.
Over the past three years our first quarter revenue has averaged approximately a 4% sequential decline. When
normalized for the 14th week this decline is closer to 7%. We expect our first quarter revenue to be approximately in
line with this adjusted historical decline.
Before we take questions let me close with a few summary points. We remain fully committed to our strategy. Our FY
2012 financial results were excellent and we delivered record revenue, op income and earnings per share. There are a
few areas we'd like to improve on from our fourth quarter results. And our fiscal year 2013 outlook calls for continued
mix shift to Enterprise Solutions and Services and a continued commitment to key investments in this area. And finally,
we expect to see year-over-year growth in earnings per share.
Now let me turn it over to Rob to get the Q&A started.

Robert L. Williams
Thanks, Brian. Just a quick reminder to please limit your questions to one with one follow up. Regina [ph], can we
have the first question?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I have one question and one follow-up please.
I'm still struggling a little bit on the forces at work on gross margin. I would have thought that pruning your Software
and Peripherals portfolio would have helped margins on a sequential basis in the quarter. I would have thought DRAM
pricing, which was down strongly, would have helped margins in the quarter, yet margins were down 140 basis points
sequentially on higher volumes, suggesting that ex those other factors maybe they were down 200 basis points. I
struggle with, given that Consumer's only 20% of the mix, that hard drives could have had that dramatic an impact. So
maybe you can go through each of the three reasons you cited and attribute or maybe refute the notion that pruning and
other components were not a help? But I'm still struggling with why gross margins were down so much.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Toni. I think the points you raised are all correct. I think those were things that would
have contributed to positive momentum on gross margins. We clearly talked about, coming into the quarter, some of
the concerns we had around margins.
Talking about the three items that we raised, for hard disks, we had uncertainty coming into the quarter. We had
significant inflation that came from the hard disk situation. We did effectively raise prices to offset that and the teams
did a great job of getting supply to support the demand that we had, but we just didn't get the mix of drives that we
wanted and it really forced us to sell lower – or less-configured, lower-end systems and prevented us from accessing
higher margin more highly configured systems. That played out across the portfolio but especially in consumer and
also, I would say, within our aftermarket sales of hard disks within the SMB business. So that's the one dynamic that I
think we didn't fully understand coming into the quarter, what that mix was going to do to us
On the mobility side we talked about – we wrote off previous generation phones. That was about a $25 million impact
in the quarter, quarter on quarter. And that is something that we would say is behind us now.
And then on the Public side, clearly, talked about the weakened demand that we saw after the federal year-end, in the
U.S. especially there was weaker demand. And I would say we saw bigger sequential decline in that business, which
had a mix impact. But also I would say it was a more competitive environment within Public. And in some cases,
market pricing was more aggressive and we participated in parts of that and that had an impact as well.
So those are three big things that I would call out. It's about $100 million, you could say 70 basis points of gross
margin. And there were other moving pieces as you look at other commodity prices and other dynamics in the quarter.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And then a follow up. You – at your Analyst Day last year you articulated a longer-term
model of 5% to 7% revenue growth. I think ex the 53rd week this year, you were about flat. It sounds like given the
way that you've given guidance for fiscal 2013 you're really not anticipating revenue growth again this year. I was
wondering, and I realize you're going to address this at your analyst day, but if that was truly meant to be longer term
guidance and you seem hesitant to reiterate it, what has fundamentally changed about either the competitive
environment or about Dell's approach to the business that makes you less confident about talking about that? About
talking about that as a longer term goal and also obviously in delivering against it in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Toni, we'll give you a much better long term view as we get into the June meeting. I
think clearly it's a different demand environment and there's more uncertainty as you look at things like Europe, as you

look at some of the demand dynamics we've seen over the past year. That's number one.
I think in addition to that, we've been more aggressive I think in pruning and I think that to some extent will continue
for some period of time. And by not giving you a real revenue outlook for the year, I think it gives us an ability to make
the right decisions for the long term, continue this transformation, make the investments we need and not get so fixated
on trying to deliver a specific revenue commitment.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you. The first question is around just the software strategy, if Michael could weigh
in here. You recently created the new business unit with new leadership from an industry veteran. Can you just kind of
help us understand how we should think about potential mileposts in terms of revenue? As well as also the gross
margin contribution?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Sure. Software obviously is playing an increasingly important role in the industry. We've made
a number of acquisitions around software and systems management and with KACE and cloud integration with Boomi
and infrastructure virtualization and orchestration with Scalent. And I think you'll see others as well fitting within the
very similar framework that we've used in the past.
John Swainson is joining the company to lead this group for us and we see a lot of opportunity in close adjacencies.
We've had a lot of success with a number of the acquisitions that have been software related and believe there is
significant opportunity for us to build a big business here. Don't really have any revenue projections for you at this
stage, but clearly it's a significant opportunity for us and we're thrilled to have John joining the Dell team.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you. And another question just for Brian or Steve, just trying to get a sense here in
terms of the sales and marketing and the R&D dynamics as we look to 2013. Obviously sales and marketing was a big
push this past year and it definitely supported your Enterprise Solutions growth, but just want to get a better sense here
as we continue to hear more and more about the non-PC part of the business, do you guys have the flexibility maybe to
pull back on sales and marketing now? Maybe drop some of that to the bottom line in 2013 and then maybe reallocate
some of it to R&D to kind of support the software build-out and the other non-PC build-outs?
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Yeah, this is Steve. We did do a lot of investing. We added a lot of specialists. We added a
lot to our, obviously, our capabilities with some of the acquisitions we've done and towards the end of this year we had
already started to communicate that we felt we had added the investment that we could now grow into that in a
productive way.
So you will see, going forward, a return to a more disciplined approach to the investment and to have the OpEx match
the revenue. We think we have the resources in place to support some growth, especially in the Solutions and
Enterprise areas and that's really where we focused the investment. So, yeah, you definitely won't see the same kind of
growth that you saw last year in the operating expense.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you.

<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just given the headwind in the quarter, can you talk about what the
industry and Dell in particular are doing to help lighten the blow from HDDs on margins in future quarters? And
specifically the hard disk drive companies have talked about long-term supply agreements, which would guarantee
supply at certain capacities and price points. Are these contracts that you've entered into that help manage the situation
over the next couple of quarters?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Katy, it's – clearly I think the teams did a very good job on our side to ensure that we
get sufficient numbers of drives. And as we talked about we maybe didn't get what we wanted. There were clearly cost
increases that we absorbed. As you think about the quarter, we had order of magnitude about $150 million of inflation
from hard disk costs. And that was pretty consistent probably with what the market saw.
Not going to provide specific details of the commitments that we made. I think some of that's probably competitive
information. But that's sort of the dynamic. Our hope is, and as we look at the situation over the next couple quarters,
this is going to remain a bit challenging probably for the next two quarters and begin to ease as we head into the second
half. That's how we're thinking about it.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. And then just a quick follow up on the EPS guidance; many of your peers when they
guide annually or multi-year, they're assuming some base level of acquisitions. Does your guidance for earnings growth
assume that you do some acquisitions through the year, or would those just be incremental EPS if they're addressed?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes. As we've talked to you about outlooks, I mean we've always given you a combined
view that includes everything we would expect to see. And we obviously don't know all of that at this point, but we
would intend to include that in the guidance in the outlook we provide.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Thank you. I'd like to ask more of a product question, and I guess it's probably a question
for Michael, but it seems like the server industry probably has a little more in terms of headwinds here, you've got the
continued performance increases from Intel and all the people in the industry. Virtualization, you've now got Server
based flash ramping. We've now had three years of very robust upgrade and consolidation activity within the base. And
so I'd just be curious to get your outlook for growth for the server industry this year and whether you believe that
Romley will fuel a significant upgrade cycle and why? Thank you.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yeah, I think what we're seeing is the replacement cycle actually accelerate a bit on servers.
And the reason is that the gains in processor and the combination effect of what's going on in I/O and solid state, flash,
the 10-gig Romley, this is all allowing for much more intense virtualization loads.
So we're super excited about our 12G server launch, which is coming in the first quarter. Obviously virtualization is a
big deal. We're simplifying Systems Management. Really going after the bigger workloads and accelerating the
movement of work from minicomputer and mainframe environments onto our 12G platforms.
We also believe that Romley will help us more tightly drive a synergy with our recent Force10 acquisition. And so
we've done a lot with flash, with solid state inside 12G. Stay tuned for the announcements, but we're very excited and
believe it's going be another strong year for Server, Storage and Networking. Remember, we're kind of changing the
whole sale from being an individual product to effectively selling the entire data center.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: And to follow up, Michael, is that growth rates in servers have obviously decelerated
dramatically during fiscal 2012 and during the fourth quarter in particular. Should we expect to see growth for the
Server business, in particular, re-accelerate in 2013?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Are you talking about unit growth?

<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Revenue growth.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yeah, I think the product cycle will certainly be healthy for growth and there are always value
shifts that go on among the various ingredients. Overall, the Enterprise business is doing quite well. We're seeing a lot
of growth in Storage. We had, in the quarter, 60% sequential growth in Compellent. Overall, our Dell IP Storage was
up 33% year-over-year and 19% sequentially.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, and I'd just add a component, we've kind of clicked along at mid to high-single digits
and up around 10% most of this year at a consolidated level for the company. And with Romley coming in Q1, I think
that you've got a reasonably nice setup as we enter the first half of the year. So still remains to be seen, but a lot of
performance improvement that Michael called out.
<A - Robert L. Williams>: Next question.

<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yep.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Louis Miscioscia with Collins Stewart.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Okay. Thank you. If we look at your first quarter revenue guidance and let's just assume,
even though I know you're not giving full year guidance, that you're around flat year-over-year. Others in the industry
have talked about global IT growth of let's say 3% to 4%. So let's say you end up being about flat, could we assume
then – because it'd be really nice to understand how much of that you are pruning out that, that delta if you're seeing the
industry that way is actually that 3% or 4% growth that the industry's getting that you're not?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, I mean obviously we're not going to give you a longer-term revenue view today. I
think as you think about the first quarter I mean we're just naturally calling this the historical sequential first quarter
versus fourth quarter dynamics adjusted for the 14th week. Yeah, I think what I would say is as you look at the revenue
dynamics and how we see demand for the year, I think the first half is going to be probably more challenging than the
second half and we would expect demand to be a bit better as we move throughout the year. So I think you could think
about it that way, Lou.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: And a quick follow up. In the Storage area obviously it seems like you all are starting to
do real well. Maybe just give us your thoughts on the competitive dynamics in the sense of who do you think you might
be taking share from? Because obviously it seems like you're growing faster than the market. Thank you.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: It's pretty competitive market. We have – we've seen great growth in SMB. Obviously, we have
a strong channel there. There's obviously some rebalancing as we position Compellent more to the higher end, but the
whole thing, as you said, 33% growth year-over-year is strong. We're at 93% of our revenue now is our own IP. So
we're pretty much through the transition and believe we can grow this business quite nicely, but it is a competitive
environment. Obviously having the full portfolio of Server, Storage, Networking, Services and increasingly Software is
very helpful in many of the opportunities that we find.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Okay. Good luck on the New Year.
<A - Robert L. Williams>: Thank you.

<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you. My first question is can you just provide some more color on end demand,
geographic, vertical basis, anything you can give us in terms of what you're hearing from your customers? And then
possibly talk a bit about the linearity that you saw during the quarter?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I'll give you a little bit of the numbers, Shannon, and then Steve can you some maybe
insight into what he's seen in the marketplace. As you think about regionally, in the quarter, obviously Asia Pacific was
the fastest growing market. We were up 10%, EMEA was up 8%, which is clearly faster than the market. And then
Americas driven by the U.S. was down, and down 3%. For the total year, APJ was up 15%, EMEA was up 4% and
Americas was down 4%. So that's the regional dynamics.
I think when you look at the product lines or the segment performance, clearly on the corporate side between Large
Enterprise and SMB we saw solid growth and year-over-year was up 6% for SMB and up 5% for Large Enterprise.
And both of those were up mid-single-digits for the year. So those are the fundamental numbers. Maybe Steve can you
give you some color.
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Well, there's not a lot to add there. The – in Europe, I would say we are seeing some definite
growth ahead of what appears to be market conditions. So I'm really pleased with what's going on in Europe. It's a good
case where if we run the strategy right, we're gaining both unit share and revenue share while our profit is accretive
both on a percentage basis and a dollar growth basis. So that's really a strong story. In Asia, we're also seeing some
similar dynamics. So it really is limited to a few sectors like the U.S. federal or some of the larger government entities
in Western Europe where we see the biggest headwinds.
On the Consumer side, we're seeing pretty healthy growth in most parts of the world. The hard drive rebalancing did
get in the way in the U.S. So we probably could have grown more, but to add a little color to this, when we get the mix
of drives, we have a series of customers that have a set contract with us that has a certain configuration. And we fill that
– those demands – that need first.
So it's really the transactional side of the business. And even part of Toni's question, Consumer is completely
transactional but we have a lot of business within our small business and our large corporate, even pieces of that that
are more transactional. In other words, it's really demand that comes in that day where it's not under a contract. That's
where we had to shape the drives and we would normally sell a higher mix of capacity into those if we had access to
that. And that's what impacted both the Consumer business from a demand and a margin basis in the U.S.
As a good example, we don't want to put a 350-gig drive on an XPS computer because it's going to have a bad
experience for the customer, so it limited our ability of what mix we could sell. So that impacted demand a little bit and
I think we'll see that continue to improve as each quarter goes by where we have more visibility to the mix of the drives
we're going to be seeing.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And then, Michael, if you could just talk a little bit about your thoughts on the
opportunities for ARM both on the Server side as well as notebooks and tablets?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: I think with Windows 8 obviously there's great excitement, particularly in the corporate space
for us and the addition of both capacitive touch capability, integrating that in with the software and the ARM processor.
Pretty excited about Windows 8 and the effect that will have on demand, first with consumer but then flowing pretty
rapidly, there's a pretty strong appetite for a Windows tablet in Enterprise with the security and compatibility that
customers kind of expect.
On the Server side, we've been experimenting with ARM now for oh, I'd say more than a year. The challenge is really
in the software stack. It's maturing. There's the LAMP stack, which is the obvious place to start. Competition isn't
standing still there and more competition there is certainly a good thing. And there's some interesting opportunities
emerging, but I think x86 still has an enormous lead in that space.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. Can you give us a bit more color into what you're seeing in terms of
competitive pricing? I know you said you saw some competitive pricing in the Public segment. But outside of that,
what are you seeing? And are most of your competitors attempting to pass along HDD costs as well? Or are there still
some companies that are just hyper focused on share gain?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: We haven't seen a substantial change in behavior over the last few quarters. There's pockets
of aggressiveness, but I wouldn't call it broad based. There is one concern that we've expressed over the last couple
quarters, where some of our competitors have been long in inventory and so we've seen older models get somewhat
aggressive and we've had to back off and let that flush its way through. We saw a little bit of that this quarter. I know
we've been able to successfully pass through the hard drive cost increases and we still feel like we're in good
competitive position, so I'd say in general, that's probably happening across the board.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dive a little bit more in the model again.
Most of the questions have been asked, but just simplistically as we look at the year, you guys have basically come in
slightly above your long-term target operating margin of 8% non-GAAP. Underpinning the $2.13 estimate plus for the
full year, are you assuming that you're at or above that level again for fiscal 2013? I'm trying to dictate between
operational OpEx management versus ongoing share repurchase and what you're factoring in?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I mean, to be fully transparent, I mean I think as you look at the buyback that we've
done this past year and head into next year, the impact of the FY 2012 share repurchase is about $0.06 of EPS benefit.
You guys can do the math in terms of 10% to 30% buyback on a cash flow generation number for this coming year and
figure that out. I think we've given you a sense for tax rate being about the same year-over-year and we've given you
interest and other, so I think you can kind of get back to a view of how we're thinking about the operational
performance of the business and I think that's about it.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Okay. Fair enough. And then the follow-up question for me would be on the storage side
obviously you're burning through and I would assume that you're pretty much all the way through the legacy EMC
business. Compellent being up 60% sequentially, it seems to imply that you have what looks to be ongoing anemic
growth, if you will, in your legacy EqualLogic business? I think there's been some transitions that you've worked
through. Can you touch a little bit on EqualLogic specifically within that category?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I would say EqualLogic actually sequentially picked up nicely and we had
double-digit growth there and we had strong – we had good growth year-over-year as well in EqualLogic, so it's picked
up. And we've talked about some of the challenges during the summer, and even after the third quarter. I think for the
most part we launched a whole new set of products in the third quarter and we're now in the process of upgrading all
those – moving to those new products, so it actually feels pretty good.

<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. Brian, for you if I could. On gross margins, your gross margin, if I net out
that $100 million force was still down about 70 basis points sequentially to, call it the mid-22s. If I think about your
comments to previous questions, is that the right benchmark as we look to the potential April gross margins? And if
you could just talk a little bit about will margins be flat, down or up, at least directionally? And what the forces are that
persist there? Because HDDs will be there, you've already commented on that, but I'm trying to understand the
benchmark relative to say the mid-22s that you reported in January versus what you might have in April?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I think, Keith, we've probably said as much as we're going say. I mean we're not going
provide margin level guidance. I mean, I think the things we talked about for the most part, we feel like we've got our
arms around. Clearly the mobility is not going to be an issue going forward. The hard disk situation should get better as
we move throughout the first half of the year. And maybe that's about all we're going give you at this point.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Brian, can I at least just push you on that? Is there opportunities for improvement or
we should just think about all those forces persisting in the April quarter at least such that gross margins would be
flattish?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, look, I think if you look at it over a multiple quarter dynamics here, I mean we're
growing the Enterprise business much faster. And that is a higher margin part of the business and we should, over a
series of quarters, see expansion of gross margins because of that. We've been talking about that for a while and we can
start to show you actually that's happening.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: And that's a primary driver. I think you'll have some lumpiness with other issues in any
given quarter.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, thank you, Brian.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I just have a clarification, I think, Steve, you mentioned OpEx wouldn't grow at
the same level going forward for the next year. Could OpEx actually come down for any reason? Or do you – or is Dell
in the stage here, maybe this is for Michael as well, where you have to invest just to execute on this Enterprise strategy?
And then on the issue of gross margins going forward, has anything changed in the pricing environment on the Server
side at all going forward? Because I think you benefited just from a beneficial mix shift in Servers over the last year,
I'm trying to see if there's any risk around that.
And then finally, I've actually seen that one [ph] of the karmas (43:27) have asked this, in terms of the lower margin
businesses you want to prune, is there a dollar number that you can help us think about? Is it $5 billion? Is it $1 billion?
Any kind of a range? I'm trying to think about how much that might hamper Dell's ability to grow revenues not just for
the next year but for the next two or three years. Many thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Kulbinder, it's Brian. I'll kick it off on the OpEx. I mean I think there will be places clearly
where we continue to invest. We've been investing in Solutions and Services and adding Solutions head count in both
the R&D side as well as sales specialists. We'll continue to do that. We will continue to invest in the acquisitions that
we've done and in those acquisitions that we do going forward to build out capabilities there.
I think there are still opportunities to reduce OpEx in other parts of the business. And I think you've seen us do that as
we've looked at a weaker demand environment over the last couple quarters. So I think it will be a blend, but we're not
going hesitate to make the investments we need to make to drive the strategy. That's a big part of what we're doing to
transform the company.

Steve, you want to...
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Well, that's exactly right. The key thing is that we're starting to see the productivity benefits
of the investments we made. And I think if you look at the year in balance, we clearly did the right thing in investing in
the business. That's what's driving the higher margins is our ability to sell a higher mix and a higher solutions set. So
now we're just saying that we've got a more productive set of capabilities and we can scale it better. But as Brian said,
we want to continue to invest in the business. So as long as the demand environment allows it, we'll continue to add
investments.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yep. On your Server margin question, I think we've done a nice job of changing the mix of
where we play in the Server business and moving to more highly configured, higher end workloads within that space. I
think that's driven a nice expansion of margins within the Server business. We think that, that will continue; with our
12th generation products we'll continue to do that. So we feel pretty good about the overall sustainability of the
profitability in the Server business.
And what was your third question, Kulbinder?
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Sorry, on the pruning of businesses just in terms of what's left, is that like a $5 billion
number in revenue turns on an annual basis? Is it $1 billion? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much more pruning
Dell has left realistically. And not thinking of the next year, I'm thinking of the next couple of years in terms of how
much that might hamper your revenue growth?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, I would say without giving you specifics that we're through the majority of this. We
told you about $3 billion this past year was what we were working our way through. And that's still a good number. It
would be a smaller number as we move forward; and primarily focused in the S&P business is the primary element that
we move forward with.

Your next question comes from the line of Maynard Um with UBS.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi. Thank you. Can you just talk about how you've measuring the R&D and sales and
marketing investments that you've made over the last year into the businesses? What metrics in particular you're
looking at and how that's tracking so far relative to your original expectations?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, I think – we've done – we've really bifurcated the way we think about OpEx and,
clearly, have begun to look at some of these product lines relative to competitive benchmarks. If you think about the
Storage business, you think about where we are on Enterprise in total and we've basically set some targets around the
right levels of investment.
Clearly, those teams have commitments around growth, they have commitments around the product portfolio and
launching new products. But I think we've got a real sense for what's required to be successful in these kinds of
businesses and we're committed to get there. And I think at the same point, we're going be tough in other parts of the
business whether it's in G&A or other less profitable parts of the business in terms of investment and that's how we can
fund those things.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Well, I guess specifically to the specialists that you hired, how are you measuring those guys
and how is that, in particular, tracking?
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Yeah, we have a series of key performance indicators, and, for competitive reasons, I'm not
going to share the details of them. But we can measure how much growth we're getting in the way we define a solution.
We can measure the pipeline that's generated that are multi-line of business, for example. We can measure where we've
added Services content to the sale. We can look at the revenue productivity per specialist. So we've got a number of

metrics that we're pretty maniacally focused on and so we know how we're progressing here. And that's why I said
earlier, I'm pleased with the improvement in productivity as we go into this New Year.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Got it. And the just lastly on the Services business, can you just talk about what the big
growth drivers are there and whether you think you are sufficiently scaled in that business? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I think it's really across the board. I mean we've shared some of the progress we've
made in new contracts on the nonsupport side of that business. But I think we've also made progress with attach rates
on support and, overall, really across the board some nice growth. In terms of scale, I think that's the place that you'll
see us continue to invest to support that business. It's clearly one of the strategic priorities for us.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Marshall with ISI.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys. If you look at your Storage business, obviously, Dell-owned IP Storage
has been doing extremely well. But we haven't seen much growth in that business as the third party resale comes down.
So we've kind of been hovering around 500 million in revs on quarterly basis for quite some time. It seems to me that
still commodity hardware represents the majority of the company's revenue. And that's been the case for, obviously, the
past couple years as we really tried to move to strategic revenue sources. Can you discuss a little bit about how this is –
are we going to see similar trends that we've seen in Storage in your Networking as well as your Software business
going forward as we transition to more Dell-owned IP and stop the resale of third party?
And then the follow-up question is could you give us the unit number as well? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Brian, just on the third party storage. On the total year, that was down about 64%. We
still have some more work to do there as you move into the first quarter. It was down in the fourth quarter 83% and
there's still a fair amount from a comparison standpoint in prior-year first quarter results. So as we head into the second
half of the year, we're pretty comfortable that we'll be completely through that. Probably even into the second quarter
and we'll have overall Storage business begin to move forward in a growth mode.
As you think about that model, it's really almost the same exact framework we would expect to see in the Networking
business and as that gets to a scale that's larger, we'll begin to give you a little more visibility to that and probably at the
Analyst Meeting as well.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yeah, Brian, and I would just add that the focus is clearly on continuing to add Dell intellectual
property that we think is disruptive and that can provide real value for our customers. So if you look at this past year,
there's a lot of clear indication of that in SecureWorks and Compellent and in some of the other acquisitions that we've
made, Force10 and then the integration of things like Ocarina and Exanet into our Storage portfolio.
So, yeah, no question that we're going to continue to be in the end user computing business for the foreseeable future a
long time to come and it's great business to be in if we can grow it appropriately and attach the Services and kind of
drive that business appropriately so. So that's kind of how we're – that's kind of how we're thinking about it.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Sure, understood. Thank you. And the unit number if possible?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: I don't think we disclose units anymore. We moved off of that about a year ago.

<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Thanks. Brian, but based on the information you've given on buy-backs and other income
and tax rates, etcetera, it's still possible to drive EPS growth without driving growth in operating income. So it's still not
clear to me whether you expect to drive operating income growth in fiscal 2013? And I'm still confused as to why you
aren't specifically discussing an op income growth objective for the year whereas last year you did? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, we spent some time benchmarking and looked at peer companies and what they do
and we were really the only company out there providing operate income outlook. So we decided to be consistent with
other companies. So that's why we moved to EPS.
I think your math is right. I think given everything we see right now as we head into the year, that's the number that
we're calling. And I think as we move throughout the year and things become a little bit more certain around the
demand environment, around where we are in the investments we need to make, we'll obviously give you more clarity
on that. But we do think we can grow earnings per share and that's our focus.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: All right. Maybe just one final follow up, if I could. In terms of capital allocation you
talked about buybacks at 10% to 30% of cash flow. You talked about CapEx for the year. Can you say whether Dell is
more seriously considering the issuance of a dividend? And if not, what are the key arguments against the dividend as
you talk about this option with your Board, given the company is generating a lot of cash, it's pretty consistent and
you're sitting on large pile of cash as well? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I think we talked about this last quarter in a specific question. I would just say that the
one big area of uncertainty that we obviously have to manage through, and this is something we think about and talk
about from time to time with the Board, is really around U.S. liquidity and access to capital in the U.S. And as that gets
clearer I think we would obviously be in a position to talk more about that, but that's probably the biggest thing that we
think through as we consider that alternative, Brian.
