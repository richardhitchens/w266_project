MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted
by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer.
During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web, at www.xerox.com/investor. At the
request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and or rebroadcasting of this
call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]
During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by
their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially
different than those expressed herein.
At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.
Ursula M. Burns
Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. To set the stage, here is a year-to-date
review of the strategy that is transforming our business.
First, accelerating our Services business, growing it faster by diversifying our offerings and expanding globally;
through the third quarter, revenue from Services is up 6%, backed by a very positive pipeline. We've been especially
pleased with the new contracts we've signed this year. Our new business signings are up 7% year-to-date.
Second, we are a services-led, technology-driven company, which means maintaining our leadership in document
technology is a top priority. We continue to hold our number-one equipment revenue market share position, and we've
already launched 21 new products this year. And we are competitively advantaged through the breadth of our portfolio,

our multiple sales channels, and through our innovative work flow and managed print solutions.
Third, we're managing our business with a disciplined focus on operational excellence. Our productivity initiatives this
year have helped offset the challenges from the Japan natural disaster and other macro dynamics.
By executing well on the first three priorities we are delivering on the fourth, expanding earnings and returning cash to
shareholders. Through October 24, we've bought back $450 million in Xerox shares, with another $250 million planned
through the end of the year. And year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share are up 17%. We're on track to grow full-year
earnings by 15% to 18%.
The year clearly has not been without challenges, but I am pleased with the progress that we're making on all four
priorities, all of which collectively deliver value for our shareholders. Part of the value comes in how we're redefining
our business and our brand. As a company in the midst of transformation, I spend a lot of time talking with
stakeholders about the new Xerox. It's no surprise that our brand is known for great printing technology, but it's often a
big surprise to learn that our technology and services not only change the way that people work, but also how they live.
Turn to Slide 4 for some examples of what I mean. This is a snapshot of the many ways our innovation is integrated
into solutions that simplify how the world works. Through our Transportation Solutions Group, we're working with
municipalities around the world to modernize their public transit systems. In cities like Abu Dhabi, where public transit
use is expected to grow five times in the next 20 years, we've developed a new payment system that require nothing
more than a pre-loaded debit card. Our role is to handle all the project management, the IT integration, processing, and
payment reconciliation.
As the largest provider of transportation services to governments worldwide, we have projects in 30 countries. Our
digital solutions for tolling, parking, and public transit are being replicated across multiple geographies, from New
York, Mexico City, and L.A. to Casablanca, New Jersey, and 400 other municipalities around the world.
The next example is electronics claims processing. This reflects our expertise in bridging the digital and paper divide.
With healthcare payers, including government agencies like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, we've created the
infrastructure and are managing the process to convert a paper-based claims system into a digital one. The new system
for the VA will significantly reduce backlogs and more accurately process benefit claims for veterans and their
dependents.
We're also making it easier for healthcare companies to communicate with their members. At Medco, we're developing
and managing a multi-channel platform that lets Medco's 65 million members personalize how they receive information
from the company via hard-copy statements, secure website, email/text messages, or a combination of all of these
channels. It's a solution that is providing – is proving to be relevant for several member-based industries and one that is
increasing our revenue with banks and other financial services firms.
All three examples demonstrate repeatable, scalable, and integrated solutions. This is our approach to real business,
improving our clients' productivity by simplifying the way that they serve their clients. Our results in the quarter reflect
progress in these and other areas, so let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of Q3 performance.
In the third quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.26. That's up 18% from a year ago. On a GAAP basis, earnings
were $0.22 per share. This includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles. Revenue was up 3%, reflecting
growth in Services and aided by the strong euro. Technology revenue was up 1%, and Services revenues increased 6%.
Supply constraints due to the natural disaster in Japan have eased considerably, and as we shared with you last quarter,
we've been working very closely with our colleagues in Japan to accelerate production and ensure that we're meeting
our customers' needs. We've made significant progress in reducing our backlog while meeting new demand, and I'm
very confident that these challenges are now entirely behind us.
Operating margin of 9.6% was up 0.4% this quarter, and gross margin of 32.7% is down. As demand increases for our
outsourcing services, we do see an impact on gross margin, which we continue to offset with cost reductions and
operational improvements, as you see in our improved SAG results, all of which helped deliver solid bottom-line
results.

Cash from operations was $366 million. We've generated $683 million in cash through quarter 3. With quarter 4 always
our strongest quarter for cash generation, we remain committed to delivering at least $2 billion in full-year operating
cash and will continue to use available cash for acquisitions and share repurchase. In a moment, Luca will provide
more detail on cash flow, as well as review our balance sheet and reporting segments. Then we'll both take your
questions, but first, let's take a closer look at our top-line results on Slide 6.
A year ago, revenue from Technology and Services was almost equal. Now, Services represents a higher percentage of
our total revenue, reflecting investments in building our outsourcing portfolio and expanding our offerings globally.
This growth strategy is generating more long-term contracts, and as I noted earlier, more new business signings, all of
which fueled growth in our annuity stream. Total revenue of $5.6 billion was up 3%, with both annuity and equipment
sales up 3%. Equipment sales are up sequentially as well, reflecting progress we've made in reducing backlog, creating
demand for new products, and the effectiveness of our growing managed print services.
There is no doubt that we have industry leadership in MPS, and we're strengthening this leadership by broadening our
offerings. This includes print services geared for mid-size businesses and sold through our channel partners, and
managing an enterprise's entire print infrastructure, from their outsource production printing to individual workers'
mobile print needs. Continued external recognition speaks to the competitive advantage of our services-led,
technology-driven strategy, and it's helping us grow our business. Revenue from document outsourcing was up 12% in
the quarter, and BPO was up 6%.
Joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS have resulted in more than 200 revenue synergy deals this year,
delivering significant total contract value for the company, and helping grow our pipeline. These deals include a
multiyear contract with a major telecom company to administer their employee benefits, and a big win with a pharma
company to help manage their global learning systems. And at National Grid, the global gas and electricity company,
we've developed an integrated solution to redesign their worldwide print and IT infrastructure.
So, summing up the quarter, we're executing well across the business. We've delivered steady revenue growth, along
with earnings and cash in line with our expectations. We effectively managed through the supply chain constraints. We
are efficient across our global operations, and we've launched market-leading products, acquired new services
capabilities, and expanded our sales channels.
We're winning big deals that fuel our long-term annuity, and we resumed our stock buy-back program, with plans to do
more in Q4. We expect this solid performance will continue, positioning us well to deliver on our full-year
commitment.
With that, let me turn it over to Luca. I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?
Luca Maestri
Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong EPS in Q3, thanks to improving revenue growth,
expense management, and equity income. Also, cash came in as planned, and we were able to take an aggressive first
step in deploying cash towards share repurchase.
Starting with our top line, revenue growth was 3% at actual currency, with a two-point benefit from currency, and
increased two points sequentially at constant currency. Services continue to drive our growth and were up 6%, while
Technology improved and was up 1%. Operating margin in the quarter was 9.6%, up 0.4 of a point year-over-year.
Gross margin, however, was affected by the shift of business towards services and the ramp of new contracts. We
expect this dynamic to continue as Services growth accelerates and new contracts start up.
We are offsetting the gross margin impact with disciplined expense management. Both R&D and SG&A ratios
improved significantly due to restructuring and synergies. Below the line, equity income in the quarter was $43 million,
which reflects continued strong results for Fuji Xerox in Asia Pacific and benefits from restructuring actions. Our
adjusted tax rate was slightly lower than usual due to a higher foreign tax credit benefit, and offset the negative impact

of currency dynamics during the quarter. As a result, adjusted EPS was $0.26 and grew 18% year-over-year. The only
adjustment to reported EPS was the amortization of intangibles, and GAAP EPS was up 29% year-over-year.
Let us move to the Technology segment on Slide 8. We continue to show profit growth in the Technology segment in
spite of our relatively soft and volatile economic environment. Technology revenue of $2.5 billion was up 1% at actual
currency and down 1% at constant currency. It represented a three-point improvement over Q2. Segment margin of
10.3% was up 0.3% year-over-year, reflecting restructuring and synergy savings. At the Product segment level, entry
install performance was affected by a combination of continued higher backlog and timing of product introductions.
Product launches during Q4 should drive improvement in this segment, which represents 22% of our technology
revenue.
Mid-range color was the segment most impacted by the Japan shortages, and we saw good growth as the supply chain
began to recover. Backlogs are healthy entering Q4, and we expect to continue our positive market performance.
Mid-range now accounts for 58% of our technology revenue.
In high-end, iGen4 and the 800/1000 color press continued to show good growth, and we began to see some
improvement in the entry production color space, where we had indicated that we had a product gap. Additionally, we
have announced two very promising new products that we'll be launching toward the end of the year, the Xerox 770,
which will further strengthen our entry production portfolio, and the CIPress color continuous feed, which brings our
solid ink technology into the continuous Speed segment, providing very competitive running costs and ability to print
on any paper stock.
Moving on to Services on Slide 9, we continue to deliver good growth in Services despite the economic environment,
which is a reflection of the breadth and diversify of our Services portfolio. Services revenue was up 6%, with BPO up
6% and document outsourcing up 12%. ITO revenue improved, and was flat in the quarter. BPO's 6% growth was
driven by recent acquisitions, as well as human resources, healthcare payer, customer care and transportation. This
growth more than offset declines in government services and the timing of contract runoffs and ramps.
BPO signings were $2.3 billion, which is up over 10% year-over-year and reflects wins across all lines of business,
including a significant deal to take over the U.S. check-processing services of Symcor, which will contribute
approximately $100 million a year in revenues. BPO's pipeline remains strong, and revenue growth will continue as we
start to have significant contracts, such as California Medicaid, during Q4.
ITO revenue was flat in the quarter, with contract ramps from recent strong signings offsetting contract losses from
earlier in the year. We expect ITO growth to remain constrained, as new business signings will be offset by the impact
of the contract runoffs. Document outsourcing continues to show strong growth, with revenue up 12%, and this reflects
both the impact of new signings and benefits from our partner print services offerings, which began to be reported in
document outsourcing this year and are accelerating. Signings of $1 billion were once again strong, with both renewals
and new business up double-digits.
Maybe the strongest metric for the quarter was total signings, which grew over 30% year-over-year. The trailing
12-month signings calculation declined 9%, as it includes the 10-year $1.6 billion California Medicaid deal we signed
in Q1 2010 and the Texas Medicaid renewal that occurred in Q2 of 2010 for close to $1 billion. Also, the total contract
value of new business signings was up over 70% year-over-year, and annual revenues expected from new business
signings were the highest ever for the company.
Even after a strong signings quarter, the pipeline remains healthy and is up 5%, including synergies. Segment margin of
11.9% was up 0.7% year-over-year thanks to good expense management and the benefits from restructuring offsetting
impacts from contract startup costs.
Moving on to our key metrics slide – and this quarter we are including all of our key metrics reporting on one single
slide. I think it provides a good snapshot of our business drivers. I just reviewed signings and install performance on the
previous slide, but would like to take a moment to touch on color, machines-in-field, and page metrics. Keep in mind
that these metrics include the technology segment plus document outsourcing. Total color was up 9%, or 6% at
constant currency. Digital MIF, machines-in-field, continued to grow, and was up 3% in total, 14% for color-capable

devices. Finally, digital pages showed an improvement in the quarter, and were down 3% year-to-date, with pages from
color devices up 9% year-to-date.
Moving on to the balance sheet on Page 11, our Q3 ending debt balance decreased $100 million from Q2, to $9.2
billion, and included the repayment of $750 million in term debt and an increase of $650 million in our commercial
paper program. We continue to target a year-end debt balance of $8.6 billion, which is a $650 million reduction from
our 2010 year-end interest-bearing liabilities of $9.3 billion, and would put us very close to our steady-state leverage.
The vast majority of our debt, as you know, is in support of our financing business. Of the $9.2 billion debt balance, $6
billion can be associated with the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance debt is calculated
assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $6.9 billion. These finance assets represent committed revenue streams
from our customers.
Our strong capital structure and cash generation has enabled us to resume our share repurchase program. During the
quarter, we spent $309 million and repurchased 38 million shares. We have continued that activity into Q4, and as of
October 24, we have repurchased additional $140 million, or 18 million shares, for a total of $450 million or 56 million
shares since the start of the program.
We have also made a portion of our Q3 domestic pension funding in stock amounting to approximately 60 million
shares. This decision gave us further flexibility in managing our cash flow during the quarter to meet all our cash
priorities, including being present consistently in the market to repurchase shares during a time of extreme volatility.
We continue to plan to repurchase 700 million shares in 2011 and anticipate a Q4 average fully diluted share count of
approximately 1.425 billion shares and a year-end fully diluted share count of approximately 1.405 billion shares.
Slide 12 provides further detail on our cash performance. Cash from operations of $366 million was equal to Q3 of
2010 and positions us to deliver our cash flow guidance of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. Performance was driven by
earnings of $329 million. Consistent with normal seasonality working capital during the quarter was a use of cash of
$168 million. Pension contributions of $225 million were $83 million higher year-on-year due to anticipated catch-up
payments.
CapEx was $121 million in Q3, $367 million year-to-date, and is on track for approximately $500 million for the year.
During the quarter, we also invested $51 million on tuck-in acquisitions, both in services and technology; 69 million on
dividends; and reduced debt by over $100 million.
In summary, during Q3, we continued to execute on our strategy. Revenue growth of 3% was an improvement over the
first half of the year. Services signings were very strong, up over 30% year-over-year. Operating margin improved.
Adjusted earnings grew 18%. Cash flow is on track, and we began the share repurchase program at a strong pace.
With that, back to you, Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. We've been successful in leveraging our
brand, our global scale, and innovation to win multi-million-dollar deals for Xerox technology and for our diverse
outsourcing services. We run our operation with a disciplined approach to cost management. This becomes increasingly
more important as we are ramping new services contracts, contracts that require upfront investments in time and
resources and therefore impact our gross margins. It's a shift in how we manage our business model.
We are driving efficiencies across the enterprise that result in improved operating margins, all while profitably growing
our business and generating cash. Like any business, we'll always have headwinds that need to be offset and tailwinds
that give us added benefits, but when it nets out, we are delivering steady top-line growth, solid bottom-line results, and
delivering shareholder value through dividends and share repurchase. It is this across-the-board progress that I am
confident will continue.

For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.32 to $0.35 per share. This will bring our full-year
adjusted EPS of $108 to $111, a year-over-year increase of 15% to 18%.
Thank you again for joining us today. Now let's open it up to your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Hi. Thank you. My first question is with regard to geographic trends. Canon noted pressure
in Europe. Lexmark kind of talked about pressure all over. Can you talk just a little bit about what you're hearing from
your customers, both in terms of demand for products on technology and services, and then also printing volumes? Just
in general, what are you hearing?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, so from a demand perspective, geographically, we continue to see the strongest
demand in our developing markets' economies. Russia, the Eurasian region, some of the Latin and Central American
countries are the strongest. I think the next grouping would be – or the next group of countries – or the next country
would be the United States. It's a little bit stronger than Europe.
It's not as strong as DMO. And we haven't seen – we're seeing a overhang in the U.S. that is dampening go-forward
expectations from our clients, particularly from the government, but so far this year we've been able to manage very
well in that environment. And then in Europe I think it's a little bit weaker than in U.S., so it's like a waterfall – DMO,
developing markets the strongest, United States kind of wallowing around in the middle, and Europe is definitely
seeing a fall over it.
On a go-forward basis – I think it's important for me to talk about that as well. On a go-forward basis, we do see
continued headwinds from a macro environment in the U.S. and in Europe. There's no doubt about it. The
conversations are all muted with our customers across the board, and so we don't expect that this economic
environment will improve in the fourth quarter very much. As far as page trends go, we see, as Luca discussed,
continued growth in color and continued softness, particularly, in the high-end black and white printing segment.
Some of the growth that we saw in the third quarter was driven by the fact that we had a pretty large backlog from the
second quarter, and we'll see a little bit of that continue into the fourth quarter, but by the end of this quarter, we expect
all of the backlog to be totally cleared up and we'll be back to normal, which I think is about flat on technology
revenues for the fourth quarter. Did I answer all your questions Shannon?
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Well, not all of them yet, but yes, I think you answered that one. Thank you. Luca, can you
talk a little bit about the biggest drivers of your confidence in cash flow during fourth quarter? Because, clearly, it's an
extremely large cash flow quarter, so just if you can walk through some of the puts and takes we should keep in mind.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Q4 seasonally is our strongest quarter. We tend to deliver stronger earnings than the rest of the
year. Shannon, when you look back at our historical performance during Q4, you see, for example, that in Q4 of 2010
we delivered the same level of operating cash flow that would be required to get to our range, so we've done that in the
past. Clearly, working capital needs to be a positive during Q4. It's been a positive historically. And so we know that it
is the biggest quarter, and we've got the plans in place to get there. And of course we're also trying to position the
company for growth, which is very important, and requires some investments during the course of the year. We
recognize that.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. And then I guess my final question is, we've heard from a few companies about
potential impact from the Thailand flooding, so can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that and if
there's any impact we should worry about?

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, first of all, our hearts go out to the people in Thailand, and anything that we can do to
help, we will do as a company. Particularly, if we have suppliers or any clients or customers out there, we will help
them. This couldn't be a worse year for natural disasters. I think we've had it all. We expect that we will have no impact
from the natural disaster in Thailand from a direct Xerox supply perspective. We've already checked with our supply
chain, and we've gotten very positive feedback back. It turns out that we, fortunately, don't source hard disk drives from
that region, and that this happens to be something that fell on a positive side for us this time, not on a negative side.
We do expect, though – it is possible that there would be some impact from equity income from Japan. We don't know
that for sure. We still have to wait until this clears up a little bit, and we'll see that as it goes forward. But for Xerox
corporation, supply, supply to our customers, et cetera, we expect no impact at all.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: You're welcome.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Hey, thanks a lot. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the yen; it just keeps
strengthening on you. And have you been able to do any renegotiating with Fuji Xerox to maybe improve the baseline?
I know you have a 50/50 sharing agreement. Could you talk about maybe how you hedge it, and then how that factors
into gross margin guidance, not only for the fourth quarter but maybe also next year? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah. So clearly, Ben, the strengthening yen is a headwind for us. I would say, at today's rate, for
the full year, we would be looking at about 0.2% in terms of the impact on margins for the company, so it's not
particularly material. As you know, we...
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: But that's for next year? That year-over-year would be...?
<A - Luca Maestri>: No, no. This is for 2011.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay.
<A - Luca Maestri>: It is the year-on-year impact for 2011 versus 2010. We do hedge out 12 months, and therefore,
any impact from currency movements get delayed a bit. And so, obviously, in general, a negative yen is – a strong yen
is not a positive for us, as you well know. We manage it actively through the hedging program. We, of course – as you
said, we've got a currency sharing agreement with our partner, Fuji Xerox.
And as we develop partner programs, in general, of course you know we try to set targets taking into account a yen that
is stronger than it was in the past, and so we need to continue all our efforts in terms of being very competitive on cost,
and those are the ways we manage, together with Fuji Xerox. So far, I would say that when you look at our technology
margins for the year, I think it's pretty commendable that they've held up the way they have in spite of the continuing
appreciation of the yen.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Do you have any idea what's the hit in the fourth quarter and next year? Similar?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Q4 2012?
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: 2011.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah, Q4 is going to be, again, about 0.2%. It's low double-digits.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. Then, earlier today, Canon lowered guidance for their laser printer shipments
due to an HP inventory adjustment. Obviously, you're aware of HP in the news and whatnot. It was laser-printer
related, but given they're a big player in MPS, there's a lot of overlap with you guys. Canon's copier numbers were
actually fine. So I was just wondering if you're seeing any change in the competitive environment that's HP-related and

that's helping your business or impacting your business, and trying to put together what they said this morning.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, what we're seeing – HP, and then I'll just broaden it to other competitors as well. As
you know, HP the company is having lots of disruption, but what we're seeing from HP, our segment, is a continued
strong competitor. We haven't seen a lot of hiccups or back-peddling in the market from HP. They continue to be a
strong competitor. Where we succeed, and HP has maybe not been succeeding as much, is in two segments. One is our
MPS, or our managed print services offering, attacks HP's strengths straight on. And more and more customers – as
you can see from our document outsourcing strength this year, 12% year-over-year – this quarter, 12% growth in MPS
or print services. Our managed print services offerings are taking off, and it actually works to consolidate where HP's
strength is, which is in single-function printers.
The other place that we're very strong and continue be strong is in the very high-end production printing segment;
iGen4 and our color press technology continues to do well there. So while we haven't seen a marked decline in HP's
performance, we've seen a marked increase and improvement in our performance, and that's where I think, net-net,
we're winning the war and winning the battle.
In addition to that, as we go to clients, when we speak to them, we speak to them about the entire offer, about BPO,
ITO, document outsourcing, and our technology base, and that conversation, as signaled by our signing strength and
our backlog strength, is one that is absolutely on fire. It's a conversation that customers want to hear, so when we start
talking to them about BPO and ITO, what we end up with, if we don't get BPO and ITO, we actually get document
outsourcing or technology or all three. So I think that the combination of the value proposition that we have and our
strength in the areas that happen to be places that HP is not very strong, may be having an effect on them.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: All right. Last thing to sneak in is, on the cash question, I was surprised, Luca, you
didn't mention that a bunch of big contracts are moving from investment to revenue mode, like the California Medicaid,
as cash drivers for the fourth quarter. Is that a big driver, or is it not that material?
<A - Luca Maestri>: It is significant. I said, Ben, that we are positioning the company for growth, and that's what
happens, right? You are starting up big contracts, and of course the ASM upfront cash requirements, but that's included
in our numbers, right? We need to manage them. They've been a year-on-year negative for the first three quarters of the
year, but they're included in our numbers.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And California Medicaid, fortunately, we can say pretty fervently, is now starting to revenue.
We are actually operating. It took a while, but we're operating California Medicaid as a real contract now. We generate
revenue from it, et cetera, et cetera. So fourth quarter, tail – the last two months of the fourth quarter and all of 2012,
we'll see the benefit of revenue and then the flow off of improved earnings from California Medicaid.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay, thank you. Ursula, in your prepared comments, you made a reference to the
continued challenges on the government side of the services business, and given that that continues to be an area of a
lot of questions, I was hoping you could give some detail on government BPO signings year-to-date and what the
pipeline looks like there, and just generally what you're seeing in terms of those particular customers' appetite or
willingness to go forward with contracts.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, so let me – I start this always, when I get a question about the government, with the
statement that one of the things that I realized when we bought ACS and we got them into our company was how

important it is and was for ACS to have strength in the government. A large amount of the revenue in BPO and ITO in
the world is generated from governments, and so our strength there is a positive that I want never to be kind of
overshadowed by some of the short-term issues. So, overall, we're really pleased with our position in the government.
What we are seeing, though, is we are seeing, very similar to what we saw in the second quarter, with a little bit more
emphasis on it, it takes a longer time to get a contract negotiated, and after it's negotiated, actually signed, and that
longer time is not because of lack of desire for the services. Particularly in the United States, some of the localities are
still trying to figure out what their budgets are and are going to be and what authority they have to make big go-forward
commitments.
Once they've figured it out, then they sign. One of those that's currently active for us is in New York State Medicaid,
for example. It's one that's in competition, and everybody has done their bidding, and we're just waiting for the State of
New York to decide what to do once they figure out what they can do and what they have to do.
So what we're seeing is we're seeing longer times, and then we're also seeing lower volumes for some of the services
we provide. The most notable there is in unemployment, and this comes and it goes, so we have a baseline unemployed
number of people, and depends on what the government does to either extend or not extend that unemployment, the
volumes go up or go down. So those are the places.
We also have some contracts that naturally end, that we did the service for them and now it's over. They were very
high-return contracts for us, very profitable contracts, and as they roll off, we have not only the revenue impact; we
have the profitability impact. And you couple that with some really amazing startups for some very big contracts –
California Medicaid is one, but there are others, as well, that are starting up – that cause it to be – overall, the
government segment to be lower performance this quarter than a year ago and lower performance this quarter than last
quarter than what we would expect.
But on a go-forward basis, government is a strong segment for us to be in, and what we have to do is continue to
manage winning big contracts and manage the roll-off of contracts that naturally end, and obviously manage our losses
so we don't lose any that don't naturally end. It's a long answer to your question, but I hope it – volumes are lower,
contract signing is longer, and a little bit more complicated, and that's it.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. If I could ask a follow-up, Ursula, you...
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Of course you can.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: You mentioned the worse performance than one year ago in the government BPO
business. Is that a revenue statement or a contract-signing statement or a pipeline statement, or all of the above?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: It's a revenue statement. It's not a contract-signing statement, but it's a revenue statement for
sure, and it's down about 1% year-over-year.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Actually, bookings in government in Q3 were significantly higher.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, so signing's good. Revenue – for roll-offs and for other – roll-offs, cancellations are
down. Particularly, in Georgia and Texas are where we had two big hits. And the fourth quarter, based on California
Medicaid and other just natural flows from our smaller contracts will be higher. Revenue will be higher – will be better
for our government sector in the fourth quarter, and we can just see that before – just revenue in California is going to
help that.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. And then just one final quick one – in terms of volume sensitivity, are we talking
about sort of low-single-digit numbers here in terms of the impact on revenue growth rates based on things like
changing unemployment claims, I would suspect?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes, absolutely. Yeah, so it's a single-digit impact on us, low-single-digit impact for us, but
from a revenue perspective, yes.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a solid quarter. A couple questions, if I could.
I guess the first is going back to hardware. Ursula, I just want to make sure that I understand what the message is. You
guys had pretty solid hardware results this quarter, fueled somewhat by backlog, but your guidance for the December
quarter is solid as well, and it sounds like you're saying you're through the backlog. You're also saying that the macro
environment is having some impact to demand. So is the message that, despite a bit softer macro environment, you're
still delivering to what your hardware expectations were for the second half of the year? And then I have a follow up.
Thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, the answer is yes, so if you look year-to-date, take out all of the ups and the downs,
we're about flat revenue on a year-over-year basis through quarter 3. And that's based on the macro environment and
based on just the trends in this business. I think we are on track to be where I would expect to be. Quarter 4, we expect
to be essentially flat total revenue for the technology segment. And one of the things that Luca pointed out when he
reported is you'd look at technology segment in two different buckets.
One is just the equipment hardware that we report in technology, and the other one is the total hardware that we report
– that we sell, some of which is wrapped around – or service is wrapped around it. And where we see the big pickup in
quarter 4 is in our document outsourcing business and the technology associated with that, which comes into our P&L a
little bit differently. As you know, it doesn't come in as equipment sale revenue. It comes in as annuity stream.
Total-total, if you look at the activity numbers that we show, we see strength in mid-range color, we see strength in
high-end color, and we see strength in regional performance in the total revenue for technology that we sell; so, net-net,
yes, things are looking not terribly. They're not looking terribly. They're actually looking pretty good.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: On a competitive basis, we're gaining share across the board on a competitive basis as well.
Equipment revenue share, we're number one just about everywhere we compete.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: And is it really the MPS where you think you're driving share gains?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, there's MPS, for sure; mid-range and very high-end. Those three segments are the
places that – very high-end, which has nothing do with MPS. It has to do with strength of portfolio, iGen, Color Press.
And then later on this year and into 2012, we will have the CIPress device fully rolled out. And then in the mid-range,
some of it is cleaning up backlog, but we just have a very strong portfolio in the mid-range in color, so those two
places, and then wrapping around in our lower-end product portfolio, both in single-function printers and in low-end
MSPs, wrapping that around with our services helps us there as well.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Thanks, and then...
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So this is one case that the strategy actually is working as we wanted it to work.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Understood, thanks. And I guess just to follow up on services, the revenue trends have been –
they're pretty solid the last couple quarters, and the bookings trends certainly saw nice improvement this quarter. The
mix has been a little softer last quarter and this quarter. And I guess you walked through some of the dynamics in the
government business. Can you talk about some of the other mix dynamics that have been a little softer in the other parts
of the businesses? And I guess I'm just wondering what the gross margin implications could be over the next few
quarters, and how long it could take to work through some of those mix dynamics. Thanks.

<A - Luca Maestri>: So on the mix of services, you know we've got a very, very diversified portfolio, many different
lines of business that have different characteristics in terms of growth rates and in terms of profitability. Some of them
– take customer care, for example, is a business that is doing extremely well for us. It was affected a bit by volumes
during the third quarter. It very much depends on the level of economic activity for our customers then translating to
volumes in our call centers.
So there was some of that, but I would say the primary impact on our gross margin dynamics right now comes from
government, both in services and healthcare. Services, Ursula talked about. In healthcare, we're making very significant
investments that once we complete those investments, ramp up those contracts – example is California, but we've got
many other cases – we're going to have a platform for these type of contracts that is going to be really unmatched in the
industry and is going to put us at a very, very strong competitive position.
So I think, overall, Ananda, we continue to see some level of gross margin pressure in services purely from the mix and
from the fact that we're making investments for growth, and so that will continue in the near term. But we think that
when we look at the long term and where we want to take the company, the fact that we want to accelerate our revenue
growth rates, I think we're making the right decisions.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And with that, if I could just add a point, the margin mix, therefore, that we see on a
go-forward basis is towards the lower end of the range, definitely for quarter 4, and we'll update in January our 2012
numbers. But what we can see, based on startups, based on volumes, et cetera, that we'll be in a gross margin range
that's at the lower end of our range, tending towards where we are right now.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: 33% to 35% range?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, 32-ish-percent range, 32% to 35% range, yes.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Okay, got it. And then one last one on services, if I could, document outsourcing obviously
had good momentum the last two quarters; seems like, at least anecdotally, you guys are starting to get a little bit more
excited about that. And you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks that you're seeing some pretty good increase
in momentum there. Can you give us some sense of how big of a percent of revenue that could ultimately become? I
think it's around 16% today. Can it become a 20%-of-revenue sort of segment over time, or is that shooting too high?
Thanks.
<A - Luca Maestri>: So right now I think you've done the math right; 16% for the company, 33% for our services
business. We think that it's a segment within services that can grow above average, and so you would expect it to trend
up a bit in terms of its relative importance for the company.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Thank you very much.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And, Ananda, one last point, if I can – I have a lot of last points today. One of the things
about document outsourcing, the benefit that we're seeing from the services strategy that we have, the overall services
strategy that we have, is that document outsourcing, while it's doing very well, is doing very well because it's a part of a
set of offers that actually excites customers more. So we're getting a drag-along of document outsourcing with the fact
that we have BPO and ITO as well.
And by the way, that's something that we talked about, and I think this quarter and a little bit of last quarter was the
first times that we started to see that improvement, that synergy of where document outsourcing BPO and ITO, we'll
engage a client and we'll win one of the three of these lines, to start with, and then we'll expand. We'll penetrate with
one of those lines, and then we'll expand. Document outsourcing has benefited in the last quarters from that strategy.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes, thank you. Next question?

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. I had a couple also. Ursula, I wanted to start with you and go back to the
strategy question. In technology, the growth on a constant-currency basis was about negative 1%, with some help on
backlog burn, so maybe it was negative 2%, but it was nevertheless a negative number. Your services business is doing
nicely. It grew about 5%. At the same time, in some parts of services, like ITO, you're very sub-scale, and in
geographic basis you're sub-scale in other areas, such as Europe.
My question is, why deploy anything but the minimum amount necessary for the technology side of the business? And
why not deploy the incremental capital towards the services business? Ad in the past comments, you've talked about –
it sounds like you want to try to do everything, but I'm not sure why you're devoting incremental capital to the
technology business. And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I think that we are devoting the appropriate capital to the technology business. We
have places in the technology business that we are clearly privileged and where that drives incremental profitability and
cash. That is focused around color and around managed print services, tightly linked to our technology business. So
we're not – and as I think I've said in many calls before, we are deploying, on a percentage basis, and shifting
significantly our investments towards services, towards document outsourcing and towards BPO. So the reason why
we'd invest any money is because there is money to be made in that segment of the business, and that's where we are.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Technology is a competitive space. It's a place where we generate a lot of cash, and so we need
to continue to be competitive, so there is a certain amount of capital that we allocate to technology. But when we look
at all the activities that we have, acquisitions, we favor services over technology. CapEx, most of our CapEx is actually
linked to services contracts. Working capital primarily is we're deploying working capital to the services contracts. So
when you look at all the different lines – and now we're actually starting to deploy R&D...
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes.
<A - Luca Maestri>: ...towards services.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Luca Maestri>: We've got an R&D center in Europe that is totally dedicated to our services business. So more
and more we're shifting every aspect of the company towards the opportunity where growth is. And you mentioned
Europe. Europe is a place where, of course, we will deploy capital because we want to grow services in Europe. It is a
huge opportunity for the company. So I think, overall, I think we agree with you, and I think we are following up with
our actions.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: I guess also I wanted to include ITO. It seems like, as we look at the BPO market,
increasingly, technology is a critical element of BPO. So would your investments include trying to stimulate more
growth in ITO, which has had a couple quarters of flat growth?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah, definitely, definitely. And ITO is important for us as a standalone line of business, and
also because it provides us with capabilities that support our BPO and document outsourcing businesses, right? So we
definitely want to make the right investments there.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Let me just ask my follow-up question. On the last, the June quarter conference call –
or I guess it was July quarter conference call, the target for cash flow from operations was $2.0 billion to $2.3 billion. I
think Ursula said, on the prepared remarks, it was greater than $2 billion. I just wanted to confirm, what are the
cash-flow targets for the year?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I think that Luca said, very clearly, $2 billion to $2.3 billion.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, so it is the same cash flow targets?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: It's the same thing, yeah, but [ph] he'll be worried (51:36) and make sure that they all match.
No, we didn't intend to say anything differently there. It's $2 billion to $2.3 billion.

Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Great. Thank you very much. Ursula, can you share with us some color on what renewal
rates were in the services business during the quarter, and how that compares to what you saw a year ago? And maybe
if you could just break it down for us by service type, that would be very helpful as well. And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So renewal rates were at 85%. They're back to our normal working rate. We had a low
renewal rate last quarter, primarily driven by a drop in ITO renewals. We're back to normal. We work to make sure that
we're back to normal; it wasn't an accident that we got back to normal. And so we will continue to be – my prediction,
based on how we're going to manage this, is to be in that 85%-plus percent renewal rate next quarter and going into the
future. What was the second part of your question? I'm sorry.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: I was just wondering if you could break it down by service type, but I think your comment
on ITO could have answered that as well.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, ITO has recovered back to a good rate. It's generally lower than BPO and document
outsourcing, but it's really high. It's in the higher 70% range, so we're back to normal.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Okay, great. And then, Luca, a follow-up for you – I didn't see it in the slides, but how
should we think about your comfort level just with the outlook for 6% to 8% revenue growth and $2.6 billion to $2.9
billion of cash flow from operations for next year?
<A - Luca Maestri>: So, Deepak, we provide guidance, update guidance for 2012 during Q4 earnings. When you
think about revenue, clearly, we got some revenue tailwinds that should improve our growth in 2012. We talked about
California a lot, about the fact that our signings are strong that we have, right? We also need to monitor the macro
environment because that has had its bumps recently.
Cash, again, we will have strong cash next year because we expect earnings to be higher. At the same time, clearly,
pensions will be become an issue for us, and for any company that has got legacy plans. You know the interest rate
environment drives lower discount rates. That is obviously a negative for companies that have legacy-defined benefit
plans. I don't want to get too much into pensions, but pensions will be a headwind versus what we were thinking
previously. So we're putting together our plans. We will provide you with the updated guidance in January for 2012.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you. Next question?

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Great, thanks. You've all been pretty clear on how we should think about volumes and the overall
pace of business going into the fourth quarter in light of the macro uncertainty around right now, but can you comment
on how we should think about competitive pricing, particularly within the technology business for the fourth quarter
and potentially into 2012? There are obviously some signs of incremental price aggression in certain areas of the
imaging market, and I'm wondering if you're seeing any of this flow into your core businesses, or potentially flow into
your core businesses if conditions remain volatile?

Page 14 of 16
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We haven't seen a significant change in pricing trends from the previous quarters, 5% to 10%
on our technology business, and we expect that that will be the same in the fourth quarter. By the way, all large
contracts are competed for outside of that range that I just talked about, but the balance is that 5% to 10%. On our
services business, we see – the good news about our services business, any of the three lines, is that we sign up front
and we sign, for the life of the contract, pricing with pre-defined escalators or de-escalators in those contracts.
Occasionally, we get customers who are stressed who want price concessions, and we negotiate with those customers
openly and very willingly, and we generally give a price concession with something in return, so we're comfortable
with that as well. So no significant change to what we are seeing. I think everyone is dealing with the same
environment that we are, so while it may seem logical that you would run down on price to get business, everybody's
dealing with cost challenges that they have to manage, and so they're staying fairly logical in their pricing, which is
good. And we are as well, obviously.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then I guess a final question, just sort of a basic
question on thinking about these new contracts in the services business – I know you've discussed it before, but how
should we think about the lifecycles of some of these new contracts coming on? Because, clearly, at some point I would
imagine that you're going have this tilt towards these new contracts all shifting into profitability mode. How should we
think about that timeline? Should we assume that this is really a fairly near-term phenomenon, and we start to see
potential margin improvements and revenue uplift as well as we get deeper into 2012, or is this something that's really
just going to be a sustained phenomenon because you're pushing for growth, I'd imagine, over the longer term?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah, the typical – in fact, the typical profitability profile of these contracts is fairly similar,
right? You've got the upfront investments, and then margin tends to improve towards the end of the contract. So in an
environment where we are actually trying to promote some growth, you will see some kind of sustained margin
pressure because the amount of new contracts that you sign is higher than your base, right?
So you continue to require some level of gross margin dilution and some level of working capital investment. So I
would say, for the near term for sure, I think we should be looking for the company for a gross margin range of 32% to
34% because of these dynamics in the services business. But, again, it is in the context of trying to accelerate our
revenue growth rates from the historic numbers to something that is healthier.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: It's in the environment of expanding operating margins, as well, so we leverage our SG&A
and our R&D investments across a big event base and actually do some shifting to make sure that we can fuel that
growth while continuing to expand operating margins. And the big, big, big contracts are the ones that we're talking
about here. It's California Medicaid, it's some of the pharmaceutical contracts that we are signing and the telecom
contracts that are really large and long-standing. The good news about them is that they're long standing, and the
second piece of good news is that they're really large. And so these are really good business deals for us. We
investigate them very clearly to make sure that we can afford them way before we sign them, that we can operate them
before we sign them, et cetera, et cetera.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you. Next question, please?

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, if I could. One, Ursula, can you weigh in a
little more on how we should think about the technology part of the business in terms of what the installs this past
quarter imply for annuity growth next year? Because it does seem like it was kind of mixed in terms of the
year-over-year install activity.

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I think that the install activity will continue to stabilize and then strengthen our annuity
revenue on a go-forward basis. This is the install in both the technology segment of the business and the services
segment of the business. We're installing higher-end devices, mid-range color and production color devices, really well,
so that'll help. We had some weakness in this quarter in the entry segment, and that's generally – you know the entry
segment is generally lower everything – lower prices, lower post-sale revenue.
We like them if we can get them, but we had lower activity this quarter. But, overall, our install activity will drive more
pages, stabilizing pages in color for sure, drives an average price per page up. It was up this quarter; it was up last
quarter on a total company. So the install activity bodes well for the future, very well for the future.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you. And then, Luca, I want to get a sense here in terms of – kind of build on some
of the previous questions around cash flow. When do we get a sense that all of the new signings on the services side
over the past 12 months or so – when do we get a sense in terms of when the cash flow will exceed the initial cash
outlays? How many more quarters does Xerox have to make these cash outlays to really build out the infrastructure
before you start generating positive cash return?
<A - Luca Maestri>: I think, first of all, we will continue to sign new contracts, so we're going to continue to have that
issue that every time we want to start up a new significant contract that requires some infrastructure investment in, we
will have that. I think, in general, what we're seeing is that some of these things drives some working capital
requirements that were maybe higher than we were anticipating. I would say that, over time, as we put some of these
contracts into full mode, take California, they will become a positive versus the negative that they've been this year.
But it very much will depend on future signings and what the profile of those signings is going to be.
Over the years, I think it's important to think about working capital as being fairly neutral, as opposed to having had a
couple of years in the past where working capital was a significant source of cash. And this is normal for a company
that wants to grow a bit faster than we were growing in the past. And so probably that's the way you need to think about
it, maybe working capital as a wash and no longer a source of funds.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Last question, please?
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you. Last question?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thanks. I had a clarification and a follow-up. First, did you lower your near-term expectations
for gross margins by about 1 percentage point? And if so, does that apply to next year as well?
<A - Luca Maestri>: So we are saying that in the near term, we think it's going be more like 32% to 34%. We had out
a range of 33% to 35%, so within that range. It's clearly a reduction, again, driven very much by the fact that services
are growing, and therefore there is a dilution of gross margin that comes from that and some of these new contracts, as
we said before. Again, getting into 2012 guidance, we will give you a full update in January.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: My question relates just to reconciling everything we've heard so far on the call into that next
year's outlook. Constant-currency revenue growth is tracking 1%. You expect that to accelerate. However, guidance
implies something significantly faster. Meanwhile, you have this ongoing mix shift on the gross profit line. I guess my
bottom-line question is, do you believe you need to restructure and cut costs in order to meet 2012 expectations? And if
so, are you willing to do that?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So the answer – let me start and then Luca can add. We're being very careful to continually
say one answer to a question that's been asked a lot of times, and that's, what is our guidance for 2012. We've been very
careful to say that we were going to update our guidance in the fourth quarter of this year, the January report of that.
Company Name: Xerox

The reason why is because we actually see tailwinds and headwinds, and we want to get a better sense of how the
fourth quarter will come out, and we'll have then a better read of 2012 obviously.
There are certain things that we know. One is that we are growing our services business broader, better, faster – I don't
know how to put it – than we thought we would. We are winning contracts, larger contracts. Those contracts – by the
way, good contracts – those contracts require that we invest to start up. The investment is in CapEx, as Luca talked
about. And with more services contracts and with more mix towards services, our gross margin will come down – or is
lower.
So we see our gross margin 32% to 34% for the fourth quarter. I would suspect that we'll see it that way for 2012 as
well, but we'll update you on that when we report the fourth quarter in January. We'll be able to give you a better, a
more complete picture. The rest of the lines we really haven't really opined about at all for 2012.
<A - Luca Maestri>: But to your question on costs, Chris, absolutely, we're working on costs every day of the year.
We work on costs on the product cost side. We work on costs on the fixed cost side of the business. Restructuring is a
normal course of business. We're always looking for efficiencies, and we're going to take the actions that are needed. If
we see that we can run our operations more efficiently than we do today, absolutely we will do it.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thank you very much.
Ursula M. Burns
Thank you very much. Thanks for all of your time and for your interest, and have a good day.
