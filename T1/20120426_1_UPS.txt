MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Steven and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been
placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer
period. Please note we will take only one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call.
Thank you for your cooperation. It is now our pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS
Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.
Andy Dolny
Good morning. Today, I am joined by Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's
results for the quarter and future expectations.
Before they begin I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are
forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the

company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2011
Form 10-K report. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial
measure are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules are also available
on the UPS Investor Relations website in the Financial section.
In March, UPS announced it reached an agreement to acquire TNT Express. Although we expect the transaction to
close before the end of the year, any guidance that we provide will not include the results of TNT operations nor any
synergies or integration expense associated with the acquisition.
As always, today's call is being webcast and is also available on the UPS Investor Relations website. As a reminder, our
goal is to allow as many as possible to participate on the call. As a result, each person will be allowed one question and
then required to get back in the queue for a follow-up. I thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Now let me turn it over to Scott.
D. Scott Davis
Thanks, Andy, good morning, everyone. 2012 is off to a good start for a couple of reasons. First, we announced our
intention to acquire TNT Express, an investment that will contribute to our growth for many years to come. Secondly,
looking more near-term, first quarter results built upon momentum from last year. We continued to see strong demand
in the UPS products and services especially in the U.S. and Europe. Both the U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain &
Freight segments delivered double-digit profit growth in the quarter.
Back in January, we discussed that expectations for the U.S. economy were improving especially compared to the rest
of the world. During the quarter, the most positive news has come from the U.S. where indications of economic
rebound are evident. Retail sales have grown faster than expected and the employment environment has improved. On
the other hand, economies in other parts of the world continue to face challenges. Europe struggles under austerity
measures and slowing growth persists out of Asia. Despite this, we continue to see our export volume in both Europe
and intra-Asia perform well.
UPS is executing on its strategy of investing to grow with the announcement of two acquisitions. First in February, we
acquired the European consumer delivery company Kiala. Its retail delivery network and the unique technology will
benefit UPS as we continue to look for ways to serve the growing B2C market, especially outside the U.S.
As you know last month, UPS announced an offer to acquire TNT Express. While we have not closed on the
transaction, we have made initial contact with the regulators. UPS remains confident it will receive all required
approvals. The acquisition of TNT will diversify our global revenue increasing our portfolio of solutions and expanding
our geographic footprint. We are excited about the prospects of adding such a strong and respected company to the
UPS family.
During the quarter, UPS received accolades from a number of organizations for our reputation, ethics, and brand. One
of the more widely recognized honors we received was the number one ranking by Fortune Magazine as our industry's
most admired company. This is the twenty-seventh time UPS has received this recognition in the 31 years the award
has been given.
Also during the quarter, UPS My Choice, the B2C solution we introduced in October, surpassed one million
subscribers. UPS has received a positive response from customers as they enjoy unprecedented levels of visibility and
control over their deliveries.
Before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to congratulate the almost 6,000 members of the UPS Circle of Honor, individuals
who have achieved 25 years or more of accident free driving. In fact this year, we recognized our first driver to surpass
the 50-year milestone. That's truly amazing. This is just one example of how these drivers and the rest of approximately
400,000 UPSians around the world contribute to our company's success. As you can see, 2012 is off to a good start.

UPS continues to be a global leader investing for growth, developing innovative solutions, and continuing to build on
our corporate legacy.
With that, let me turn it over to Kurt to review results for the quarter.
Kurt P. Kuehn
Well thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Yes, we are off to a good start. Daily package volume for the quarter
was up a strong 4.3% as online shipping continued the rapid growth seen last quarter. Boosted by strong results from
the U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain & Freight segments, earnings per share grew 10%. Let's take a look at the
segments.
Operating profit for the U.S. Domestic segment jumped 13% on revenue growth of 6.1%. Operating margin expanded
by 70 basis points to the highest first quarter margin for this segment since 2008. Our Package volume increased 4.5%.
Deferred products were up 10% as online retailers clearly recognized the value of using our network to expedite the
movement of goods to their customers. Our Next Day Air volume increased 5% with Next Day Package up 6.5%, and
some gains in letter volume, something frankly we've not seen in many quarters. Our Next Day Saver product was the
primary source of growth as residential deliveries for large e-commerce shippers continued to expand. Ground
shipments rose 4% with approximately half of the growth resulting from a 30% increase in light weight products. These
solutions are proving to be very popular with our customers and are creating connectivity to other UPS products.
As we saw in the fourth quarter, the strong demand for Saver and light weight products like SurePost impacted yield
growth. Base pricing was up about 2.5% to 3%, but it was somewhat offset by changes in product and customer mix
that I just discussed. The impact on yields will begin to moderate as we ramp the build out of our SurePost launch. This
will become most evident by the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, while these trends negatively impact yield, they do have
a positive impact on our cost to serve and on our capital consumption.
Direct labor hours, block hours, and miles driven all increased at a rate significantly less than the 4.5% volume growth.
Operating leverage was also apparent in the quarter as we continue to improve efficiency, benefiting from productivity
gains, greater economies of scale and a mild winter.
Now turning to the International segment, although we faced some challenges primarily due to shipping trade patterns,
our International export volume continues to perform well, up 5.4%. Average daily volume comparisons did benefit by
about 1% due to year-over-year differences in local operating base.
Looking at the regions, exports increased at a mid-single digit pace for both Europe and the Americas. However, our
long higher yielding lanes out of Asia were relatively flat. We also saw European shippers increasing their reliance on
our standard products. International yield growth was flat as the benefits from the fuel surcharge and base rate increases
were offset by the impact of shorter trade lanes, changes in product mix and the impact of currency. On a currency
neutral basis, yield was up 2%. The International segment operating profit came in at $408 million. Currency
translation and rising fuel costs accounted for over a third of the $45 million decline, although our operating margin
13.8% remains industry leading.
Moving on to Supply Chain & Freight; operating profits increased substantially, up 19% with forwarding and
distribution leading the way. The segment did receive a $9 million benefit from the sale of a surplus facility. Revenue
for the forwarding business declined due to lower tonnage and yields as excess capacity remained in the market.
However, operating profit and margin improved due to growth in customized solutions and brokerage services in
addition to improved productivity. The distribution business saw profit expansion in an environment of increased
investment in healthcare capabilities. UPS expects to add five new healthcare compliant facilities this year around the
world, bringing our total to 38 dedicated facilities. In what is typically the most challenging quarter for the industry, our
UPS Freight unit broke even. Tonnage declines were offset by higher revenue per hundredweight and improved
productivity.

Looking now at cash and our balance sheet; UPS generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow during the period. Capital
expenditures were $417 million including the delivery of three additional 767s, bringing our total fleet count to 226
aircrafts. In the quarter, the company repurchased more than 7 million shares for approximately $550 million, less than
expected as internal guidelines caused us to restrict purchases during the TNT acquisition negotiations.
As UPS prepares to close on this transaction, we are reviewing multiple alternatives for financing. Although our plans
are not yet finalized, we remain committed to the preservation of a strong balance sheet and our dividend approach.
And under any scenario, we do expect significant share repurchases in 2012 and beyond. We are evaluating our options
and will update you on our decision.
Regarding guidance, UPS is right where we expect it to be at the end of the first quarter so our full year guidance
remains unchanged. We anticipate 2012 diluted earnings per share of between $4.75 and $5.0, which represents a 9% to
15% increase over 2011. I do, however, want to take a couple of minutes to provide more insight into the remaining
quarters.
On a consolidated basis, second quarter earnings per share is anticipated to grow at a similar pace to the first quarter.
Third quarter earnings per share growth should be a bit lower due to one less operating day compared to last year. And
we expect fourth quarter earnings to grow at the fastest pace. This is due to the operating leverage generated by peak
season volume growth and our proven ability to efficiently processed e-commerce shipments.
Our guidance for the U.S. Domestic segment remains consistent with what we told you back in January. For the full
year, we expect to generate high single digit operating profit growth. Although our expectations are for 2% to 3% base
pricing, yield growth will be muted by changes in product and customer mix. And we do anticipate average volume
growth of 3.5% to 4% with air growing faster than ground.
Turning now to International, for the second quarter we expect revenue trends to be similar to the first. Local day
comparisons will negatively impact reported daily volume growth, a reversal of what we saw in the first quarter.
Although we expect operating profit to improve compared to the first quarter, it will be relatively flat to last year.
Beyond the second quarter, year-over-year comparisons should improve. For the second half of 2012, we expect
operating profit growth in the mid teens on high single digit revenue improvement.
Regarding Supply Chain & Freight, we expect second quarter revenue growth to be similar to the first quarter and
operating margin to be relatively flat compared to last year. Looking at the second half of 2012, we anticipate operating
profit growth of mid to high teens on high single digit revenue growth.
So all in all, we're off to a good start to what should be an exciting year for UPS. Although market dynamics continue
to change, UPS will benefit by adapting to them. Whether it's e-commerce growth, shipping trade patterns or
demographic changes, UPS has the capabilities to meet the challenges.
Thanks for listening this morning, and now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A

Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question I guess on the yield side. I just wanted to
tease out a little bit of the mix kind of impact as you go forward here and think about it. Is it 2Q and 3Q before 4Q that
you start to see a little bit of improvement where we could actually see that core yield growing in the 2% to 3% range?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. Certainly, the dramatic impact we've seen in our lightweight products has changed the
shape of what you guys see anyway. The – but the core underlying philosophy we have for pricing has not changed. On
an account-by-account basis, our disciplined approach is the same. Individual customers are all being reviewed and we
are executing our normal yield processes.

And if you look at Q4, really the trends, if you take out fuel surcharge changes, the trends are really pretty stable. The
only product really that sees any notable difference and changes are Next Day product where the substantial growth of
the Saver product, which is the afternoon delivery, does come in at a lower yield but generates substantially lower cost
and so profits are good. But to answer your question directly, yeah, what you really see is as we just really initiated the
SurePost the beginning of last year, it ramped up and really began to hit its stride in Q4.
So the year-over-year comps will moderate over the year and in Q4 you will see more of the core underlying base rates
that we talked about.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nate Brochmann>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Hey, Nate, how are you doing?
<Q - Nate Brochmann>: I'm doing great, thanks. Hey, I want to talk a little bit just on that question strategically. I
mean obviously you have the benefits of the integrated network and probably can ship pretty easily. But what are you
having to do with the network to kind of accommodate the new SurePost product? And how do you kind of adjust the
rest of the network to accommodate the faster pace of e-commerce that's obviously growing pretty rapidly?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, I think the thing that gives us some confidence that this is actually a positive trend for
UPS is that with the deep integration we've done of these products through every component of our business, it flows
through very smoothly. It utilizes existing assets and the incremental impact on the network is minimal. As we
mentioned, our hours, our miles and those things are just barely up for the quarter even though we showed some of the
strongest volume growth you've seen in some time. Another great proof point of that is I guess if you look at the
compensation and benefits, it's up 4% over year-on-year on 4% volume increases. So we are able to process this
volume very efficiently and the incremental impact on expense and capital is very minimal.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And Nate, I think things we're doing like the My Choice helps us get that delivery there the first
time. It is the consumer taking control of it, get the delivery the first time. Kiala, the acquisition in Europe, looks at
alternative delivery locations, the same thing. We're having more deliveries, helps density as opposed to one package to
one house. So a variety of things we're doing is helping that.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: So it is – it's an interesting time for us. We are seeing changing mix and at a rate that's more
frequent and more significant than you've normally seen. The core underlying momentum of the business remains very
steady and our approach to the market is unchanged. Layering on top of that then though is this rapid expansion of
products frankly that we haven't competed for in the past.
<Q - Nate Brochmann>: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes, good morning. I wanted to touch on I think the kind of broader topic you're talking
about here is B2C and the impact as well. If I look at the fourth quarter, you – I think you had a pretty big favorable
impact for B2C growth and you see that in the deferred air certainly and you had a very strong incremental margin. I
calculate just simply on the Domestic Package 52%. It seems that your mix effect is probably similar in first quarter
with a lot of growth in B2C, but the incremental margin shows up to 25% in Domestic Package. So I wonder if you can

just talk about what the differences in the two would be because I guess looking at margin performance that kind of
helps us figure out whether it's good business or how good the business is that you're bringing on? Thank you.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, Tom, it's a lot of moving parts to try to decompose incremental margin
quarter-to-quarter, I guess, and clearly we talked at some length about through the Q4 and the process there. Certainly
in Q4, these trends were even more extreme and as we mentioned during December, over half of our volume in
aggregate was B2C. We feel good about the Domestic margin expansion. We saw a full 70 basis point expansion and
we expect margin expansion to continue with these trends.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I think typically, Tom, you're going to see that kind of change from Q4 to Q1, certainly some
seasonality to that.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Would you think that that incremental margin would accelerate then through to 2012 or
it's more of a kind of fourth quarter is just different than you see in any other quarters?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: We're more focused on overall total margin improving than the calculation of incremental
margin quarter-to-quarter. We are confident that we're going to continue to increase the margins on the Domestic side
and work towards our long-term target.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, I think as we said in January, as far as our margin goals domestically, we feel extremely
confident, frankly a little ahead of target right now.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: I – good morning. Maybe I can come at that a little bit differently. Just it's typically the first
quarter is impacted by weather and you obviously didn't have that this year. Yet, the volumes in the first quarter were
the highest you've posted kind of relative to the rest of the year. So what occurs in the first quarter that pushes your
overall margins to be the lowest? Again, I just want to dig into the understanding of that incremental concept of why
we see this lower given the beneficial weather and environment?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, we did see significant improvements in margin. Q1 historically is a tougher year. You
still have winter weather and lower aggregated volumes typically versus the year spanned overall. I mean certainly
there are some headwinds in the quarter. Fuel was a bit of a headwind with the rising fuel and then the lag in the
surcharge. We do have some increased pension expenses, although we'll see those all year and that's in our guidance.
So we're pretty comfortable with a 70 basis point improvement. Q1 is not typical of the entire year and we expect to see
margin continuing to increase over that. On the flip side, clearly, the – we did – this was a pretty benign weather period
for Q1 and that helped offset some of the things that I just mentioned. So we're pretty pleased this – domestically, we're
getting back to margins that we'd not seen since early 2008 and we expect them to continue to grow.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Okay. So just to understand that, there is something in the first quarter that keeps it lower
than what you see in second and third quarter despite volume declines on a relative basis in 2Q and 3Q relative to what
you see in the first quarter?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Historically, yeah, Q1 is a challenging quarter for us in Domestic because of the weather as is
Q3 usually the most challenging quarter in International because of European holiday. So I think if you look, those are
pretty typical seasonal patterns.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Appreciate the insight. Thanks, sir.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I remind people one question please so we can get everybody on the call. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Good morning, gentlemen. I just wanted to talk about International and thinking
about it over the course of the next two or three years about the margin performance in particular and the relationship.
You had talked about changing product mix and shifting trade patterns as being one of the contributing factors to the
margin declines year-over-year. So, just trying to get a handle around how big of an impact there's going to be given
the changes in trade patterns expected going forward. And if we can talk about it irrespective of TNT and just think
about shorter length of haul or changing length of haul? And what impact that might have over the next two or three
years in terms of progress toward what you had talked about I guess late last year at the Analyst Day in terms of the
ability to get back to 18% plus margins in the segment?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Clearly, it is a moving target right now. And we have seen really for the last three quarters, I
guess, Asia being a bit of a challenge; it at least was more or less of a breakeven this quarter. So we did see an impact
where the long distance highest yield lanes, mainly Asia to Europe and to U.S. were relatively flat. Whereas, we saw
robust growth on the intra-Asia and the European volumes, most the exports which tend to stay in the continent. I think,
over the medium term, we adjust all those, then our combination of an air and ground network allows us to create
economic value out of both. Certainly, the capital demands of intra-European volume are much less than dedicated
high-value assets flying 6,000, 7,000 miles. Although it does create challenges as those transitions happen. So we feel
pretty good actually that we are in great shape to handle that, whether it's regional trade patterns across North America
or Europe, we can adapt and certainly be profitable. But it does have some impact on margins in the transition.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah. I think longer term, I think global trade is going to stay strong. I don't think you're going
to see long-term these trade flows change that dramatically. I think some of the Asia impact clearly has been weaker
consumer demand in Europe and last year weak consumer demand in the U.S., which is picking up now. So, I think
were fairly optimistic. You're going to see later this year some of the Asia export numbers start picking up again. So I
think this is kind of a temporary predicament right now.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. And I guess just to reinforce, we're not sitting on our hands just watching these patterns
change and not reacting. We've – we are continuing to make network adjustments. We've – if you look year-over-year,
we've taken our Asia capacity down about 10%. We have some additional things that have been rolled out to maintain
the kind of service levels we want. But at the same time, produce our exposure. We continue to show great growth
within our European capabilities, but we're also cautious. And so we have a number of operating cost initiatives there.
We have seen some increase in consumers choice of our lower-value products and so there is definitely some trade
down, which over time is – can be adjusted because things like time of day and those, we reduce costs but that does
require aggressive cost focus to get there. And at the same time, we're looking at revenue management strategies to
make sure that we are extracting the value we should and being paid for the services.
So, there's a number of initiatives in the International to adapt. And we do – clearly we're not thrilled with the Q1
performance in International. It was a challenging quarter for us, and I think for most players. But we've got pretty
good plans and that's why we're confident in our results going forward.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Great. Thanks for that.

<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: You know outside of the mix issues with SurePost, it does seem like Domestic volumes,
particularly the Next Day Air particularly spiked in the first quarter while the yields declined. Is there some intentional
market share gains you're looking for in the Next Day Air? And can you talk to SurePost? And is that all recorded
within Ground? Or is there some of that that impacts what the yields might look like in any of the air products?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, Ed, I think there is some indirect benefit. I mean, SurePost is just one product in the
portfolio. And I think as we mentioned since we first introduced this, it is part of an overall combined value proposition
for customers. So typically for every SurePost product, there's five or six other packages through our traditional ground
service or our air products. So there is some portfolio benefit I guess. But we did see the e-commerce momentum that is
clearly pushing our results right now rippled through both to air and ground. I think in the fourth quarter, we talked
about that being a big impact on our deferred air as a lot of the premium retailers are taking advantage of the time
definite services. We're also seeing some of that ripple into the Next Day also and it did create surprisingly strong
growth in our Next Day product. The vast majority of that, as I've said, is our Next Day Saver, which has no time and
day commitment.
So it really looks and feels to us like a traditional ground product but it lies in our air network. So it is a good product
for us. It doesn't have the kind of high delivery cost that a time-committed air product does. So we're very confident
that it is good volume for us and that we can handle those e-commerce shippers needs very appropriately.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Ed, as Kurt said clearly the big change was the large online retailers looking for that competitive
advantage and go into the Next Day Saver product. We are focused on the base rate 2% to 3% increase and we're
holding to that.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you. Sorry about the printer sound in the background here, guys. The big mix shifts
going around, and the previous two questions have addressed this as well. I think you did a great job saying, okay,
what's going on in Southeast Asia? We think was kind of a shorter-term issue related to consumerism, but how much of
the mix shift and the shift down the product chain do you think is structural? And kind of a longer term fact of life,
which is sounding more like the U.S. is, as opposed to just shorter term. This trade lane wasn't here, or customers were
just a little bit conservative with their product choices in a tough economy?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: I don't think we're overly concerned on that, Jeff. I mean clearly Europe is a bit of a wildcard
right now, so that's probably the area where there's the most movement. It's also a market that's not as mature for
product differentiation. What we call our standard product in a lot of cases exceeds the delivery commitments of other
companies' express products.
So there may be some settling on it, but I don't – we don't see this as a big risk. It's more a matter of adapting and
having the appropriate capacity, both for the overnight services and then the definite services. So, we don't see it as a
long-term risk. I think it's more of just a bit of a moving target and if economy's – economic conditions gets
challenging, we do see customers tightening up a little bit and extending their time commitments to save a little money
on transportation.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: But what is not changing though, is that the growth of B2C and that really benefits the small
package industry and we're going to benefit from that and that's some – where you're seeing some of the package
volume grow. Now our job is to figure out the best ways to serve that. And that's why we did the Kiala acquisition, to
help with the density on residential shipments going to alternative delivery locations. That's why we did My Choice.
So, that trend will not change, going forward.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Justin.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Can you guys put some numbers around the sequential shift in B2C? You talked about
50% of domestic in December. I guess, I'm just trying to get at this a different way and get a handle on – back to Tom's
question, as that shift in incremental margins moved down sequentially. I guess, I'm trying to understand if some of this
business that's come on in the B2C space, is coming on at discounted pricing, because you're getting good volume
through your network, from like an Amazon Prime or somebody like that, who's able to deliver big volume and sort of
gives you good utilization, but you're willing to take a step down on the pricing on that product in order to get that and
maybe get a foot in the door to raise price in a better time period? So, I'm trying to understand how that mix shift is
working? And the sequential change in the B2C percentage?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: We are seeing some market shifts in the customer composition in the B2C space. Clearly, there
has been consolidation. If you look back five years ago or more, there were more numerous players all buying to great
market share in the B2C and we have seen both some of the big traditional retailers become much more focused on it
and some of the pure plays like you mentioned. So no, there is absolutely a large customer impact right now. We're
seeing overall greater growth in large customers and small customers. That does tend to reduce yields, but they also
bring significant economies of scale, both in direct expense and in support expense because we can connect
electronically to them. So that is a trend very much that's in place. Larger customers in general are outperforming.
We've talked before about small business and the challenges they're facing. Nonetheless, across the board on our
revenue management, we are managing the customers and extracting base rate increases.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Again, this is not a new trend. Back in September at our Investor Conference, we shared with
you our long-term targets for domestic operating profit growth and domestic margin growth and we're right on target.
And we feel very confident in those long-term targets.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: All right. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Thank you.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Hey, Art. How's it going, bud?
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Good, good. How are you all? I was going to ask about the mix shift, but I'm going to move
on from that. I want to move on to the margins in Supply Chain and Freight. If I recall and I can't remember what you
said recently, but over the long haul, you always had a focus in that kind of high-single digits, roughly 7%, I think 7%
to 8%. You're kind of there in Q1. Can you talk a little bit about how you feel about where those margins are now in
Supply Chain and Freight? And if you think you can get those up to double-digit levels?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, thanks, Art, for giving us something else to talk about here. No, we feel pretty good that
this capability we built of an integrated Supply Chain and Freight offering is continuing to pay some dividends. We –
margins were very strong in the quarter, although clearly the growth was more muted, as some of the buy rates on the
Forwarding side have come down over time and we were able to adjust and adapt and taking cost out. So we feel great
on that front. The distribution group is a great asset. We are investing right now, but we've been able to maintain decent
margins there, even with a headwind of deep investment in healthcare. And then our UPS Freight group clearly has a
lot of opportunity going forward. Their results were relatively flat in this quarter, but we're making great progress on
differentiating ourselves and trying to strike a balance between being a disciplined yield player and still generating

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi there. Good morning, guys.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Bill.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hey, I just – I'm sorry to beat this dead horse, but I just want to understand when you have
conversations with your customers and they're considering moving to a SurePost or a product like that, how does the
conversation go? Because I think all of us look at this and say it's not just the yield mix risk. There's a profit risk mix as
well and I know you're aware of the risks there, but how do you ensure that you can keep defenses up and keep
premium ground, because ground is so good for you that I think by offering a SurePost you create some risk of
cannibalization of your own very good business. So how do you manage that? How do you think about that?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, I think, Bill, it's a portfolio management issue. I mean we've always faced that issue.
We're having such an integrated network it's very easy for customers to move from 8 AM Air to 10:30 to Saver to
Two-Day Air products to ground, so it's not a new concept at all for us.
And I think, if anything we've had a lot of experience. We do – the SurePost is one piece of a puzzle, but what it really
is, is it's giving us now a relevance and a very lightweight end of the market and a lot of cases we weren't relevant
before. So there's always cannibalization risk, but at the same time, we're continuing to differentiate our ground
product.
If you use SurePost you can't take the advantages of the great UPS pickup and delivery network as much. You don't
have the capabilities with My Choice to redirect deliveries. So it's a multi-tiered strategy of differentiating the UPS
ground product, but at the same time offering a different alternative for very lightweight low value shipments. So is
there risk to it? Absolutely. Do we talk about those things? Those are critical marketing issues and the appropriate
approach is what we've done from years is to create differences across our product line, price those appropriately and
then let customers take advantage of it. So the vast majority of what we're seeing is new volume coming in that we
haven't been really targeting. Is there some transition from our basic product, which was a start on this into SurePost?
Absolutely. But in aggregate, it's bringing more volume in all fronts across rather than cannibalizing.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah. Okay. Listen, thank you for the time.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey, good morning. You talked a little bit about pulling down buybacks in the quarter.
Can we expect that to get made up in the second and third quarter? Can you give us a little bit more insight into what
you're expecting on that front?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. Once we got hot and heavy on the discussions with TNT, it was appropriate for us to
restrict our purchases in the market. Fortunately, we had put in some accelerated share repurchases before that started,
so we were able to at least continue to purchase a reasonable amount of shares.

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are revisiting a number of alternatives for how we finance and structure the
acquisition – pending acquisition of TNT and we do expect to reach conclusion on that in the not too distant future.
We intend to maintain a very strong balance sheet. Our dividend policy will remain unchanged. But we are reviewing
the purchase, the repurchase strategy and we do expect to be a significant buyer of stock under all scenarios, but at least
at this point we're not ready to lock in guidance as far as repurchases in the short to medium term. We'll give you guys

Our next question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Good morning.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Morning.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Morning.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: So if I can get a step back, earnings were up 10% year-over-year this quarter. The midpoint
of the range implied 12% earnings growth. So, you've got to grow low teens for the rest of the year. There are lot of
different moving parts. You've identified a number of them and I promise I'm not asking you to write my notes for me,
but could you rank prioritize, let's say the three key bullet points. Why is year-over-year earnings growth going to
accelerate as this year progresses? Because it does seem like you had some tailwind, so whether it was productivity
from good weather in the U.S. or additional operating days in Asia. Thank you.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. Although, Andy said he would volunteer to write your note for you if you want.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: I don't think my boss will let me.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: There you go. Yeah. No, as we said, we actually are right on target for what we expected. There
maybe a couple of you that got a little ahead, but there's not dramatic differences I think. We do have some headwinds
with fuel moving up a little bit this quarter and the currency wasn't particularly friendly. Those things we expect
currency clearly to moderate with our hedges in place, so the International gets a little bit of help there.
We do expect our ability to adjust and adapt to the International, so we're going to – we've showed negative earnings
declines in Q1 for International. We do not expect those going forward we're going to see improved results. And the
business momentum we feel is strong. I mean we feel great about what's going on in the domestic business, 13% profit
improvement. We feel the momentum in the domestic business continues unabated, so we feel good about the U.S.
economy.
And we also saw some stability and firming in Asia I think in March into April anyway. So we feel in general positive
and think that the guidance is appropriate.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, I think when we gave the guidance in January we talked about tough comparisons for
Forwarding and for International Package in the first half of the year. Obviously, Asia fell off in August of last year and
the comps get much easier in the second half of the year for both International package and Forwarding. So as Kurt
said, we're right on target where we thought we'd be at this point in time.

<Q - John L. Barnes>: Hi. Just in looking at this specific quarter and the next couple of quarters, can you elaborate at
all were there any costs associated with what you have done on TNT and any costs associated with the expansion of air
freight capacity that you mentioned in your press release around Latin America that you can quantify that would have
impacted this specific quarter that might not be there on an ongoing basis, startup cost or one-time in nature, as you
tackle those two issues?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Clearly, we've got a lot of people spending a lot of time in airplanes and other activities, John,
but at least in the scheme of – the scope of UPS I'd hate to characterize those things as anything but negligible. We do
have expenses every day. Clearly, the Kiala acquisition, we've got work we're doing on that to build capability across
the globe. But, in the scheme of things, most of that is not material. And, the bulk of the expenses clearly with the
potential TNT acquisition will be in Q2, Q3. And, as they get to be material, we will discuss and give you guys clarity
around those. So, at this point, they're more of a rounding issue.
<Q - John L. Barnes>: And, then the expansion in Latin America?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Just a – well, that's just part of our overall dynamic air fleet network. It does add some expense
as we add capacity there but, once again, not enough to hugely move the needle. But that's – some of those steps we
make now will position us well and that's part of why we're giving the guidance we are going forward.

of Asia.

Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to come back to this Next Day Saver
product that you guys are definitely showing quite a bit of growth in. [indiscernible] (44:05) that, at least historically,
some of your highest cost operations are delivering those Next Day packages to residential addresses. So, how is that
levering into your network here where you can get a similar profit profile on those new packages?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: That's a great question and that is really why the Saver distinction is so critical for residential. It
is very challenging for us or anybody to work their way out to a residential suburban area and make an 8 A.M.
commitment or in some cases even a 10:30 commitment. You do what we call "break trace". You go off the optimal
travel path or you have to have a dedicated driver, driving it out there. With the Saver agreement, we get it there next
day guaranteed, but we have the flexibility to deliver it in the afternoon. So, we're able to deliver that package during
the normal optimal trace that all of our great operational technology tells us we should. So, there's a dramatic reduction
in operating expense in return for not having that early morning commitment. Most consumers aren't driving to get the
thing first thing in the morning; if they are, then the product would not be Saver. So, it's a great way to generate Next
Day Air yields but have a minimal impact on the pickup and delivery operation and utilize our integrated network. One
other interesting anecdote which I mentioned earlier was we did see growth in our letter products that we are seeing a
beginning of an uptick in refinancing applications in the mortgage industry. So that's another nice trend that is taking
letters from being negative to positive in that this is the first quarter in some time that we've seen that.

<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Good morning.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - David Pearce Campbell>: During your initial comments, you said the international trends in the – and revenue
trends in the second quarter would be like the first quarter. But, there's been substantial rate increases in sea freight and
some in air freight and some, as you mentioned, firming in the Asia Pacific market. So, I'm surprised that the revenue
growth would be the same as the first quarter.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, there the – the first quarter was almost – you can almost split the first quarter into half as
far as the air freight market. We were very disappointed in January results and then February didn't fully compensate
for it. So, it was a challenging period. In March, as some of the big product launches came out, there was an
improvement in demand, and yields did move up. So, it's hard – the first quarter was really a tale of two different cycles
anyway. We've seen demand stabilize a bit, although I don't get a sense that yields are moving up significantly in the air
freight industry right now. If anything, there may be a slight decline heading for it.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the international business. I know you've
mentioned that Asia to U.S. and Asia to Europe was a little bit soft. And, you characterized it mainly as a consumer
concern on the delivery side of that. But, are you seeing anything with your customers that are relocating any of their
manufacturing facilities back to North America for example? And, is there maybe some underlying structural trend that
will weigh on outbound Asia volumes going forward?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I don't think so, Chris. I think there's some of that and there is – and we're seeing some
manufacturing growth in the Unites States, but I don't think we're seeing a dramatic shift at this point in time. I think
what will drive that shift is energy prices if they climb. I think the big change in lanes, I think, would be if energy
prices do climb a lot then you will see some near-sourcing. But, today, I don't think there is a dramatic shift yet.

tough comps to last year. We had a pretty strong quarter last year, with substantial growth in both yield and shipments.
And, we are seeing some moving patterns. Some of the players in the market are getting a little more aggressive. So,
we're trying to find a middle ground right now as things stabilize. So, we feel good that the business unit is making
good progress but we've – we are trying to be selective and continuing to focus more on the middle market areas than

Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Great. Thank you. I thought it'd be helpful if you could give us a little breakdown in
terms of what the composition of the yields were, I know you talked about kind of 2% to 3% base price, but can you
run through on let's say the Air Express, I don't know if you want to do Air Express and Ground, but how much is
price? How much is change in weight per piece? And then how much is fuel impact, just to give us a little better sense
of what's really driving the yields?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, Tom, we did see a big impact on overall weight. The Ground was down a couple percent
in aggregate and our air products were down 4% to 5%. So that's fairly large piece. Probably the most notable issue and
that encompasses both the mix of the B2C, which tends to be lighter and the lightweight focused. The core underlying
base rates in most cases is 2% to 3% customer-to-customer, so the changing mix both of lower service with Saver for
example, although there is a yield [indiscernible] (51:26) as we mentioned there's an offsetting price benefit. As I
mentioned, Q4 to Q1, the trends are very similar for Ground and deferred air if you take out fuel surcharge. Next Day,
Air shows a bigger difference because of the substantial increases we are seeing on the Saver side and the weight being
lighter. So, all in all, the base rate as we factor out those things are very steady at the 2.5% to 3%.
Ground a little better than that average, Air maybe a little below that average, but we know that on a
customer-by-customer basis as we do our customer strategies, those yield increases are happening. But with the
significant mix change it has masked that a bit.
