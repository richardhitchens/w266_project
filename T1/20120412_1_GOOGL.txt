MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google, Inc. First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is
being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Jane
Penner. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Jane Penner
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With us are Larry
Page, Chief Executive Officer; David Drummond, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Chief Legal
Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President
and Chief Business Officer.
Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at
investor.google.com so please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that
accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on
our website in a few hours.
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered
forward-looking including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the
expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a

free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings
press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry.
Lawrence E. Page
Thank you. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. It's great to be here with all of you. I'll talk about our
new class of stock at the end of my remarks, but first I want to focus on our performance.
We had a very strong quarter with revenue up 24% year-on-year at $10.6 billion. Since becoming CEO again last April
I've pushed hard to increase our velocity, improve our execution and focus on the big bets that will make a difference in
the world. Google is a large company now but we'll achieve more and do it faster if we approach life with the passion
and the soul of a startup. This has involved a lot of cleanup. We've given many of our products including search a
visual refresh so they now have a more consistent look and feel and we've closed or combined over 30 products. We
have so many opportunities that without hard choices we end up spreading ourselves too thin and don't have the impact
that we strive for.
Creating a simpler, more intuitive user experience across Google has been another important focus. I've always
believed that technology should do the hard work: logistics, scheduling and communications, so users can get on with
what makes them happiest, life. Our products work seamlessly together so people don't have to navigate Google to get
stuff done.
Chrome for Android, which launched this quarter, is a great example of this kind of simplicity we're shooting for. It has
made switching between devices painless; all of your tabs are there across your desktop in Android. You can even click
the back button on a different device and it just works. Just try it out, it's a great experience.
It's the same with Google Play, which we also shipped this quarter. You can now access all your movies, your books,
apps and games from the web or from your Android device, no cables downloading or synching required. We spent
years working with partners to get all of this great content so it's really exciting to see it brought together in a
beautifully simple way that people can enjoy.
Now Google+ is truly at the heart of our efforts to create a simpler, more intuitive experience for all of our users. You
should think of it in two parts: one is just our social side. Once you're logged in and have upgraded to Google+, you're
just using one Google not a series of disconnected products. It's still early days but with over 120 Google integrations
to date – Google+ integrations to date – we're on the right track. And your user experience on Google just gets better.
You can see friends' recommendations when you're using Google Play and you don't think about that as Google+ but it
just comes from that infrastructure and we're seeing a positive impact all across the web. Google users can now
recommend search results they like, a goal we've had ever since we started the company.
The other part is the social destination, which is accessed on your mobile clients or on plus.Google.com. This social
destination part grew from a base of zero, not starting with all the Google usage like the part I was previously talking
about and is growing quickly. In fact, we see impressive engagement and fast growth here. It's just not all of Google.
We're starting up a new community.

We're excited about the amazing speed with which some people have amassed over one million followers and I've just
been lucky enough to pass two million. I get high-quality feedback on the public posts I make which I really enjoy and
every day we make Google+ better. Just yesterday we took another big step forward with the beautiful new UI for
Google+ and the new customizable navigation ribbon in that redesign makes it much easier to access your favorite
apps. There's better discoverability for Hangouts and you'll love the larger images that you see across that interface.
Now last time there was a bit of confusion over the metrics I gave about Google+, so I want to be clear about these two
parts of Google+ and the fact that we've made great progress on both parts. As you would expect, the social spine is
proportional to Google and all of the usage across Google and Google is pretty big. And well over 170 million people
have now upgraded to Google+.
So to summarize, there are two parts to the Google+ experience, the part that is the social spine and the other part that
is the social destination part of Google+ exclusively. Both of these are growing fast but the social destination part of
Google+ is growing as a new product with very healthy growth.
I'm also excited by our big bets. We have some amazing new products that were seen as crazy when we launched them,
but now have phenomenal usage. They can easily pass the toothbrush test. They're important enough that millions of
people use them at least once or twice a day.
Chrome has over 200 million users. Our Display business has reached in annualized run rate of over $5 billion and
850,000 Android devices are activated every day. And YouTube just keeps on growing. Usage is staggering, even by
Google's standard; they have over 800 million monthly users uploading over an hour of video per second.
I'm incredibly proud of these achievements. They wouldn't have been possible without an amazing team of Googlers
and the long-term focus with which we are able to run the company, which brings me to this afternoon's announcement
about our stock.
Now throughout our evolution from being privately held startup to a large publicly listed company, we have managed
Google for the long term and enjoying tremendous success as a result, especially since our IPO in 2004.
The founders, Sergey and I, really hoped, but we did not expect, that Google would have such significant impact and
that this progress has made us even more impatient to do important things that matter in the world. Our enduring love
for Google comes from a strong desire to create technology products that enrich millions of people's lives in deep and
meaningful ways. To fulfill these dreams we need to ensure that Google remains a successful growing business that can
generate significant returns for everyone involved.
When we went public in 2004, we established some clear, well-publicized expectations for investors around our
governance. We wrote a couple of things in our original founders' letter I just want to read here, "New investors will
fully share in Google's long-term economic future but will have little ability to influence its strategic decisions through
their voting rights." And, "We are creating a new corporate structure that is designed for stability over the long time
horizon. By investing in Google, you are placing an unusual long-term bet on the team, especially Sergey and me."
I wanted to quote all that, because these were the clear, well-publicized expectations we established for investors. And
while this decision was controversial at the time, we believe with hindsight it was absolutely the right thing to do. Eight
years later these statements are still remarkably accurate, and everyone involved has realized tremendous benefits.
Given Google's success it's not surprising this type of dual-class governance structure is now somewhat standard
among newer technology companies. In our experience, success is more likely if you concentrate on the long term.
Technology products often require significant investment over many years to fulfill their potential. For example, it took
three years just to ship our first Android handset, and then another three years on top of that before the operating
system truly reached critical mass. These kinds of investments are not for the faint hearted.
Long-term product investments, like Chrome and YouTube, which now enjoy phenomenal usage, were made with a
significant degree of independence. However, day-to-day dilution from routine equity-based employee compensation
and other possible dilution, such as stock-based acquisitions, will likely undermine this dual-class structure and our
aspirations for Google over the very long-term. We have put our hearts into Google and hope to do so for many years

to come, so we want to ensure that our corporate structure can sustain these efforts and our desire to improve the world.
Today we announced plans to create a new class of non-voting capital stock. These shares will be distributed via stock
dividend to all existing stockholders. The owner of each existing share will receive one new share of the non-voting
stock, giving investors twice the number of shares they had before, effectively a two-for-one stock split, something
many of our investors have long asked us for. These non-voting shares will be available for corporate uses like
equity-based employee compensation that might otherwise dilute our governance structure.
In November 2009, Sergey and I published plans to sell a modest percentage of our overall stock ending in 2015. We
are currently halfway through these plans, and we don't expect any changes to that, certainly not as a result of this new
potential class. We both remain very much committed to Google for the long-term.
It's important to bear in mind that this proposal will only have an effect on governance over the very long term. In fact,
there's no particular urgency to make these changes now, we don't have an unusually big acquisition plan in case you
were wondering.
Investors and others have always taken a big bet on Sergey and me, and that path will likely last longer as a result of
these changes. We are honored that so many of you have put your trust in us and we recognize the tremendous
responsibility that rests on our shoulders. We think this is a good thing, because users rely on Google to produce and
operate amazing technology products and to safely and responsibly store their data. That is our passion.
Thank you very much. And I will now hand over to David to explain some of the more technical aspects of this
proposal.
David C. Drummond
Thanks, Larry. So first of all, I wanted to say that we will be filing a proxy statement soon, which will have more
details about today's proposal. But for now, I want to give a few broad strokes.
First off, as Larry said, what we announced today is basically a two-for-one stock split and here's how it works. What
we're doing is creating a new class of stock, Class C. That new stock will have equivalent rights to our existing Class A
and Class B stock, except it will have no voting rights. And it will also be issued through a stock dividend on all Class
A and Class B shares. So after the dividend, a stockholder who currently owns one share of Class A common stock
with a single vote will continue to own that share plus one share of Class C capital stock that does not have a vote. Our
existing Class A shares will continue to trade as they do now, and the new Class C shares will also be listed, so
stockholders will be able to trade those shares, the Class C, just as they can with the Class A shares today.
Now one thing to emphasize, because all stockholders will be treated equally and will receive one share of Class C for
every share they now hold, everyone, including Larry, Sergey and Eric, will retain the same voting interest they had
immediately prior to the dividend. And it's also important to note that as part of this, Larry, Sergey and Eric have all
agreed to subject their shares to a transfer restriction agreement. This agreement maintains the same link between their
voting and economic interests that exists today.
So if any of Larry, Sergey or Eric sell or transfer their nonvoting Class C shares there is a stapling provision in the
agreement that requires them to either sell an equal number of class B shares or convert an equal number of class B
shares into class A shares. Now the stapling requirement will end when their ownership levels fall below certain
thresholds. So the basic thing to understand here is that the stapling provision is designed so that subject to these
thresholds the votes held by the founders and Eric will be reduced proportionally as their economic interest in the
company declines.
Now a word about the process we used. Our Board of Directors carefully considered this proposal to create a new class
of stock before reaching a decision. The process the board followed was robust and the deliberations were extensive.
Back in January 2011, the Board established a special committee comprised of independent, non-management Board
members to consider this new class of stock or other alternatives. The committee met on numerous occasions over the

15 months that the special committee considered the proposal and that was separately from the board. The committee
recommended and the Board unanimously approved today's proposal.
In terms of next steps, the proposal is subject to the approval of a majority of the voting power of Google's common
stock and they'll vote together as a class. That will happen at our annual meeting on June 21 of this year. Given that
Larry, Sergey and Eric control the majority of voting power and support the proposal, we expect it to pass. Following
that, the board will set a record date for the dividend and move the process forward.
So for more detail on the proposal you can find the founders' letter that Larry and Sergey issued this morning as well as
a postscript from me on our Investor Relations site. And as I said, next week we'll file a preliminary proxy statement
with the SEC, which will have even more details about today's proposal.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick to talk about the quarter.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Well, closing this first year with Larry
leading Google as CEO, all of us at Google feel a renewed sense of velocity, focus and optimism and our Q1 operating
but also financial results are good reflection of this spirit. So let's jump right into the financials.
Our gross revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $10.6 billion or 1% quarter-over-quarter, and our Google websites also
grew, revenue grew 24% to $7.3 billion with strength across most major geographies and verticals.
Google's network revenue was up 20% year-over-year to $2.9 billion,1% quarter-over-quarter and network revenue was
still negatively impacted by the search quality changes we began to make a year ago in late February, otherwise known
as Panda. Other revenue was up 56% year-over-year to $420 million and 2% quarter-over-quarter.
Our aggregate paid click growth was very strong, just shy of 40%, up 39% year-over-year and up 7%
quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate cost-per-click growth was down 12% and down 6% quarter-over-quarter. So given the
recent trends in CPC and clicks, allow me to spend a bit of time today addressing this.
The most important thing for you to understand is that our business is healthy. We believe that shifts in CPC and paid
clicks taken independently really do not reflect the fundamental health of our business. Now allow me some details on
this.
In general, we attribute these trends to a combination of really five core factors. Those include FX, then there's three
mix effects. For example, the mobile versus tablet versus desktop shifts, Emerging Markets versus developed market
shifts, and even the basics of Google.com versus our network. And then finally, ad quality changes which is also huge
factor.
So as you can see, it's a complex set of dynamics with multiple variables at play. Many in the financial community
have tried to isolate or often I hear pick one of these among these factors as the primary driver for CPC or click trends.
Some even say, it's all about mobile. Others suggest that it indicates weakness in demand for Google advertising. Well
on the latter point I want to be very clear that, that's not the case.
One important signal we have for advertiser demand is bidding behavior and in fact, our advertisers' bid continues to be
very strong and are growing. So the dynamics around CPC and paid clicks are just simply very complex because of all
of these big factors and change continually. Do trying to pick up horse, so to speak, just doesn't make sense. We
internally track all these factors with the help of a number of statisticians, economists and engineers who dig into all
these details on an ongoing basis.
So we won't go into that level of detail every quarter, but again, the key thing to understand is that we believe that shifts
in CPC or paid clicks taken independently simply don't reflect the fundamental health of our business, which we
believe is actually very healthy. If anything, the recent lower CPCs present a great opportunity for advertisers to get an
even better return on their ad spend. And lower cost, better ROI, attract advertisers and thus, this is good for Google for

the long-term as well. So enough said on CPC and paid clicks.
Let's just turn to geographic performance. The U.S., U.K. and rest of world are growing still at a good pace as reflected
in our results. In our earnings slides, which you will find on our Investor Relations website, you see that we've broken
down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging
programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
Our revenue in the U.S. was up 22% year-over-year to $4.9 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 54% of our
total revenue or $5.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year, which includes a modest $37 million benefit from our hedging
program. The U.K. was up 19% year-over-year to $1.2 billion.
Let me now turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition costs were $2.5 billion or 24.5% of total advertising revenue. Our
other cost of revenue was $1.2 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $74 million. And finally, operating
expenses, excluding SBC again, totaled $3 billion. SBC totaled $482 million for the quarter. And the increase
year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend and professional
services.
So as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit was $3.9 billion for Q1, resulting in a non-GAAP operating
margin slightly above 37%. These robust margins give us the confidence to continue to fully fund these strategic
growth areas such as mobile, Android, YouTube, Chrome, all of the areas that Larry talked about, and Nikesh will go
into more details of these initiatives in a minute.
Turning to head count, which was approximately 610 for the quarter, and we ended up the quarter with roughly 33,077
employees full time.
Our effective tax rate was lower this quarter, 18% and this reflects the mix of earnings between domestic and
international subsidiaries and hedges, and also some capital gains offset by carried over capital losses.
So now let me turn to cash – cash management. Other OI&Es, or other income and expenses, was $156 million for the
quarter positive and it reflects a higher realized gain on our investments, offset somewhat by lower interest income and
by the impact of our FAS 133 expenses from our hedging program. For more details on OI&E, once again I refer you to
the slides that the company us on our IR website.
Operating cash flow was very strong, $3.7 million. CapEx for the quarter was $607 million versus last quarter at $951
million. The majority of our CapEx spend was related to production equipment this quarter as well as data center
operations and facilities. And as a reminder, we will continue to make significant CapEx investments and these have
shown to be lumpy from quarter to quarter mostly depending on when we're able to make these investments.
So in total, very pleased with our free cash flow, $3.1 billion. Let me close with my usual reminder that our revenues
typically exhibit seasonality in the first half of the year while our expenses do less so. So it's just a forewarning for
everybody who's kind of tuning their models.
I'll handoff now to Nikesh, who will cover in more detail our business performance in the quarter. Additionally, since
Susan, who's typically on the call, is on a well-deserved spring break with her family this week, Nikesh will also cover
some of the product highlights, primarily in ads.
With this, I'll turn it over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. I will now give you an update on our business activities. As Larry and Patrick have mentioned, we
had another quarter of excellent performance, resulting in $10.6 billion of revenue this quarter. Our results are actually
reflective of three major trends that are happening in the online advertising space so let me just touch upon those.

First, we're seeing a big move to solutions. Our clients and partners more and more want complete solutions that work
across all screens: desktop, mobile, tablet and in the future of television, and also work with all kinds of formats
whether they're search display or video ads rather than having individual solutions for different devices and formats. So
we are driving our teams to sell solutions across the entire marketing funnel from building brand awareness to
conversions. We are converging our teams, of over 8,000 people, to selling these complete solutions in 60 countries,
making us one of the largest online solutions players.
Secondly, the big trend is we're seeing a breakthrough on brands. More than at any point in the last decade of online
advertising, we're at a point where major brand advertisers from movie studios to CPG companies are finally looking to
digital media as a central part of their marketing efforts. We are making huge progress. YouTube has gone from an
interesting ad buy to a key buy for brands. In May, we will be hosting our first up front for brands and agencies
showcasing the latest channel content and opportunities for marketers. Something television has been doing forever, we
will do that for YouTube in New York.
And third, we're being – we're beginning to see a trend on cross media measurement. Search advertising has always
been highly measurable and we have been leading the industry in extending the measurability not only in search but in
display, mobile and now video. We are actually taking that one step further and trying to move that measurability to
offline sales. Our experience is that businesses may allocate experimental budgets to new areas but they invest serious
money only when they can measure the results. We are rolling out best-of-breed measurement technologies so all
clients can measure their ROI whether their goals are online conversions, brand lifts or just the ability to compare
offline and online media. Let's talk about some specific product areas.
Search. Our desktop search business has maintained robust growth with strong traction with our top partners around the
world even in the face of economic uncertainties that we've been noticing in Europe. I think search advertising has
broken through that sound barrier of being an online channel, which now finally has proven to drive in-store sales. For
example, we partnered with Ikea in Italy in a study showing that each click on a paid search ad generates $7.60 in
revenue. That interaction with paid search in conjunction with television drives 20% of contribution to sales. There's a
lot of room to improve on that but it's a clear demonstration of how online advertising is no longer just restricted to
online sales but also having a huge impact on the offline world.
Last week we launched a range of features to improve location targeting so that marketers can reach users by ZIP code
or have their physical location show up more prominently in their ads. Today I also want to highlight Google Analytics,
which is an unsung hero. Over 10 million marketers and websites globally use Google Analytics to measure the
effectiveness of the online presence in real-time from large e-commerce sites to small blogs. That means that our
technology is the heart of over 10 million businesses, helping them get the most out of the web.
Last quarter we made several important improvements to Google Analytics, helping marketers to measure the impact of
traffic from across over 400 social networks. I didn't even know there were 400 social networks.
Let's talk about Display. On Display we saw robust revenue growth as our clients continued to see the value of
integrated advertising solutions in driving business results. For example, we signed a deal with Unilever in Brazil for a
campaign that ran around across all Google properties, including YouTube, Search, Google Display Network and
Gmail. We also recently partnered with leading sportswear company Reebok to develop a global display campaign
across YouTube Mobile, YouTube and AdMob and Mobile YouTube as well.
On the platform side in Display, we continue to make progress. We're now the leading platform provider for agencies
and publishers to help drive their business using Display Advertising. We are focused on building unified buying and
selling platform that helps to manage the advertising across all media much better than they have been able to in the
past.
Our good relationships with our clients are helped by rapid product development and innovation. Last quarter we
launched the Google Display Network app in AdWords, which makes it easier for all AdWords clients to build,
monitor and refine display campaigns across millions of sites in our network. This is helping bring the world of search
and display even closer.

Let's take a minute to talk about YouTube. As I mentioned, YouTube is an amazing success story. It's gone from an
interesting buy to an obvious buy. Our watch paid sales have accelerated, particularly in key emerging countries, but
also in mature ones. Today most of our in-stream ads on YouTube are skippable by our TrueView ad format, which is
fast becoming an online video standard. It's great for users, and it's fair for advertisers.
For example, the U.K. mobile operator O2 is actively now using YouTube to support their brand launch. They're using
several YouTube products including TrueView, YouTube Mobile. They even live streamed the New York – I'm sorry,
the New Year's Eve concert from O2 Arena in London globally on YouTube.
In addition to this, we're also rolling out our 100 new original channels on YouTube featuring top talent like Jay-Z, and
Madonna, Tony Hawk, as well as innovative new media companies and YouTube's new own successful partners. We
think YouTube is fast becoming the platform for the next generation's channels. Which is great because we're also
seeing initial success selling the sponsorships for these channels to large advertisers such as Toyota, Unilever and GM
and it is all in anticipation of the big upfront event coming up in May.
Let's change gears and talk about mobile. Mobile is quickly becoming a backbone of many clients' overall advertising
strategies and has huge headroom to grow. We continue to innovate with our product offerings with a number of new
tools for advertisers. One development we're particularly excited about is our new enhanced click to download format.
This format in search helps marketers and developers promote apps. These things help grow ROI. They provide users
with more relevant download information about apps such as star rankings, pricing etcetera and all this happens right in
the ad creative. So we keep actively working to help develop the mobile ecosystem, from enabling mobile commerce to
empowering local businesses.
In Q1, we began to scale our GoMo campaign, which is our go mobile campaign. This initiative helps businesses get
more and more assertive and set up great mobile websites so they can keep driving traffic to those websites and expand
their businesses. We've done this effort across the world in North and South America and Europe and Asia and Africa.
Moving beyond advertising, our Enterprise business also saw excellent progress as large organizations and small
businesses continue to see the value of Google apps as a cost-effective and feature-rich productivity suite. Some of our
top customers to go Google in Q1 include global pharmaceutical company Roche, more than 90,000 users; the State of
Colorado, which announced they intend to move 26,000 employees and users to Google; also the University of
Pennsylvania and Rome have gone Google.
Not only that small business adoption of Google apps is on fire with SMB sign-ups almost doubling in the past six
months. So we're happy with the business and were happy with the way enterprise continues to progress.
Let me go back and show some more color on the country performance that Patrick also talked about. From a regional
perspective we saw generally stable performance in the Americas. We saw sustained traction in most parts of Europe
and we saw acceleration in Asia. All this was driven by strong performance from our long tail sales channel. Google
North America was steady and U.S. revenue was boosted by seasonal events such as the Super Bowl, Valentine's Day,
tax season. Canada was a little slower.
Growth in Western Europe was robust in spite of the macroeconomic conditions. We continue seeing good growth in
the U.K. Germany, France and Italy grew slightly less quickly than before. We saw strong acceleration in Asia, Japan
grew faster this quarter led by successes again in our small and medium client base.
Let's talk about marketing and our partnerships business. Our marketing and partnership teams continue to support the
fantastic growth we have seen this quarter across all of our business lines, products and services. We continue to roll
out initiatives to support Google+, which Larry talked about. We rolled out our, "That's a Plus," campaign with spots
airing during the Grammys, the Oscars. Google+ and Hangouts are getting great traction. We have President Obama,
we have Governor Romney, they both conducted very successful Hangouts on the platform. Even NASCAR held a
Hangout ahead of the Daytona 500. The most interesting was Seaview Survey did an underwater Hangout live from the
Great Barrier Reef.

It's amazing to be able to see our great products like Hangouts be so successful. I recommend that all of you try
Hangouts soon.
As Larry mentioned, we also launched Google Play, which provides users one place to find, enjoy and share apps,
music, movies and books instantly; anywhere across the web and on their Android devices. To support the launch we
had a seven days to play promotion offering discounts on apps and media and our YouTube video has received more
than three million views to date.
Our partnership teams also kept great work supporting our products by being very close to our partners. For example,
we launched Google Street View in Russia which lets users walk around historical centers of Moscow and St.
Petersburg. And we're also thrilled that this quarter our Google Cultural Institute helped bring Nelson Mandela's
archives online. We expanded our successful art project to include new museums from the Getty Museum in LA to the
museums in Paris and Qatar. The project now provides access to more than 30,000 ultra-high resolution images of
paintings, sculptures and photographs of 151 museums and other institutions in 40 countries.
So in closing, I think Q1 was an excellent quarter. It has led us off to a very good start for 2012. We look forward to
continuing to serve our users, customers and partners for the rest of 2012 and beyond. I also want to say thank you to
all the Googlers in our global business team, all of our partners in the product and engineering teams that allow us to
make these wonderful things happen and allow us to continue to drive business.
With that, thank you, and I'm going to hand you back to Pat.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. So, Jamie, our operator, is going to give us the instructions to get to the Q&A. So, Jamie, why don't we just
jump right in.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Spencer Wang>: Thanks, and good afternoon. Two quick questions, first for Patrick. You mentioned the head
count growth was only about 600 this quarter. That's obviously slower than what you saw in 2011. Should we – is this
roughly the pace we should expect for 2012 or were there perhaps some timing factors?
And then secondly for Larry, you talked about Google+ unifying the Google product. So when you think about things
like Google Wallet and Offers, the mobile strategy, Maps, do think of these as individual products or are they part of
perhaps a broader local strategy, and if so, how do they fit together? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Spencer. Why don't I just jump on the technical question, then let Larry get to the
second one. So look, I think that the head count fluctuations, you'll remember last year when Larry said that we were at,
what was the, kind of the edge of what was tolerable. And look, this short-term variability is actually the very best
proof point that we don't manage kind of quarter-to-quarter and try to smooth things out. It just happens that in the first
quarter, at this time of year, it's a bit different than when you come back in Q3 when you have all of the graduate
students that actually start with us, so there's a bit of fluctuations there. So I wouldn't read that much into the numbers
but we're basically continuing to push on plan for our hiring for this year.
<Q - Spencer Wang>: Thanks, Patrick.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, on the question I guess about our products, I think we're working very hard and I've
talked a lot about this, to make our Google experience be more unified and feel like one great experience for people.
And many of the products you mentioned, Google Wallet, Offers, Maps, I mean have – they apply kind of across many

of the things we do.
And so I think you'll see better integration of those products over – through the rest of our products as already exists
with Wallet, for example, across many different parts like Google Play and so on. And I think you'll see that
increasingly happen over time just as we make these experiences better. They'll come up when you expect them to
come up and when they make sense for users. I think that's definitely a big area of focus for us.
<Q - Spencer Wang>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you. Jamie, let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.
<Q - Mark Stephen Mahaney>: Thanks. Two quick questions, first in terms of appealing to major brands, Nikesh, I
think you talked about how you're seeing major brands engage more with YouTube and other assets. Could you talk
about how you're trying to go after those dollars? Are there new things that you're doing now that you weren't doing
two years ago to kind of accelerate that momentum?
And then just real quickly on the mobile CPC issue, could you just comment again on over time, over what period of
time you would expect mobile and desktop CPCs to merge? Or do you think that's a realistic expectation? What would
cause that to happen or not? Thank you.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Hi. Let me take the first question quickly, then I'll give you a little color on the second one, then
Patrick can jump in. In terms of what we're doing differently, as I mentioned, YouTube has gone from being an
interesting place for brands to be to being a must buy. So we're seeing tremendous demand for inventory which is brand
related; and for the most part, the online world in the past has been more performance related, i.e. people wanted to get
some transactions, they wanted to get more people to their website. Now they're seeing the benefit of using the web for
brand affiliation and for brand recognition.
So we are beginning to have a different sales pitch with the large brands, which is oriented towards them coming and
getting their brand seen on the web and YouTube is a phenomenal tool in that regard. It acts sort of like an anchor
property, then they're able to package our demographic-based inventory around the Google Display Network, around
YouTube, and actually get the brands to engage in large campaigns, which can run in the millions of dollars.
This was a capability we couldn't have a few years ago because the inventory didn't exist, all the demographic tools
didn't exist. So clearly this is a new space and a new sort of pitch to our brand advertisers. And as I said, we are trying
to light this up across our sales force around the world in 60 countries.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Thank you, Mark. Our next question?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: No, we just have – let's go to the mobile CPC question. So Mark, I think that this one is –
think of it as so much upside for us because essentially mobile is exploding in query growth. And the formats
themselves are just adapting already a lot from a relatively crude base to so much more in the future. So that you're
absolutely right, that right now they don't monetize as well, because we're kind of in what Search used to be in 2002,
2003, 2004. So as these formats kind of continue to get better and better, we'd expect much better performance on
them.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, this is Larry. I'll add something, Mark. I think the mobile CPCs, people always spend
the most effort on whatever the major source of traffic or revenue is. Those are growing really quickly, but currently
obviously there is more on Desktop. I think over time, it'll actually reverse, and I think that the ability to kind of on
your mobile to do local kinds of transactions, to really easily communicate with people and the kind of capabilities you
have on your mobile device. And the fact that you spend most of your money locally, I think over time that may
actually reverse and CPCs actually may get better. But I think we're very bullish about that. We're making a lot of

investments in that area, in things like Offers and so on and Wallets and we're very, very excited about the potential
there and also click-to-call and other things that we do.
So I think, for example, it's a lot easier to call someone from your mobile than it is from your computer right now. So if
that's how you're relying for transactions, actually mobile CPC should be higher for that. So I think you just haven't
seen the focus on it, and we're moving more and more focus onto that, both on our sales side and our customers are
moving focus onto that, but I'm very, very bullish on that.
<Q - Mark Stephen Mahaney>: Thank you, Larry. Thank you, Patrick, Nikesh.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks. Jamie. Let's go to our next call, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Larry, in your 2012 update letter you speak of all these notions of changing the world and
ambitious goals on risky projects, and having a healthy disregard for the impossible. Without getting into too much
detail, at a high-level what types of projects is Google working on that would really surprise us? And are you remaining
committed to the 70/20/10 rule, were these non-core areas might only get 10% of the investment?
And then separately just on the Google.com TAC piece, that continues to increase as a percentage of Google revenue.
Is most of that coming from payments to mobile partners? And given the growth of mobile, should we expect that to
continue to increase meaningfully? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Larry, why don't I answer the last one first, cause it's really easy, then you can jump on the
rest. Look, on TAC, if you look at our percentages as a percentage of revenue year-over-year, it's basically stable. I
mean it moves a little bit here and there, and you have partner mix and then FX mix between mobile and others, but it's
not actually changing in any dramatic way. So what you have to see in there is just a regular mix of both traffics and
partners that come in and out all the time as well. So I wouldn't read too much into that. I'll let Larry answer the real
sexy question.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Thanks, Ben, for the great question. I think – I didn't mention specifically the 70/20/10 in
my letter. I should have, that's a good addition. So we definitely still feel that most of our resources should be going to
our core businesses, which really Search and Ads and a few of the other things I mentioned really fall into that core, I
think. And then there's, you know, 20% kind of on near things and maybe another 10% on the really speculative things.
Through our whole history we've really struggled to even have 10% on the speculative things. Generally it's much
lower than that. I think the real thing that's needed on those projects is some management. It does take up bandwidth.
You saw our announcements of Google Glass last week, which I was very excited to see go out. You've seen the
driverless car kinds of things, and it does take our executives time to do deal with those things and so on. I think that's
the real investment we make rather than being huge amounts of dollars on those kinds of things generally.
We've got a limited number of things we can do. As I've been saying, we've been trying to focus. So trying to make
sure that we have the right speculative bets as well as the right bets we're making on our core products and so on and
I'm pretty excited about our ability to do that.
And I think it's hard coming from the outside because I mentioned in the letter I published today that Android took
three years plus three years, kind of, to really get to where it is today, and that's six years. You all haven't seen Android
for those six years. We've seen it for those six years and we really invested in it. It's not so much money at the earlier
stages, but attention. And that's an important, I think, discipline for the company to have.

And we'll take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Go ahead please, Brian.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Can you hear me?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Now we can hear you.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Okay. Sorry about that. Similar to detail on cost-per-click, would you discuss the key drivers of
higher paid click growth? Is it quality changes, product listing ads or something else? And more broadly, maybe you
can discuss how product listing ads do impact results as we're tracking on a substantially higher number of these ads on
your site? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Without giving – the short answer is yes and that's what the core answer of my message to the
market was today. I think that you have a combination of international factors, you have a combination of new formats.
Ad formats drive a lot in terms of paid clicks if you think of even the sitelinks extensions, like we have a new
generation of sitelinks for this quarter, right?
This is a perfect example of a product where by adding additional lines that are more targeted so instead of having just
trucks or – and then you go down into the second layer, right? You have less CPC for that additional sitelinks but if it's
a better ad, people click a ton more on them. So it is really all of those five factors that actually drive them. And that's
why we're continuing to be pretty happy with the health of the net effect, which is real growth. Certainly
internationally, I mean it also, you can see our mix between international and non-international and that's driving it as
well. So you all these factors at play and we're pretty happy with what we're doing there.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Brian. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas Anmuth>: Thanks for taking the question. Two things. First, I just want a follow-up on the question on
mobile and TAC. If you could help us understand beyond CPCs how the economics of mobile are different? And
perhaps a little bit more detail on how you're paying OEMs and carriers?
And then secondly, any updated thoughts on the cash balance and update perhaps on the split of U.S. and international
cash? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Yeah, let me start with the last one first. We don't give the breakdown of our U.S. cash. We do
it kind irregularly so we haven't done so of late. We continue to have a very strong cash balance both U.S. and
international. You'll notice if you go into the details of our cash balance and on our balance sheet, right, we have just
slightly under $2 billion of sec lending program, so when you really, really look at our net cash balance, you've got to
take that sec lending out because it's just – it's on both sides of the balance sheet. But for the rest of it, incredibly
healthy cash balance both domestic and international.
And Nikesh, do you want to give a quick update on the mobile CPCs and economics?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, again, I'm not going to talk about specifically the TAC on mobile, but as you know, we get
people using our devices both organically as well as through our distribution partnerships with carriers and OEMs. And
typically the OEMs and carriers participate in some of the economics around the Android marketplace or Google Play
and some of them participate in the economics around Google search just the way we would do syndication on the web
platform, which you do with many partners around the world. We have similar deals on the mobile front.

I think in the mix that it comes out – it washes out and it sort of adds up into our number which we show in our total
number between desktop and mobile but mobile is no different from the way the desktop business operates out there.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: And we benefit from the terrific growth. Thanks for your question, Doug. Let's go to the next
question, please, Jamie.
Operator
And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Go ahead, Carlos.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Thanks for taking my question. Two questions if I may. If you think of the future of Internet
search three or four years out, how important to you this social signal be and how important will personalization will
be? In other words, will the company with the best social signal be able to offer the best search and invested in that
question is to know why is Google investing so much in Google+?
And the second question, if I may, you'll probably end the year with about $50 billion in cash and marketable securities
and that will give you quite a lot of strategic flexibility. Given that, what's the rationale to continue to increase that
amount and not return cash to shareholders?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, I'll take the first part, Carlos. Thanks for the question. This is Larry. I think that it's a
very good question and I think one of the things I actually had in my remarks and I took out was to talk a little bit about
search and just didn't have enough time to put it all in. And I actually covered the question you're asking.
I think one of the most amazing things I think we can do today that we couldn't do even a few months ago is to really –
I have this friend Ben Smith, right, who is a person at Google. He has kind of a common name. Now when I do a
search actually it finds the right person and it puts him in the search box. So the first time the search box isn't really
doing searching a string just a sequence of letters, it's actually searching for that person that I know.
Now it's not, obviously not all the searches you do, but being able to search for people well is important. And knowing
– having real feedback from users about what they like and don't like, and things they're sharing and so on is very
useful for Search. And we have a lot of those signals already. But we can always use more signals, we can always use
better elements and we can always use more data to generate that.
So I think it's – it is very important. I think it's not – I think social data about identity and our ability to easily share
things with other people and comment on them and things like that is a basic utility for people in all of our products.
And that's where – I was talking about Google+ really working across all of Google for identity and sharing and
notification and other things that it does really well.
So that all applies to Search and I think it's important for Search. I think Search is going to change a lot. We're going to
make it a lot better over the next five or ten years, as it's changed a lot in the past, and it will include a bunch of those
signals and a bunch of other things as well.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Carlos, why don't I take the next one, the issue of our cash balance. We have a healthy cash
balance; I had mentioned a minute ago. And we still believe that it's an incredible strategic asset for us. You saw it last
year when we decided to make the purchase of MMI and we continue to monitor this cash balance. And for the time
being, we really believe that, that strategic asset has a ton of value.
So we'll continue to monitor it and we have a process by which we actually review it on a regular basis with the Board
and those questions are always asked. So we have a good governance process around it. But for now, in the time being,
we have nothing to announce on it.
Thank you, Carlos, for your question.

<A - Patrick Pichette>: Jamie, why don't we go to the next question, please?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Hi. Good afternoon and thank you. I was wondering, Larry, if you could walk us through
your view on Google's tablet strategy via Android and the relative importance of having success with these devices in
terms of achieving your long-term goals?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Heather, that's a great question. I think that we're very excited about
tablets. I think there's a number of Android tablets out there, obviously we have strong competition there as well. I
think you've seen us really invest substantially also in things like Google Play, which really gives you great access to
entertainment, media, books and videos and so on, as well as the apps. And we think that's an important component of
what we're doing.
I think there's also – obviously there's been a lot of success on some lower-priced tablets that run Android, maybe not
the whole Google version of Android but we definitely believe that there's going to be a lot of success at the lower end
of the market as well with lower-priced products that will be very significant. And it's definitely an area we think is
important and we're quite focused on.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks for your question, Heather. Let's go to the next question, please, Jamie.
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Hi. Thank you. I have one for Larry and one for Patrick. Larry, Android is obviously a key focus
you talk about a lot in your letters. Can you help us understand the strategic value for Google since you're not licensing
it? Do you see more revenue per device if it runs on Android? Or lower TAC? Or what else can you tell us about what
the real advantage to Google's Advertising business is?
And then Patrick, obviously hiring and CapEx in Q1 this year a lot lower than Q1 last year. Can you tell us if you factor
in your revenue growth when you make that spending decision; your outlook, does that give us any clues on your
outlook for revenue growth over the next couple of years? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Why don't I jump on the first one because mine, again, it is not a very strategic one, it's more
how we proceed. But it's lumpy because there's just timing decisions, right? We would – there's probably a few areas
where we would've liked to actually make investments in Q1 and for a bunch of logistics reasons or otherwise we
couldn't. And so – and you'll notice that's why there's kind of like $350 million difference between Q4 and Q1. And
you should just expect it to be lumpy. And that's just the nature of – data centers are kind of big and clunky and when
you buy some piece of real estate it's big and clunky, so there is quite a bit of variability into it.
And – but we're – again, I wouldn't take any one data point to start making a trend out of. So it's tough for – but I think
that you can see we're committed to capital. If you look at the last couple of years we've really made kind of significant
investments and we'll continue to do them because it's a real strategic asset to us as well.
I'll let Larry answer the first question.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, Justin, I think on your questions about Android, I think they're pretty short-term
focused and I think it's good to think about the longer-term issues. We don't get very many new operating systems, kind
of only a few in my lifetime, and I think they're pretty important. And I think Android is really about increasing the

pace of innovation, usage of mobile devices and our ability to get great user experiences out to our users, which I think
we're doing a great job of. I mentioned over 850,000 devices per day are going out. And it's important to remember,
we're very early stages of that. Like we've only – I'm amazed the computer that I'm carrying in my pocket is as good as
the one I had a few years ago on my desktop. And I think we're only at the very, very early stages of what's possible
with those devices. And I'm just excited about a whole bunch of things we're doing in that area.
We already mentioned the kind of things, like I said, I'm very bullish that CPCs will improve on mobile over desktop
due to all those capabilities. And so I think the benefits we get from Android are a lot, I mean obviously we have great
integration with our products in Search and Google+, and photo uploading, and there's a hundred things that we do
really well on Android that benefit across the board, our users across-the-board and our products across-the-board. I
think that's going to continue to be the case.
And I think that does lead to better economics for us too, because we're providing amazing experiences for people that
are well integrated and work well and they demand. So I'm very positive on all those things.

We'll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Lloyd Walmsley>: Great. Thanks for taking the call. Larry, just wondering as you look out very long-term, kind
of five-year view, do you see tablets taking perhaps a majority of home Internet usage? And if so, how strategically
imperative is it for Android to have a big success in the tablet space, given partner TAC could pose a high cost to the
extent Android doesn't have a hit?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, I mean I think I sort of already answered this question previously about tablets. Like I
said, I think it's an important area. I think your computing experience, obviously if you have an Android phone or use
Google online, you care about all those things in terms of your experience. And so I think it's – I think you're thinking
about your user experience, you're thinking about across all the devices you use.
I think people are going to get a lot more devices. We see kind of a convergence between all the services on those
devices. And right now I feel like each device you get is kind of a hassle to deal with and you're thinking about each
individual device and all the issues of it. And I think that, that's not really right. I think you're going to have a pretty
unified experience and a great experience from a user point of view, and you won't have to manage all these devices.
So I think you want to think about all these screens around you working seamlessly and working well for you. And I
think obviously tablets are important. We have Google TV, obviously big screens are important, computers are
important, phones are important. Everything, all those devices are important. And I expect that they'll work well
together. So I think that's kind of how we would think about it. I don't think any single device there is going to drive all
the usage or all the kind of convergence that needs to happen.
<Q - Lloyd Walmsley>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Lloyd. Jamie, let's go to the next question, please?

And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: I had a question for Nikesh. Can you give us an update on the growth rates you're seeing today in
your core Search business by small, medium and large advertiser tranches? I think you mentioned in the prepared

remarks that Japan had strong growth primarily due to smaller advertiser tranche? How does that growth look in the
various advertiser size buckets across your geos? And then is the speed of small advertiser adoption increasing right
now versus prior periods, given all the new local products that you have?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: I think the one way to think about it is that fundamentally we have one auction, and in that
auction, every advertiser participates, whether it's the small advertiser or the large advertiser. So the way we think
about it is that we try and go ahead and get more and more advertisers to see the benefit of online advertising and the
solutions that we offer. So as more and more advertisers come into the auction, it drives the price up of the auction for
both large and small advertisers.
So the way to think about it is that there's a price. We've talked about CPC and paid clicks, but it's really the third
variable that goes into it, how many advertisers we can bring into the auction? And how many various things can we
get them interested in, whether it's mobile, whether it's YouTube, whether it's display, whether it's search.
So there has been a lot of effort we've put in from our end both to get more small businesses online. We've been
running GXBO campaigns around the world where we get small businesses online. We've also been cleaning up our
signup flows for our AdWords product, which is a self-serve product where any small business can sign up. We have
been working on getting people to have more mobile sites and getting people launched on a mobile campaign.
So effectively it's a lot of effort towards getting more and more advertisers into the ecosystem and as that happens
around the world you will see seasonal patterns or some sort of spikes where we worked harder on small businesses in
one quarter in certain parts of the world. But eventually it all benefits the auction and we see the trend over time ends
up working the same way for large and small advertisers.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Nikesh. We'll take one last question and then we'll close the call. Jamie, can you give
us the last question, please?
Operator
Yes, sir. That final question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Thanks for fitting me in. Just had one question for Nikesh or whomever wants to
answer it. It seems like even though, as you're shifting to mobile, you have this presumably double-digit pricing step
down for CPCs. But in the display world certainly that pricing difference could be even more dramatic, in some cases
by half or two-thirds, prices getting cut on the shift to mobile.
So you guys at Google have the unique ability to compare and contrast the difference in price between like Search and
Display and how the two are monetizing relative to Desktop. And so any color on that comparison would be
appreciated because I think there are folks out there that have a view that actually Search, core Search, monetizes better
on the shift to mobile than Display does and I would love to just understand that better. Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, I mean, I guess let me try and explain to it from the advertiser perspective. So what we're
striving towards advertisers are interested in ROI. Advertisers actually are not interested in whether they're on the
mobile product, display product, the search product on the web or search products for mobile. So what we are fast
converging towards is we're basically sitting down and understanding ROI targets by advertisers and then we have
immense amounts of inventory at our behest whether it's mobile inventory or display or search or desktop inventory or
even inventory through our network. And what we are trying to work toward is being able to dynamically allocate
across these various products what allows them to get the maximum ROI. In that case, they are – they don't really care
about whether they got that transaction to happen off one platform, one format or the other. So that's what we want to
aspire to and that works really well in performance advertising because there is a specific objective the advertiser has.
On display, on brand it works slightly differently, obviously, because you're talking about CPM. But generally that's the
way to think about it. In the long term we think mobile will monetize better and we really don't see the difference
happening on display and search as you alluded to. Larry, do you want to add something?
