Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Good morning, and welcome to our conference call to discuss operating and financial results for
the second quarter of fiscal 2013. We're very pleased with the operating results at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight,
which continue to show improvement.
At FedEx Express, persistent weakness in the global economy and increasing demand for lower-yielding international
services limited profits during the quarter. Superstorm Sandy affected overall earnings as well.
At the October Investors and Lenders Meeting, we showed you plans to improve annual profitability by $1.7 billion
during the next three years with a significant portion of the benefits achieved by fiscal year 2015. I'm very confident
we're on our way to achieving this ambitious goal.
We're hard at work currently on another record-setting holiday shipping season, driven by the increasing popularity of
e-commerce. On Monday, December 17, team members moved about 19.8 million shipments through our various
systems around the world, a daily record. But overall holiday we believe volumes in our worldwide networks will
increase by more than 13% compared to last year. I'd like to say thank you to all our team members, especially those in
the areas affected by Sandy, for their hard work and dedication during this peak season.
Before I turn the call over to Mike Glenn for his views on the economy and Alan Graf for his analysis of the quarter, I'd
like to do two things. First, I'd like to thank Bill Margaritis, our Corporate Vice President of Communications, who will
be departing FedEx on December 31 after 16 years of service. Bill, we appreciate everything you've done for us during
your time here and look forward to seeing you often in the future.
Second, I'd like to congratulate FedEx Express for being recognized by the Great Place To Work Institute as among the
World's Top 10 Best Multinational Workplaces for the second year in a row. The ranking is the world's largest annual

study of workplace excellence and identifies the top 25 best multinationals in terms of workplace culture.
Now let me turn it over to Mike Glenn.
T. Michael Glenn
Thank you, Fred. I'm going to make a few brief comments regarding the economy, then give a summary of our yield
results and then finally a couple of comments on peak season.
We continue to see modest growth in the global economy with our forecast for U.S. GDP calling for 1.9% growth in
calendar year 2013. For industrial production, we expect a growth rate of 2.4% in calendar year 2013. This is slightly
lower than our prior forecast, primarily reflecting a lower entry point in FY 2013 due to Hurricane Sandy.
Our global GDP forecast is 2.5% in calendar year 2013. And finally, I just want to emphasize that the calendar year
2013 outlook could swing either direction depending upon policy outcomes, especially with the fiscal cliff issues in the
U.S. and certainly issues in Europe.
Turning to yield, in the domestic Express sector, excluding the impact of fuel year-over-year Express yields increased
2.5%, which was primarily driven by pricing and rate – rating and discount improvements. In the Ground segment,
again excluding the impact of fuel, our yields increased 2.9%, the year-over-year increase was driven by list and
discount improvements followed by an increase in extra services charges.
Excluding fuel, in the international export Express segment, package yields declined 3.8% year-over-year due to a
change in product mix, rate and discounts and weight changes as well as the impact of exchange rate. And finally,
excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight increased 1.9% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by
pricing rate changes.
And as noted in our recently released peak day volume forecast, FedEx expected to handle more than 19 million
packages on Monday, December 10. FedEx not only exceeded our forecast on the 10, but we also handled more than 19
million packages on Monday, November 26, which was Cyber Monday and Monday, December 17. The heavy volume
was driven primarily by e-commerce sales, which consist of lighter-weight lower-yielding residential delivery
packages, and our team both at Express and Ground will work very closely with our largest e-commerce and
multi-channel retail customers to deliver outstanding service during this peak season.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter earnings of $1.39 per share, which includes an
$0.11 per share hit from Superstorm Sandy, reflects the strength of FedEx Ground and SmartPost, continuing
improvement at FedEx Freight and the current trends at FedEx Express.
As we said in October at our Investors and Lenders Meeting, we are committed to delivering improved profitability and
shareholder returns and in addition to a review of the quarter and outlook for the second half of fiscal year 2013, I will
comment on our progress toward delivering on our profit improvement plans.
So, let's first review segment results for the quarter and we'll start with Ground. Ground's strong revenue growth from
e-commerce and market share gains continues to expand our network and increase our capabilities. New volume
milestones were reached for the second quarter as SmartPost moved over 2 million packages per day and Ground
delivered over 4 million packages per day.
On Cyber Monday, November 26, Ground moved 8.7 million packages and SmartPost 6.1 million packages. Ground's
operating income increased 4% to $412 million in the quarter, primarily due to 8% higher volume together with yield
growth, partially offset by network expansion costs.

Operating margin did decrease in the quarter, primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and higher purchase
transportation cost related to increased fuel expense. Operating income at Ground was also negatively impacted by
Sandy.
At Freight, we are continuing to benefit from the leverage gained by integrating our networks and differentiating our
service by offering priority and economy choices for our customers, plus increasing our use of rail.
Freight's operating income for the quarter improved significantly, up $36 million from a year ago to $76 million, as a
result of LTL yield growth and increased average daily LTL shipments along with ongoing improvements and
operational efficiencies in our integrated network. Freight's results were also negatively impacted by Sandy.
Turning to Express, continuing weakness in global markets and customers choosing slower lower-yielding services are
ongoing trends as we continue to adjust our network. Operating income and operating margin decreased in the quarter,
due to the demand shift toward lower-yielding international services, the negative impact of year-over-year net fuel
changes, increased depreciation expense, the impact of Sandy and higher pension costs. These were partially offset by
favorable impact of cost-containment actions, which Dave Bronczek will talk to you about in detail.
Operating income and margins were also negatively impacted by ongoing investments in integrating recent acquisitions
into the Express network. Fuel had a negative impact on operating income in Q2 based on a static analysis of the net
impact of year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to year-over-year changes in fuel surcharges. Fuel costs
increased 3% during the quarter to an increase in the average price per gallon of fuel. Meanwhile, the weighted average
U.S. fuel surcharge for the quarter decreased 1.7 percentage points versus last year.
In October, we announced programs targeting annual profitability improvement of $1.7 billion during the next three
years with a significant portion of the benefits to be achieved by the end of FY 2015. The majority of the profitability
improvement will come from initiatives at Express and Services and include cost reductions in selling, general and
administrative functions through head count reductions, streamlining the processes and elimination of less essential
work.
Also, modernization of our aircraft fleet, transformation of U.S. domestic operations and international profit
improvements in Express and also improved efficiencies and lower costs of information technology at Services.
Our overall profit improvement plan includes offering voluntary cash buyouts to eligible U.S.-based employees
beginning in February of 2013. Cost of the benefits provided under the voluntary programs will be recognized in the
period that eligible employees accept their offers, which will be predominantly in Q4 of this fiscal year. We expect the
pre-tax cost of the voluntary buyout program to range from $550 million to $650 million, but actual cost will depend on
employee acceptance rates. Eligible employees will vacate positions in three phases to ensure a smooth transition.
Employees in the first phase will vacate their positions on May 31, 2013.
These programs, combined with continued profit improvements in Ground and Freight are expected to increase
margins, improved cash flows and increase our competitiveness. The ultimate cost and savings from our profit
improvement initiatives will depend upon other things on a number of employees that participate in the voluntary cash
buyout program and the timing and execution of these programs. We expect to begin realizing the benefits of these
programs in FY 2014 and anticipate these savings will be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2015.
Our capital expenditures for the Corporation are expected to be approximately $3.9 billion in 2013 and include
spending for aircraft and related equipment at Express, facility projects at Express and Ground and vehicle replacement
at all our transportation segments.
In December, Express entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase four incremental 767 freighters to be
delivered in 2015. As part of that agreement Express is also deferring the delivery of two firm 777 freighter orders for
one year from 2015 to 2016.
Turning now to the outlook and based on the economic outlook for the year as Mike described, we are expecting
diluted earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.45 for the third quarter. We reaffirm our guidance of $6.20 to $6.60 per

diluted share for the year, which does not include charges related to our voluntary cash buyout program. Our outlook
also assumes that the U.S. does not go off to fiscal cliff and into a recession. For the second half of fiscal 2013, we are
assuming a slightly higher effective tax rate of approximately 37%.

And with that, we will now open the floor for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes, good morning. Let's see, I wanted to ask a bit, Alan about the, you had quite a bit
of helpful commentary following up in the October meeting, kind of reviewing some of the drivers on the broader
improvement program. If you're taking this charge in fourth quarter, it would imply that you have significant amount of
the head count that would be out in fiscal 2014. Is that primarily related to the SG&A cost savings, the – I think $500
million total that you had identified, and how would we think about that? Is it reasonable to think that you could realize
a fair bit of that cost savings given the timing of your buyout program?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Tom, thanks for the question. At the Investors and Lenders Meeting, we had thought that the
buyout would be as people departed. We have since done a lot of further accounting research and have determined that
we will take the charges upon the signing of the execution of the voluntary buyouts, no matter when people depart. So
that's why we will expect most of the charges to occur in 2013.
We are working very hard on our reorganization plans. We think we know within a pretty good tolerance range of how
many people are going to accept it and where they will be and how we will address that, but until we actually get
through February, it's going to be very difficult for me to quantify how much in fiscal 2014 that we will be able to put
to the bottom line as we determine how long we'll have to retain people to ensure the smooth transition. It will be
significant, but I would look for most of the benefits from the voluntary buyout to be realized in fiscal 2015 and I will
say the same thing for the profit improvement program at Express. We've already started it there. Dave will talk about
it.
In fact, I'll just turn it over to him and let him talk about it as part of this. We've already started that, we've saved a lot
of money already and we're well on our road, I would just say, to sum up, we are very confident about reaching the
$1.7 billion profit improvement program by fiscal 2016, and I think as the deeper we get into this, the more confident
that we are. Now let me have Dave talk a little bit about the profit improvement.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah. Thanks, Alan. And that's correct. We're very optimistic that the 5-point plan that we
presented is going exceptionally well. SG&A, as Alan pointed out, a big part of it is at Express. This quarter, I should
go back to and I'll talk about expenses in a minute here. Significantly, it was affected this quarter, our profits and our
margins, by Superstorm Sandy was a big part of the $0.11 was at Express.
Another big part of it significantly was at fuel that Alan pointed out, although it seemed like it would be a positive, it
was a negative significantly. Pension, and then the fourth point that you may not pick up, it's in our purchase
transportation is our new acquisitions, sits in that purchase transportation number. It's a big negative number. That's a
short term obviously until you get these new acquisitions rolling. So, you have those significant headwinds in our
profits and our margins this quarter. Going forward, we're very optimistic that those margins and profits improve.
But on the expense side even in this quarter, our FTEs were down 1,736, over 2%. Our fuel usage was down, thanks to
our great programs we put into air operations. Aircraft maintenance was down, even though our pounds were up. So,

pounds were up across the world, a lot of them being International Economy, which I'll talk about a little bit later
because it's a new network design we're putting in for that lower-yielding international traffic to be in a much more
cost-effective network going forward. That's part of our 5-point plan. So, we're feeling very good about our 5-point
plan. We actually had a quarter that would have significantly looked better had those four initiatives not hit all at one
time. So, going forward, we're very optimistic.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Rob on for Justin. I guess, Dave, as a follow-up to your
comments related to the various cost initiatives at Express, you guys had called out, I think, roughly $350 million at the
Investor Day, which you weren't including in that $1.7 billion of cost initiatives that you were targeting for fiscal 2013.
Can you give us a sense how much of that actually showed up in the earnings this quarter? Just given the headwinds
from Sandy, earnings were a bit better. So, I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of those cost initiatives are now
kind of showing up in the bottom line.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, that's a good question because if it wasn't for Sandy, a lot more would have shown up
and we actually did reduce our FTEs in our U.S. transformation number that you're talking about, the $350 million,
would have been significantly better, you would have seen it a lot more dramatic. But it's in our U.S. domestic
transformation program that you are talking about. We are going after those costs in a lot of different areas; attrition, of
course, redesigning the network; and even with Sandy, we still had pretty good improvement on our FTEs. Alan?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Rob, let me just add to that, that we're building momentum, and while I know that a lot of people
don't like my outlook for the third quarter, we did keep the year the same, because we expect the momentum to build
through Q3 and we will really start to see the impact of this at Express in the Q4 results for Express and for the
Corporation and then on into fiscal 2014. So, momentum is there. It does take a while to get everything. Once we've
made the plans executed, you've got, for example, bid packs with the pilots; you've got attrition that you have to let
happen; we've got to continue to go through the reorganization for the G&A that we're doing, but strong momentum
building and you'll see it in Q4.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: And one last thing on the four 767s. Obviously, it's accretive to more operating profits and
margins. It's a positive MIRR as well, and it's all part of one of those five pillars that I pointed out in our fleet
modernization as well.
Operator
And our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
<Q - Nate Brochmann>: Morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit on the International side. Obviously, there
continues to be some trade down there, but yet, kind of saw some uptick in volumes. I was wondering how much of
that might be market share gains from your competitors' disruption over there maybe with their big deal. I'm just
separating that as well as with just improved activity over there?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. Market share data trails, so it would be premature to make definitive
statements regarding market share gains at this time; although, we have seen strong performance – stronger
performance out of the Asia Pacific region, and certainly strong performance out of Europe.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I would also add that our European organic expansion plan is right on target. Our strategic
business case there looks very good, despite the weak economy over there. They're executing on it very well. As you
know, we've made important acquisitions in Poland and France, and we will continue to roll that out and we're very
pleased with the progress.

<A - David J. Bronczek>: And just one last point. You've seen on our numbers. International Priority, which is also
International Priority Distribution where a lot of our high-tech customers use that product, grew at 3%; International
Economy grew at 14%. So, going forward, there is a big opportunity for us there to put those packages in the right
network for improving our profits.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Dave G. Ross>: Yes, good morning, everyone. Can you talk a little bit about the company's exposure to the U.S.
housing market? The housing market seems to have bottomed and has gotten better this year. Is there assumed more
upside surprise in 2013, could you talk a little bit about how each of the different segments might benefit from that?
<A - William J. Logue>: Yeah, I think from the – this is – David, this is Bill Logue. On the Freight side of the
business as the housing recovery comes around, obviously that's a big role in the Freight side of the business. So,
whether we – in the quarter we saw some good volume movement through November – October, November pretty
healthy for us. So, again, helped our results. And again, as we see continued improvement going forward, then there's
significant upside for us on the Freight side.
Now as we go into our Q3 side of the business, obviously we have a – two less operating days in this quarter – in our
third quarter which is December, January, February is the most challenging quarter, because it's – in the LTL space, it's
three challenging months, that plus two less days. So, as we work through Q3, our objective is to stay focused on
continuing to build on our base business, continue our efficiencies, and very focused on our contract renewals which
we are in a very heavy part of our season right now and prepare us to run efficient through Q3 as best we can with the
challenges of other volume during this period and get us ready for Q4. So, again, if housing continues we'll see the
benefit of that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Dahlman Rose.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just on – some press
reports a couple of weeks ago on this recent lawsuit over charges in your network. Can you just address that or how we
should think about that? Thank you.
<A - Christine P. Richards>: Hi, Helen. It's Chris Richards. This case was filed on February 2011 and received some
recent media attention. We deny the allegations in this complaint, it had to do with an assertion that we weren't
properly paying – we were improperly charging for residential surcharges, which of course we have a very subtle
process where customers, if they have this concern can note from their invoice that they have it and we'll address those
issues.
I have to tell you, it's not uncommon for plaintiffs' counsel where they have a situation where a case may be disposed of
on preliminary motions for them to go to the media and attempt to bring forward negative facts in the media, and we're
not going to try this case in the media.
So, just want to bring it to the attention of all of our customers that we note on our invoices when a residential
surcharge has been applied. We take seriously and address any concern that's raised about those charges. We have a
good process in place to make sure we are doing this correctly.
But, on the other hand, this isn't a perfect science. And if you drive around your town, you'll probably find some places
where houses that used to be filled with families are now the locations for beauty salons and Mexican restaurants and
other kinds of things and so, it's a changing situation that we address through our various data sources. So, that's where
we are, it's very preliminary stage and we can't be accountable for plaintiffs' lawyers' actions.

Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Good morning. I'm wondering if you can provide some context on the airfreight
dynamics without giving specific numbers in the quarter, can you talk directionally about how trends trended. It sounds
as though November airfreight was healthy after being weak for the five months prior and can you talk a little bit about
trade lanes in terms of that dynamic and maybe what you're seeing from a near-term perspective, whether you do have
the sense that airfreight fundamentals globally have started to bottom or if there is still too much uncertainty to make
any sort of claims? So, any sort of color on that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Well, I'll start, this is Dave Bronczek. The airfreight out of Asia Pacific is doing quite well.
A lot of it is our high-tech customers, obviously this time of the year, there isn't a shift, however, we think in the overall
market that has more Express on the high-end and more Freight, i.e., type of traffic on the low-end, so it's actually
going to play into our network very well. So, our volumes were up out of the Asia-Pacific, they're also up out of
Europe. So, we are actually seeing some positive trends from our key customers in our market segment. Mike?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Yeah, I was just going to highlight, as Dave mentioned, as most people want to know during
the quarter, there were several high-tech product releases that certainly benefited the market overall and FedEx, and
those don't happen every quarter, but certainly we've benefited from that during the quarter.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith speaking. On our Investor Relations website, you can read a
speech, which I gave in May at the Wing's Club. That gives a comprehensive look of our views about the international
cargo business from the Express sector through the commodity airfreight or traditional airfreight business down to
ocean freight, and you'll see that over the last several years, particularly since the Great Recession, there have been
major systemic changes, and I'd commend that work to you because it gives a more comprehensive answer to the
question you just asked.
Operator
Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Yeah, Fred, maybe I can ask you, just follow-up a little bit on that, we hear a lot about
near-sourcing of manufacturing back to North America. Obviously, FedEx serves all those places, but we also hear that
International Priority Freight is some of the best Freight on the network. So, maybe what are the puts and takes there?
Is it a good thing if we get near-sourcing back here for FedEx? Or is that more of a challenge as a secular shift?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, we're in all these sectors. It's just really an issue of managing the capacity and
putting the right traffic in the right network. And I think over the last couple of years, as Dave mentioned, customers
have opted to trade a bit of speed for a lower price, but that's fine. We just have to make sure that the economy traffic is
moved in the appropriate network and we are moving a lot – moving in on the ground more as opposed to flying it as
much. So, it's more drive-fly-drive rather than – and then fly-fly. So, that takes some time.
One of the things that we're most excited about in the last couple of years, and perhaps Dave can talk a bit more about
this, we bought a terrific company in Mexico which will be a major beneficiary of near sourcing trends, we got a great
team down there and it's going very well. So, we're prepared on either side for continued growth across the Pacific, and
I think the sector that we pioneered, the door-to-door Express will be the growth area and we're also well situated for
near sourcing. Dave?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: That's exactly right, Fred. We have a great company in Mexico. We come across the border
now in trucks when it gets near sourced and that's a great question or it's Indonesia or it's in China or it's in Austin,
Texas. Those customers are telling us in advance where they're moving to and we align our network to that.

Our next question comes from Christian Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Yeah, hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. I was maybe wondering if we could touch a little bit
on the fuel surcharge in the purchase transportation of maybe the Sandy allocation within Express. Just trying to get a
better sense of maybe what the underlying kind of earnings power of the segment is right now and how you think about
that ex-some of those items? Just a little bit more color there would be very helpful.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, as we grow FedEx Trade Networks, our purchase transportation costs are going to increase
because they're all – that's all purchase transportation. FedEx Trade Network is a very important part of our strategy. It
goes back to the last couple of questions, where we're getting bigger in ocean and we are also getting bigger in
forwarded air traffic on a small basis now, but hope to be larger as we go where we can't justify flying an entire aircraft.
That's an important part of our strategy.
Also with acquisitions, there's a lot of purchase transportation in acquisitions and acquisitions when you first make
them, you have two costs that you have to deal with, particularly in the first year. One is, you can't capitalize the cost of
the acquisitions anymore. Those are expensed immediately and secondarily, you have integration costs as we hook
those acquisitions into our international network. We know that going upfront. We have a strategic business case on all
of these, we have to understand that. But as we get them tucked in and up and running and FedEx branded, 18 months
down the road they start to payoff. So, those are the answers there.
As to the fuel, you have to remember about the fuel surcharge, you have to remember what happened a year ago in
terms of those lag between the surcharge and the price and what happened this year, so a lot of people thought, we'd
have a tailwind, we actually had a headwind. As our fuel price variance was significantly higher than year-over-year
and our surcharge revenue was basically flat across the enterprise.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Sal Vitale>: Good morning. Sal Vitale on for Jeff Kauffman. Just looking at some of the trends in the Express
business volume-wise, was there anything in terms of easier comps this quarter? If we look at the trend over the last
few quarters, you had the – the May quarter was down about 3% year-over-year. August was up about 1.5% and then
you had up 6% in the November quarter. Is there anything there we should be looking at?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: I don't think there is anything in beneficial in that regard. I think to the contrary,
we're still lapping the one large customer to cell phone industry that I mentioned last order which moved the traffic out
of the Express network into the Home and SmartPost – Ground and SmartPost network. So that is still a headwind for
us in the Express sector. So, what we've seen is stronger numbers, obviously we've been benefiting from e-commerce to
some degree and specific opportunities with other customers. But it's more – I would say, it's more of a headwind than
a tailwind that we're dealing with.

Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, I want to understand on the Ground side, we saw nice
acceleration in the volume growth and wondering what's driving that. Are you hearing from customers? Do you think

you're taking maybe a little bit of share or accelerated share ahead of UPS' Teamsters contract next year? And then on
the expense side at Ground, you talked about expansion costs and higher contractor costs. Maybe give a little bit of
color there and should we think about those as ongoing in the next few quarters?
<A - David F. Rebholz>: Okay, Scott, this is Dave Rebholz. There is no question that with our value proposition and
the quality of the service that we are performing, that we are taking some level of share. It would absolutely be
ridiculous to not think that we're not doing that.
All up, our customers are pointing out to us what's valuable, what's important. We have picked up a number of
significant customers that have obviously stated concerns over the UPS situation. But I don't think that's the primary
driver in this, otherwise I think we would see a heck of a lot of more volume coming on board in the short-term. So, I
think we're absolutely winning the game over the long run.
In terms of the cost structure, it's just basic fundamentals here. We – Alan already mentioned the net fuel position that
we were in. We are all in the position of the legging factor which will benefit us going forward. We put on a significant
– and you follow us very closely – we put on a significant amount of expansion that comes on in this particular quarter
in anticipation of the peak volumes that we have to handle, which Mike already told you were record level days. My
peers laugh at me when I say, it's kind of like the fishes and loaves, because the days are unique, dramatic and we're
handling it at incredible levels of performance.
So, I am very, very pleased with our team and I would like to go on the record for saying the level of dedication and
commitment, not only from our own employees, but from our contractors is second to none. So, all up, those are really
the two big issues in this quarter; fuel and expansion. We anticipated it and we're looking forward for the years to
come, in particular, the second half, because I think we've got headway to play this thing out. I have no idea what the
situation is with UPS and their contract. All I know is, we've got customers that are coming on for the long term.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Happy holidays. Good morning. Dave, can I just follow-up on the Ground side there.
It seemed like yields also seemed to take a deceleration, not a decline but maybe slowing over what we've seen the last
few quarters. Is it getting more competitive in terms of getting those in that business? Or is, I guess maybe is
e-commerce having a greater impact? I know you just highlighted expansion in fuel, but is the rapid growth of
e-commerce impacting your margin capabilities, is it growth of SmartPost or anything else that's going on within the
network that we should think about? Thanks.
<A - David F. Rebholz>: Ken, the issue here is that as we have moved into this peak season the acceleration of
e-commerce is very real. You don't have to look at FedEx to understand what's going on out there in the marketplace
with our largest retail customers and their customers. It appears that there's been a lot of pent-up demand from us, we as
consumers, and so ordering online is the most convenient way to do business. So, I don't think that trend is going to
change.
The economics on yield, we were over-yield as was already articulated by Alan in our press release. That's not to say
that the larger the customers and as the mix changes that we could not envision some sort of yield risk as a function of
customer mix, not as a function of rate, okay? So, I think we're in a very healthy position, and all I can tell you is, is
that the growth is and the demand is very strong. And yes, it is true, and I'll let Mike comment on it, our largest
customers are seeing record years.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Ken, I just want to highlight a couple of points. I certainly agree with what Dave is saying,
but I want you to focus on the fact that FedEx has been leading the industry in terms of overall yield improvement and
our yield management and our sales team, along with our revenue management team has done an outstanding job of
managing our yields in the various quarters over the last couple of years.

Our objective as I stated at the Investor and Lenders Meeting is to balance our yield improvement along with volume
growth to maximize profitability for each operating company and we work very closely with the operating companies
to make sure that we accomplish that.
Certainly, during quarters leading up to – or the quarter leading up to the peak season, we do see a changing customer
mix. As Dave noted, which does put some pressure on the yield, but our long-term objective is to balance yield
improvements and volume growth to maximize our profits and that's what we're focused on. So, some quarters you're
going to see yields a little higher, some quarters you're going to see yields a little lower, but the key is improving our
profits.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good morning, everyone. And this question might kind of be a follow-up for
you Mike or maybe Dave Bronczek. But when we look at yields in Express as well, is that being challenged anyway
domestically by what your peers doing with these new Saver products that they've introduced over the last few
quarters? And with the declining volume environment, what are some things that you're doing to try to push better
pricing outcomes looking forward?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Our yield strategy, I can tell you is independent of what our primary competitor is doing. As
I said before, our objective here is to balance our yield improvement along with volume growth to maximize our
profitability. We worked very closely with our Express company to identify opportunities whether that would be on a
lane segment basis or out of a particular market or region to grow our services. We've had a lot of new contract
negotiations that have come up in the quarter and we work again very closely to make sure that we're getting the level
of contribution that we need to get. What's really driving a lot of the yield issues in the market in general in Express is
the growth in e-commerce. And again, as I stated at that Investor and Lenders meeting, our SmartPost and Home
Delivery services are ideal for growth in SmartPost; and at the same time, we are being more selective in the Express
segment when pursuing e-commerce opportunities. Certainly, Express benefited during the quarter from strong
e-commerce results, but we are more selective in that regard and perhaps more selective than our primary competitor.
Operator
Our next question comes from Art Hatfield with Raymond James.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question going back to the profit improvement
initiatives and the cost saves that will come. Alan, in your comments you talked about some of the savings in next
fiscal year and then most of the benefits being in place by the end of fiscal 2015. Is it right way for us to think about it?
I know you can't pinpoint all of this at this point in time. But if this occurs, will it be something that will come in a
stair-step function or will it accrue smoothly over the quarters as you start to see those benefits kick in?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I think it will be a combination. There'll be small stair-steps, but it'll mostly be momentum that
will drive this. Again, we are talking about thousands of people here. So, as we reorganize around that with a very
limited backfill behind that, we have to space these folks out. So, there'll be May, then there'll be some August, and
then there'll probably be some November and then there'll be some in next May, and I don't have clear visibility of that
except I know where we'll be in fiscal 2015 with pretty good certainty.
So, we don't have a lot more to say about this over the next couple of calls, Art, because I have a lot better knowledge
after we actually go through the process. We've told our employees what the voluntary buyout is. We want them to
think about it over the holidays and talk with their families. We want to do this the right way and I'm confident that
we'll get where we need to be.

Our next question comes from Peter Nesvold with Jefferies & Company.
<Q - Elliott Waller>: Hi. Good morning. It's Elliott Waller on for Peter. Congratulations on a good quarter. Just
continuing in the cost savings, just questions for you, just how many people approximately were offered the buyout and
your charges that you spoke of in the next quarter? How many people does that assume ballpark estimate in terms of
accept those buyouts and then should we expect charges going forward into fiscal 2014? Thank you.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Elliott, most of the voluntary buyouts offered are at FedEx Express and FedEx Services. There'll
be a significantly large population, but I'm not going to get into details of numbers. As I said, we expect it to be in
thousands of those who will take the voluntary buyout and I've given a number between $550 million and $650 million.
We will book the majority of that in the fourth quarter as contracts are signed as opposed to spreading that out. So, we
will have most of the voluntary buyout – will be in fiscal 2013. There will be some continuing costs associated with the
program that will go into fiscal 2014, but they will not be material compared to the savings that we'll see in 2014. So,
we'll have a plus in fiscal 2014. I just can't tell you how big it is today, but I will certainly give you some indication at
our next call and then we'll have a great definitive answer for you when we report our year-end earnings.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: We have a question from [ph] Andrew Meister (47:24). Are you actually trying to
affect churning freight from one network to another for the long-term benefit of both FDX and your customers and how
do you affect such changes if so?
The reality is, we don't affect those changes; the customers affect the changes, and it depends on a number of factors,
but again, referencing the Wing's Club speech, what you'll see is one of the most important element in the
transportation market over the last decade is the increased price of fuel.
From 2001 to 2011, the price of diesel and jet fuel went up about 4.5 times. So, that by itself drives people to make
price-service trade-offs, and obviously the more expensive Express transportation is more energy-intensive, because it's
built around aviation, and it drives people to make decisions.
Second is the relationship of value per pound of the product that's being shipped. Mike mentioned a cell phone
provider, I think it was a communications company and they moved from Express to SmartPost, well what happened
there is, cell phones went from being exotic expensive devices to much lower-cost commodities and so the need to
move them with the same speed requirement declined, that's happened to a lot of the electronics trade across the Pacific
and they may be moved in air transportation for a product release, but over time as the value per pound of the product
goes down, they might move to ocean transport, so it's a dynamic process and we are not doing this, it's a function of
what the customers want. And we then have to be prepared, as we are, to efficiently handle it and that's what the FedEx
portfolio does, we can handle near sourcing or Trans-Pacific, we can handle the most economical shipment in our
Ground and SmartPost network or the defibrillator for the surgery tomorrow for First Overnight delivery.
Now, I do think that the rapidity with some of these changes over the last few years has been something that we've had
to deal with and that's what we talked about in the Investors and Lenders Meeting. And the reality is that things didn't
come back the same way after the big recession as everybody thought they would. And so, clearly the voluntary buyout
and the new networks that Dave Bronczek are putting in place are reflecting what customers want. So, that's the answer
to how traffic churns in the network, it's not us, it's the customers and the macroeconomic environment and the input
cost, particularly the price of fuel.

Our next question comes from Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Patrick C. Geekie>: Hey, this is actually Patrick Geekie on for Chris. We haven't talked too much about Freight
thus far in the call. So, I want to see if you could elaborate on the current competitive environment and in particular
pricing, that you're seeing right now in the market? Thank you.

<A - William J. Logue>: Okay, Chris – this is – or Patrick, this is Bill Logue. The – I would say from a competitive
perspective, obviously, the market is a very competitive market. There is a – on the pricing side, again, pricing remains
rational. Obviously, the contract renewals and pricing is – gets a little more challenging as you go through this time of
year with the volume levels where they are. So again, we're seeing some of that in the market space. But overall, we're
happy with where we're positioned in the market space. Customers are responding. As you saw, our volume growth
continues on both volume and yield growth, so we're getting yield improvements, and we're getting volume. And the
customers are using both services, which is, again, the value that we put out with our new design model. So, from that
perspective, I think we're in good shape.
And I said earlier, we're going through a – our Q3 is a challenging quarter. So again, I want to make sure that, that's
something we're very focused on and building through Q3 to get us right into a – our strongest quarter, which is Q4. So,
from the market's perspective, challenging as we go into this time of year, but I think – and I'll let Mike comment on
some of the yield initiatives.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, as Bill indicated, when you're dealing with softness in the economy and you have the
number of competitors that we are facing in the LTL industry, there is certainly opportunity to see more aggressive
pricing, but I would reiterate what Bill said. I would consider the market rational. I think our team has done an
outstanding job, again, working with the Freight operating company, selectively, being aggressive where appropriate
and at the same time, being focused on improving our yields. And as I stated before, without the impact of fuel, our
yields went up 1.9% during the quarter, which I would characterize as very solid performance.

Our next question comes from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Good morning. Thank you. Just a couple of questions tied to the head count reduction. So,
it's $550 million to $600 million in charges that equates to about a $300 million run rate benefit that begins in May of
2013, did I get those numbers and timing correct?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, I didn't comment on the run rate in 2014 and I'm not going to, but you got the fourth quarter
charges correct.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey, guys. Just a quick question, it looks like we're getting very good volume growth in
the Ground segment, 8% and 17% in SmartPost, perhaps maybe not as much operating leverage as you'd expect in the
business with that kind of volume. There were some comments about network expansion costs and Hurricane Sandy
and stuff like that. Could you help us to understand what level of non-recurring costs might be in that Ground result for
the quarter?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, I'm not going to comment specifically on the specific numbers, but what we
were trying to point out to you is every year, we have expansion costs in this quarter because lead time, when we're
bringing on capacity in anticipation of peak.
In terms of the fuel, that's relatively public information. It's – you've got to be looking at what those fuel trends are. All
up, I didn't think that our return on that growth rate was a bad number, so I'm not sure what else I can add to that, but I
would ask Alan if he wanted to comment on it beyond that.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I think Dave told you earlier about our biggest customers who are having seasons that are higher
than they even forecasted, and so, that means that we had to add late additional capacity in November and in December
to be able to handle the volume surges that we had not planned or forecasted and still make service commitments that

given you the numbers.
But having said that, knock on wood, the weather's been pretty good; and I think we'll have a great Service week this
week, and expect that we will continue our expansion at Ground. And we'll have to have some of the things that we're
dealing with next year, so there's a little bit of that in there. But generally speaking, the margins in Ground are solid,
and they're going to stay solid, and their growth's going to continue.
