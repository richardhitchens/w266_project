During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies.
In today's earnings release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP as well as pro forma results for 2011. The pro
forma results reflect the acquisition of certain cable systems in 2011 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2011, unless
otherwise noted. The year-over-year growth rates we will be referring to this morning are on a pro forma basis.
Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. The presentation that
accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under Financial Information. The press release
and trending schedules are also posted on our website under Investor & News Center.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. For the second quarter of 2012, we delivered revenue
growth of nearly 5% year over year, increased adjusted EBITDA 2.7% and generated free cash flow of $26 million.
Video relationships declined, reflecting typical seasonal second quarter seasonality, but the trend for all products
improved compared to the prior year. Our fundamental objectives haven't changed since we last reported. We're
enhancing our video product and overall customer experience using our superior Internet product, coupled with video
and voice, to drive relationships and growing our commercial business.
As we entered the second half of 2012, we improved our product set, particularly video. We accelerated the expansion
of our HD offering with over 100 channels now available in substantially all of our footprint. We will progressively go
all digital in the next two years and, since April, we're actively selling digital only. And we want that digital experience
on each TV set and an HD on every HD set. With the changes we've made, Charter now has a strong video product
relative to any other video provider.
In addition, our Internet offer now start to 30 meg, a speed that is 10 times faster than DSL and faster than U-verse can
go, is currently constructed. And we packaged it in a high-value offering that ensures that rich experience on each TV
and drives uptake of all three products, including our fully featured voice product, all at an attractive price.
The goals of our new pricing and packaging strategy are to drive deeper penetration of our services into the home with
a simple, compelling offer structure; drive higher ARPU per connect, which will increase over time; lower our
transaction cost per customer by reducing customer touch points, a number of follow-on transactions; extending
customer lifetime through lower churn; and, ultimately, increase operating cash flow and drive return on investment.
In the short term, customer connects revenue and operating expenses will be impacted by the transition to new selling
methods and operating practices. And we expect to see some pressure in the second half of this year. In addition, our
capital spend will reflect that higher growth and deeper product penetration in the home, but the increase will be
entirely success based.
In the last quarter, we increased our CPE spend to ensure that we were ready to accommodate higher anticipated set-top
box placement in third and fourth quarters. I'm pleased to say that we're seeing success with our new strategy. It's still
very early, but thus far, we've seen a much higher uptake on triple play, with the sell-in rate on video connects more
than doubling.
At the beginning of the third quarter, we also implemented a number of changes designed to enable us to operate more
effectively, to provide our customers with better service and to improve our ability to roll out new products over time.
We reorganized field operations into four regions, with a shift in responsibilities and accountability to better service our
customers' needs. We're centralizing our network management structure to ensure consistent service levels and change
management throughout our operations. We've revamped our go-to-market strategy from targeting to selling methods.
And we're continuing to focus on improving the service we provide our customers in all aspects of the business, which

is critical.
Whether it's sales, marketing or field operations, we're making series of structural and tactical changes, which I expect
will have a cumulative effect on better service, low churn and higher sales. And, of course, we continue to focus on
product development. But near term, our main objectives are to run a top-notch operation, deliver high-value,
competitive packages and provide high-quality customer service. This will take time, but it is designed to drive
sustainable, long-term growth and has a clear, demonstrated return on investment.
I'll now turn it over to Chris to give more details on the second quarter.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4, looking at Q2 customer and ARPU trends on the
residential slide. Video customers decreased 66,000 in the second quarter, an improvement over last year's Q2 decline
of 79,000. In addition to seasonality, as Tom mentioned, we ceased active marketing of analogue service during the
quarter. This had some short-term impact on video customer acquisition. But offering a fully featured video service will
benefit us long term.
We grew Internet customers by 29,000, some 60% higher than the gain in the prior-year second quarter, as we
continued to see success with our superior data product. And we're making it even more competitive. For phone, we
added 6,000 customers during the quarter. It's early on, but we're seeing very positive phone results in Q3 from the new
pricing and packaging.
In the second quarter, Charter generated top line growth of $85 million or 4.7% year on year, shown on Slide 5. In the
residential business, year over year grew – Internet revenue 10.2%, driven by a 291,000 increase in customers and
modest ARPU uplift. We increased phone revenue 1.9%, driven by 75,000 customer additions, offset by slightly lower
ARPU year over year. I expect this rate volume trend to deepen under our new offer structure. The focus is on ARPU
per-customer relationship and single ARPU – single-product ARPU become increasingly relevant to evaluating
performance.
For video, revenue was down 0.7% in the quarter, due to customer losses over the past 12 months, which has improved.
From a revenue standpoint, we expect video to be the largest beneficiary of the product improvements, new offers and
operating strategies over time, both from a penetration and ARPU perspective.
On the commercial side, we drove 21% growth in revenue, reflecting strength in our small and medium business
service offerings, and also in the carrier space. Excluding video, commercial revenue increased nearly 26%.
We continue to see significant opportunity in the commercial space, with a long runway for growth. And we're making
investments to capitalize on the opportunity in our footprint. In the second quarter, for – ad sales rose nearly 15%,
predominantly reflecting increased political spend.
So looking at Slide 7, we grew adjusted EBITDA 2.7% year on year. As a reminder, we had some net-positive one-time
adjustments in the second quarter of last year, which put approximately $4 million of pressure on the year-over-year
comparison this quarter.
The key expense drivers within the quarter were programming expenses, which rose $25 million or 5.3% year over
year; higher marketing expenses, driven by increased media investment and commercial marketing, which ties into the
higher residential and commercial customer growth.
Marking costs were up $20 million in the quarter year on year but, excluding the one-time benefit recognized in the
prior-year quarter, increased by $13 million. And finally, a $22 million increase in other expenses. When you sort
through the puts and takes, the key drivers for those expenses were labor, including sales force and benefits, increased
preventive maintenance levels on the network and reconnect expenses for higher reconnect mix percentages and
volume.

Moving to CapEx on Slide 8. Q2 capital totaled $468 million, $144 million higher than last year. The increase was
driven by three key areas: $63 million higher spend on CPE to support increased installation, and, as Tom mentioned,
appropriate inventory levels to accommodate higher CPE placement expected in the second half of the year.
Approximately 60% of the $63 million year-over-year increase related to inventory pull-forward. Second, increased
scalable infrastructure spending. We saw some timing between the first two quarters, and the year-to-year –
year-to-date increase of some $40 million in this category was largely driven by higher capital investment for Internet
penetration and throughput. And finally, higher commercial CapEx, which increased $16 million to $61 million in the
second quarter to support growth in that business, particularly cell backhaul construction.
At this time, we estimate our 2012 CapEx spend to be at least $1.5 billion. And we could exceed that by as much as
$200 million, depending on the level of success of our new operating strategy, which would reflect higher RGU growth
and increased video CPE placement for new and existing customers as a result of increased digitization and DVR
penetration. This type of spend has a clear ROI-positive outcome, driven by the objectives Tom outlined. And if we're
successful, we would expect to see elevated CPE spend continue, as we go all digital and put the full set of Charter
products in existing and new customers' homes. The clear expectation is that this investment strategy will put us on a
very different growth path.
Turning to cash flow on Slide 9, we generated free cash flow of $26 million, down from last year's second quarter,
mostly due to the higher capital investment. We ended June with a weighted average interest cost of 6.6%. And our run
rate interest expense is roughly $850 million, including the 13.5% notes, which are callable November 30. Our leverage
was 4.8 times adjusted EBITDA at June 30, and our target leverage range is 4 to 4.5 times, plus or minus a half turn
either way to enable strategic activity. And while we're investing for growth, we remain focused on getting into that
target leverage range.
And now, back to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thanks, Chris. In closing, I'd just like to say that we're excited about implementing the new operating strategies and are
pleased with the early successes we've seen. The goal is to be well positioned and grow not only in the Internet and
commercial, but to win back video customers over time and grow our phone service. And we'll keep those relationships
with product packaging, service and price value, which nobody can match.
Our strategy will have short-term implications for our run rate for adjusted EBITDA and capital. But I believe our
actions will make us more competitive, improve our service, put more value in the home, create higher incremental
value per transaction and increase our long-term growth potential in a positive way.
Operator, let's open the call for questions now, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with Bernstein.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, Tom, for you. You talked about winning
back video subscribers. There's – you look like you've added an awful lot of non-video subscribers in the last quarter
end and over the last year. Can you talk about what the strategies are to win back those video subscribers? I would
presume that pool of people that take your broadband product but not your video would be your first target audience.
And then, Chris, just on the higher inventories that you talked about in CapEx. Is it fair to say that given that you've
already pre-set some of the inventories you would need, that – the higher CapEx for the rest of the year that gets you to
your guidance would largely be capitalized labor or, at least, the increment would be capitalized labor? And, if so, does

that have an impact on your expected labor expense that would hit EBITDA margins?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, Craig, with regard to win back, you're right. Our previous strategy and our results
have created a lot of data-only relationships in Charter. We have almost 1 million of those relationships. And so the
opportunity to sell them other products has always been part of our strategy. And so that is a big opportunity. But even
larger than that is the unsold passings universe and the satellite subscriber base that exists inside that universe. And
what we've been doing to get ready to market to that universe is to make our product set superior to satellite. So we've
gone away from the historic analog distribution that we've had and gone to an all-digital product, a two-way interactive
video product, with state-of-the-art HD quality on the bulk of the service. And we're moving toward getting a fully
deployed HD product across our entire footprint on every channel we carry.
And as you know, there's a lot of inertia in the video business. But we have an inherently superior video product than
our competitors in most places – the bulk of our competitors. And we have a superior data product and a superior voice
product, and put those all together in a package that's compelling and actually creates a value proposition for the
consumer, based on what they're currently paying. And we think we have an opportunity to grow our business for years
to come.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Craig, on the second question related to capital in general and labor. So we took,
during the second quarter, reflecting a higher percentage of our customers that were being sold into digital, reflecting a
higher number of boxes that were being placed into those homes, already starting in Q2 but gearing up for Q3, in
particular, and a higher number of DVR sell-in and a higher placement of DVRs inside the home. That type of
inventory increase will continue and, as the model plays out, will accelerate. And so I think you'll see some of those
trends continue. On that basis, when we increase the estimate for CapEx for this year, over 90% of that increase really
comes from CPE. And so that should give you some indication; it's also the reason that the range is somewhat wide,
depending on the level of success and how quickly that grabs hold, as planned.
Your second question was on labor. And so, yes, to the extent you're doing more installs and to the extent you're
spending more time in the home, placing more CPE, all of which is accretive, you'll be spending more on labor. Some
of that will be OpEx to the extent it's a reconnected home, and some of that will be capital to the extent it's a new home
with a – or with a new service. So all of that will be flowing through in the coming quarters.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: But would you expect the capitalized labor to be a net benefit to expense and that less of it
hits the income statement because more of it hits the balance sheet? Or would you expect it to be an addition to both
pools because of the increased volumes?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I'd expect it to be in addition to both pools because of the increased volumes.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Walarska (sic) [Wlodarczak] with Pivotal Research.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: Good morning, guys. It's Jeff Wlodarczak. One for Tom and two quick ones for Chris. Tom,
is part of your ultimate strategy here, over time, to rebrand the Charter offering? Or are you satisfied with the Charter
brand in the market? And then for Chris, is the temporary effects the customer connects in revenue for new initiatives,
is that mostly related to the fact that you're no longer marketing analog? Or is there something else? And then, Chris,
for the last couple of quarters you all have been running about a 9 million hit related to investments in your customers
experience. Did you still have that hit that quarter – excuse me – this quarter? And what's the outlook going forward?
Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, Jeff, on the rebranding strategy, we don't have a rebranding strategy at the
moment. And there's – there're parts of – there're aspects of the way Charter's footprint is distributed that makes

rebranding more difficult for us than some companies. So I'm not sure it's a good idea. We think that we can be
successful with our current brand. And that doesn't mean that we won't consider it, but we don't have a current plan to
change our brand name.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And, Jeff, on the temporary effects of connects and revenue, it's a combination of
what you were describing, which is actively only marketing our digital product as well as transitioning different sales
channels to different selling methods. And the process that is going on there. As well as when you're bringing on these
customers, maybe having a little bit less one-time revenue in the short term, which generates a higher recurring revenue
stream over the long term.
As to the customer experience investments, it does continue, and I would say over $5 million was what we saw inside
the quarter. It's becoming less of a one-time item, as we spend more in the home to make sure that the customers' issues
are fully resolved before we leave a trouble call. And preventative maintenance, which we've talked about for a couple
quarters now; as we accelerate that, it will become a recurring practice over time. So that's probably why you've heard
us move less to speaking about that, as we expect to be doing those activities going forward.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Good.
Operator
Your next question comes from Stefan Anninger with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two, if I could. I was hoping you
could expand a bit more on the product set that you're hoping to launch on the video side. So more HD is clearly part of
the roadmap, but was hoping you could expand on the other parts of the feature set that you hope to offer, like gateway
boxes, live video feeds in the home on devices beyond the TV set, et cetera. And then my second question is about your
new pricing and package initiative that you started earlier in the summer. Perhaps you could give us a bit of color on
the customer response to that. I think it featured more focus on, obviously, doubles and triple players, but also premium
services, et cetera. Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well with regard to our video product, we've gone from a business where we were
selling analog television up against an all-digital satellite broadcast service. And we've morphed that into a product set
that now is all digital and two-way interactive, and it has at least 100 channels of HD and will ultimately have – in a
relatively short period of time – every channel that we carry that's capable of being carried in HD in HD. And that
product is – unlike satellite, is a two-way interactive product that has the capability of VOD transactions, both
transactional VOD and free VOD, so it's inherently a better product as currently configured than our satellite
competitors.
But we had to put the plant and put the operation in place to make that capable. With regard to the long run and CPE,
we do have an evolving CPE strategy. We have not committed to a gateway. We think that intelligence in the network,
meaning capabilities in the network, make a gateway not necessarily an efficient way of going forward for us. We
would like to end up with the lowest CPE possible. And we think that we can get on a curve where we have declining
CPE per-unit costs for years to come. And we're actively trying to pursue that.
At the same time, we think that there are opportunities to use cloud-based services, including streaming video and
streaming guide applications that allow customers to interact with existing CPE and to use new features – or new
equipments like iPads and Android devices to watch TV. And we will be rolling those out toward the end of this
year/the beginning of next year, and have an integrated, network-based video CPE strategy going forward.
With regard to packaging and triple play, as I said in my comments, since we've done the packaging, our triple play
sell-in has more than doubled. And it's only been in the market for a month, and we expect a continued growth in that

<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: A question for Mr. Rutledge. You've had the benefit of working at a number of cable
firms in the industry. As you implement these structural changes and this new strategy to go all digital and sell the
triple play more aggressively, are there one or two metrics that you think are most important that you would suggest we
use to sort of benchmark your progress versus peers? Is it something like EBITDA per home passed – is that the right
way? Or EBITDA less CapEx per home passed? What would you think is the most salient metric for us to follow?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well I do think EBITDA per home passed is the ultimate metric. And it's – if you look at
Charter, we have the lowest EBITDA per home passed and – which, to me, is why Charter's so valuable. It's got all of
that upside opportunity and what we call runway. So as we go forward, I think you'll want to see us growing our
revenue line and growing that revenue line in a good way, meaning creating customer relationships that are higher
revenue-per-month customer relationships.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Hello. This is David Joyce for Vijay. I was wondering how the TiVo box fits into your CapEx
plan. Are you still committed to TiVo there? And given the product strategy, what's the prospect of the EBITDA
growth in the second half? Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well our commitment to TiVo is a commitment to their software, actually. And we have
a license agreement with TiVo to use their user interface. And we are using their user interface currently on boxes they
provide. But as we go forward, our strategy is to use the user interface on both in the cloud and on existing CPE and on
a new CPE.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: And on the EBITDA growth potential, given your product strategy for the second half?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Oh, Chris, why don't you...
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So – we don't provide EBITDA guidance, so I won't do that here. But I think what I
would express is that the past few quarters have demonstrated when we've accelerated growth, what are the impacts of
that, both in terms of increasing OpEx from a one-time or an accelerating growth rate level of OpEx, as well as for
CapEx. And everything that we're talking about here is certainly about accelerating the growth, not only in terms of the
amount of relationships that we have, but the depth of our product and services that we're providing into the home for
new and existing customers. And so you'll see pressure, both from a CapEx as well as from an OpEx perspective, to
drive that growth, ultimately, all of which is going to drive a higher customer relationship ARPU as well as intended to
drive a higher, long-term run rate EBITDA and the EBITDA per-home passed that Tom was referencing.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Phil Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Can I just ask for some clarification? There was one sentence in your release
that said you expected customer connects [ph] within (26:54) your OpEx may be adversely affected during the
transition. The revenue and OpEx seems pretty clear, but the customer connects, I was a little confused about. Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I'm not sure I understand the...
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah, I think I did. This is what I referenced before. As we transition to new selling
methods and the way we go to market, everything from the marketing strategy, targeting strategy, selling strategy, the
organizational structure that Tom was referencing is just turning a lot of knobs all at the same time. And so while we
have a very compelling pricing and packaging structure that's going in place and it's seen very early success, you're
changing a lot of – you're turning a lot of knobs at the same time. And so you could expect to see – you might see some
short-term impacts from doing that.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: So we should look for – to the business turning up more in the fourth quarter than the third? Does
that make sense?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I don't think we're at a stage where we're providing monthly or quarterly guidance.
But it's a natural impact of that and what I was describing. And that'll take some time to work out as well as moving
away from selling – [ph] proactively (27:55) selling analog and focusing more on selling digital which, at the end of the
day, is a much higher-quality customer base.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Hi. Thanks. Can you talk about 2013 CapEx? I know it's still a little early. But how much, I guess,
is one time in nature? And since most of your CapEx is success based, can you just help us think through the moving
pieces for 2013? And also, can you comment on any churn benefits from DTV not carrying Viacom or DISH and AMC
in your footprint?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well we – with – the second part of your question I'll answer first. It's hard for us to see
that because the same time those events were going on, we changed basically everything we do in terms of how we go
to market. And we did say that ours – that we've been successful so far with our new selling techniques. But I can't
attribute those to any other external factors and what proportion they might play.
With regard to – we're not giving guidance for future periods for CapEx. But the biggest issue that we will have from a
CapEx perspective going forward is how fast we grow. And the faster you grow, the higher the CPE will be in the
periods when you're growing rapidly.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Okay. I guess, just – is there any way to parse out how much CapEx is one time in nature for this
year?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Well, Amy, if you take a look inside the – the slides that we've prepared, you can see
a split out – that's also in the trending schedule. So you see a pretty clear split-out of the CPE component of that inside
of each quarter. So you can pretty clearly take a look at when we've grown faster, where that has driven CPE. We've
also mentioned that to the extent we're having success at these kinds of levels as well as increasingly going all digital
over the course of the next two years, you will expect to see that column inside of the bar chart continue to be at
elevated levels. And I don't think if we're – if we're successful in 2013, I wouldn't expect that portion to be going down.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. Just one follow-up to an earlier question, Chris, on the pricing and
packaging changes. Is there any impact on the installed base on the changes that you're having that are factoring into
your forward comments?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Well, I think at this stage, we're focused on getting new customers to connect. But
obviously, your existing basic customers are getting excited about the offers that are in market, the opportunity to have
up to four DVRs for $20. And they're calling in. We're moving them into higher-priced and higher – more importantly,
higher-value packages. And over time they'll be targeted. So you may have customers who are calling in and sitting at
ARPU of X and call in for an upgrade and get moved to an ARPU of Y, for which you have some up-front capital and
expense to go upgrade that customer and put CPE deeper into their home. At this stage, the larger focused is on new
relationships. But some of that, certainly, for sure, will exist for existing relationships as they move into the
higher-value packages.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: And then just – Tom, on the capital network outlook or strategy, what does all digital
mean in this context? Charter has used – utilized switch digital in the past to add capacity. And then we've seen sort of
various versions of all digital from some of the other operators. You've had the – you said sort of DTA approach. At
Comcast, I think there's been some reclaims down to the B1 or that sort of Comcast speak, the lifeline basic? Or are
you talking about a completely digital, eliminating all analog down the road? And if you are, can you just maybe give
us a sense for what the boxes per digital sub level looks like so we can sort of figure out what that might mean in terms
of sort of CPE levels?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. What we mean is all customers can completely turn off all the analog product.
With regard to the network, it means that the – the network itself, actually, is unburdened by the going to an all-digital
platform. And it actually – one way of thinking about it, it creates additional capacity without any additional capital
because you're essentially turning off fat analog spectrum, making that spectrum available for other uses. The biggest
one among those might be additional data speed capabilities. So going all digital, while it's a painful process and
requires the placement of CPE, it actually frees up the capacity of your network.
So one way of thinking about it, it gives you – it extends the life of your network and the capability of your network
without any additional network capital having to be spent. With regard to CPE per household, I think it's around three
units per house, on average. And that varies, but that's a good number. And we think that we can ride a reduced cost
curve of CPE. We think there are some factors that are working in our favor in terms of the kinds of CPE that are
available. And in smart televisions and iPads, for instance, are televisions that have a set-top box, essentially integrated
into them as a part of a port. Another way of thinking about an iPad is, it's a cable-ready TV in an IP world.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: And so we think that, ultimately, CPE per unit will go down and that the number – the
amount of CPE per device in the house that's watching cable television will go down. The amount of CPE necessary
because some of the devices will actually essentially be integrated CPE devices.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: And just to be clear, you're saying that the average Charter sub has about three TVs per
home? Is that what the three was referring to?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yes.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Yeah. But today, if you think about the current business, how many boxes are in those
digital households today that you'll have to then increase to get to three to make sure that all their TVs work, when you
move the analog off?

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Chris, do you want to answer that?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. I'm not sure that it's any longer on our trending schedule, but a few quarters ago
it was, and that was one and-a-half...
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: One and-a-half, yeah. I'm sorry.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Per digital – per digital customer.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Hi. Thank you. Just had two questions. One, wondering whether there wasn't more
flow-through from the broadband price increases that you implemented in April? I think there were $2 to $3 on most of
the tiers, but it looks like ARPU increased only about $0.20 sequentially. And then the other question I had is, I
understand you went back using fully featured DVRs for your whole home DVR solution. Is there a product roadmap
to move back towards centralized, in-home storage and thinner clients? Or are you going to skip that step and go
straight to a network DVR? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I'll answer the last question first. We don't know yet what the right answer to that
question is. But we think that the immediate opportunity is to use conventional DVRs, and that the long-run
opportunity is to buy DVRs in more efficient packages, meaning buy storage in bulk. And whether that's in the home or
whether that's in the network, I'm not sure yet what the right answer to that is. And it's an evolving question as
technology change – I mean an evolving answer as technology changes.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And on the Internet ARPU, the increase we saw was exactly what we expected. And I
think what we had mentioned is that, on average, across the customer base, the rate increase was about 1.2% average
across the entire base. There are segments of both Internet and video to which those rate increases were applied that
were not eligible for a rate increase because they may have been inside of a price guarantee contract and so couldn't be
applied to that. But from our perspective, the Internet ARPU uplift was exactly what we expected and – as well as the
overall rate increased at 1.2% across the basis of what we were looking for and what was achieved.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza with CRT Capital Group.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Hi, guys. I have two questions. The first is on the balance sheet. We've recently seen a lot of
issuance in the high-yield market. Your benchmark bonds are trading well inside of 5% now. And if I'm not mistaken,
you still have a big chunk of the 13.5% notes outstanding. Any reason in particular we haven't seen Charter come to
market with another refi?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Think we're always looking at the market and the opportunities that presents itself,
both in the bank as well as the bond market. And the reality is that we've done two tenders on those 13.5% notes. And
we are thinking through all of that in an NPP-positive way. And we've tendered twice to take out those 13.5% notes,
and we didn't get all of them in. They become callable on November 30. And so you can imagine all the different type
of analyses we do internally to think that through. And obviously, both bond and bank markets have been somewhat
attractive as of late as they continue to take a look at [ph] our non-TV business (38:22).

<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Okay. And then all other commentaries surrounding the growth opportunity, you've also
mentioned a desire to bring leverage down at least a little bit, I believe. So I suppose I'm stating the obvious, but should
I infer a common stock dividend isn't even in the conversation at this stage?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Well I think the better way to think about it is that we do have a target leverage, four
to four and-a-half times, and we're comfortable plus or minus half turn to enable strategic opportunities. Those
opportunities have always included, whether it was stock buybacks, whether it was M&A, whether it was investing
deeper inside the business as well as if you didn't have a better use for it and you were kind of inside your target
leverage range, potentially, on the dividend. I think what we're expressing today is we see the biggest opportunity for
an ROI and payback by investing inside the business, and that's why we've accelerated the CapEx to implement the
plan that Tom was outlining.
So we see that as the best use of cash flow today. That could change over time as opportunities present themselves. But
we're at 4.8 times today, so we're not sitting on excess cash or below our target leverage range. And we'll be focused on
getting into that target leverage range and evaluating uses of free cash flow once we're there.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Thank you so much. I have a few questions as well. So I guess the first one for Tom. On the
win-back of the penetration of non-video subs with a data product. I know the DISH partnership you had alluded to last
call that you were going to follow up on that. And I was wondering if you still see that as a potential, important channel
that you could be aggressively pursuing? And how much of that was a factor in Q2?
And separately, wanted to see when we can begin to hear about your wireless roadmap, especially now that you're very
close to your all-digital completion. Is that a 2013 event? I know, Tom, you'd recently suggested that Wi-Fi could be a
superior solution for cable compared to cellular or even 4G. So if you can maybe help us to articulate your plans on that
and how that could factor into your CapEx plans.
And lastly, for either Tom or Chris. I guess on the CapEx, when I think about your system, right. So correct me if I'm
wrong, but it seems like close to 10% of your footprint now is kind of either not – less than 550 or even not two-way
activated. So while that's a relatively small percentage, it's certainly not insignificant compared to your peers and
certainly so for Cablevision, if you think about the competitive situation out there. So I guess the question is, can you
maybe provide some color on what you're seeing in those particular markets, and if you might see an urgency to
address this in future CapEx plans? I know now you've articulated CPE success base – but for those systems, I'm
wondering if you see some vulnerability that might lend some urgency to upgrade those systems. Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: All right. Well, with regard to the DISH relationship, it hasn't had any impact – any
material impact in our strategy in the second quarter. And I haven't addressed it, and – but it's a very small channel and
not significant, I guess, is the best to describe it. With regard to wireless, we don't have a plan currently to deploy
wireless hotspots on our plant. But it is an opportunity for the business, and we do have an opportunity immediately to
start deploying Wi-Fi in commercial circumstances where the commercial customer also has Wi-Fi available to our
customers as a result of their relationship with us. And it's a hotspot strategy that's based on physical location as
opposed to – and the customer relationship – as opposed to the plant itself.
That said, in the long run, the cable architecture is a very robust architecture. And the data network that we have is very
robust and can carry – as I said before, when we takeoff analog signals and unburden our cable plant, the amount of
capacity that we have available to add to our data product is huge – particularly huge relative to what we've already
deployed against data product. And it's already a better data product than our competitors. You can leverage that data

product by attaching radios to it and have very small cells with very high capacity. And they can be Wi-Fi; they can be
cellular or some combination of both. And so I think in the long run, our architecture lends itself to either an adjunct
service to the 4G products that are currently being deployed by the cellular companies or a direct competitor.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Okay.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: The final question you had there was just related to the bi-directionality and the
over-550 megahertz of the network. And if you take a look on the trending schedule, you'll see that the homes passed
for Internet is about 97% of our total homes passed, which means that at a minimum, 97% is two-way or about 98%
that's about 550 megahertz. So you're really talking about at the edge case studies. And that has not been the focus as of
today.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Okay. So you don't see a need to get substantially closer to 750? That's not an issue right now.
You think so?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: We're not saying 98% is greater than 550 megahertz; predominantly, that is at 750.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. We have no plans today to upgrade any networks beyond what their current
capacity is. And we think that even the 550 – the small number of 550 plants we have in all-digital world are sufficient.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Tullo with Albert Fried.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Taking my question and congratulations on a solid quarter. Question. Regards to set-top boxes, is
the increase in CapEx in the back half of the year related to the TiVo implementation? Or are there other
implementations outside of that?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: It's the increase in regular set-top boxes that we're deploying across our footprint, and it
has nothing to do with TiVo directly.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Robin Gutzler>: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Yes, ma'am. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian Russo>: Hi. This is Brian Russo for Doug. Is marketing easier or more challenging now that you have a
third of the video subs in the market versus the two-thirds at Cablevision? And what are you doing differently at
Charter versus Cablevision in terms of marketing? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, it is a different marketing situation. And our concentration in DMAs is different
than other companies that I've been associated with in the past. And our penetration is lower, so there are challenges to
that and opportunities. The opportunity is we have more to sell. And we have a lot of diverse marketplaces with a
competitive footprint that I think gives us an opportunity to have a superior product to our competitors. So there's a
whole series of puts and takes, but it is a different marketing environment. And, in some ways, the good side of it is
that it's – that we have a superior product to our competitors in a lot of places. The difficulty of it is that using mass
media is harder to do than other situations.

And – but the growth of the Internet, interestingly, creates a new medium to target customers that hasn't existed so that
the cluster strategy of the 1980s and 1990s of putting your cable systems together, TV markets may not necessarily be
as active today with the opportunity to sell your product through a data service. So we're learning what the best and
most effective marketing techniques are, and we're encouraged by the results that we're getting.
