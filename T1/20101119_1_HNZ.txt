Now with the formalities out of the way, let me turn the call over to Bill.
William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Meg. Once again, good morning to everyone.
Before turning the call over to Art and Ed, I want to briefly address our solid performance in the second quarter, which
once again reflected the benefits of our emerging market strategy, our continued global growth in ketchup, the
continued operating discipline that underlies our success, the consumer and economic environment, and our outlook for
the full year.
Turning to the second quarter, as we reported this morning, on a constant currency basis, sales grew 1%. Operating
income rose almost 5%, and EPS from continuing operations increased nearly 7%. On a reported basis, EPS from
continuing operations rose almost 3% to $0.78 a share.
Encouragingly, during the quarter, we saw a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin and strong operating and
free cash flow of almost $300 million.
Without question, emerging markets were the growth engine in the quarter and in the first half of the fiscal year.
Emerging markets achieved double-digit organic sales growth of more than 10% in the quarter, enabling Heinz to
deliver our 22nd consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. The strong emerging market sales growth was fueled by
excellent results in China, India, Indonesia, and Russia. Overall, emerging markets generated 15% of the company's
total sales in the second quarter and have generated over 16% through the first half of fiscal 2011.
Notably, the emerging markets Infant and Nutrition business delivered 17% organic sales growth in Q2, reflecting
strong results in China, where we grew sales, achieved record shares in infant cereal, and successfully launched Heinz
infant formula.
India continued to be a growth catalyst, with organic sales of Complan nutritional beverages up 29%. Complan has
quickly grown to become one of the company's top brands, and Heinz opened a new greenfield factory in India last
December to support its continued expansion and growth.
Indonesia delivered 19% organic sales growth in ABC sauces. ABC is one of the world's leading brands of soy sauce,
and we have extended the ABC product line with new varieties of chili sauce to increase host food usage.
Russia achieved 16% organic growth in ketchup as Heinz continued to build distribution while leveraging our
partnership with McDonald's to strengthen our number one ketchup share position. Russia had a superb quarter overall

and led our ketchup growth in Europe, where Heinz is now number one in 10 of our top 12 markets.
Looking forward, I see China in particular as one of the keys to unlocking future value for Heinz. And consequently,
we are investing aggressively there to accelerate growth, especially in sauces and infant nutrition. The acquisition of
Foodstar, whose brands of soy sauce and fermented bean curd hold leading positions in southern China, aligns perfectly
with our strategy. Foodstar's brands give Heinz a solid growth platform in China's rapidly expanding $2 billion-plus
retail soy sauce market.
We plan to invest heavily in marketing, people, and the supply chain of Foodstar over the next 12 to 18 months to drive
distribution, growth, and innovation. Therefore, I anticipate that short-term results will be modestly dilutive to income.
Foodstar is already growing rapidly, and it represents a real opportunity for Heinz to leverage our global sauces
capabilities to drive even faster growth while building a large and meaningful ketchup and sauces business in China.
Foodstar and its 2,500 employees joined Heinz just a few weeks ago, and the integration is already off to a good start.
Art and I are visiting a number of countries in Asia next month and plan to meet with our Chinese teams of baby food,
frozen, and of course Foodstar. Our visibility and commitment to China is such that I have also been asked to address a
well attended symposium of pediatricians and health officials on the important topic of infant and child nutrition. Our
visit coincides with the significant organic growth opportunities that we are seeing in Asia as well as numerous core
M&A opportunities which we are exploring actively.
Overall, I now expect emerging markets to deliver more than 20% of the company's sales by 2013, more than double
their contribution of five years ago, and at least 25% shortly thereafter. We view the emerging markets as a target rich
base of consumers, who are likely to spend more and more of their income on branded packaged foods as they prosper.
Turning to ketchup, we continue to prove that our brand is far from mature. Our flagship product has delivered 6%
organic sales growth globally through the first half of the year, with organic growth of more than 3% in the second
quarter. We continue to invest behind this growth with new capacity planned in both developed and emerging markets
and innovative marketing initiatives like Dip & Squeeze in progress.
Innovation will be key to continuing our ketchup momentum, which is why we are so enthused about the upcoming
launch of Dip & Squeeze, the biggest ketchup innovation in decades. The first Dip & Squeeze machine has been
installed, and we are on track to begin shipping nationally in early January. Consumers are responding very favorably
to Dip & Squeeze, and many restaurant operators have tested it with very positive results.
Dip & Squeeze exemplifies our continued leadership in driving innovation that differentiates our brands, excites
consumers, and benefits our trade partners by driving traffic to our categories. Globally, our innovation pipeline is
robust, as evidenced by the great success of Ore-Ida sweet potato fries, which has already captured the number one
share in the segment, and the upcoming launch of consumer preferred, more shoppable, new Ore-Ida packaging, which
will begin appearing early in 2011. I will review this and many other exciting new initiatives with you at CAGNY.
Innovation impacts consumers and customers in myriad ways, and it is one of the keys to driving growth to our
categories. Another key is customer satisfaction, and I'm pleased to say that we were advised this week that Heinz
ranked first in overall customer satisfaction among food processing companies for the 11th consecutive year in the
American Customer Satisfaction index, which measures perceived quality, value, consumer loyalty, and consumer
expectations. Heinz led all food processing companies with an overall customer satisfaction score of 88, seven points
higher than the industry average.
Our customers are also increasingly recognizing our progress, as Heinz has vaulted into the top 20 for the first time in
the new Kantar Power Rankings. Also for the first time, Heinz was ranked in the top 10 for best supply chain
management and best combination of growth and profitability.
The second quarter benefited from another Heinz hallmark, operational discipline. We continue to be very disciplined
across the P&L and balance sheet, with particular focus on trade spending, CapEx, and inventory management. Trade
spend increased only slightly from year-ago levels in the second quarter and was actually down from first quarter
levels. Frankly, our experience suggests that aggressive promotions are even less effective today than in previous years

in driving profitable growth or producing acceptable returns. In short, there is simply no reason to chase consumers out
the door, as I've said for several years.
We also continue to allocate capital very efficiently and effectively, and our continued discipline in inventory
management led further to reductions in DII [Days in Inventory] for the second quarter.
Reflecting our strategy to leverage global scale, we are making significant investments in the second half of this fiscal
year behind Project Keystone, which as you recall is designed to build our capabilities, harmonize global processes, and
standardize our systems. This will drive capital and SG&A in the second half beyond what you should normally expect,
but the long-term benefits clearly warrant the investment, and our Keystone team has performed admirably to date.
Turning now to the consumer and the economic environment, we are seeing some improvement in the U.S. and Europe,
but clear differences still exist between developed markets and faster growing emerging markets. U.S. consumers are
still focused on value, as evidenced by the fact that coupon usage is up more than 5% year to date. They are still eating
at home in great numbers. And at least a quarter of the U.S. population is now without discretionary income, according
to Nielsen. However, we are seeing some glimmers of hope in away-from-home venues amidst slightly more
encouraging holiday shopping visits, and some consumers in developed markets appear to be emerging from
hibernation. As the U.S. economy begins to improve, I expect sales at our U.S. Foodservice business in the second half
of this fiscal year to improve enough to be essentially flat with a year ago, which would be a very positive development
after the prolonged downturn in restaurant traffic.
Meanwhile, emerging markets continue to be epicenters of dynamic growth, led by China, which passed Japan earlier
this year to become the world's second largest economy.
Frankly, as I have said many times, I believe emerging markets are the future of the packaged foods industry because
their economies are growing at more vigorous rates than developed markets, and the ranks of middle class consumers
are projected to rise dramatically in the decades to come, led by both China and India.
To win in this changing world, we must invest in growth markets, and that is exactly what Heinz is doing successfully,
as evidenced by our growing footprint in emerging markets and by our stature as a global company that now generates
almost two-thirds of our sales outside the United States.
Finally, a few comments on our outlook for fiscal 2011, which Art will elaborate on further in a few minutes; Heinz is
raising its outlook for operating free cash flow by 15% to $1.15 billion, reflecting strong cash generation in the first
half of the year. We are also reaffirming our full-year constant currency outlook of 3% to 4% growth in sales and 7% to
10% growth in both operating income and earnings per share.
In closing, Heinz performed well in a challenging and uncertain environment in the second quarter, driven by both our
continued growth in emerging markets and ketchup, and supported by our continued focus on innovation and strong
operating discipline.
With those brief remarks out of the way, I'll now turn it over to Art.
Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.
Overall, we're pleased with the results of Q2. For the quarter, we delivered continued strong sales in our key growth
vehicles of emerging markets, global ketchup, and our top 15 brands; expanded gross margins through strong
productivity and net pricing; delivered solid operating income and EPS growth; and continued our great momentum in
driving cash flow.
Now as Bill mentioned, we've performed quite well on a constant currency basis. Reported results were lower than
these growth rates as foreign exchange reduced sales by about two percentage points, operating income by 2.5
percentage points, and EPS by four points. The currency headwind during the quarter largely relates to the Venezuelan

bolivar, key European currencies, and hedges whose impact shows up below operating income.
In terms of organic sales, the increase was clearly led by emerging markets, which posted double-digit sales growth in
the quarter, driven by China, India, and Russia, and pricing in Latin America. Organic sales for developed markets
excluding U.S. Foodservice were relatively flat in the quarter, as gains in global ketchup and our top 15 brands were
offset by results in parts of continental Europe and Australia.
U.S. Foodservice continued to be impacted by soft channel trends, though we are starting to see some improvement in
restaurant traffic. Our core branded Ketchup and Sauces business continued to grow, but was more than offset by lower
sales of unbranded frozen desserts.
As you know, Heinz is comprised of a highly focused portfolio, anchored by the $4 billion Heinz brand. Our top 15
brands represented more than 70% of sales in the second quarter and have consistently led our organic growth over the
last few years. And this quarter was no exception as these brands grew organic sales at nearly 3%.
Turning to our core categories, we drove solid constant currency growth in Ketchup and Sauces and Infant/Nutrition.
Ketchup and Sauces sales grew more than 2.5%, and shares increased in many countries around the world. We're
particularly pleased with this result following a very strong performance in Q1, where this category posted 5.1%
organic growth. Ketchup led the growth here, up 3.3% in the second quarter following an increase of a very strong 8%
in Q1. Infant/Nutrition grew almost 5.5% for the quarter, driven by 17% organic growth in our emerging markets. The
softness in Meals and Snacks primarily reflects the lower sales in U.S. Foodservice desserts.
Now let's take a quick spin around the world of Heinz, and we'll start with North American consumer products.
Constant currency sales were driven by volume growth and a small acquisition in Canada. These increases were
partially offset by a reduction in net pricing. This sales growth reflects strong market share performance across our
most important categories. And on a constant currency basis, operating income increased roughly in line with the
increase in sales.
In the last 12 weeks and in fact over the last year as well, we've seen volume and value share gains in our three big
brands of Heinz Ketchup, Ore-Ida, and Smart Ones. Competing brands and private label have not fared as well. Our
iconic brands have outperformed the categories in this difficult economic environment, and their success has been
based on continuing innovation and our consumer value program.
Some of our recent innovations that helped drive the strong share results include Ore-Ida Sweet Potato Fries, which are
already number one and have helped grow the category twofold since its introduction earlier this year. This product is
so popular that we went on allocation this quarter. We've since remedied the supply situation and we're back in full
swing in time for the third quarter; Smart Ones sliders and breakfast offerings, which are showing very strong sales
velocity; and Simply Heinz Ketchup, which is running well above our launch expectations, and now represents about
10% of the retail ketchup business. Another notable innovation is Classico Light Alfredo sauce, which has proven to be
a highly incremental new product in our pasta sauce portfolio.
Now just a couple of final thoughts on North American volume, overall volume was constrained in the quarter by a few
factors. First, the timing of the promotions and some pantry loading in Q1 this year appear to have held shipment
comps below consumption comps in Q2. Second, given the environment, in the frozen category we're moving to
simplify and streamline our brand offering. A step in the process is consolidating our retail Poppers brand into the
T.G.I. Friday's brand in order to further consolidate our focus on the top 15 brands. And lastly, as I mentioned, our
shortage of sweet potatoes in Q2 held down shipments of Ore-Ida Sweet Potato Fries in the quarter. Net-net, probably
the best way to view North American volume is on a year-to-date basis through the first half, which is up 3.4%, a good
result in the current economy.
Now turning to U.S. Foodservice, we're pleased that again in Q2 branded ketchup and condiment sales grew despite
continued lower aggregate foot traffic across our customer base. But as I mentioned earlier, the sales declines related to
non-Heinz branded frozen desserts. However, through the effect of streamlining of the business and strong operational
discipline, profit for the quarter grew 20%, and year-to-date operating income is up a very strong 22%. As we look
forward, we believe we are well positioned for when the traffic trends in Foodservice improve, and we expect organic

sales to be at least flat in our third quarter.
Our profit performance in U.S. Foodservice continues to be driven by recovering gross margin levels. We regained
gross margin during the last couple of years through tightening of promotional practices, effective mix management,
SKU reduction, elimination of low margin business, and productivity in the supply chain. The team has done a great
job on the bottom line, and now with innovations like Dip & Squeeze is turning toward top line expansion.
Now let's turn to Europe. For the quarter, we saw constant currency sales growth of 0.5%, driven by an overall volume
increase of 0.7%. Here, strong organic sales growth in the UK, solid growth in Italy, and double-digit growth in Russia
were partially offset by soft sales in Germany and the Netherlands. Gross margin was up 180 basis points, driven
largely by supply chain productivity. Putting it all together, European operating income grew almost 6.5% on a
constant currency basis, even with the continuing investments in Keystone processes and systems.
Q2 marks the fourth quarter of the very effective IT HAS TO BE HEINZ marketing campaign in the UK, and it is still
generating strong results. Heinz grew volume and value share in key beans, soup, and ketchup categories. As we look
forward, we'll begin lapping the excellent results of this campaign next quarter.
In our Asia-Pacific market, sales growth was largely driven by strong results in India and China. Additionally,
Indonesia increased sales even after tremendous growth in Q1, which partially reflected the timing of Ramadan. The
Australian business continues to face a difficult trade and a competitive environment, and we continue to bring
capabilities and new tools to Australia to enable them to improve performance in the tough market conditions there.
For the Asia-Pacific region overall, volume increased by 2% and price decreased slightly. Gross margin was very
strong, expanding 100 basis points despite commodity spikes in Indonesia. Operating income increased by almost 3%,
even after a double-digit increase in marketing spending in the region.
This marketing spending is supporting some exciting new products being launched in our Asian markets. These include
new Ayam Goreng chili sauce in Indonesia, an accompaniment to popular foods like fried chicken; Complan
Nutri-Grow toddler formula in India, launched in June and expanding to additional cities and regions this year; our new
Green Rice Cereal in China, which as Bill mentioned helped drive our infant cereal business to a record market share in
the quarter; and our infant formula launch in China last April. It's still early, but we're pleased with our progress.
Distribution is strong, and we've just commenced advertising on the product.
In our rest-of-world segment, we delivered constant currency sales growth of 14%, primarily driven by Latin American
pricing. Volume was down in Latin America, reflecting the economic difficulties in Venezuela. The devaluation of the
Venezuelan bolivar at the end of Q3 last fiscal year drove this quarter's $50 million unfavorable ForEx variance in the
segment in net sales, and we expect a similar impact next quarter.
Now turning to cash flow, we're very pleased that we delivered another excellent quarter. Operating free cash flow of
$297 million in Q2 represents 118% of net income, driven by strong profitability, working capital management, and
continuing financial discipline. For the first half, cash flow exceeded last year's excellent performance by 24%.
Now I'd like to hand it over to Ed McMenamin to cover our financial scorecards. Ed?
Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance
Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone.
Now that Art has covered the performance of each of the operating units, I'll briefly review the overall financial
highlights. Looking at EPS, I'll give you three perspectives on the company's results that reflect the impact that
currencies and last year's divestitures have had on our comparisons.
First, looking at the results on a constant currency continuing operations basis, EPS was $0.81, up 6.6% from the prior
year. Our current period results were unfavorably impacted by about $0.03 from currency movements, which were
largely due to the relative weakening of the euro and the pound as well as the bolivar devaluation last year. Reported

EPS from continuing operations was $0.78, up 2.6% versus prior year. And finally, including the $0.04 unfavorable
impact from discontinued operations last year, total company reported EPS was up $0.05 or almost 7%.
Now turning to our P&L scorecard, net sales of just over $2.6 billion benefited from double-digit organic growth in
emerging markets. The efforts of our global supply chain are delivering great results, with a gross margin increase of
100 basis points to 37%. Productivity improvements are the main driver here, primarily in U.S. Foodservice, the UK,
and Australia.
Marketing was down slightly as increased investments in our emerging markets and the UK were more than offset by a
shift in North America from traditional advertising to trade promotions.
Operating income increased 2.1% on a reported basis and 4.6% on a constant currency basis. Improved gross profit
enabled us to increase investments in Project Keystone while still delivering operating income growth.
Now that you're grounded on the major P&L line items, this chart details the currency impacts on these key measures.
Despite some recent strengthening of the European currencies, overall ForEx was still a headwind for the quarter. The
largest impact is obviously on our revenue line, where the bolivar devaluation was the most significant movement.
However, given the relative size and profitability of our European business, the euro and the pound are the largest
drivers of the currency impact on earnings. And generally, the Asia-Pac movements have been favorable but on a
smaller base.
Adjusting for the impacts from both translation and losses on translation hedges from both years, EPS was unfavorably
impacted by $0.03, $0.02 from translation, $0.01 from the hedges.
Here's a quick look at several of our key currencies. As you can see, the general positive trends since early summer for
the pound and the euro have barely reached the low point for those currencies during our second quarter of last year. In
fact, on average, the pound was about 4% below last year's levels, and the euro down 8% for the quarter. We have
hedged translation for the euro as well as the New Zealand and Australian dollars at rates better than Analyst Day
levels, but in the case of the euro still well below last year's rates. As a result, we would anticipate moderate upside
versus earlier estimates due to currency movements.
Turning back to the P&L, a few points that we haven't yet discussed; gross profit dollars were up almost 4% on a
constant currency basis, driven by improved margins. SG&A was up 4.7% on a constant currency basis, which reflects
increased investments in Project Keystone and higher compensation costs. In relation to Project Keystone, I'm happy to
report the successful SAP go-live in the Netherlands, which occurred during our second quarter.
Looking below operating income, net interest and other expenses are down $4 million, largely due to our debt
refinancing last year, which more than offset the unfavorable impact from currency hedges I mentioned earlier.
The company's 26.7% effective tax rate for the quarter was up 110 basis points from last year. But as a result of tax
planning projects reflected this quarter, Q2 was still favorable to our full year estimate of around 28%.
And finally, shares outstanding reflect a small increase versus this time last year, resulting in the $0.78 of EPS.
Now let's take a deeper look at sales drivers. The second quarter delivered organic sales growth of almost 1%. Volume
increased 0.3%, and was driven by our emerging markets, the UK, and Canadian businesses, offset by declines in U.S.
Foodservice, Germany, and Australia. Net pricing increased sales by 0.6% as pricing in the emerging markets,
particularly Latin America and U.S. Foodservice, were partially offset by year-over-year increases in trade promotions
for North American consumer products, the UK, and the Australian businesses. As Bill mentioned, D&A is down as a
percentage of sales from our first quarter levels.
Foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales by 2.3%, while acquisitions had little impact on sales for the quarter.
But the Foodstar acquisition will contribute to top line growth in the second half of the year.
As I noted earlier, our gross margin increased 100 basis points to 37% on both a reported and constant currency basis.
This reflects productivity improvements along with higher pricing in a rising commodity cost market.

During Q2, we saw market price increases of around 3.5%, primarily behind dairy, vegetables, resin, and glass.
However, favorable contract pricing and the great work of our global procurement teams kept our commodity costs
about flat for the quarter. We expect that the inflationary impact of dairy and resin for the remainder of the year will be
partially offset by the favorable cost for tomatoes and potatoes. Based on these trends, we now believe our basket of
commodities will experience market inflation of over 3%, but our net cost should be below that.
As you can see, operating free cash flow was driven by higher earnings and favorable working capital, which included
the benefit of recent agreements to purchase domestic tomato paste throughout the year rather than at the harvest.
In addition, this year we reverted to more typical pension funding levels almost $80 million below last year. Roughly
offsetting that favorability was the $80 million we received from the termination of a total return swap and the maturity
of foreign currency contracts in Q2 of last year.
Capital expenditures are up from last year, primarily due to Keystone investments, while dividends reflect the 7.1%
increase we announced in June.
Now let's briefly review our results for the first half of the year. Taking a look at EPS from the same three perspectives
as I did for the quarter, constant currency EPS was $1.59, up almost 10% versus prior year. Our year-to-date
comparisons were unfavorably impacted by about $0.05 from currency movements. Reported EPS from continuing
operations was $1.53, up 6.3% from prior year. And finally, including the $0.04 unfavorable impact from discontinued
operations last year, the total company reported EPS was up $0.13.
Now let's move to our P&L scorecard. As you can see, all the key measures compare favorably to last year on both a
reported and constant currency basis. Year-to-date net sales grew 2.3% on a constant currency basis. Organically, sales
grew 2.2% as a 1.4% volume increase was combined with a 0.8% price increase. The volume reflects strong growth in
the emerging markets as well as improvements in North American consumer products and the UK business. These were
partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice, Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands.
Notably, on an organic basis emerging markets grew over 16%, and our top 15 brands grew 4.4%. Including the 2.2%
unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and a slight impact from acquisitions, reported year-to-date sales are up
slightly. Our gross profit margin was up around 100 basis points, as higher net pricing and productivity improvements
were partially offset by higher commodity costs.
Consumer marketing was up on both a reported and constant currency basis. Operating income reported a 5.8%
increase and a very strong 8.4% growth on a constant currency basis. At $1.53, EPS was up almost 10% on a constant
currency basis. The dilution from higher shares outstanding was roughly offset by a 100 basis point decline in our
effective tax rate, which came in at around 26%. As a reminder, last year the after-tax impact of the gain on the total
rate of return swap was completely offset by the after-tax charges for upfront productivity initiatives.
Looking at the year-to-date balance sheet scorecard, capital expenditures of $122 million were 2.4% of sales, up 50
basis points from the prior year, but still favorable to our 3% estimate for the full year. Cash conversion cycle was 49
days, down five days from the prior year, driven by improvements in all three measures. Operating free cash flow is up
$100 million from last year at just over $0.5 billion, giving us the confidence to take our projection up by the year for
15%. Yet debt to EBITDA was better by 0.5 times, driven by both lower debt balances and higher earnings. ROIC was
19.2%, up 1.6% from this time last year. This excludes the impact of losses from discontinued operations of around 60
basis points.
Overall, we're pleased with our performance for the quarter and first half, and now I'll turn it back over to Art to discuss
our full-year outlook.

As Bill said at the outset, we are reaffirming our constant currency P&L targets while increasing our cash flow outlook
by 15%. Our year-to-date results and the plans for the balance of the year give us confidence that we will deliver
another strong year for the company and its shareholders.
Finally, let's talk about the shape of the next two quarters relative to last year and items impacting comparability. Last
year, the high water mark in terms of EPS occurred in Q3, with Q4 profit being quite a bit lower due to commercial and
productivity investments. This year, we expect our EPS to be much more even in Q3 and Q4. This largely reflects a
more even distribution of investment spending this year, largely focused on Project Keystone; the modestly dilutive
effects of the Foodstar acquisition as we plan to aggressively invest in this business in order to further leverage its
current momentum; the overlap of the currency devaluation in Venezuela, which occurred very late in Q3 last year; a
higher effective tax rate in the back half; and an increased number of shares outstanding this year. So again, we expect
EPS to be relatively evenly phased between the two remaining quarters.
So in summary, we believe that the business is performing in challenging times and we are confident in our full-year
outlook. And we have a great runway for continued growth as we continue to invest for the future.
So now we'll open it up to your questions.

[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Diane Geissler of CLSA. Please proceed.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Good morning.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Diane.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Good morning. I just – the volume trends in the quarter were a little bit lighter than what I had
been looking for. You cited a number of issues: the pantry loading, allocation on the sweet potato fries, the Ramadan.
Can you just give us some indication about your volume expectations in the second half of the year, what you see
happening with the U.S. consumer? Just any color there would be appreciated.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, I think in the second half of the
year from a U.S. standpoint, remember we're up against very difficult comps because of the growth we put behind the
CVP [Consumer Value Program] program last year. The second thing you should be aware of is, and we made the
statements about where deal spending is in the first and second quarter, but for the year I would expect deal spending as
a percentage of sales to be flat, which means in the second half of the year you're not going to see us aggressively chase
volume like I think we may have done last year with the CVP program.
Third, the U.S. consumer is in a funk. And while we're seeing some glimmers of hope and some seem to be emerging
from hibernation, the reality is that they are making conscious and significant trade-offs in their budget. And for the
first time ever maybe since the Great Depression, we're seeing 27% of them without discretionary income based on the
Nielsen data we looked at last week, which is an incredibly high number. Having said that, we have a lot of innovation
in the second half of the year in the U.S.
And my hope in the U.S. is in the second half of the year that we see some volume improvement on Ore-Ida because of
the launch of – recapturing the sweet potatoes that we didn't get in the second quarter. Ketchup will continue to be
relatively strong other than it's up against a huge CVP program in the fourth quarter last year. Frozen entrees are simply
a function of what the categories want to do. We're building share and we're seeing good response to our breakfast and
sliders business. But in the U.S. if we don't see a turnaround in the category, I'm not very hopeful about volume in the
second half. So I would think the second half in the U.S. will be not as good as the first half where we were up between
3% and 4% in volume. I would expect this to be flattish in the U.S. And again that's going to reflect lower deal
spending.

Globally, you're going to see a very strong second half in the emerging markets, very strong. You're going to see I think
reasonably solid performance in some of the European countries. I'm still concerned about Germany. I'm concerned
about the Nordics and I'm concerned about Benelux, but I think short of those you'll see pretty good response. I think
the UK, although it comes up against tough comps, they've got a lot of innovation, and the Fridge Pack beans seem to
be off to a very good start.
And then I think in the rest-of-world segment, short of Venezuela, we're seeing very good growth in the Middle East
and in Africa. So I think generally, the emerging markets will be a very good story in the second half. We'll have
pockets of strength in Europe. Foodservice, as I said, we think will be flat year on year in terms of organic sales in the
second half, which is the first time in a long time we can say that. So I think generally what we've said is we're holding
to our 3 to 4% sales, using Art's word, algorithm for the year. And other than that there's just not a whole lot to add,
Diane.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay, great. Is there a breakdown within that 3% to 4% sales growth in terms of volume and
price?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We haven't broken it down. What
we've said is 3% to 4% constant currency sales growth. That was the target we laid out in May, and that's still the
number we're looking at. So I'd rather not break it out, although you can pretty much get a good read by what we've
done in the first half and then the addition of some M&A in the second half.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay, terrific. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Hi. I just wanted to continue on the question of what's going on in Germany and Benelux and
the Nordic regions. Could you give us a little bit more color on that? You said it might persist into the second half. Is it
weakness in the consumer? Is it competitive dynamics, just a little bit more information there?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The answer to both those is yes. In
Germany, it's a function of a price increase we took on Sonnen Bassermann and the negative reaction we've gotten
from the trade. And we've been delisted in some accounts in Germany, so we saw a very weak German performance in
Q2.
I think our plan is to have it back in the accounts say early part of next calendar year. In fact, the one account that did
eliminate the product has seen their comps versus their peer competitors drop precipitously in soup and in stews. So
that's fundamentally the issue in Germany.
In the Nordics, the issue is a function of frozen. The frozen dynamics in the Nordics, where we have a very strong
Weight Watchers business, are very similar to what they are in the U.S. And so we're a victim of the category there.
And then I think in the Benelux, it's predominantly a couple of things. It's one, the customers there are really being
difficult with private label and pricing, and we are not participating. We have decided that it's just not simply worth the
cost nor the implications for moving in that direction, so we're not as aggressive as the market in general. I think
secondly, we've got a lot of innovation in the second half in those businesses, and we'll see how that plays out. Having
said that, in the Benelux our ketchup business from a volume standpoint is doing very well, as is ketchup across the
continent.
The other thing we're seeing is based on the Nielsen data we've looked at and we're seeing it in our own businesses is
that Eastern European markets' market baskets are flattish to down slightly as the consumer retrenches. Fundamentally
what you've got in Europe is a story of Southern Europe and Northwest Europe, and I'm excluding Ireland from that

obviously. But in Northwest Europe we're seeing better comps and better performance from a consumer standpoint
other than our one-off issue in Germany.
In the southern parts of Europe excluding Italy for the time being, where our business performed fairly well in the
second quarter, the consumer is literally not coming back. You've got high unemployment, particularly among younger
people. And I think as a consequence of that, we just don't see a lot of good things coming out of Europe, other than the
UK, where volume was up a little over 5% in the second quarter, and where our team really is doing a spectacular job
with innovation and I think managing the balance between trade spend and marketing, consumer marketing, and I think
has done a very good job at driving share and volume performance, as Art articulated in his comments.

Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi. Please proceed.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Thanks a lot. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to the Europe question, but
specifically just focus in on the UK. You've made a couple of comments here. But the IT HAS TO BE HEINZ
promotional campaign, I believe it began third quarter of last year. And the UK business in that quarter grew I believe
it was 9%.
What happens when you start to lap that promotion? And what gives you confidence that we'll actually see
year-over-year growth in third quarter and beyond that, just given how strong the business was during that period of
time?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I want to be clear that I don't know
that we'll see significant year-over-year growth in the UK, certainly not in Q3 relative to those comps from last year.
But they have a lot of activity, David.
The Fridge Pack beans has been a big hit. And the advertising we're running, which started last week, is very
breakthrough advertising, some of the best advertising I've seen in this company.
They've got a lot of activity on sauces and on soups. Soup category was up in the latest 12 weeks. Our share was up
against a growing category. In fact, we're now pushing from a volume and value standpoint upper 60s, pushing 70%,
which are numbers we haven't seen in UK soup in a long time.
But I do think the comps in the third quarter will be difficult to match, and then we'll come back and see how the fourth
quarter comes out.
But the UK business overall is very solid. Fundamentally sound. They've made great progress from a supply chain
standpoint, from a margin standpoint. They've got some good initiatives coming in the second half. But I want to be
clear. I don't know that I want to say – and if I did, I want to correct it, because I don't think I said it – that I expect big
volume increases year on year in the UK, given the IT HAS TO BE HEINZ program. Having said that, again our
business is very healthy in the UK.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Thanks for the clarity, just two quick follow-ups. Art, can you tell us – maybe you said it on the
call here – but what is the EPS effect projected in 2011 from foreign currency, all factors taken into account? And
what's your expectation for productivity saves this year?
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, I'm not sure we quantified it
exactly, David, given the extreme volatility of currency. I think, as Ed mentioned, it will be somewhat better than what
we had thought at Analyst Day, but still down to prior year overall. So a few cents I would expecting coming there.

We've locked a number of our currencies. The remaining open one is the pound, so we're getting some clarity there. But
there's still volatility in the pound and also on some of the Asian currencies.
So we'll keep you posted as that goes along, but I wouldn't get too far ahead of yourself on currency just based on what
we've locked at and also the continuing volatility. Three days ago, I would have said one thing, and today I would have
said something different.
So I think currency should be a modest help to us.
In terms of productivity, we're off to a great start productivity-wise, and that has really helped drive our gross margin
up 100 basis points in the quarter, so that we continue to make progress on.
And I'm very pleased with the Keystone progress as well. Successful rollout in the Netherlands. Those are never easy
processes. But we've got in the global template, and now we're continuing to work to expand it to other geographies.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, David, on the productivity, I
think Bob Ostryniec and the global supply chain team we put in place in the last six months has had a huge impact.
Now obviously we're benefiting from some very good moves on the procurement side. We're also benefiting from
tomatoes and potatoes finally moving our way, but we are also benefiting from the time they are spending in the
emerging markets and in other markets, trying to bring everybody under the HGPS [Heinz Global Performance
System] system.
And I think from that standpoint, we are seeing good productivity gains across the board, particularly in Europe and in
the emerging markets. And I look forward to that continuing as part of what we've laid out for future goals.
But I think particularly with the Foodstar acquisition and some of the other moves in the emerging markets, we now
have 12 factories in China, and there are significant opportunities to improve their processes and improve their returns.
We have three factories in Indonesia. We've got two in India.
And so there are significant plans in place to greatly improve the returns and the productivity we're getting out of those
facilities, as well as continuing the growth and improvements we're seeing in the developed western world.

<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Just two – maybe two quick ones. The first, in the quarter, was your sales growth relative to
your internal expectations above or below what you were expecting? And can you triangulate whatever happened with
the tactical decisions you've been talking about making in terms of allocating D&A, both in general and across your
geographic segments?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think from a sales standpoint,
every quarter looks different to us. Sales finally came in towards the end, against our expectations, about where we
thought they would for the quarter.
Now if you go back to the original plan, it always changes because the investment decisions we make and the monies
we move around. So we evolve as we go through the year.

From a tactical standpoint, Vincent, on D&A, we have been very hardnosed. As you know, this is something that I
believe in both philosophically and personally that we need to be cautious, and we've seen some areas.
In the United States for example, we've seen some areas where D&A was up, and we made some conscious decisions
to reallocate some marketing to the D&A line, as Ed said in his comments. I don't think we've gotten a return for it.
And frankly, you'll see that come back in the second half of the year, because we're just not going spend money against
a consumer that is not influenced by that kind of promotion activity.
We are allocating additional marketing money into the emerging markets, where we're seeing significant growth. We're
putting a significant amount of marketing money behind the Foodstar acquisition to build on the incredible momentum
we're already seeing over the last six months in their top line. And we're seeing some reallocations across Europe to
some of the businesses that are performing better.
We are ruthless in allocating marketing and taking it away from those businesses that don't do well and putting it
against those businesses that do. And as you can see, year to date we're up about 4%, $5 million, $6 million, $7 million
in marketing. And I would expect you to see some investment marketing in the second half of the year, predominantly
in the emerging markets where the allocation processes, I think, are going to become more robust. And you'll see
additional funds shifted over time to where we get returns more clearly.
We are also in the process of putting in a plan we call HMPP, which is the Heinz Marketing Productivity Process.
We're just now starting that. It's being developed by a couple of the people who report to me, Mike Pretty and his team.
And it's a real opportunity for us to be a little more ruthless in terms of allocation of marketing funds based on not only
ROI but based on category performance, country performance, geographic splits, and so forth.
So I think as we go forward, you will see marketing funds shifted from markets where we're not getting growth into
markets where we are, and I think that process has started. And we've seen an incredible lift, for example, in China on
baby food, from the investments we're making behind – just started to make behind formula. It's having a huge halo
effect. We're seeing similar things across Indonesia in ABC. We're seeing similar things in Russia.
And so the appetites in those markets are considerable, but the returns are even more considerable. And so we're
making some tradeoffs between D&A and marketing in the developed world and adding additional marketing where
possible in the developing world to continue to drive the growth we've seen.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay, and if I could just ask you quickly on Foodservice. To get to that flat year-over-year
number in the back half, are there particular segments of Foodservice that you're expecting to drive this, or is it more
broad based?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No. I think it's going to be
predominantly condiments and sauces driving it in the second half, particularly portion control in response to the Dip &
Squeeze launch in January.
I think the other thing we're starting to see, as you see, the QSRs are performing better than the fast casual restaurants.
And so I don't expect a huge turnaround in some of our frozen businesses in Foodservice, but I do expect condiments
and sauces, as it has for the last couple of quarters, to continue to do well.
That's one of the things driving the margin on Foodservice. I want to give kudos to the Foodservice guys on all the
productivity initiatives, but they're also getting the benefit of the mix shift into our branded products, and I think that's
where you'll see the focus in the second half.
But I think we have good plans in the second half. And providing the consumer continues to show some continued
improvement in access to the Foodservice venues, I feel fairly good that we'll deliver that flat performance, but it is
going to be driven by condiments and sauces.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance>: On top of that, in addition to the general economic
comments, remember that over the last couple years, the Foodservice team has been proactively eliminating some
SKUs, and in some cases, getting out of some customer agreements where they just weren't profitable cases. So as I

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Hi.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Ed.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Bill, I was hoping you could maybe just share some views on how you're thinking about the
pricing environment maybe versus prior cycles. There seems to be growing evidence that food companies are taking
price a bit faster than in the past, but it's happening in a pretty weak volume environment.
So you seem to be of the view that trade spending hasn't really helped drive volume. So do you think that the volumes
will hold up as this pricing makes its way through the system over the next – call it few months?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I worry about us, Ed. I don't pay a
lot of attention to what other people are doing. And our pricing decisions are predicated on our cost profile, what we
expect to happen in the future from a commodity perspective, the elasticities that we understand. And they vary by
business, significantly by business and by customer and by geography.
I think it will also be predicated on the productivity measures we're seeing and how effective they're going to be.
My own view on pricing is that for the Heinz Company, even if we were to see some volume tradeoff, the net-net
benefit typically over time is a positive one. But I don't think you should expect to see this company take blanket
pricing across the board. I think we'll be very selective in areas where we know the elasticities and where the brands
strength and the trail of innovation is enough to continue to support the premiumization of some of these products.
It's interesting, and I heard very few people comment on this, but if you go back and look at our last four fiscal years,
fiscal '07, '08, '09, '10, we got net price in each of those years. Fiscal '06 was the last year we didn't get net price, and it
was essentially flat. And year to date this year, we're up net price, obviously.
And so our view is we'll continue to reflect the dynamics of the market, the dynamics of our brand, what our marketing
is showing us, what our innovation packages look like, and what productivity and commodity costs are going to be, and
we'll be prudent and selective. But I think in some cases, we'll probably have no choice but to take price.
But I have to tell you, I don't reflect on anything other than what I think we can do as a company and where we can be
successful, and I don't worry about what anyone else is doing. I don't follow the commentary on it, because I think it's
usually nothing but puffery. But we will take appropriate action where we deem it appropriate.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Thanks. And then one quick follow-up. On the comment about shipments having lagged
consumption in the quarter, is that just because you shipped ahead of consumption in Q1, or is this something that
should reverse in a positive way in the third quarter?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No. I think it's primarily because of
the Walmart situation in Q1 on ketchup and some Smart Ones pickup in Q1. So I certainly wouldn't read into it that you
should expect a big pop in the third quarter as a function of catching up.
I think – I'm hoping the exception of that is going to be sweet potato fries, where we did have a significant supply issue
in the second quarter. And based on our trends and the strength of the SKUs, I think you'll see some pickup there.

sharp decrease in effectiveness in their promotions of their categories. And they're seeing greater price shocks from the
grains themselves than you're seeing in your basket, which seems to be a lot more balanced and diverse.
So the 3% outlook on your basket, you're doing better than that. And arguably you sell a little bit more expensive
calories to the consumer.
It doesn't seem like from what you're laying out here that you're expecting nor really pitching here that you're going to
take a more aggressive stance on price or a reduction in promotions in the medium term, but maybe I'm looking at that
wrong.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Now I would never say that, David.
I certainly think it is, as I pointed out, that if deal spending is a bit ahead of last year in the second quarter and year to
date, and we're going to be flat across the year, where I think we're going to be plus or minus 10 basis points. And I
think you should assume in the second half we're going to be less aggressive from a D&A standpoint.
Pricing decisions – I think people who talk about pricing decisions in the public domain are airheads. I think the reality
is you can't make decisions in a vacuum. You have to make decisions based on the strength of your brand. You have to
make decisions based on the innovation pipeline you've got. You have to make decisions based on the cost profile of
the businesses affected. You have to make decisions based on the strength of the brand and the positions you have in
the marketplace. And we will be selective as we look at opportunities.
But I am clearly not going to articulate for a broad audience what our pricing strategy has been. I just gave you a pretty
good sense that the last four years, we have netted price in each of the last four fiscal years, better than 2% or 2.5% on
an annualized basis. Now some of that's driven by emerging markets and response to inflation. Some of it's driven by
developed markets and response to opportunities.
Clearly, for example, Dip & Squeeze is a more expensive product than pouch. And as we've launched Dip & Squeeze,
we'll obviously get some mix pickup in terms of the price/value of that on a single tradeoff between pouch. So those are
the things we continue to look at.
I'm not trying to denigrate or besmirch anybody else. I just think – I've been in this job a long time, and I've seen these
discussions come and go over time. And I am a believer that you do what's right for your shareholders and for your
employees and for your brands on an individual basis, and that's the way we evaluate it.
But I want to be clear. I'm not saying we're going to take price. I'm not saying we're not going to take price. I'm saying
to you that we evaluate the opportunities going forward to create value for our brands and our shareholders. And we

look at those on an individual basis, and sometimes we see opportunities, other times we don't. But we're incredibly
careful about it given the elasticities and given the markets we operate in.
<Q - David Palmer>: And is there a comment you can make about just that in some of your major categories,
particularly the U.S., are you seeing the type of behavior from your competition about price that you would expect at
this point, given the outlook on costs? Are folks what you would call rational at this point?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, David, I come from the Bobby
Knight school of coaching. And Bobby and I have always had a philosophy, if my team plays its game, I don't care
what the other guys do.
And so from my perspective – and I'm not trying to be a flip or a smart guy. I worry about what I think we can do in the
businesses, where I think pricing would be available to us, and where I think we have a sufficient trail of innovations to
support and warrant that among the consumers.
The consumer is very fickle today. I see it in my own household. Consumers are being very selective and very prudent.
And we're certainly going to reflect the consumer's behavior. I don't care what competitors do. I care what consumers
do because I want to know how consumers are going to react to what I do.
And we're blessed in this company with great brands. We're very concentrated with 15 brands doing better than 70% of
our business, so we can make very selective decisions against pricing as we see them relate to the Heinz Company and
as we look for opportunities ourselves to continue to optimize value for the multiple constituents we operate and sell to.

<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: We're running out of time here. We have a lot of you

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney of Janney Montgomery. Please proceed.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: There he is.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Thanks very much, Meg. I just wanted to – you guys almost didn't get a chance to besmirch
some of my puffery.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That's quite all right, Jonathan. I'll
be happy to besmirch your puffery if you'd like me to. I can understand how people on the outside perceive things. But
again we have a very long track record in this company of doing the things that are right for our businesses, and we
evaluate that. And so rather than make this broad based statement, which I think is dangerous and frankly I don't think
is necessarily relevant, we try to be very selective. But more importantly, I don't think it's appropriate to talk about
pricing strategy in a global environment.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Let me be very specific then, Bill. The United States consumer, we just went through this.
Cost inflation doesn't drive the pricing outlook, I totally agree. It's a product-by-product value proposition question, but
it does change probably the economics of private label. It changes the economics of retailers, and it changes the
economics of households.
So my specific question would be when you look at the consumer environment right now, just starting to see some cost
inflation in some categories, just starting to see IRI pricing across the store, certainly in some of the commodities
businesses come up after a period of coming down, how is this different than the period of '06 – '07 when costs were
going up with unemployment lower? I think that's the key question. Is it different?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: What you're asking is how will the
consumer react?

<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Exactly. How does the retailer react right now?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The consumer reacts to innovation.
Take Dip & Squeeze versus a pouch of ketchup. We know how the consumer is going to react to Dip & Squeeze, and
yet the customer is going to pay more for Dip & Squeeze than they'd pay for pouch ketchup because it's a premier,
superior product. It gives them three times as much product as a pouch. It's got enormous innovation and enormous
appeal to consumers, so we know that.
We know, for example, consumers have been prepared to pay for Simply Heinz because they want to make the tradeoff
between fructose and sugar. So there's a select group of consumers that will make that tradeoff. We know, for example,
that consumers in China on baby food will pay more for products that they perceive as premium products and offer
benefits from a nutritional aspect to their children that other products don't make.
We know, for example, that UK consumers are going to pay more for Fridge Pack beans because Fridge Pack beans
solves a major problem much as Steam n' Mash did in the United States. And the major problem is, and you'll see it in
the advertising, that you open a typical refrigerator in the UK and you'll see beans piled in jars, plates, paper plates,
paper cups, glasses, tin cans, half a can, plastic jars, whatever it may be. And now they have a resealable package that
allows them to put it in the refrigerator, use it whenever they want. It stays fresh for five or six days, and so we know
they'll pay for that.
I think you have to keep in mind that it varies significantly by product and it varies significantly by the opportunities on
each of those products. But consumers have made tradeoffs, and consumers will make a tradeoff to a product that adds
value. I think marketers' jobs is to create added value. We always talk about value, but I think we have to change the
definition of value from a consumer aspect. We have to ensure that we're enhancing the levels of innovation we take to
consumers so that the consumer becomes indifferent to whether or not he or she is paying a higher price because he's
getting added value.
So my view of a marketer's job is just to create new value. And price is an aspect of that value as is package quality,
product quality, sustainability, all sorts of things. And you'll see a lot of innovation in this company in the second half
of the year that I think reflects that. And I'm not – again, I'm not trying to be obstreperous and I'm certainly not trying
to be contumacious, but I just think it's important that you understand that I have very specific philosophies about
pricing.
And as all of you know, I'm not shy with my opinions. It sometimes gets me in trouble, but sometimes it, I just give
you my view. You ask me a question, I give you my view. And if I hurt anybody's feelings, I apologize. I'm a coach's
son. I never remember my dad walking into a team meeting and saying, now fellows, if you would please do this, I
would be very appreciative. I remember walking in the meeting, say get your tail off the chair and get on the field. So
you have to excuse me if I've offended anybody.

thing to do. How big is the Chinese business now? And what do you think investors can reasonably expect from you
guys in China as we move through the next call it say three to five years?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It's a very good question, Terry. Let
me put it you this way. One-third of our employees are now in China, one-third. We have 12 manufacturing facilities.
We have a baby food business that's growing very rapidly. The Foodstar business, which gives us entree into the heart
and soul of this company, which is condiments and sauces, it is doing very well. It gives us a base with the Weijixian
product, which is 25% of the total soy sauce market in China which is about a $2 billion market and growing about 7%
– 8%. But Weijixian is growing at twice that rate, 16% – 17%. Foodstar has a 50% market share of that in Fujian and
Guangdong provinces.
Art and I are heading there in the next couple of weeks. We're building a new factory in Shanghai which will allow us
to hit out of the south and go into more of the more northern markets where the business really is and hasn't expanded
yet. I am very enthused about China. Having said that, China is one of a number of markets for us that's very important
in the future. India, our Indian business is growing rapidly. Our Indonesian business is extremely well positioned.
We're looking at opportunities in other markets. And I can tell you this, given the openings beyond China. We are
seeing more M&A opportunities in the emerging markets than I've seen in the last 13 years, and we are busy.
And I think in the context of that we will go where opportunities take us and where we believe we can make a
difference. We think Foodstar is one of those opportunities. We're very enthused about it. We've put a young man in
charge of the business that actually comes out of our Russian team, who was very instrumental in building that Russian
ketchup and sauces business. He has gone in there. We put a good management team in place already.
And so China for us in the next couple or three or four years ought to be two times what it was say last year if not more.
And I think China continues to be the growth engine along with India. And I don't think we can forget India over the
foreseeable future because there are 2.5 billion people in those countries. Eventually there's going to be a massive
emergence of the middle class. And while they will always have periods of dislocation and difficulty the reality is as
I've said and I said in my comments and I've said all along, the CPG industry in the future will be very dependent on
China, India, parts of Latin America, and probably parts of Eastern Europe because you're simply not going to see the
growth in the mature markets in the West that we've seen.
We are well positioned. We've got three good teams now in charge of our business in China. We've got 12
manufacturing facilities. Our supply chain people are spending an enormous amount of time. We just moved a young
guy out of our U.S. business in supply chain to run some of the factories over there. We're putting expertise in place.
We're looking at systems and processes possibly before we get to Keystone over there to integrate the business and
allow us to capture the opportunity from a benchmarking standpoint.
I am very enthused about China, but you should not misinterpret that as China is just a road paved with gold. There are
going to be difficulties in China, and we'll navigate them as we have in the past, but it is clearly a place a CPG
company that's going to be successful has to work.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: And one quick thing. I don't think you're subject to – they've been talking about some price
controls over there, but my understanding is that probably doesn't apply to you, certainly in infant formula. But is there
anything else we need to worry about in that vein that you've heard?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I don't want to comment on
price controls other than to say historically they've never proven very effective, and we'll see. But I think most of the
things they're talking about from a price control standpoint are raw materials and raw commodity products that work
through the stores. They've got some issues in other areas. I am not aware of anything today, Terry, but I want to say
I'm not aware of anything today. And again I'll be there the Monday after Thanksgiving. Art and I are heading over
there and a number of Asian countries and meeting with our teams.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay, travel safely. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, thank you.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance>: Hi, Andrew.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: I think my vocabulary needs a little bit of work after listening to this call; I guess two quick
things because I know we're running short on time. First, how much of your 3% to 4% full-year sales guidance I guess
is helped by the Foodstar deal? I want to get a sense of how much that's contributing to the three to four and what that
means for I guess what you consider organic sales growth for the year.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: As I answered earlier, we've never
said three to four would be organic. We've said three to four would be constant currency, and Foodstar will contribute
to it in the second half of the year. I don't – off the top of my head, Andrew, I can't give you a precise number, but it's
certainly – maybe 30 basis points somewhere in there. It's hard – maybe a little more, but a lot of it depends on how
much we grow Foodstar also.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Right, right. Okay, thank you. And then you talked about lower lifts or returns on some of the
promotional spend, and certainly others have too and things – you're going to be a little bit more balanced or thoughtful
about it going into the back half of your fiscal year. You had some experience with this I guess last year, right, where in
the beginning of your fiscal year you were a little less aggressive. Volume weakened a bit and you ramped it up a bit
with the CVP in the back half. I guess what's different this time or what have you learned from that experience that
makes you more comfortable with that strategy this time and feeling reasonably okay about where volume will come
out given previous experiences?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We're not getting returns. It's really
that simple. We're just not seeing the kinds of lifts you would historically associate with the kinds of deal spending that
we've implemented in parts of our U.S. business and parts of our Western European business.
Secondly, I think as we evaluate where to best put our marketing to get the maximum returns, it's not necessarily in
some of those businesses from a deal standpoint. It's in some of the emerging market consumer businesses. And in the
case of the emerging markets, some of the modern trade, where we still have distribution voids and we think we can get
more response for our dollars.
And then third, it's just – it's a function of at this point in time. And that point in time could change six, nine months
from now. But at this point in time, we're just not getting the kind of response that I would have liked to have seen from
the consumers in our businesses where we deal aggressively or where we merchandise aggressively. And I think we
had pretty good experience with this on ketchup in the first quarter of this year. And while we got some lifts by
bringing other people in, we also loaded a few pantries. And I'm just not sure it's the way you create value for the
consumer. The consumers have become far more, I think, sophisticated in looking for value. And again, that's why
we're focused. As I've said on Smart Ones all along, we continue to be focused on innovation. And premiumization is
really related to innovation. And if we do our job there, we'll be okay.
But you never say never, and things change at halftime and things change at the end of the third quarter, and sometimes
you do things that you didn't think you would do, and other times you adjust. But we tend to be a company that's pretty
adept at adjusting on the fly. So what we're doing is adjusting here on the fly because we're simply not getting the kind
of response.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks very much.
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And having said that, you've seen
our share performance in some of the big developed markets, so shares are still quite strong. And so to Bill's point, we

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Hi, Chris. Let's make it quick. We've got lots in
queue.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi. Yes, if I can just ask two quick ones. My question was, are you seeing the proper
returns from advertising as well? So as you pull back on promotion, are you putting more money into advertising? And
is that – are you getting the proper return from that money I guess in the right markets?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The answer to that is yes. And
again, we're going to get a good test of this real quickly in the UK on Fridge Pack, where the advertising – it's really
fun advertising. It's 15 seconds, and when you see it, there's no verbiage in it, none, and it is incredibly breakthrough.
We're seeing it in Ore-Ida, where we advertise Ore-Ida. We're seeing it on TGIF. We're seeing it obviously in emerging
markets.
So we're seeing a good response where we have something to say. Where we don't have anything to say, we're not
seeing much of a response at all. It's working very well in ketchup across Europe where we're using multiple kinds of
advertising. Secret Ingredient is running in the UK now and it's doing very well, we're getting good ketchup lifts. We're
seeing Grown Not Made still being used in Russia and other parts of Europe where we're getting good lift. So it just
depends on the business, Chris, but generally we've been very selective within – generally where we're running
advertising we're seeing decent lifts, yes.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And my last question would be are you taking the experience of China in infant
formula and basically using that to decide if and when and in what form you'd launch it in Russia? Is there any
timetable for launching it in Russia?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, there is no timetable for
launching it in Russia. And yes, we are using the experience along with the conditions of the marketplace and what we
would bring to that marketplace vis-à-vis China, where we an incredibly strong brand in Infant/Nutrition. As I said, I'm
speaking to a large symposium of pediatricians and health officials in China two weeks from today where we'll talk
about this, and we'll also talk about the Heinz Micronutrient program. Again, it's going to depend on a lot of other
things besides whether or not we think it would work there, and there are other markets we're also looking at.

been in emerging markets for a long time and have a lot of scale is where they'd rather be. Maybe you could put it in
this context. What do you think that you're doing better than the big Western companies that have been there for a long
time? What are your advantages? And what advantages do you think they do have over you that you think you can
close the gap on?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Let's talk about that. Let's talk about
Russia for a minute. Let's talk about a business we bought about three or four years ago called Petrosoyuz and had
about 57 different kinds of brands. I'm making up a number. And we put the Heinz brand on most of it. We are now
number one in condiments and sauces. Our bean business is growing rapidly. We just became number one in baby
cereals over there. What we have in Russia is a spectacular brand Russian consumers have said they want.
In the other markets, we have built terrific infrastructure. None of them are as well structured as we are in Indonesia.
There are 240 million people in Indonesia depending on which census you look at and which numbers you believe. But
nonetheless, our business in Indonesia, we have an incredible brand in ABC. That is our brand in Indonesia. It's a
business that was well under 100 million when we bought it, and is now pushing well over 300 million, and it's well
structured. We have one of best distribution reaches of anybody in Indonesia.
In India, we have a business that was $25 million or $30 million when we bought that this year will be well north of
$200 million with a brand that's growing in the upper 20s and another brand in Glucon-D that's growing almost as fast.
We've got great brands and we've got great teams and we've got great people and we've got great infrastructure. The
other benefit to us, yes, they're big. They've got a lot of scale. It's also 30% – 35% of their business. For us, it's still
only 15%, 16%, 17% of our business.
And so as we reposition over time, the impact to us given our size now and given how relatively insignificant it has
been and how significant it has become, we have huge upside in terms of what we can do. A Foodstar acquisition to us
makes a big difference as we go into China, leverage our capabilities, leverage our distribution strength, leverage our
reach, and then leverage our core competencies of condiments and sauces, and then take those strengths and
competencies to the Foodstar business where we – if we double the Foodstar business it has a huge impact on us overall
as a company. If somebody else doubled the Foodstar business it would be a pin prick in terms of the impact of their
business.
So yes, I hear this stuff on scale. But I also look at our emerging market business which over the last two or three years
has generated consistent double-digit organic growth and where we continue to attract really talented people, and where
we continue to build great infrastructure, great distribution, great reach, and great share results. We compete with these
guys in condiments and sauces in Russia. I think we've done pretty well. We compete with these guys with baby food
in China. We have the leading cereal business. I think we've done pretty well. We compete with these people in Glucon
and Complan in India. I think we've done pretty well.
So I think in the context, you have to keep everything in perspective. And where we have chosen to operate, we are
operating pretty well, particularly relative to our American based peers. There's no doubt that Nestlé, who I consider to
be one of the great companies in the world. I think the world of its management team and the world of the people at
Nestlé. There's no doubt that they have a great deal of expertise in those markets, but so do we. And I think it's a bit
besmirching to use a word that was used earlier of peers to denigrate the size we have in these markets because we are
being very damn successful and you can't deny the results.
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And the other thing, Rob, I'd point
out is the operating model that we employ. We're I think very good at empowering the local teams to react very quickly
and swiftly and proactively in the local markets, so we probably have a bit of an advantage in that regard. And that has
helped drive our performance.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And I think over time, Rob, it will
either prove itself or it won't. And I feel pretty good about where we're headed.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question, just a much more micro question.
Tomato costs in China, right now there's a shortage. And as I understand it tomato prices are up at least 50%, if not
more, and they're actually difficult to get. So how do – A), are you seeing this? B), will this impact at all your second
half I guess in the vein of what you saw in the first half with the chili shortage in Indonesia, the Ramadan shift,
anything that we should think about in terms of how that impacts your second half?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It had virtually no impact on us
because our tomato products business in China is very small, and soy sauce is not a tomato based product. So I think
from that standpoint in China, it has little impact. In Europe it'll have minor impact because we've got alternate sources
for tomatoes anyway. We also have a joint venture in China with one of the leading agricultural companies, and we're
fully aware of this. But I think from our standpoint, Bryan, it's virtually insignificant.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay, thanks.
