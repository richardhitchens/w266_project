MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Accenture's First Quarter Fiscal 2011 Earnings Call.
At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator
Instructions]
I'll now turn the conference over to K.C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
K.C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations
Thank you, Kathy. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our First Quarter Fiscal 2011 Earnings
Announcement. As Kathy just mentioned, I'm K.C. McClure, managing Director of Investor Relations. With me this
afternoon are Bill Green, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer; and
Pierre Nanterme, who will become our Chief Executive Officer on January 1st.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly out outline
the agenda for today's call. Bill will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter.
Bill will then provide a brief update on our growth strategy and market positioning. Pam will then provide our business
outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2011. And then we will take your questions.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursement, or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking, and you should keep in mind these

limited to general economic conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the Risk
Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news
release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now let me turn the call over Bill.
William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, K.C, and thanks, everyone, to for joining us today.
Well, the momentum continues, and it's building. I am incredibly pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We
achieved very strong growth at both the top and bottom line, building even further on our performance from the second
half of fiscal 2010.
Here are some highlights from the quarter. Revenues were more than $6 billion. This is our second-highest quarterly
revenues ever and exceeded upper end of our guided range. Of particular significance, four out of our five operating
groups achieved double-digit revenue growth in both U.S. dollars and local currency. We delivered earnings per share
of $0.81, an increase of $0.14 or 20% over Q1 of last year. Operating income was $827 million, also our
second-highest ever, with strong operating margin of 13.7%. We generated solid new bookings of $6.3 billion,
including outstanding consulting bookings of more than $3.7 billion.
And we continue to have a very strong balance sheet, with a cash balance of $4.2 billion and, of course, no debt. Our
exceptionally strong results in the first quarter position us very well for the remainder of the year, 2011, and frankly,
the future.
With that, let me turn the call over Pam, who will provide some more detail on the numbers.
Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Bill. Best wishes for this season, and thank you, all for joining us today. I am pleased to tell you more about
Accenture's fiscal year 2011 first quarter financial results.
We recorded overall outstanding revenue growth across the dimensions of our business, in both consulting and
outsourcing, around the world, and in the broad base of clients and industries we serve. In addition, we continue to
drive the business, delivering net revenue growth well into the double-digits in four of our five operating groups. We
have posted up a strong first quarter toward the full-year financial outlook we provided last quarter.
Unless I state otherwise, all figures are GAAP, except the items that are not part of the financial statements or that are
calculations. New bookings for the quarter were $6.31 billion and reflected a negative 1% foreign exchange impact,
compared with new booking in the first quarter last year. Consulting bookings were $3.72 billion. Outsourcing
bookings were $2.59 billion. Consulting bookings were the highest in 10 quarters and reflected broad-based
year-over-year growth. In management consulting, clients are hiring us to help them drive both operational excellence
and growth in their businesses. Bookings were very strong in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We continued to see robust
demand from clients for our offerings in supply chain optimization, customer service effectiveness, and sales and
marketing transformation. This quarter's bookings also reflected healthy demand for our strategy offerings in
post-merger integration and global operating model design, and also, our talent and organizational performance
offerings. Finally, activity is building in the areas of risk management and new market entry.
In technology consulting, bookings were strong, as our clients continue to seek sound, unbiased strategies they can
implement to improve their technology infrastructures. Their interest in innovation and flexibility continues to grow in

order to drive down IT cost through increased use of virtualization, and the cloud. At the same time, they continue to
rationalize legacy operations through data center consolidation, application modernization, and renewal, and address
security and IT governance.
In systems integration, bookings were the highest in nine quarters. The SI business has rebounded nicely and is
showing increasing strength. Post-merger integration and rationalization of technology platforms are major drivers.
Client demand also, reflects the critical need for modernization of legacy applications, as well as the implementation
and upgrades to ERP applications. We are particularly pleased with this level of bookings, given that we are also
proactively and successfully managing the shift of SI work to lower-cost locations.
Turning to outsourcing, bookings were right in line with what we expected in September, when I stated we thought
they would be relatively lighter this quarter. In technology outsourcing, cost optimization remains paramount, and we
are benefiting from the vendor consolidation that has occurred. We recorded a significant number of wins and saw
clients launching more projects. We also have a healthy expansion in our pipeline. Finally, our solid BPO bookings
reflected demand for cost-effective solutions in finance and accounting, procurement, and industry-specific processes,
particularly in North America and Europe.
Now, turning to revenue. Net revenues for the first quarter were $6.05 billion, an increase of 12% in U.S. dollars and
14% in local currency from the same period last year. These revenues reflected a rounded foreign exchange impact of
negative 1%, compared with Q1 last year. Consulting revenues were $3.57 billion, an increase of 14% in U.S. dollars
and 16% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $2.48 billion, an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars and 11% in
local currency.
Let me give you a little color on each operating group.
In Financial Services, revenues grew 21% in local currency. Consulting revenues were a record in both dollars and
year-over-year growth. We saw demand in all three industry groups. The demand for our services related to
post-merger integration, core banking and insurance replatforming, risk and regulatory compliance, and business model
transformation drove the momentum this quarter.
Resources revenue growth at 18% in local currency this quarter reflected double-digit gains in both consulting and
outsourcing. Consulting growth continued to be driven by demand for global operating model design, ERP, operational
excellence, and smart grid related projects. Similar to last quarter, outsourcing revenues reflected demand for client
programs around cost takeout in IT and financial business processes.
The Products operating group had local currency growth of 17%, driven by very strong growth in consulting. Demand
is across virtually all of the industry groups and products, with both new and existing clients starting to expand beyond
cost-cutting projects to more customer-focused offerings to drive their growth. In addition, we saw good revenue
growth in Asia-Pacific, where we are working with clients on global expansion strategies.
Communications & High-Tech revenues increased 12% in local currency, up from 7% last quarter. Consulting demand
continues to be driven by strategic sourcing, globalization, cost takeout, and customer acquisition and retention, as well
as deploying new technologies to support growing wireless product demand. In addition, we saw more interest from
clients developing differentiated capabilities, such as improved broadband content delivery, and the management of
investments in cloud computing. Outsourcing revenues in C&HT grew as well in Q1, as clients continued to focus on
cost takeout and improving operational efficiency.
Health & Public Service revenues were down 1% in local currency, as uncertainty and challenges in the public sector
continue, particularly in Europe. Consulting revenues declined modestly in Public Service and were partially offset by
growth in Health, particularly in the Americas. We are leading some of the most defining health engagements around
the globe and investing to take Health to the next level. Outsourcing revenues grew again this quarter, primarily driven
by U.S. federal.
In summary, the outstanding revenue results are evidence of healthy demand for our offerings across the majority of
our industry groups and geographies.

Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 32.2%, down from 33.1%, a 90 basis point decrease from Q1
last year. The return of strong growth and demand in the business resulted in higher subcontractor needs and higher
recruiting and training activities from the onboarding of many more employees. This year's gross margin also reflects
our take-up of significantly higher compensation increases, effective this September versus last September.
Sales and marketing costs were $731 million, or 12.1% of net revenues, compared with $622 million, or 11.6% of net
revenues for the first quarter last year. The 50 basis point increase reflected higher business development costs as we
continue to grow our sales pipeline and new bookings. General and administrative costs were $386 million, or 6.4% of
net revenues, compared with $412 million, or 7.7% of net revenues for the first quarter last year. The 130 basis point
decrease reflects an 80 basis point impact from our continued efforts to actively manage our cost structure, with the
remaining 50 basis point decrease coming from a reduction of part of our bad debt reserve due to better-than-expected
bad debt experience.
Operating income for the quarter increased 11% to $827 million, resulting in a 13.7% operating margin, a 20 basis
point decrease, compared with Q1 of last year. As Bill mentioned, this level of operating income was our second
highest ever. Three of our operating groups delivered strong results in operating income and margin in the first quarter.
The operating income in Health & Public Service was negatively impacted by continued lower contract profitability in
parts of the Public Service portfolio and higher selling costs.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.3%, compared with 30.5% in the first quarter last year. The lower rate this
year was due to a number of factors that impact the geographic distribution of income.
Net income for the quarter was $606 million, compared with $525 million for the first quarter last year, an increase of
15%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.81, compared with $0.67 in the first quarter last year. This $0.14 rise reflects
an $0.08 increase from higher revenue and operating income in local currency, a $0.04 increase from a lower share
count, a $0.02 increase from the lower effective income tax rate, and a $0.01 increase from higher non-operating
income, offset by a $0.01 decrease from foreign exchange rates.
Now let's turn to some key parts of our cash flow and balance sheet. Free cash flow for the quarter was $31 million,
resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $106 million, net of property and equipment additions of $75
million. For the same period last year, free cash flow was $184 million. Our property and equipment additions more
than doubled, and the level of free cash flow this quarter also reflected a rise in working capital, as our revenue ramped
during the quarter.
Turning to DSOs, our days servicing outstanding were 33 days, up from 30 days last quarter and 32 days in the same
quarter last year. We continue to focus on strong working capital management. Our total cash balance at November
30th was $4.2 billion, versus $4.8 billion at the end of August. As you can see on our cash flow statement, the free cash
flow in the quarter was more than offset by the cash we returned to shareholders and a slight uptick in M&A.
Turning to some key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with global head count of 211,000 people, and we now
have 120,000 people in our global delivery network. In Q1, our utilization rounded to 87%, up less than half a point
from Q4. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 15%, down from 17% in Q4. And lastly, we continue
to plan to hire at least 64,000 people around the world this year.
Before I turn things back to Bill, I will comment on our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through share
repurchases and dividends. In the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 14.6 million shares for $620
million at an average price of $42.37 per share, including 3.2 million shares repurchased in the open market.
Repurchases included $170 million worth of shares employees sold back to us in order to fund their tax withholding
obligations for shares delivered to them in Q1. At November 30th we had $2.5 billion of share repurchase authority
remaining.
Also in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $0.45 per share, which was a $0.075 or 20% increase over
the dividend we paid in May, for a total of $321 million. We expect that our board of directors will declare the second
part of our semiannual dividend at the time of our Q2 earnings call.

In summary, we're off to a great start in fiscal '11, beginning the year with a strong Q1 and good momentum going into
Q2. We are focused on executing our strategy and driving our business with discipline.
Now here's Bill to give you his look ahead.
William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Pam. Over the past year, we've talked to about our two major areas of focus: First, navigating the
challenging and changing environment in a focused and disciplined way and delivering a great result. Second, all we're
doing to position Accenture for the future, by launching and driving a series of strategic actions. What you're seeing is
the impact of both, accelerating new business on top of a solid and profitable operational platform.
And we continue to execute our growth initiatives exceptionally well across three dimensions. First, our core business.
This is the backbone and includes our traditional services of consulting, technology, and outsourcing, refreshed and
relevant for today's market, not yesterday's. Our unique ability to serve clients across the entire stack is what clients
want now. Second, our new initiatives in businesses, including things like analytics, mobility, smart grid, and digital
marketing, and the many other new products and services, especially in the technology area. We're building these
within and on top of our core, and all of them are getting traction and kicking in. And third, our geographic expansion
agenda. Focusing our leadership position in emerging and fast-growing markets, as well as increasing growth, market
share, and profit in our most developed and mature markets. We are doing more work in more places for more people
than ever to help our clients [audio gap] high performance.
I think you'll agree that our excellent results in Q1, coupled with the fact that we are gaining market share in virtually
every part of our business, clearly show that we're executing this growth agenda extremely well. We are very close to
our clients, helping them with their critical new initiatives, while at the same time, staying focused on running
Accenture as a high-performance business. As a result, we have great momentum, are on a solid trajectory for
continued growth, and more importantly, are expanding our market leadership.
As you know, Pierre Nanterme, who is here with us in Boston this week, will become the CEO on January 1st, so I
thought it would be good for you to hear from Pierre. Pierre?
Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer Designate
Thanks, Bill. I'm delighted to be here today, and I can tell you that the transition with Bill is going exceptionally well.
Let me start by saying that my first and highest priority will be to work with Pam and the rest our leadership team to
deliver on our priorities and commitments for fiscal year '11, building on the last few quarters. We are on a strong
trajectory with the right actions for capturing growth on the way. So, you should not expect any big changes in our
strategy moving forward. My focus will be on accelerating the execution of our growth agenda to make sure we are
capturing the growth opportunities we see in the marketplace.
Now, let me share with you a few principles that I hold deeply.
The first is profitable growth. Growth without profits doesn't mean much. This is the discipline we demonstrated in the
Financial Services operating group, as reflected in our Q1 results. We will pursue robust growth while making smart
investments and improving profits.
Second, bringing the best of Accenture. Our clients, who are so important to us, are the envy of the industry, especially
our Diamond client relationships. Over time, we expect to significantly increase the number of Diamond clients we
have for even greater durability in our business.
Third, shareholders as partners. From my experience in the financial services industry, I understand what the market
expects: openness, transparency, and responsiveness. You can be assured that I and the rest of our leadership team are
totally committed to this.

Fourth, sustained leadership. We will never cede our market position. Our goal is to remain the leader in our industry.
We will always stay relevant to our clients, and the industries we serve, and we will continue to be the company that
the competition wants to be like.
And finally, our highly skilled people. The incredibly talented group of Accenture people around the world who are so
committed to the success of our clients make me even more confident in our ability to achieve our goals.
So we are on a good trajectory for growth, and I am very excited about taking on the CEO role. I believe there are great
opportunities ahead for Accenture.
Now, let me turn the call back to Pam, who will provide our business outlook.
Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Pierre.
As a reminder, each quarter we provide an outlook for the next quarter's revenue and an update on our annual outlook
for the full fiscal year. As we've stated throughout this call, we are very pleased with the momentum in the first quarter,
as our strategy of strong business propositions for our clients is working. We also recognize that the global economy
continues to have a mix of positive and negative news around the world, and we remain vigilant about that. We know
we need to continue to drive a focused strategy of what generates value for money for our clients, and to manage our
business with discipline.
So for the second quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion. This range assumes a
foreign exchange impact of negative 2% for the quarter and reflects the foreign exchange rates over the past few weeks.
Now turning to the full fiscal year, we are now assuming a foreign exchange impact of 0%. Based on our qualified
pipeline, strong demand for our services continues. We are raising our fiscal year '11 revenue outlook to be 8% to 11%
growth in local currency. And based on our Q1 results, and what we see for Q2, we believe we are tilting forward the
high end of that range.
We continue to expect new bookings for the fiscal year to land in the range of $25 billion to $28 billion. We continue to
expect operating margin to be in the range of 13.6% to 13.7%. You should expect some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter
as we've seen in the past. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 29%. We
now expect our earnings per share for the full fiscal year to be in the range of $3.08 to $3.16, an increase of $0.08.
About five pennies of the increase is due to higher revenue at the same operating margin, and about three pennies is due
to the updated assumption from the impact of foreign exchange on our results.
Finally, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, property and
equipment additions to be $340 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. Our free
cash flow this year, compared to last year assumes slightly higher DSOs, higher tax cash payments due to their timing,
higher property and equipment additions, and higher bonus payments related to fiscal year '10 performance. The impact
of these items will continue into Q2 and have the biggest impact on our free cash flow during the first half of the year.
As you know, most of our free cash flow is generated in the second half of our fiscal year.
As our fiscal Q2 takes shape and we turn now into calendar year '11, we are positioned well to drive revenue growth
and market share for our broad and durable base of services. And at the same time, we will continue to responsibly
invest in developing talent and new business while maintaining a strong balance sheet and cash flow generation.
So with that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. K.C.?

Thanks, Pam. I would ask that you each keep your questions limited to one question and one follow-up and allow as
many participants as possible to ask questions. Kathy, would you provide instructions for those on the call?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: All right, guys. Hey, just wanted to talk about the revenue acceleration, or at least the apparent
acceleration in demand here. So, you beat consensus by 5% on revenues. And I guess I'm wondering if you've been at
all supply-constrained in recent months. In other words, are you seeing above-normal cases where you actually don't
have enough staff to meet the demand that you're seeing in the market, given that you far exceeded the upper end of
your revenue range? Or have you been nimble enough to hire fast enough to meet the demand that you're seeing?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Rod, this is Bill. I think – I mean, one of the
things I'm just incredibly proud of is our ability to onboard people, have them trained, have them deployed, and deliver
87% utilization while we're doing that. I mean, you know how the economics of our business works, and the
management of supply and demand is just critical. And we were able to mobilize and get people in the door and get
them productive. And we continued on that journey actually, continued with that momentum.
And so I think we were able to respond to the increase in demand in a first-class way, and we believe – and Pam
mentioned our target for this year. We believe we'll be able to continue to do that. We also had a 2-point improvement
in our attrition, which means a lot to us as well.
But I think it's interesting because what we've seen is the intersection of an improving economy. And I think if you put
an improving economy with a series of tech waves, and the fact that I think as a company we are executing in an
exceptional way on just about every dimension, we've been able to take advantage of the growth opportunities we see
in the market. And not only onboard more work, but to be doing really, frankly, higher-quality work as well.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: All right. So, Bill, can you elaborate on the tech waves that you're seeing that are kind of across
the board as the economy improves? And specifically in the area of cloud, are you having enough activity in the cloud
arena to declare that cloud will definitely be a net opportunity for Accenture's demand rather than a net threat? Thanks
a lot.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I guess let me sort of back into it. I think,
first of all, there's a series of technology waves. One of them is quite simply just a delayed refresh. People that had
slowed spending in the technology space are starting to accelerate. Then you add virtualization, and the cloud, and
mobility is also another important wave. So, there's a series of things going on there.
And right now, we just see – we see ourselves kind of at the front end of everybody figuring out how do I ride these
waves in a sort of practical and a pragmatic and an economically responsible way? And so we're doing a lot of work on
what people's strategy should be. Some of that is the rationalization of current environments to be prepared for the
cloud. And others – how are people going to get from where they are to the cloud over the next three to five years and
take advantage of the innovations that have come out in the marketplace in the last 12 to 18 months?
So we see this thing as a huge business-booster to Accenture. We see ourselves at the intersection of trade and
commerce, as it relates to the onboarding, and the on-ramping to the cloud, which we've talked about. And I think
importantly, a lot of our clients have a lot more confidence in their business, and they're positioning themselves now to
make more investments in 2011 as we get into the calendar year.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: All right. Well said. Thanks, guys.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.

We'll go next to Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Hi, this is Nathan Rozof on for Adam Frisch. Pierre, let me be the first to welcome you to the
earnings call circuit. I had a question for you. One of the things that we posed during the Analysts Day was a question
about Accenture's financial identity. Really what that is – kind of the relative prioritization between revenue growth
and margin expansion. And with your new role that you're going to be taking on here in a month or so, we wanted to
get your thoughts on really how you see the interplay between revenue growth and margins for Accenture going
forward.
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer Designate>: Thanks for the question. And I'm very pleased to be
with you today here in Boston. I mean, you know our financial identity, as you say, has always been around profitable
growth, and we will probably never trade one against the other. This is exactly my intent, to continue with that
discipline. We've been able over time and especially this last quarter to post excellent growth, together with as well
excellent profit, and this is what we will continue to do moving forward.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Thank you. And then for our follow-up question, I wanted to turn over to bookings. Obviously,
bookings started off strong; I think as of the fourth quarter call, bookings were up 14% versus where they were at that
time last year and continued through the quarter. Can you guys give us any insight as to how bookings are then
progressing into the fiscal second quarter and in terms of where you are kind of year-to-date versus last year?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I'll take that one, Nathan. I mean, as you can see, the
consulting bookings continued to be very strong. We had $3.5 billion in Q4; we're up over $3.7 billion in this quarter,
highest in 10 quarters. And so that continues. The outsourcing bookings this quarter, as I had signaled, we did expect
them to be relatively light. Interestingly they weren't as light as most of the last several first quarters. And I can't tell
you why first quarter is lighter, to be honest, but we did feel that way, and we do expect them to trend up next quarter
for sure.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Thanks, I appreciate it. And Bill, I know you're not going far, but we each wanted to wish you
all the best in your new role.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you very much.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks, Nathan.

<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Yeah, it's a busy night. Busy night for all of us.
We were just in India and came back, and we had a chance to meet with you guys and a bunch of other companies that
were down there. And the pace of activity, the sentiment, was so positive for offshore, I wanted you guys to maybe
kind of dig in a little bit deeper in terms of this continued transition that you guys have talked about. How much further
does it go? Because as it is already, it's a major part of your head count – I think, what's it, half of your head count –
and by our own estimates, we think that you guys are approaching somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 billion to $6
billion of revenues. So, my question, I guess, very specifically is when does all of this offshore stuff actually begin to
benefit you guys from a margin perspective? Because if I look at the margin profile of all these other companies that do
offshoring, it's much higher. Why should we not expect it to also help you guys benefit your margin profile as well?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think over time, you probably should, and
you probably should be demanding on that dimension.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: I'm demanding, I'm demanding.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I know that. I know that. I mean, and so are
we, right?. We continue to work on our cost to serve. Unlike others, we had this journey, right, of some work that was
onshore traditionally to offshore. For instance, we talk about India a lot, but I was in Manila two or three weeks ago,
20,000 employees, we'll have 25,000 by the end of year, we've been in the country 25 years, we opened three new
buildings. I mean, this thing is just going to continue. And we keep getting scale, and we keep getting better at it, and
we keep industrializing and some of the things that you've seen down there. And I think all that's going to serve us well.
I think it's notable, though, that we've been able to continue to deliver and execute it in a superb way while we manage
this onshore-to-offshore transition in, really, frankly, a very seamless way, as it relates to our clients, which is the first
thing. And then secondly, as it relates to our economic result. And we continue to focus on mining more profits out of
the opportunities we have because of the global delivery network.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Got it.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: We, we -
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Sorry, go ahead.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Let Pam follow.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: I'll give you little bit, right, because that was it. But we're very
pleased with the cost to serve, and the progress that we have made there. And we're going to continue to tackle the rest
of the cost structure, Julio. I mean, we don't ever see that as an ending thing, right? So we have stuff under way this
year to sort of tackle the whole selling side of things, and as you know, we hold the line on G&A.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Understood. And one last thing. The other point that was really clear too was just this
mentality, right, that the way that the models are changing for – part of the offshore guys moving up as well, right, is
switching to more of a demand-generation mentality. And every time I hear that, I almost feel like, well, that's what
you guys do, right? So do you have to change the way that you guys approach the marketplace today, or is the model
with offshore what you've to continue to take to the marketplace just to stay effective?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I mean, I think the offshore dimension just
added a whole new life to Accenture over the past five to eight years. This going-up-the-stack stuff is not for the faint
of heart. I mean, it is incredibly hard to do, and I would just tell you that I've seen people taking bigger things
horizontally, but very few really moving up the stack.
And the interesting thing about the recovery, the economic recovery, is – and we always talked about this – it wasn't a
recession, it was a reset, and that buyer values were going to be different when they came back. And the thing that is
incredibly different as buyer values come back and as people start investing again, is they expect companies to be able
to provide the full stack of services from envision and architect, design and build, and operate on behalf of their

You have a question from Jason Kupferberg with UBS.
<Q - Jason Kupferberg>: Hey, thanks, guys. Bill, just wanted to pick up on one of the drivers you talked about. I
think you mentioned delayed refresh. And just wanted to get a read from you whether or not we should interpret that as
kind of release of pent-up demand, if you will. It clearly seems like you see some of that persisting into calendar 2011.
But do you feel like the industry, including yourselves, are still riding a wave of pent-up demand that at some point
kind of peters out? And I guess where I'm ultimately going with this is how do you see the structural growth rate of
Accenture going forward? You guys are going to do 8% to 11% this year, maybe near the upper end of the range, albeit
off a pretty easy year-over-year comparison. But where does that leave us in terms of thinking longer term if we try and
separate what might be the refresh, and the pent-up demand from kind of the underlying trends that you see out there?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I mean, I think you're going down a rat
hole with this pent-up demand thing, to be perfectly honest. We look at our business, we can grow 7% to 10%
consistently over a business cycle. Now, let's hope we have a business cycle that's many, many years, and let's hope we
can outperform that. We're delighted with where we're starting.
But what you're really seeing this year is people were cautious about spending in calendar 2010, and now we're getting
to the end of calendar 2010, and people are feeling more confident about their business, so they're spending a little
more money. I'm not sure it's pent-up demand per se; it's just more confidence in investing in the business. And I think
that's going to just fall right over into 2011. I don't think it's anything about a release of pent-up demand; I think it's
going to be just a higher level of people investing in their business in order to get better economic results.
And there's no question that people had held off a lot of investments that people are going to now start to do. And I
think what we're just seeing is the confidence that's returned in management and companies across the board has had
people get ahead of some of those investments. But I think it's something that's consistent, and I think it's going to
continue into the medium term at least.
<Q - Jason Kupferberg>: Okay -
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Let me give you a few more facts here, Jason. Our qualified
pipeline, if we look at just how it's been building over the year, it's up, just in consulting alone, 25% year-over-year. So,
I mean, we don't see sort of pent-up demand stuff in there, right? I mean, this is stuff that we expect to continue. I told
you last quarter that we saw 14% more revenue in our backlog for this year than we had seen the prior year. As I look
at this quarter ahead, the nine months versus last year's nine months ahead, 13% more, right? So this is not about things
sort of popping and coming down. I mean, this is a very steady increase that we see in terms of our pipeline and future
look for our business.
<Q - Jason Kupferberg>: Okay. No, those stats are really helpful. And maybe if we can just pick up on some of the
offshore discussion, but switch it over to China. More attention being paid there to some Chinese IT services firms.
They're obviously still pretty small, but can you guys talk a little bit about what you're doing in China? What's
customer demand like? And I'm thinking about this both in terms of servicing local Chinese clients, as well as using
China as part of your DDN. And any numbers you might be able to share around revenue or head count out of China?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we – you know, we have a lot of moving
parts there, but there's sort of three dimensions. First is Dalian and our related offshore capabilities, which continue to
grow. The second is – way back, the business was very much a global, multinational business with a lot less work for
the national companies. And now I would say it's sort of like a third, a third, a third, in terms of head count if you look

across it. And we have actually – even have a Diamond client in China, which is a phenomenal thing, that's a local
company.
So the ambitions of the Chinese company are incredibly high, to compete on the global stage. Pierre knows that from
his work in banking over there. An insurance company in China is about 25 times the size of a big insurance company
here in the United States in terms of customers. And all those companies have their sights set on operating on the global
stage, which means global business practices that were consistent, which means making sure they deliver real value for
money, and making sure that they have sort of the transparency, if you will, in order to be compared against other great
companies around the globe.
So we see China as a good and growing market. It grows at many times the normal rate of Accenture, and we're pleased
with our growth there. But we think the opportunities are just incredible, and the key thing is to capture the market
space with the leading companies. And that's what we're very much focused on.
<Q - Jason Kupferberg>: Can you share the head count number in China or -
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm going to have to wing it, but right now I'd say
it's between 5,000 and 6,000.
<Q - Jason Kupferberg>: Terrific. All right, thanks, guys.

We have Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Thanks, guys. And nice job on bookings again. Just any more color on operating group or
industry verticals? And also, can you talk a bit about the competitive landscape? Specifically, are you seeing more
market share gains, especially in light of the – some of your larger competitors having recently shown only mild growth
or decreases? And then just a quick follow-up.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I guess there's two things. When we went
through this, just in getting ready, we always use this all-cylinders thing, if we can ever get the firm on all cylinders.
And with four of our five operating groups showing double-digit growth, I mean, there's a lot of momentum. And as
Pam mentioned, Health & Public Service continues to be challenged, mostly because of the Public Service dimension.
But that'll work its way out as well. And so I think that's important. And then interesting – our win rates on the new
work have been higher than they were historically. And a lot of the new work – and you see that in consulting bookings
– has a heavy consulting component, which is a place where there aren't that many competitors that can go.
And so if you just look at those dimensions, we feel pretty good about the broad-based momentum that's across the
firm. And even in some of the countries in Europe, where people ask the question, what about Europe? I mean, Europe
is – you really have to look at it in three dimensions. One is the economy, second is the sovereign debt, and the third is
who are our clients? And if you look at who our clients are, they're the big global European companies, right? Their
businesses have a totally different dynamic than the economic condition of Spain. And if you look at the economy,
sovereign debt aside, there's growth in many of the economies over there and some good momentum. So, we're not
down on Europe at all. I know it draws a little fire in the newspaper, but frankly, we feel good about our business there,
and the prospects.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: But even Public Service, because I mean, Health & Public was sequentially a nice pick-up. I
mean, does that seem to be getting a little better?

<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, well, Health – I mean, Health, we're doing
some really profound stuff. I mean, if you look at the Health – if you look at the Health business broadly, all right, it's
sort of all the things we do for the payers, and the people that have to deal with the health administration. We're doing
some of the most defining things around medical records that anybody's doing anywhere in the world, and in fact, we'll
be working on the first project, where an entire country's medical records are totally digitized.
But also important to that is initiatives around the world in new markets where they sort of have a clean sheet of paper
to build the healthcare service industry, if you will. And we're on the front end of that, so we feel particularly good
about what's happening in Health.
Public Service continues to be a rocky ride. The U.K. and the U.S. were – they're not big in terms of the whole of
Accenture, but they're a big component of our Public Service business, and those have been, as you read in the paper,
particularly challenged. But frankly, there's still a lot of money being spent and a lot of services that need to be
deployed, and we're just trying to make sure we're lining up with the right opportunities that are going to continue to go
forward.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: All right. Just a quick follow-up for Pam. Pam, your prior guidance is to return $2.6 billion – I
think it was to return $2.6 billion in capital. This quarter you saw $620 million of buybacks, and with a dividend of
$320 million, you're obviously at a run rate that's a fair amount higher, I think over $3 billion for the year. I didn't hear
you mention guidance on – or an update to that number, the $2.6 billion return. Can you just comment on that number
real quick?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. I don't have an update to it at this point, and of course, the
dividend is twice a year, so this quarter was skewed by that. And at this point we are on track for that $2.6 billion.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

We'll go next to Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Tien-Tsin.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Tien-Tsin.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Hey, good afternoon, good quarter here. I wanted to ask about – I guess I'll ask about the
margins. The G&A cost came in quite low here. A little bit – there's obviously some upside there in terms of the lower
dollar run rate, looks like. So, I'm curious if that was designed to offset some of the gross margin headwinds, and
whether or not this level is permanent, Pam, on the G&A side.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I think what was – I mean, as you know, we've had this
strategy of really holding the line on G&A costs. And so we certainly did that in terms of – so as a percentage of net
revenue, we saw that fall. We also, every quarter, take a look at our bad debt reserve. It's not a big number in the
scheme of things, a very small number on a $20 billion cost base. But because we've had good experience in the last
two years with that, we did take that down a click, that reserve. And that was reflected in the G&A cost as well.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: I see. I see. So, on the gross margin side, I guess you mentioned the use of subs and I guess
training and bonuses. Did you frame how much of the pressure was coming from each, in particular, the
subcontractors? I'm guessing, because that would be temporary.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. No, I mean, in the gross margin this quarter, right, we're in
the process and doing very well with absorbing the salary increases, and obviously, we had some this year. And they
were negligible last year.

So, that's one. And that was job one. But with the demand, right, the revenue did come in higher than we expected. The
demand was even higher. 87% utilization, as Bill said in answer to the first question. So, we did fill in with marginally
more subs this year. And that did have a slight impact on the gross margin. But clearly, we needed to do that, and we
did do that.
Also with onboarding so many people, right, as the revenue started to ramp, we do have higher recruiting and training
costs when we're doing that. So, is it temporary? Yes, in the sense of it's a little ahead of the future revenue.

We have Ed Caso with Wells Fargo Securities.

<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Ed.
<Q - Edward Caso>: Hi, let me add my congratulations.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you.
<Q - Edward Caso>: The acquisitions, there's been a bunch of small ones lately. Did that factor at all into the
guidance for the next quarter or the rest of the year?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: No, not really, Ed. I mean, as you said, there were three small ones
that closed in the first quarter. We've announced another one in Germany. I mean, they're all consistent with our tactical
tuck-in strategy and did not have a big impact on the guidance.
<Q - Edward Caso>: Okay. And can you talk a little bit about the transformational business that you got? Are the
milestones still fairly short, or is the business picking up with shorter milestones? I mean, is there a day where we're
going to again see the $100 million, $200 million ERP implementation?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, you know, we actually do have some of
those that [Laughter]
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: [Laughter] We do.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We just keep – you just think everyone's got it,
and then you realize they don't, right? I was on the phone with a CEO, when they were just going to get started this
morning, actually.
But yeah, I guess what we have found – and we've looked across our Diamond clients for the nature of the work we're
doing and across our portfolios – and the work that has come on in the last three to five months has more of a
transformational bent to it. In other words, people are solving for an outcome as opposed to buying labor. We're
making fundamental changes in how business gets done. It has operating model ramifications at its core. It's not only
technology, but it's process- and people-related as well.
But true to the form over the last several years, people are taking smaller bites. We talked about that. There's interim
gating points, and people are taking it as a pay-as-you-go kind of basis. So, the work content has become more
transformational, which really plays to our consulting power. But at the same time, people aren't signing those $500
million, or $1 billion deals, so they're just more bite-size steps, and things that will go over three to six years, but they'll
do so one step at a time.

Next we have Bryan Keane with Credit Suisse.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan Keane>: Hi, guys. Solid results. I guess just one question I had was the SI business, it sounds like it's
showing increasing strength. But I guess you guys are still seeing deflationary revenue pressure as you shift to more
lower-cost locations. So, I guess my question is how much longer do you have on that, and is there any way to quantify
how much that might be impacting revenues – 2 to 3 points, I'm guessing? But anything along those lines?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I mean, it's absolute – I mean, the hours are up significantly
more than the revenue as the shift occurs, and interestingly there's also, as Bill said, with this uptick in the more
transformation work, there's also more demand onshore interestingly, too. So, this is sort of all in the mix, as we
expected. When we first talked about this in April, we said medium term. So, I mean, we'll still be – we're probably a
little ahead of where we expected to be at this point, but we're going still be doing this this year and next year. And
again, managing it very carefully and at least to-date very successfully.
<Q - Bryan Keane>: But on a longer-term basis, when we get to apples to apples, if it's a couple years from now, that
should automatically help the growth rate?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Absolutely.
<Q - Bryan Keane>: Okay. And then just last question for me – I might have missed this, I'm jumping around a few
calls here. But on the Health & Public margins, I heard there were some investments in there. And the margins were a
little lower than we expected. Should we continue to see those margins at these lower levels, or should it start to spring
back next quarter?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, this year I think is going to be a repositioning year for that
business. I mean, that's what we've said. And we are supporting more investments in terms of selling costs, investment
in the Health business. And we do have some contracts in the Public Service portfolio that are just a little challenged in
terms of profitability right now.
<Q - Bryan Keane>: Okay. That's helpful. Great work. Thanks.

<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Moshe.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Hey, thanks. Pam, can we get some metrics on the revenue growth side, looking at some of the
large European economies, including the U.K.?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, interestingly, I think we had our best growth in the quarter
from France. So, I think that was a particularly appropriate, given our new CEO. And so – I mean, we had good,
positive growth in France, and Italy, and the U.K.; some of the smaller countries also had a very good growth, like
Sweden. And we just had a couple of the smaller ones with negative growth in the quarter.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: And then in the U.K. market, is there a specific vertical that's strong? And I'm focusing on the
U.K. just because it's still – it is still your largest revenue contributor out of Europe, right?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, it is still our largest country in Europe.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, no, I mean, I feel good about the U.K – I
was just there -
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Recently.
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: – some number of days ago. I can't remember.
And both at big, new opportunities, and there were things on the Capital Committee this last week that were big U.K.
opportunities. So, I think that one is we're managing the business we have there very well, but we see a lot more
stability in the country, the economic condition, the banks. Of course, Pierre would know well that financial services
industry has come roaring back, leaving some of the other industries in their wake, but many of those are kicking in as
well.
And so we're very optimistic about the U.K., because they are the homes of some big global companies, and those are
the companies that are our clients. And I think for the most part, their economic performance has improved
dramatically. And maybe most importantly – and I always talk about this with us – the confidence of management of
these companies has improved dramatically. So, people are starting to invest in the future more now than they have
been in the past number of years.
One thing I would just mention, just broadly, is that the Business Roundtable, I think on Tuesday their results came out,
and for the first time in nine quarters, companies saw increasing sales, increasing head count, and increasing capital
expenditure. And we haven't had that in nine quarters. And if you look at some of the other major measures like that
that we look at around the world, it's pretty much consistent with that. So, nobody wants to declare that things are
getting better, and certainly, the media doesn't, but frankly, when you sit with a group of business leaders, people are
looking forward and are starting to become dramatically more optimistic. And certainly, willing and have an imperative
to invest in their business.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: And then just a brief follow-up. I haven't heard too much about pricing on the call. Maybe you
can talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of pricing trends. The tier 1 offshore companies out of India are talking
about some pricing increases and about the fact that clients are willing to kind of let these go through. What's your
feedback on that?
<A - William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I mean, our sort of consensus view is
pricing is stable. I mean, that's kind of – if you take the puts and takes across all the industries and across all the
services we have, pricing is stable, which we're fine with. There's the places where we always have and continue to
historically get very favorable pricing because we have dramatic power. There's still pieces of the business where the
pricing is incredibly challenged, and the work is very competitive. So, our sort of public view is that pricing is stable at
this point.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Great. Thank you.

William D. Green, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
All right, well, thanks, and let me just say a couple things in closing.
First, I couldn't be more pleased with the very strong results in Q1, and the momentum we're seeing in the business.
Momentum is a big deal to us. As we get this machine moving, it generally keeps moving, and I just couldn't be more
pleased that the momentum continues here.
Importantly, I want to thank the now 211,000 men and women of Accenture, whose tremendous efforts and dedication
really are what enable us to deliver value to our clients and to our shareholders alike.
Pierre is stepping into the CEO role in just a few weeks. I will continue as Chairman, where I plan to devote my time to
our clients, our growth, and our leadership. We've been joking this week, as people do, about the shape an organization
is in when you turn it over to the new guy. Well, I'm very proud, not only of our position, but maybe more importantly,
how well-positioned we are for the future. The best is ahead for Accenture. Our team sees nothing, but opportunity, and
we're raising our game yet again. This has always been and always will be a team effort, and I'm excited to contribute
to this next chapter.
I really enjoyed these calls over the past six years. It's been a great experience for me, and I'm sure I'll continue to see
many of you along the way. Thank you very much for joining us today on the call. As always, we appreciate your
continued support. If you have any questions, please feel free to call K.C. to make arrangements for follow-up.
Best wishes for a safe, relaxing, happy holiday and new year. All the best.
