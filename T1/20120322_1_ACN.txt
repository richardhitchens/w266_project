K.C. McClure
Thank you, Ryan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2012 earnings announcement.
As Ryan just mentioned, I'm K.C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre
Nanterme, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the

questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or net
revenues.
Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking, including the business outlook. You should keep in
mind that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and that such statements are not a
guarantee of our future performance.
Such risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to general economic conditions and those factors set forth in
today's news release and discussed under the risk factor sections of our annual review on form 10-K and quarterly
reports on form 10-Q and other SEC filings.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news
release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, K.C. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our Accenture results for the second quarter including strong
top and bottom line growth demonstrate that our strategy continues to resonate with our clients and that we are running
our business with rigor and discipline.
Here are a few highlights. We generated new bookings of nearly $8 billion. Revenues were $6.8 billion, up 13% in
local currency with all five operating groups and all three geographic regions delivering double digit local currency
growth. We delivered strong earnings per share of $0.97, an increase of 29%. Operating income was $889 million, an
increase of 15% over last year. And we continue to have a very strong balance sheet ending the quarter with a cash
balance of $5.6 billion.
In addition, I'm very pleased that we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of 67.5 cents per share which brings
the total dividend payments for the year to $1.35 per share. And given our very strong results for the first half of fiscal
year 2012, we are raising our outlook for revenue growth and EPS for the full year.
Now, let me hand over to Pam who will review the numbers in greater details. Pam, over to you.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for listening today. I am pleased to share more about Accenture's excellent
second quarter financial results for our fiscal '12.
New bookings were again strong, just shy of $8 billion. Revenue came in at the top end of the range we guided to last
quarter and EPS for Q2 were very strong. Revenue growth was broad based across our operating groups and
geographic regions without outsourcing growth higher than consulting for most of those dimensions. Our performance
through the first half of the year and into calendar 2012 positions us well to achieve our targets for the full fiscal year.
Now let's get to the numbers. Unless I state otherwise, all figures are U.S. GAAP except the items that are not part of
the financial statements or that are calculations. New bookings for the quarter were $7.94 billion and reflect a negative
1% foreign exchange impact compared with new bookings in the second quarter last year. Consulting bookings were
$4.05 billion and outsourcing bookings were $3.89 billion.

Let me give you some color on new bookings in the quarter. In management consulting, we continued to see strong
bookings reflecting ongoing client demand for projects that deliver near term and structural cost takeout, especially in
the supply chain. We saw increased demand from clients seeking to drive new revenue through improved sales and
marketing effectiveness and demand also continued for services on large-scale business transformation programs.
Turning to technology consulting, our bookings reflected demand for network transformation, data center
consolidation, and IT rationalization for both driving cost savings and pushing up the business value from IT
System integration bookings continue to reflect client demand to update and implement enterprise-wide ERP systems.
We see growing demand for cloud which is leading to requests for application re-platforming and for software as a
service solutions from the leading SaaS technology providers. We are also seeing more demand to leverage data
management and analytics, mobility, social and digital technologies. We are expanding our capabilities to meet these
growing demands.
Turning to outsourcing, in technology outsourcing we see increasing demand across all geographies, including
continued strength in Europe, as clients continue to reduce and make variable their IT operating costs so they can
channel more IT investments toward the adoption of emerging technologies. We also see healthy demand to help
clients transform and manage their networks and infrastructure operations as well as virtualize and consolidate their
data centers to lower operating costs.
BPO bookings in Q2 showed particular strength in the Americas. They reflected good demand both for our horizontal
offerings, especially finance and accounting, and marketing and for our industry-specific ones, notably Accenture
Credit Services and in health through care management services.
Finally, we had bookings of over $100 million at five clients.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the second quarter were 6.8 billion, an increase of 12% in U.S. dollars and
13% in local currency from the same period last year. As we expected, these revenues reflect a foreign exchange
impact of negative 1% compared with Q2 last year. These revenues were at the top end of our guided range of $6.5
billion to $6.8 billion driven by strong growth in outsourcing.
Consulting revenues were $3.8 billion, an increase of 8% in both U.S. dollars and local currency. Consulting revenue
growth was strong in the Americas, very strong in Asia Pacific and slight in EMEA. Outsourcing revenues were $3
billion, an increase of 19% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currency and were very strong in each of the three
geographic regions.
Now let me give you some highlights of revenue growth in our operating groups. Communications, Media and
Technology revenues increased 17% in local currency with growth that was strong across the CMT industries and
geographically. Outsourcing growth was very strong, driven by communications clients' continued focus on improving
their operations and also by an increase, part of which is short-term, related to a contract in Europe. CMT had modest
consulting revenue growth overall. The growth was strong in the Americas and Asia Pacific, reflecting our clients'
continued focus on improving operational effectiveness and customer service and on launching new products and
services.
The products operating group, our largest, had local currency revenue growth of 16% driven by strong, broad-based
growth across most of the products industry industries around the world. Outsourcing revenue was very strong, driven
by notably higher technology outsourcing work versus last year.
Led by our retail industry, consulting revenue growth was also strong overall with the exception of some parts of
consulting in EMEA. Resources revenues grew 12% in local currency with strong growth in our energy and natural
resources industries around the world including some of our priority emerging markets. Strong growth in outsourcing
reflected demand for flexible, cost-effective sourcing to meet increased demand in ongoing operations.
Consulting growth continued to be driven by programs supporting global operating models and a focus on driving
short-term efficiencies. In Financial Services, revenues grew 10% in local currency reflecting very strong growth in
outsourcing across the FS industries. This growth reflects clients' focus on cost takeout and operational effectiveness

and we expect this to remain an even stronger imperative across these industries globally. We did see modest
consulting growth overall in financial services. This was driven by strong growth in insurance, slight growth in
banking, led by Asia Pacific and partially offset by a decline in capital markets.
Health and public service revenues also increased 10% in local currency reflecting very significant growth in health
again this quarter led by consulting in North America and Asia Pacific. This reflects a strong focus on our health
offerings, which Pierre will give you more color on shortly. Our repositioning of our public service business continues
to go well. The PS business grew modestly this quarter including strong growth in Asia Pacific and was led by demand
for our offerings in human services.
In summary, our bookings and revenue results reflect continuing strong and more focused demand across the industries
we serve. Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 31.1%, down from 31.7% in Q2 last year, a 60-basis
point decrease reflecting lower contract profitability in two operating groups: financial services and health and public
service, partially offset by higher contract profitability in the other three: products, CMT and resources.
Sales and marketing costs were $772 million, or 11.4% of net revenues compared with $710 million, or 11.7% of net
revenues for the second quarter of last year, a 30 basis point decrease in these costs in relation to revenue. Selling costs
were down more than that, which has created some room to invest more in our offerings. General and administrative
costs were $454 million or 6.7% of net revenues compared with $435 million or 7.2% of net revenues for the second
quarter last year, a 50 basis point decrease in these costs in relation to revenue.
Operating income for the quarter increased 15% to $889 million resulting in a 13.08% operating margin compared with
$772 million or 12.74% operating margin for the same period last year, a 34 basis point expansion year-over-year in the
quarter. We were pleased with these results this quarter as we continue to be focused on managing the business to
deliver operating income and modest operating margin expansion in conjunction with the revenue growth.
Now, on operating income and margin for the operating groups, first on products, we are pleased with the trajectory of
improved product profitability. Second, on resources, the very strong operating margin results this quarter were driven
by more efficient selling costs and improved contract profitability and reflected a minor one-time upward adjustment.
Third, the drop in operating margin in financial services reflected impacts from costs related to recent acquisitions,
delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts and higher selling costs in relation to revenue.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% compared with 26.9% in the second quarter last year. This lower rate in
the quarter was due to higher benefits related to final determinations of tax liabilities from prior years partially offset by
increases in tax reserves.
Net income was $714 million for the second quarter compared with $566 million for the same quarter last year an
increase of 26%.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.97 compared with $0.75 in the second quarter last year, an increase of 29%. This
$0.22 increase reflects $0.11 from higher revenue and operating results, $0.08 from the lower effective income tax rate,
$0.02 from the lower share count and $0.01 from higher non-operating income.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $772 million rounded, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $858
million net of property and equipment additions of $85 million.
Turning to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with global head count of more than 246,000
people and we now have more than 151,000 people in our global delivery network. In Q2, our utilization was 87%, flat
with Q1. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations was 12%, also flat with Q1 and down from 14% in Q2 last
fiscal year. We continue to expect to hire more than 60,000 people around the world this year.
Turing to DSOs, our days services outstanding were 29 days, down from 32 days last quarter as well as Q2 last year.
Across all of these operational dimensions, utilization, attrition, DSOs, our business is performing very well.
Finally, I'll comment on our cash and our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases
and dividends. Our total cash balance at February 29th was $5.6 billion and compares with $5.7 billion at the end of

August.
In the second quarter we repurchased or redeemed approximately 8.6 million shares for $465 million at an average
price of $54.03 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 13.9 million shares for $750 million. At February 29th, we
had $5.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Yesterday, our board of directors declared our semiannual cash dividend in the amount of 67.5 cents per share. This
dividend will be paid on May 15, 2012. This is in line with the semiannual dividend of 67.5 cents we paid in November
and represents a 22.5 cent, or 50% increase over the dividend we paid in May of last year.
Lastly, we were extremely pleased to learn that Accenture was one of six companies added last Friday to the S&P 100
index.
In summary, our financial results were strong from the top line through the bottom line in the first half of fiscal 2012.
Our results demonstrate that we are tuned in to the needs of our clients, that we have skills and offerings for services
that are in demand, and that we are executing with rigor and discipline to meet our financial targets.
Now, let me turn the call back to Pierre to give you his thoughts on how we are executing on our growth strategy.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, Pam.
Our strong results again this quarter demonstrate that our growth strategy is well aligned with the needs of our clients
and that we are leveraging marketplace opportunities to drive growth and gain market share across all the key
dimensions of our business. Of course, we are watching macroeconomic trends very closely, and despite the slowdown
in the forecast for global economic growth, especially in Europe, there are some positive developments, such as early
signs of improvement in the U.S. economy as well as progress to stabilize the Eurozone sovereign debt situation.
In my recent conversations with the CEOs of our clients, it is clear that the marketplace forces driving the need for
large scale transformation are still here, and in this context, our growth strategy continues to be extremely relevant to
our clients.
Talking about clients, over the last six months, we have increased the number of Diamond Clients, which are our
largest client relationships across all five operating groups. We continue to operate at the heart of our clients' businesses
and to increase not only the number of clients we serve, but also the kinds of services we are providing to them.
Operational efficiency continues to be a key area of focus for our clients and is driving significant demand for our
services. Let me give you two examples. We are helping one of the world's leading insurance companies reduce costs
through the implementation of a large, multiyear network transformation program which includes a cloud-based voice
over IP solution. Our services span 25 countries and include infrastructure expense management, service delivery and
security services. In Health, which is one of our priority industries, we're using our care management BPO services to
help one of the largest U.S. health insurers manage the review and authorization of medical services for patients.
We are using analytics to help this client drive down the cost of care management and improve the quality of services
provided to patients.
Technology innovation is another key lever our clients are using to capture new growth opportunities and improve the
customer experience. Through Accenture Mobility services we are helping one of the world's leading car manufacturers
leverage machine-to-machine computing to integrate in vehicle and mobility technologies. This solution gives drivers
access to navigation and other connected services on a pay per use basis, generating new revenue opportunities for the
manufacturer.
We are working with the governments of Australia and Singapore to implement health information exchanges which
are designed to improve the cost, quality and access to healthcare for citizens. Health information exchanges provide

medical professionals with access to real-time information that can be used to make more informed decisions and
provide better services to patients. And through Accenture Analytics and Marketing Services, we helped a U.S. based
retailer deliver more than $300 million of incremental annual revenue by using productive analytics to reallocate
marketing spend to high impact channels.
As you know, geographic expansion is a key element of our growth strategy and we are taking steps to significantly
increase our leadership presence Asia Pacific. David Thomlinson, a member of our global management committee who
leads our geographic strategy and operations, has relocated to Shanghai to work with our local leadership to accelerate
the execution of our growth strategy in Asia, particularly China.
In addition, last month, we opened a new Accenture Technology Lab in Beijing. One of the key areas of focus for the
Beijing lab is how to apply smart grid technologies to help with China's growing energy demands which is a critical
priority for China.
Of course, we remain focused on our own operational efficiency. It's about running Accenture's business with rigor and
discipline in order to increase the competitiveness of everything we do and maximize our return to shareholders.
With that, let me turn the call back to Pam who will provide our business outlook for the third quarter and the full fiscal
year.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre.
As we head into the second half of our fiscal 2012, we are positioned very well. We are pleased with how we have
navigated the macro environment, which as Pierre mentioned, continues to have significant challenges as well as some
brighter spots. We continue to be focused on overall profitable growth in our broad based global business and on
building market share in the markets we are focused on.
I'll now provide our outlook for the next quarter's revenue and an update to our annual outlook for the full fiscal year.
So here's how we see it shaping up. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.05 billion to
$7.25 billion, which assumes a foreign exchange impact of negative 3% for the quarter.
For the full fiscal year, we continue to assume a foreign exchange impact of negative 1%. This reflects the rates we've
experienced over the past couple weeks which have remained consistent with the assumption we provided last quarter.
Turning to revenues, based on the strong delivery and our year-to-date results of almost 14% growth in local currency
and how we see the year as a whole, we now expect our fiscal year 2012 revenue to be in the range of 10% to 12%
growth in local currency. We expect continued strong growth in outsourcing and continued moderation in consulting
growth.
We continue to expect bookings to fall within our annual new bookings range of $28 billion to $31 billion for the fiscal
year, although we now expect to be in the top half of that range. We continue to expect operating margin to be in the
range of 13.7% to 13.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over last fiscal year. You should expect some fluctuations
quarter-to-quarter as we have seen in the past.
Although the effective tax rate for Q2 and year-to-date was lower, we continued to expect our annual effective tax rate
to be in the range of 27% to 28% for fiscal 2012 and for the tax rate for Q3 and Q4 to be above the annual range.
We now expect earnings per share for the full fiscal year to be in the range of $3.82 to $3.90, up 6 cents, primarily
reflecting our updated assumption for revenue growth.
Finally, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion with property and
equipment additions of $450 million and free cash flow in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion.

We remain committed to return a substantial portion of the cash we generate to shareholders. In fiscal 2012, we
continue to expect to return at least $3 billion through dividends and share repurchases and to reduce the weighted
average diluted shares outstanding by about 2%.
We're very pleased with how our people have delivered for our clients and for Accenture. In this time of continued
uncertainty in the global equity throughout the first half of our fiscal year. We're working hard to continue to drive
profitable growth as we help our clients drive critical value in their businesses while at the same time driving value in
ours and for our shareholders. Now, Pierre and I are ready to take your questions.
K.C. McClure
Thanks, Pam. I would ask that you keep your questions limited to one question and one follow-up to allow as many
participants as possible to ask questions. Ryan, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hi, thanks so much. Great results, especially on the outsourcing side. I guess I'll ask
something on the outsourcing front. You mentioned I guess last quarter to us that you're not seeing a shift from
consulting to outsourcing and that outsourcing is not growing at the expense of consulting. Is that still the case? I'm
trying to get a better sense of how long this interplay between the two might persist? Do you follow my question, Pam
and Pierre?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes. I think if you do the math, right, outsourcing is marginally a little bit greater proportion
of our business right now, and we see that particularly happening in financial services and communications, media and
technology. It's been a trend, and we expect it to continue to be a trend.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Right. That makes sense. I guess on the outsourcing growth as my follow-up, is it pretty broad
based or driven by certain large deals, and how would you characterize the risk profile, I would ask on the outsourcing
side, versus maybe two, three years ago? Thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, it's quite broad based. We see strong outsourcing growth virtually around the world and
pretty much across the operating groups, so this is clearly very good growth. I think in terms of the risk profile, I'll just
comment a little bit on our capital committee. It is something that we take very, very seriously in all these deals and I
think it's fair to say we're getting better and better at it and I do not see an increase in the risk profile of our outsourcing
work.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Just to add a word on this, I mean, definitely outsourcing is a very relevant response to the
clients' challenges in improving the operational efficiency and the overall performance and this is true across the batch
for all our industries. That's why you can see that kind of acceleration of the demand in outsourcing across the board.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Good stuff. Thanks a lot.
<A - K.C. McClure>: Thank you, Tien-tsin.

<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: All right, great, so hey, first question on demand and then a quick question on the margin
front. On the demand front, Pam, you mentioned in your guidance commentary that your outlook assumes moderation
in consulting. Is that moderation in the year-over-year growth rate as comparisons get tougher, or is that moderation in
the actual demand environment and seeing some incremental softening there? Can you kind of clarify whether that's a
year-over-year growth rate commentary or a demand trend commentary?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: It's a year-over-year growth rate commentary. You know we've are expecting that the
consulting year-over-year growth rate will be more in the mid-single digits kind of range next quarter and so it is very
much that. We continue to see very good demand, as you can see in the bookings being over $4 billion and the demand
environment continues to be robust in most parts of the world.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay, great, that's very helpful. And then on the margin front, I want to focus on the
financial services vertical there. And I guess there's two parts to my question here. Are you seeing any meaningful
pricing issues contributing to the margin decline in financial services? And did you have any write-off on troubled
contracts during the quarter that caused the meaningful drop in the financial services margin?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I would say, Rod, that it is more due to the things that I mentioned a few minutes ago in the
sense that we do have a couple of nice-sized acquisitions that came on-line and so we planned to have some impact
from those. We also did have higher selling costs in financial services and I think that's in large part due to there is
significant transformation going on in that industry as you know and so some of that was planned and we did have
lastly some delivery inefficiencies which would probably go into the category of we need to work on that a bit more,
that also contributed, but the first two were more of a planned nature.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Does that mean looking forward that the margin should recover after you get past the
acquisition costs and then some upfront selling costs and transformation work?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: We do expect that the financial services profitability will pick back up.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Great, thank you guys.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: We will be jumping on this, Rod; because I'm historically Mr. FS, so I still have some
personal stake on this. And indeed, as you know, and as we communicated, banking, insurance and health are industries
where we decided to invest because we saw the potential on those industries. So it's not a surprise that you can see the
impact of our investment in some of the margin and so far, we are very pleased with the results of those investments in
the terms of the acquisitions we made and we announced recently with Duck Creek and with Zenta to form Accenture
Credit Services and of course, the other data point is we are pleased to announce this quarter, in Q2, financial services
bookings were $2.1 billion, the highest bookings ever in the financial services history.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Excellent. Thank you, guys.

Next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Hey, guys, just to pick up on Rod's question there but maybe from a different perspective,
the contribution because you guys are calling out the acquired impact to the margins, is there a way to think about how
much it's actually helping on the revenue growth side as well?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: It did have a good contribution to the revenue growth in financial services. I'm not going to
give you the exact number, but it was meaningful to that growth.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Okay. Got it. Just a quick follow-up when we look at the results, hard to argue with 13% to
14% first half growth and mid-teens trailing 12-month bookings at this point in time, but when you look at the implied
growth into the back half of the year at your midpoint of the range, it looks like you guys are implying 8.5%. What
would – I mean, given where the growth is right now, especially the bookings as strong as they are, why would you

guys expect to decelerate in the back half of the year?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, it's just more how we see the – how it is shaping up and when you think about it, it's
more like a 7% to 10%, which is I think how we saw the business when we started the year and then consulting was
running hotter and now we see it, you know, coming back closer to that level, which is a very, very good level. So the
moderation is primarily in consulting and outsourcing continues to be strong.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.

Next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi. I just wanted to drill down on the consulting business, maybe outlook by region. It
sounded like Americas and Asia might have been accelerating, but maybe a little bit of a decel in Europe is expected.
Maybe you can just break it down for us. Thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, I'm not going to break it down in terms of numbers, but I think your characterization is
fair. Although we expect moderation to be in the Americas and Asia Pacific as well as we go forward, but Europe is the
one that's lowest in terms of the growth rate right now.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Did Europe deteriorate during the quarter, or it's just kind of, you know, happening to plan?
And then lastly, on head count growth, I noticed sequentially head count growth didn't grow as much, but you kept
your guidance for at least 60,000 heads for gross hires. So just curious, is there a timing issue for head count with this
quarter and we should expect it to pick up in the next two. Thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: So the first question, okay, the head count was – that's the question I've got here. So there's
nothing unusual going on with head count, Bryan. I mean, you know, it's pretty much, you know, as you know, we
manage the client demand around the world and that's really all that's going on. So the utilization was at 87%. I think
we're being tight and rigorous about that as we always are and there's nothing unusual there.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: From a consulting standpoint, I'm going to jump on that one. I don't think there is anything in
Q2 that was not expected or took us by surprise from a consulting standpoint. Pam mentioned in prior quarters that,
indeed, if you are looking at the whole macroeconomic environment, it's public knowledge that Europe is more softer
from an economic standpoint compared to the rest of the world. We're watching carefully what's happening, especially
in the financial services sector in some parts of Europe. It's not the same story if you are looking at the different
countries in Europe and so what's happening there is more happening as planned and I don't think there is anything that
was unexpected.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Right. And just what's interesting, though, is that the outsourcing demand is quite strong in
Europe so as you can imagine, we're responding to that.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Yeah, great. Great results. Thanks so much.
<A - K.C. McClure>: Thank you, Bryan.

<Q - Nathan Rozof>: My first question for you is related to the pipeline. I think after two very strong bookings quarter
last quarter, Pam, you made the comment that there was going to be some work that needed to be done in terms of
replenishing the pipeline and now here we are with another strong bookings quarter. So I wanted to get your sense on
had you been able to replenish the pipeline and what was the velocity of deals moving through the pipeline relative to
maybe a quarter ago?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: It's a great question and as you can imagine, something we are very focused on, and I think we
have made some good progress in building the pipeline. We do have some more work to do and again, with the strong
bookings, it was – you know, I think overall very good.
One thing I'll just mention because sometimes this relates a little bit to visibility and I've given you this in the past is
that when we look at revenue under contract, we do have 13% more than we did at this time last year, both for the next
two quarters of the fiscal year, but also for the next four quarters. So I think that shows you that that is building as well.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: That's terrific. That's good to hear about the visibility. Can you provide any insight in terms of
just breaking down into the bookings number a little bit more in terms of new wins in that strong bookings number
versus renewals or any change relative to what's kind of normal at this time of the year?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I don't think there's anything major to point out there, Nate. I mean, I think one of the things
that, you know, we were, of course, looking at last year – sorry, last quarter was how the calendar year turn was going
to go. And we haven't seen anything notably change that much in terms of clients' budgets and sort of all of that. So I
don't think there's really anything big to point out with respect to that.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Darin Peller, Barclays, please go ahead.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks. You know, Pierre, I think you mentioned earlier that in Europe you were seeing more
outsourcing and I think that's well received especially just given the historical trends there. Do you think now clients
continue to focus on cost takeout, those historical barriers around cultural factors and labor laws and language are
actually really becoming less of a hurdle and you are actually seeing it hit the numbers now, first of all?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah. I mean, if you look at this, at the deep end, clearly operational efficiency is extremely
important for all the reasons we know and again, we feel we are extremely well positioned to provide the right answer
to that particular agenda. From a consulting standpoint, from an outsourcing standpoint we have, I think, all the tools,
techniques and offerings to tackle that agenda, but, but at the same time, we see a growing demand for more innovation
and using more of the technology innovation to drive either more efficiency but as well more the revenue agenda of our
clients, and what's interesting to see in the marketplace is indeed these two activities and it's not a surprise are picking
up at the same time and clients are investing to be more efficient as well as they are investing to capture more growth
opportunities and we are very pleased, if you will, with those two engines for growth.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay, thank you, and just one last follow-up to that. Is it market share also? Are you seeing
your win rates increase?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I don't think – I mean, our win rates have been up as I think back over the last year, and I don't
think we saw a significant change this quarter in that.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay, but it's been pretty stable, Pam?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes.

Next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg, Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Hey, how you are, Pam?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Good.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Good. So just want to ask a question regarding SG&A. I mean, you guys have done
such a great job over a long period of time there managing SG&A cost base and wanted to get an idea of how much
more upside, if you will, remains there to the extent you see opportunity for further cost takeout, what specific areas
that might be in and part of the reason I ask the question is the gross margins continue to go down year-over-year. I
think it's been about six straight quarters, but obviously you manage the business to operating margins and you've been
hitting your goals there, but the SG&A piece of the equation obviously becomes even more important if the gross
margins continue to slide so, any color you can give us there would be great.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, I mean, I think you're right. Right? I mean, I think philosophically, we're looking to
manage SG&A to grow slower than revenue, right? That's part of our culture that we're really careful with our costs and
really manage all that, manage our cost structure with a lot of rigor and discipline and so not as pleased to see the
improvement in the selling costs. You do know that when we invest in the business, that's typically on the sales and
marketing line as well. That's where we have our offerings and our initiatives so we want to make sure that we can do
some things there as well and look to do as much as we can, but all within this overall framework of in the end
delivering modest margin expansion.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: The goal of this is – I'm going to jump on this one because it's a kind of mind set, if you will,
and you've been hearing me and Pam using a lot, "rigor and discipline," which is coming back and coming back, but if
we are mentioning that because we mean it and at the end of the day, rigor and discipline is what you need as a mind
set for proper execution, and I think in that organization there is a relentless focus on improving productivity and
efficiency in everything we do and there is no reason that will not apply to SG&A to the rest of our business.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Okay. Let me just ask a follow-up on your latest thoughts regarding nonlinear growth
opportunities at Accenture. You guys now have about a quarter of a million of employees and are there some goals you
can share with us just in terms of size for your nonlinear businesses such as on the Accenture software side or BPO or
other types of IP based solutions you have in your portfolio? I know you had talked a bit about this at past analyst
meetings and wanted to see if there was any update there you could share.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: At a high level we are a people-based organization. We will grow our head count and we love
that. We love our people. We will grow in this. We are used to that. We know how to hire, train, develop, deploy and
that's part of something we will do and we will continue to do. That being said, it is part of our plan to bring more IP in
our system, if you will, to be more differentiated, but we will continue to be a people-based business and grow that
way.
From an IP standpoint, indeed, we are pleased with the progress we are making either by leveraging the good
technologies from our alliance partners, and we are doing that every day to bring our unique industry expertise or by
making some focused investments and strategic investments and I mentioned a few we are doing in each and every
industry so we will continue to be more IP based and to grow, indeed, that part of our business as well. But the
people-based part will remain important.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Very good. Thank you, guys.

<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Thanks, hi, Pierre. Hi, Pam
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hello, Ashwin.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Excellent quarter here, especially the bookings in a tough selling environment. My
question is related to the bookings. In the next few quarters, you'll have, obviously, fairly significant ramps related to
the contracts that you're signing. You also have a lot of increased head count coming up given, you know, the relatively
flattish head count this quarter. Are there marginal cash implications in the back half of the year or even slightly
beyond that as you look at those ramps?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: What do you mean by margin or cash implications?
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Is it going to – because you're obviously ramping your-ramping large contracts there is an
initial cost involved. Does it have a negative implication for your gross margins?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I guess, in sort of this giant portfolio of thousands of contracts, right, we always have some in
the early stages, and that's part of what, you know, each operating group manages as they look to deliver each year, so
there's nothing unusual there, Ashwin.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Okay, so nothing out of the ordinary, okay. The second question is on Nokia. I guess it's
sort of client specific and let me take a shot at it even though I know you historically don't answer client specific
questions. You are making buy-out offers to re-based employees. Is that sort of, too early in the process, is it consistent
with their expectation of the project going? I mean, it is Symbian support and we know how Symbian is doing in the
market, so a little bit concerned there.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah. I mean, as you expected, I think, when you asked the question, we're not going to
comment specifically on a client contract.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Okay. I thought I would take a shot. Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thank you.

Next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: Congrats on a great quarter. Just a couple of quick questions. You continue to see strength
in some of your end markets that are having pressures, specifically financial services and Europe. So do you feel that
the ongoing pressure that your clients are seeing will continue to drive business your way, or do you think at some
point it will catch up with your overall revenue growth?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I think the thing that we see is continued robust demand for outsourcing in financial services,
and we don't see that letting up.
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: Great. You also attributed your gross margin pressure to contract profitability. Can you
expand on that? Has that driven you to higher contractor costs or to pressure on bill rates for the contract work?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, I mean, I think as I mentioned, it's in financial services and in health and public service,
and in those cases, where there's things that we wish we would do better is what we refer to as delivery inefficiencies
and that's more where it takes more costs to deliver something than we thought it would.
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: Great. Thanks. Just one other quick one; are you still planning on having your analyst day
in April or has it moved to the fall?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: We are not planning to have it in April. And we, at this point, are looking to do it in the fall
and stay tuned. We'll have an update on that.

Okay. The final question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Hi. I guess I'm going to try to squeeze two in, even though it's the last one. Any changes in
the spending patterns by clients? Are wallets opening up a little bit here as there's been some macro stability and what
could cause those wallets to shut down?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: As we said, we're looking carefully at the macroeconomic environment. We're talking to our
clients every day. We are looking at the analyst reports no later than this morning and I'm reading all the reports on the
economy coming from all around the world and we are not seeing any significant changing in the current client
environment. We do not see much within that why things would change, at least things we know.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Right.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Lastly, I just want to go back to the first question because it looks like outsourcing is kind of
outpacing consulting. Is this any – is there any linkage at all to the business cycle? Are we just entering a part of the
cycle where maybe consulting moderates and outsourcing picks up, or have you been converting those consulting, you
know, engagements into outsourcing? I'm just trying to get a final feel for that?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah. I think there is some what I would call catalyst effect of some of the consulting going
into outsourcing, but we haven't really quantified that. But there's a lot of activity under what we've termed framework
agreements in outsourcing and I think that as we mentioned in the comments, this relentless focus on cost takeout and
getting more operationally efficient, it just really lends itself to doing that kind of work and really helping clients get
more fit. And of course, with what's going on with technology, that's really supporting that, too. Because there's
opportunities through these new technologies to make some of these IT costs more variable and that's, of course, very
attractive to clients.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Again, a lot of your questions concerning consulting and outsourcing and they're all very
valid. Again, just a reminder that we've been booking in the range of $4 billion these last four quarters in consulting.
We'd like to make sure everybody gets that from this call, that we are pleased with where we are on outsourcing with
consulting and we are extremely pleased with where we are in outsourcing.
Okay. I think it's time to wrap up the call. Thanks, again, for joining us today. As you heard we are very pleased with
our strong results in the second quarter and the first half of the fiscal year. We are confident that we will continue to
deliver profitable growth and we are remaining focused on accelerating the execution of our growth strategy.
