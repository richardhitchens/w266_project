Thank you, Chris.
Net income was $1.6 billion or $2.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $1.2 billion or $1.49
per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our consolidated pre-tax income from continuing operations in the
fourth quarter of 2011 was about $2.6 billion, $2.02 per diluted share after tax, compared to approximately $2.9 billion,
$2.18 per diluted share after tax, in the third quarter of 2011.
Major items resulting in the difference between the third and fourth quarter income included higher oil volumes and
prices, which added $0.07 per diluted share after tax to our fourth quarter income; lower fourth quarter Chemical and
Midstream income of $0.08 per diluted share; higher equity base compensation costs of $0.05 per diluted share; higher
exploration expense of $0.02 per diluted share; and higher fourth quarter operating costs of $0.08 per diluted share.
Here's a segment breakdown for the fourth quarter. In the Oil and Gas segment, the fourth quarter 2011 production of
748,000 BOE per day was 9,000 BOE higher than the third quarter of 2011 volumes of 739,000 BOE per day.
Domestically, our production was 449,000 BOE per day, representing the highest ever domestic production volumes
for the company, compared to our guidance of 442,000 to 444,000 BOE per day. Our production cost rose by 13,000
BOE per day compared to the third quarter, with the Permian and California contributing to the bulk of sequential
increase in our overall domestic production volumes.
Our better than expected fourth quarter domestic production reflected the effect of the ramp-up in capital spending as
well as higher levels of workover and well maintenance activity. In addition, the fourth quarter was relatively free of
significant operational disruptions, which also contributed to the better than expected results.
Latin America volumes were 31,000 BOE per day. Colombia volumes increased slightly from the third quarter, while
both periods included pipeline interruptions caused by insurgent activity.
In the Middle East region, we recorded 1,000 BOE per day production in Libya. In Iraq, we produced 9,000 BOE per
day, an increase of 5,000 BOE per day from the third quarter volumes. The higher volume is a result of higher spending
levels. Yemen daily production was 23,000 BOE, a decrease of 5,000 BOE from the third quarter. The decrease
reflected the timing of cost recovery and the expiration of the Masila Field contract in mid-December. In Oman, the
fourth quarter production was 76,000 BOE per day, a decrease of 3,000 BOE per day from the third quarter volumes.
The decrease was attributable to downtime from operational issues. In Qatar, the fourth quarter production was 76,000
BOE per day, an increase of 3,000 BOE per day over the third quarter volumes. In Dolphin and Bahrain combined,
production decreased 6,000 BOE per day from the third quarter volumes. Dolphin volumes declined 9,000 BOE per
day because, during the quarter, we reached the annual maximum volumes allowed under its contract.
Our fourth quarter sales volumes were 749,000 BOE per day compared to our guidance of 740,000 BOE per day. The
improvement resulted from the higher domestic production. Fourth quarter 2011 realized prices were mixed for our
products compared to the third quarter of the year.
Our worldwide crude oil realized price was $99.62 per barrel, an increase of 2.5%. Worldwide NGLs were $55.25 per
barrel, a decrease of about 1.5%. And domestic natural gas prices were $3.59 per MCF, a decline of 15%. Realized oil
prices for the quarter represented 106% of the average WTI and 91% of the average Brent price. Realized NGL prices
were 59% of WTI, and realized domestic gas price were 98% of NYMEX.
Price changes at current global prices affect our quarterly earnings before income tax by $38 million for a $1 per barrel
change in oil prices and $8 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in
domestic gas prices affects quarterly pre-tax earnings by about $31 million.
Fourth quarter operating costs were about $130 million higher than the third quarter as a result of higher workover and
well maintenance activity, driven by our program to increase production at these higher levels of oil prices.
Oil and Gas cash production costs were $12.84 a barrel for the 12 months of 2011 compared with last year's 12-month
cost of $10.19 a barrel. The cost increase reflects the higher workover and maintenance activity I mentioned earlier.

Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $2.21 per barrel for the 12 months of
2011 compared to $1.83 per barrel for all of 2010. Fourth quarter exploration expense, which included the impairment
of several small leases, was $73 million.
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $144 million compared to $245 million in the third
quarter of 2011. The drop in income was the result of seasonal factors.
Midstream segment earnings of $70 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 were comparable to the $77 million in the
third quarter 2011. The significantly higher year-end OXY stock price compared to the distressed levels at the end of
the third quarter affected the quarterly valuation of equity-based compensation plans, reducing fourth quarter pre-tax
income of the company compared to the third quarter by $80 million.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 37% for the fourth quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates
are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule.
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance during the 12 months. Core income was $6.8 billion or $8.39 per diluted
share compared with $4.7 billion or $5.72 per diluted share in 2010. Net income was $6.8 billion or $8.32 per diluted
share for the 12 months of 2011 compared with $4.5 billion or $5.56 per diluted share in 2010.
Cash flow from operations for the 12 months of 2011 was $12.3 billion. We used $7.5 billion of the company's total
cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $2.2 billion on net acquisitions and divestitures. We used $1.4 billion to pay
dividends and had a net cash flow inflow from debt activity of $0.6 billion. These and other net cash flows resulted in a
$3.8 billion cash balance at December 31.
Looking at overall cash flow simply, our total debt net of cash was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2011 compared to $2.5
billion at December 31, 2010, representing net cash generated by the company of $0.4 billion. During this period, we
returned $1.7 billion to our stockholders in the form of $1.4 billion of dividends and $275 million of stock buybacks.
Over two years, our net debt at December 31, 2011 was $0.5 billion higher compared to the $1.6 billion at December
31, 2009. During this period, we returned $2.9 billion to our stockholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks
while executing an $11.5 billion capital program and spending about $6.9 billion on acquisitions.
Capital expenditures for 2011 were approximately $7.5 billion, of which about $2.6 billion was incurred in the fourth
quarter. The fourth quarter higher capital partially reflected the gradual ramp-up of our capital program during 2011.
The increases were mostly at Williston domestically and Iraq, Oman, and Qatar internationally. The fourth quarter
capital also included spending for several Midstream projects, such as the Elk Hills gas processing plant, which would
drop significantly during the first half of 2012 as these projects are completed. Total year capital expenditures by
segment were 82% in Oil and Gas, 14% in Midstream, and the remainder in Chemicals.
Our net acquisition expenditures in the 12 months were $2.2 billion, which are net of proceeds from the sale of our
Argentina operations. The acquisitions included the South Texas purchase, properties in California, the Permian, and
Williston, and a payment in connection with the signing of the Al Hosn gas project in Abu Dhabi, which is the gas
development of the Shah field. This payment was for Occidental's share of development expenditures incurred by the
project prior to the date the final agreement was signed.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the 12 months of 2011 were 812.1 million, and the weighted diluted
shares outstanding were 812.9 million. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 13%, a decline of 1% from the end of last
year. Our return on equity for 2011 was 19.3%, and the return on capital employed was 17.2%.
Oil and Gas DD&A expense was $11.48 per BOE for 2011. We expect the Oil and Gas segment DD&A rate to be
about $14 per barrel in 2012. The total Chemical and Midstream DD&A expense is expected to be about $650 million
for 2012. We expect operating cost per barrel to be about $13.75 in 2012. The 2012 expected costs reflect higher levels
of workovers and well maintenance activity. However, significant and substantial product price changes and changes in
activity levels and inflation resulting from product prices may affect this cost estimate during the course of the year.

I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to discuss our 2012 capital program, year-end oil and gas reserves, and
provide guidance for the first half of the year.
Stephen I. Chazen
Thank you, Jim.
We finished a strong year in terms of three main performance criteria that I outlined last quarter. Our domestic oil and
gas production grew by about 12% for the total year to 428,000 BOE per day. Fourth quarter domestic production of
449,000 BOE a day was the highest U.S. total production in OXY's history, reflecting the highest ever quarterly liquids
volume of 310,000 barrels per day and the second highest quarterly volume for gas. Total company production
increased about 4% for the year.
Our Chemical business delivered exceptional results for the year, achieving one of their highest earnings levels ever.
Our return on equity was 19% for the year, and our return on capital was 17%. We increased our annual dividends by
$0.32 or 21% to $1.84 per share. We expect to announce a further dividend increase after the meeting of our Board of
Directors in the second week of February.
I will now turn to the 2012 capital program. As I mentioned last call, we have ample legitimate opportunities in our
domestic Oil and Gas business where we could deploy capital. We have tried to manage the program to a level that is
realistic at current prices, and as a result have deferred some projects that would otherwise have met our hurdle rates.
We continue to have a substantial inventory of higher return projects to fulfill our growth objectives.
We are increasing our capital program by about 10% in 2012 to $8.3 billion from the $7.5 billion we spent in 2011.
About $500 million of this increase will be in the United States, mainly in the Permian Basin. And the rest will be spent
in the international projects, including the Al Hosn sour gas project and Iraq. The program breakdown is 84% Oil and
Gas, about 11% in Midstream, and 5% in Chemicals. We will review our capital program around midyear and adjust as
conditions dictate.
The following is a geographic overview of program. In domestic Oil and Gas and related Midstream projects,
development capital will be about 55% of our total program. In California, we expect to spend about 21% of our total
capital. We expect the rig count to remain constant in the first half of 2012 at 31, the same as what we were running at
the end of the year.
We are seeing improvement with respect to permitting issues in the state. We have received approved field rules and
new permits for both injection wells and drilling locations. The regulatory agency is responsive and committed to
working through the backlog of permits. We expect to maintain our capital program at current levels for about the first
half of the year, which will enable us to grow production volumes. We will reassess our capital program when the
number of permits in hand allows it.
In the Permian operations, we expect to spend about 20% of our total capital program. The rig count at year-end 2011
was 23. We expect the rig count to ramp up during the year to around 27 rigs by year end. Our CO2 flood capital
should remain comparable to 2011 levels. In our non-CO2 operations, we are seeing additional opportunities for good
return projects. As a result, we have stepped up their development program, and our 2012 capital will be about 75%
higher than 2011 levels.
In the Midcontinent and other operations, we plan to spend about 14% of our total capital. In the Williston, we have
increased our acreage in 2011 from 204,000 acres to 277,000 acres. We expect that our rig count will be about six at
the end of 2012. Additional capital that could reasonably be deployed here has been shifted to higher return
opportunities in California and the Permian. This may also encourage Bakken well costs to decline.
Natural gas prices in the United States are, as written here, horrible. I think that's probably an understatement. As a
result, we are cutting back our pure gas drilling in the Midcontinent, South Texas, and the Permian.

With regard to international capital spending, our total international development capital will be about 30% of the total
company capital program. The Al Hosn Shah gas project will continue to increase spending in 2012, as originally
planned, making up about 7% of our total capital program for the year. The rest of the international operations capital
will be comparable to 2011, with modest increases expected in Iraq and Libya. In Iraq, the planned spending levels
should generate about 11,000 barrels a day of production. Each additional $100 million in spending incurred evenly
through the year would generate about 2,700 barrels a day of production at current price levels.
Exploration capital should increase about 10% over 2011 spending levels and represents 6% of the total capital
program. The focus the program domestically will continue to be in California and the Permian and Williston Basins,
with additional activity in Oman and Bahrain.
With regard to our oil and gas reserves, we haven't completed the determination of our year-end reserve levels. Based
on preliminary estimates, our reserve replacement levels from all categories was somewhat over 100%. In the Middle
East-North Africa, the highly profitable Dolphin project has not replaced its production because of the nature of its
contract. This makes overall reserve replacement for the Middle East-North Africa region very difficult. Despite this
fact, the 2011 program, which includes only the reserve categories, extensions and discoveries, and improved recovery,
covered about 70% of the region's production. Oil price increases, which under the production sharing contracts
reduced our share of the reserves, and non-fundamental factors in Libya and Iraq essentially negated the reserve adds to
the program. As the program progresses, we expect that Libya and Iraq reserves will be restored.
In the United States, the results of 2011 program and acquisitions replaced around 250% of production, with both
elements contributing about equal amounts. After price and other adjustments to prior-year estimates, U.S. reserve
replacement was well over 150%.
As we look ahead to 2012, we expect the oil and gas production to be as follows. During the first half of 2012, we
expect our domestic production to grow 3,000 to 4,000 BOE a day per month from the current quarterly average of
449,000 BOE a day, which would correspond to a 6,000 to 8,000 BOE a day increase per quarter. As Jim noted, the
fourth quarter 2011 was relatively free of significant operational disruptions, resulting in better than expected domestic
production. A more typical experience with respect to such issues could moderate the growth somewhat in the first
quarter of 2012. If the production growth rate continued at a comparable pace in the second half of the year, our
year-over-year average production growth would be similar, between 8% and 10% this year.
Internationally, Colombia production should be about flat for the year compared to 2011. In the first quarter of 2012,
volume should be about 3,000 barrels a day higher than the fourth quarter of 2011, although insurgent activity has
picked up recently.
The Middle East region is expected to be as follows for the first half of the year. Production has resumed in our
operations in Libya. And at this point, we expect about 5,000 barrel equivalent a day of production, with further growth
to come later in the year. At this point, we reasonably expect total year production will be about half the level that
existed prior to the cessation operations.
In Iraq, as I discussed previously, production levels depend on capital spending. We are still unable to reliably predict
the timing of spending levels, but we expect production to be similar to the past quarter.
In Yemen, as we previously disclosed, our Masila block contract expired in December. Our share of the production in
Masila was about 11,000 BOE a day for the full year. Our remaining operations in Yemen typically have higher
volumes early in the year due to the timing of cost recovery each year, which will partially offset the loss of Masila
barrels in the first half of 2012. As a result, we expect our total Yemen production to drop slightly from the fourth
quarter 2011 levels in the first half of the year. In the remainder of the Middle East, we expect production to be
comparable to fourth quarter volumes.
At current prices, we expect total first quarter sales volumes to be comparable to fourth quarter 2011 volumes,
depending on the scheduling of liftings. A $5 change in global oil prices would impact our production sharing contract
daily volumes by about 3,000 barrels per day. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $100 million for
seismic and drilling for our exploration programs in the first quarter.

The Chemical segment first quarter earnings are expected to be about $165 million, with seasonal demand
improvement expected in the second and third quarters. We expect that lower natural gas prices and the continuing
improvement in the global economy will have a positive impact on our Chemical business margin, which is expected to
be offset partially by higher ethylene prices.
We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the first quarter of 2012 to increase to about 40%. The increase from
2011 reflects a higher proportional mix of international income with higher tax rates, in particular from Libya.
To summarize, we closed 2011 on a solid note with the high domestic oil and gas production in the fourth quarter,
which was ahead of our guidance. We continued to generate strong financial returns well above our cost to capital. We
enter this year raising our capital program by 10% compared with last year in order to prudently pursue our substantial
inventory, higher return growth projects. The business continues to grow and generate free cash flow after capital,
which should allow us to consistently grow our dividend at an attractive rate, further boosting the total return to our
shareholders.
I think we're now ready to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi. Good morning, Steve.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Steve, I was going to go very general on the questions actually. First of all, I wondered if you
could observe how you expect the U.S. natural gas market to rationalize itself, whether we've got an issue with
associated gas production? Obviously, a very low price relative to the full cycle cost of production and so on; I just
would be quite interested to hear what your latest views are on that. Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The bulk of our gas is associated gas, so it comes off with the oil. There's not much I can do
about cutting that back.
I think the current price is clearly not sustainable. I don't think anybody's pure gas drilling works at whatever it is,
$2.50, $2.60. I think we need to wait for the U.S. economy to improve. All these other fixes people talk about are much
longer term. But if the U.S. economy improves, we'll use more natural gas and hopefully bring the prices up. But I
think $2.50 for a rational person in drilling pure gas wells, no matter what they say, maybe they hedged it or something
for next year, it's just not a sensible price and is significantly below any rational replacement cost.
We can't do much about ours to reduce it because we just don't drill that many pure gas wells. We're not going to shut
any in because, again, most of the gas is associated. So you have to have – in order to make this work, you have to have
a reduction in gas drilling, an improvement in the U.S. economy. And frankly, the costs of drilling the wells have to
come down. We're obviously not – despite what some people think, we're obviously not going to be in a $10 an MCF
gas price environment anytime soon. And so we need to bring the cost of drilling of gas wells down to rational levels.
Some of that will come from efficiencies and some of it will come out of service companies.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Yes, fine. And the second very general one is on M&A, firstly specifically to OXY, whether
you're seeing the potential for more deals, or whether you're happy with your organic growth rate as it stands today.
And also, industry-wide would be interesting as well, the M&A trend for 2012. Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Most of the stuff that's for sale is pretty gassy right now. And the prices that people are
talking about don't reflect rational, current, or even the strip in gas prices. We try to buy things for inventory; that is to
say drilling three, four, or five years from now. We're not trying to buy current production. So I think the organic in the

United States is fine and I think will be fine overall. So I'm not really in any hurry to spend a lot of money on some
acquisition, especially a very capital intensive one. A lot of the things that are being done are extraordinarily capital
intensive and on a good day, cash flow equals capital. And so that's just not what we want to build, so I'm real reluctant
to enter one of these capital traps.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Understood. And then very finally on California, post-regulatory change, have you had a notable
change?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yes, I think I say that in the remarks that clearly, we've gotten some permits, some injector
permits. That's the first time in a long time we've got that, and clearly a change in attitude. And so the question is really
where do you get the permits, not necessarily exactly how many. But I think as we approach midyear, we'll have a
sizable opportunity based on current trends. So I think we feel pretty good about this at this point. Especially, it may be
that we were being hit in the head with two hammers, now only one and you feel better. But right now, we feel pretty
good about this.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Because the last time we spoke, it was five rigs added every six months constrained by...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think once we get rolling and the permits come in at a more normal rate, the rig count will
pick up. But right now, we'll wait until the permits are in hand.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Good morning, Steve, Jim.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: And thanks for taking my call. I've got a couple as well, if I may. I just want to pick up on Paul's
final point. It looks to us that you've got about a couple hundred permits in the last few months of the year; as you see,
a pretty significant step-up. Can you give us an idea of how that's being split between unconventional – or sorry, I
guess the rate of unconventional drilling and the new conventional exploration program. And I've got a couple
follow-ups, please.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Most of the permits are within fields. They're within existing fields because those are, in
some ways, the easiest permits to give. So I think that's the best way to say it. It's within current field boundaries
because those are the easiest thing to clear. And so there's no way to tell you what the split is, but it's really within the
existing fields.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Maybe my second question is really on the conventional exploration program because I
think when we last spoke, Steve, you had suggested that's where your preference for incremental capital would be. Are
you actually done delineating the original Gunslinger exploration discovery? Are you basically now done with that and
moved on to new exploration targets? In which case, can you give us an update on progress?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're in the development phase. There will be more wells drilled this year in that. And it
may not be perfectly delineated. It will be delineated through the development phase, not an exploration phase. We
basically moved on to look for other opportunities because that program has moved out of exploration.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it, okay. And then my final one is in 2010, you suggested that you could double your
Midstream earnings to about $1 billion. And I think a large part of that was predicated upon the increased steam flood
at Mukhaizna. Can you just give us an update as to where both of those things stand? And I'll leave it at that, thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Mukhaizna doesn't generate any Midstream earnings. Most of it was different gas
processing projects around California and the Permian and the Al Hosn gas processing, so that's where a lot of it is.

There are other pieces around our pipeline business. The pipeline business is actually doing pretty good. So that's
growing nicely, and we're putting more effort into the pipeline business because we think there's more money to be
made there. So additional tariffs – and Dolphin also is another area of significant growth because they're moving more
gas and we're getting – we may not get credit for barrels, but we're getting a fair amount of fee income. It's not –
Mukhaizna uses gas. It doesn't make money on gas.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I guess what I was referring to, Steve, was the incremental steam flood. I was under the
impression that you had some control of the pipelines over there, and that would generate some revenue.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: As they use more gas.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Right.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: And the gas will have to come from Dolphin, and there will be more fee income from that. I
guess that's the way to think about it.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. So maybe just to clarify and then I'll jump off, the Mukhaizna steam flood expansion, has
that been permitted and approved, or what is the status of that?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Maybe Sandy can answer that.
<A - Edward A. Lowe>: Paul, we're permitted...
<Q - Doug Leggate>: It's Doug; apologies for the English accent.
<A - Edward A. Lowe>: Sorry, Doug, similar accents, sorry. The permitting is up to about 680,000 barrels of steam
per day and we're running about 430,000. So we're just about to bring on quite a bit more this year. In fact, most of it
comes on this year. We're now looking at the practicalities and possibilities of a third phase of steam flooding as we
further understand this reservoir.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the answers to the questions.

Your next question comes from Jessica Chipman of Tudor Pickering Holt.
<Q - Jessica Chipman>: Good morning. First question just quickly, could you please give us an update, Steve, on
current well costs really in the Bakken, the Wolfberry, and the Bone Spring?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Bakken well costs haven't really changed from the third quarter. They're still too high. It's
for what you get relative to our other projects. Somebody else may have a different hurdle rate than we do, so we've cut
back. I don't think we've had any real inflation. Bill?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Jessica, on the Wolfberry, we're looking, depending on where you are in the basin, $2
million to $2.5 million completed well costs there. And in the Bone Spring, those long reach horizontals are somewhere
in the $6 million to $7 million per well range.
<Q - Jessica Chipman>: Okay. And then in the Bakken, I think the last update was $8 million to $8.5 million.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: That's still a good number, Jessica, yes.
<Q - Jessica Chipman>: Okay. And just my second question, in your comments around the acquisitions, acquisition
potential could be a capital trap even, is a segue into this question. OXY has ramped activity pretty significantly
recently, and CapEx is increasing as a percentage of total cash flow. 2011 looks more like two-thirds of cash flow,
whereas historically OXY was more in the 35% to 50% range. The question is just in general how you think about

capital efficiency as OXY allocates spend from long-dated international products to more capital intensive drilling in
the U.S.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Long-dated projects are just that. The returns will be good just a few years before the
production starts. In the United States, you can't really ignore the fact that the price of oil is not $40 anymore, which is
the way we used to budget it, but some other higher number. The objective of the exercise is that we spend about 25%
of our money on finding and development, about 25% on lifting costs, production taxes, that sort of thing, giving us
50% gross pre-tax margins. So as oil prices go up, and we've got a lot of oil in place around, both in California and the
Permian, as oil prices go up, we're going to spend more to basically raise the bar.
It won't raise the capital. I don't think it will hurt the capital efficiency over time. But you've got – you can't just assume
the price of oil is going to be $40. Nor can you say what I'm going to do is I'm not going to spend the money and store
the oil in the ground. So it's just a balance between returns and growth. We've tried to have a system where we're in
between. We're not trying to spend all our capital for sure and we're not trying to also deplete the business. You can cut
the capital and get whatever you want. Your returns would go up but the business would deplete. We could spend a lot
more money and have a lot more growth, and we wouldn't have the high dividend growth rate that companies enjoy and
will continue to enjoy. I don't know how else to answer it.
<Q - Jessica Chipman>: Then just two very, very quick ones. Going forward, will you then target a certain plowback
ratio in terms of capital as a percent of cash flow?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No, no. It's totally driven by the opportunity set.
<Q - Jessica Chipman>: Okay. And then...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's not driven by some formula. It's driven by an opportunity set to – and it depends on oil
prices. Even our workover program is really an oil price driven program. If you get your money back real quick, we'll
spend more money on workovers. If oil prices decline and you won't get your money back so quick, you'll spend less,
and it's really that simple. These are short-term programs to some extent. The stuff that's drilling in the Permian, a lot of
oil there, and I think capturing oil at $100 a barrel is probably pretty good business.
<Q - Jessica Chipman>: And just last, will you provide an update sometime this year on the long-term growth rate of
5% to 8%? Is that still what you're targeting for 2012?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's still a long-term target we've had for a variety of reasons, mostly outside our control.
We had a tougher year in the Middle East than we had anticipated. But when that gets back on track, pretty
straightforward to make the growth rates.
<Q - Jessica Chipman>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Hey, good morning, Steve, or good afternoon.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Congratulations on the results. I guess in the past, shale has not been as much of a priority
given, I guess, the returns that you have in California and in the Permian in your CO2 floods. But I guess you're
increasing rig counts. You've given the costs just in answer to the previous question for the Wolfberry and the Bone
Spring. It is encouraging progress on recoveries, EURs, and IPs that's encouraging you to spend more, or it is the oil
price?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yes, it's both. If oil were $30, the higher recoveries wouldn't be any good, so it's oil price.
We're driven by this 25% F&D margin thought or 50% including all the costs. And we don't use $100 oil. But for sure,

we're not using $40 to do this, and it's relatively straightforward. There where we have a large inventory, we can either
spend a lot more or a lot less, and it's really in our control. We're going to ramp the program up or down based on the
returns that we see looking at these margins. These margins will generate, by the way, very substantial returns on
invested capital; the accounting type, not the IRR things people talk about, which I could impress with you those but I
don't think they're very meaningful.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And on the mix in terms of increase, more Wolfberry wells or more Bone Spring wells just in
terms of...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think they're more Wolfberry, aren't they, Bill?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yes, the preponderance of our program, development program, is Wolfberry in the
Permian for 2012, Ed.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Good. And just on California, obviously, you increase five rigs every six months from the
middle of this year. Any thoughts on where you see the maximum rig count for California driven by, obviously,
internal constraints, say organizational, and maybe external constraints?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No, I don't have any idea. We'll find out. As the program boosts, we'll see where it takes us.
It's relatively people intensive, so you have to build your organization as you go. It's not just a bunch of guys.
Hopefully, it's not a bunch of guys just fooling around on a computer. So you have to build the organization as you go
and the people have to get more experienced. So you want to do it in a way you're not wasting money. The resource
isn't going away. We own the minerals. We either own our minerals or we have very long leases. The resource isn't
going away, so we've got a lot of flexibility on when. And I really don't have any idea because the program always has
surprises. Some of them are good surprises and some of them are not, but the program always has surprises. It's very
difficult. Especially in California, it's very difficult to predict some maximum rate.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Final question for me, you said most of the permits are within fields when we talk about the
increase in permits. Any progress on geologically and doing the EIA [Environmental Impact Assessment]
environmental assessments to define some new field areas within the acreage?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yes, we're doing that. We'll get the permits eventually. This is just where we are right now.
Because the state, it's easy to clear permits within a field. It's easy in theory. They weren't doing it before, so that allows
to us have a decent program and a predictable program. But there's a fair amount of progress. There are always issues
in California, environmental issues that they're rightly concerned about; so are we. So I think there's always going to be
something that isn't perfect for us, but we're pretty encouraged at the way things are going now.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Thanks.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Sven Del Pozzo of IHS Herold.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Yes, good afternoon.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Hi, good morning to us.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Good morning. I know you've got the royalty advantage in California. I'm wondering if on
your Permian acreage, you have similar advantages because you've had the acreage for a long time.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think our royalty interests are significantly below average. And if you look, if you went
over the whole thing compared to the current thing, it's not as great an advantage as in California for sure because a lot
of ranchers still own the underlying minerals. I'm going to guess it's nine to ten points of average against new leases
that somebody might take.

<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay, thank you. And some Permian piece, talking about the Wolfberry again with the
inclusion of some other interbedded zones perhaps, which vary from area to area are talking about a 25% increase in
EUR compared to a couple years ago that the reservoir engineers are giving them and a little bit less than that on IP
rates. But I was wondering whether you're experiencing similar performance given the application of new hydraulic
fracturing techniques.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think we need to hire their reservoir engineers because they have different numbers than
we do.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay. Then just for clarification, in the Bone Spring, are we talking Avalon Shale or the Bone
Spring sands? How is the program weighted?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: It's definitely more weighted to the Bone Springs sands because, as you know, that's an
oily play, whereas the Avalon is mainly gas.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay, any interest in vertical stacked pays in the, say, Wolfbone or drilling vertically on your
acreage at this point in Bone Spring still?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yes, we're looking at that as well.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay, and then last question. Could you just give me a general impression of John Laird, what
you know about him historically, and what you've seen most recently, what you like?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Who?
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: The Secretary of Natural Resources that was appointed by Jerry Brown, the new guy.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's a lot higher than – we're nuts and bolts people working with people giving permits.
Policies are best left to more sophisticated people than us.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: So it's bottom-up – it's debottlenecking you could say that's helping things along?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's right in the agency that generates the permits.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Which is basically an engineering discussion about things. It's not about California
environmental policies, which is way above my pay grade.

Thank you. Your next question comes from David Neuhauser of Livermore Partners.
<Q - David Neuhauser>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - David Neuhauser>: My question is a little bit macro. I wanted to see or get some thought into some the
headwinds that are currently facing the company as we look out this year and the next few years. We've had hard asset,
hard commodity prices actually fall overall this past year with the strengthening dollar. But at the same time, we've
seen recoupling between WTI and Brent crude. So I wanted to see if you think prices will remain stable in this band, or
what your current thoughts are on the landscape.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: For planning purposes, we're always more conservative than the current pricing. We're not
very good at predicting this, you should understand. We were conservative at $25 oil too. So as a matter of running the
business, we're always conservative about how we manage the business and what we expect for product prices.

Having said that, I think globally it costs more to find a barrel of oil. I'm talking about oil, not gas, than it did a few
years ago. It doesn't make any difference where that is. The overall finding costs are rising, and I think it's very likely
that that will continue to push prices higher over time. For planning purposes, we're always conservative about it.
There's always a bearish argument for oil prices. There's always some explanation of why it's going to go down, and
there's also the wacky extreme argument it's going to $200 a barrel in an hour. So I think it's almost impossible to ever
have anything except a general view that over time that it will rise with costs and to be, I think, conservative on a
short-term basis.
<Q - David Neuhauser>: Okay, and what about opportunities in general? I know you touched on a bit of M&A
activities out there today and you're seeing a lot of gassy assets. But are there areas out there or areas that you'd like to
focus on where you could see increasing your footprint that would be more advantageous to do so with an acquisition?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're basically not, as a rule, company buyers. There are always properties around. We
added in the Bakken basically not by buying companies but by buying assets. We'll continue to do that. I wouldn't
expect to see some new areas, if that's the question, but we'll see. I'm always surprised at what shows up in the course
of a year, or my ability to predict this is even less good than my ability to predict oil prices.
<Q - David Neuhauser>: Okay. And my last question is, what are some things – you seem again to be hitting on all
cylinders for the most part on the year. And I guess my question is what are some of the things that you're most not
happy with, with the company's performance today that you would definitely like to see...?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think we can get more efficient. I think there are always improvements in efficiency that
are around. We're on an efficiency drive, but I think that's always something that we're looking for. You never get – the
problem with the goal is you never get to perfect. And even if you did, we'd move the goalposts, so not much chance
getting to perfect. We look for that.
I'm always unhappy about some of the physical breakdowns. The infrastructure in the United States needs work. And
so we get more breakdowns in the infrastructure than you might like, so the full potential of business really never
shows up in any quarter. Those are the main things I'm concerned about. I can't do anything about the oil prices, so
there's no sense in being worried about it.

<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, that's fine. In terms of your Midstream spend, how much of that's going to be in
California and the Midcontinent?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Most of the spend in the Midstream is the gas plant right now, the Al Hosn gas plant, so that
big number there is pretty much that. The gas plant in California will be done – this plant will be done – the spending
will be pretty much done by midyear for sure, most of the remaining spending probably this quarter. And then there
will be some gas plant spending in the Permian, CO2 plants and stuff, but a much lower level. But the big number you
see there is the finishing up of the California plant and the gas plant, Al Hosn gas plant.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, the last two from me. What's water disposal running per barrel in the Bakken in terms

Thank you. Your next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citi.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Steve, I just want to go back to, I think, some of your comments on Iraq and Libya. The
spending level in Iraq, you talked about an 11,000 barrel a day number for the year, I believe. How confident are you in
that number? Are things getting done on the ground there to be able to keep that spending level fairly consistent?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sandy will answer that.
<A - Edward A. Lowe>: We've had a series of meetings in November and December with the procurement
committees in Iraq. And they've recently approved a number of drilling related contracts. And indeed, the main drilling
contract has got a letter of intent approval. This will get all the drilling started. The facilities that will be needed for the
increasing production are under bid right now, and they're coming through the committees in the first and second
quarter. So we are seeing an opening up of procurement which, of course, drives our production.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: To put it in financial terms, I think we feel okay about the 11,000 barrels a day, but it's
certainly not the most solid number. On the other hand, if it worked right, it would be more.

<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, fair enough. In Libya, what's the situation on the ground with you guys right now? How
confident are you that you can bring those volumes to the level that you outlined in your prepared remarks?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sandy can answer that.
<A - Edward A. Lowe>: Right now, the gross production in the fields where we have an interest are at about 65% –
70% of what they were before the conflict started. We are continuing and our Libyan partners are continuing to repair
and improve, and they still have a small drilling program going. So I think that we'll be back up to normal later this
year, probably in the third quarter. We're still working with an interim government, so we're currently meeting with our
counterparts in Libya every day to discuss how to go forward and how to increase production even further.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We try to be conservative in the estimate for that, understanding...
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Sure, that makes sense.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: ...things don't work perfectly.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, fair enough, and last question. In Bahrain, any updates on, I think, the exploration of the
deep gas rights that you guys have?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're drilling the wells this year. A well will be drilled this year.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: How many, Steve, sorry?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think it's supposed to be – it's one deep and a couple others. Whether they get all done this
year is a different issue, but the drilling will start this year.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Any operational issues in Bahrain following some of the civil unrest?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sandy?
<A - Edward A. Lowe>: It's a little more difficult place to work. We have trouble with our contractors sometimes, but
it has been relatively quiet recently. We are watching the anniversary of the initial problems there. But it has affected
our production only a few hundred barrels on a per-day basis over the year. Things are recently okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's growing. It's probably a little behind where we thought we'd be. But it's actually
growing and doing fine.

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think generally they're going back to a version of their historic rules. And they have a
sizable backlog from us and others I'm sure to clear. And so what they have to do is work through to get back to their
historic rules. And again, the easiest ones to clear are the ones within the fields. I think they'll get to some version of
historical rules. There will be other rules that won't be quite historical, but I'm not really concerned. As long as we
understand the rules, we'll abide by them. There isn't really a long-term problem. It's just that the rules have to be clear
to us, that's all.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay. Is it fair to say in the last 12 months since Brown came into office that there has been
a systemic change in how they approach it versus the...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The governor is very pro-jobs, industry, whatever you want to say, and has been someone
who understands that businesses generate jobs. We've added a fair number of jobs here in California. We continue to.

very interested in employment here in the state. And we're pleased with the governor's involvement.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: And just one last quick one. Did you book any reserves in Iraq in 2011?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: In 2011 – we booked some in 2010 based on the program that was approved. Unfortunately,
the program because for a variety of reasons, and the program was only approved through 2013. For a variety of
reasons, we didn't achieve the program in 2011 mostly because we didn't spend the money and we couldn't. So the net
result was that the reserves were negatively affected by the program. Those reserves will come back once the program
– you can't book reserves beyond where the program has been approved by the government. So once they give us
approval beyond 2013, those reserves will come back. As a technical matter, those reserves came off.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay, understood. Thanks very much.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sure. Chris?
