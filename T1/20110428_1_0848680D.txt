MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Carmen and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Sprint First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks there
will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Yijing Brentano,
VP of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Brentano. You may begin.
Yijing Brentano
Thank you, Carmen. Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for
joining us this morning. For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the
quarter. And then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are
both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint Web site. Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point
out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information which involves a number of
risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We
provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part One,
Item 1A, Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K, and when filed, Part Two, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP
performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the first quarter can be found on

attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our Web site at
www.sprint.com/investors.
Next I would like to cover our loss-per-share results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the first quarter were
$0.15 compared to $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2010, and $0.29 in the year-ago period. The improvement in loss per
share as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 was partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in
adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call.
In addition loss per share improved sequentially due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization and interest
expense. The reduction in interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in amount of interest capitalized which
is related to our intention to deploy certain spectrum licenses as part of Network Vision that were not previously
utilized. We expect full year capitalized interest related to these spectrum licenses to be approximately $400 million.
Looking ahead at depreciation and amortization, the successful testing of push-to-talk technology on the CDMA
network as part of the deployment of Network Vision in our test markets during the remainder of the year is expected
to result in accelerated depreciation and amortization on certain assets. We recorded a net tax expense of $37 million in
the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to the temporary difference associated with amortization of our spectrum. For tax
reporting purposes the spectrum intangible is amortized, but for financial reporting, it is considered an indefinite life
asset with no associate amortization. Therefore, rather than expressing our income tax expense as a percentage of
pre-tax loss as we did at year end and prior, we're now providing our expectations in terms of net tax expense to
provide a clearer view of our tax outlook. For the full year 2011 we expect our net tax expense to be approximately
$200 million.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse.
Daniel R. Hesse
Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, and thanks for joining us. First, our thoughts and prayers are with the people in
the southern United States in the wake of the tragic tornadoes that have touched down there, and Sprint will do all we
can to help with that tragic situation.
Well, this is my 13th quarter with Sprint and it sure beats reporting the results after my first quarter on the job, which
was the first quarter of 2008. Driven by customer service and sub-prime issues, that quarter I reported the worst
postpaid churn since the Sprint Nextel merger, 2.45%. By contrast, this quarter I'm reporting the best quarterly postpaid
churn in Sprint's long history. We continue to make slow but steady progress with respect to our goals of improving the
customer experience, strengthening our brand and generating cash. This quarter's performance is particularly
noteworthy because of the unique changes in the first quarter's market dynamic.
Verizon announced its iPhone and AT&T responded with price as even a duopoly provides more competition that a
device monopoly. Even with these headwinds, because of our relentless focus on improving the customer experience,
we felt we could increase our price for data on smart devices so that we could maintain Sprint's unique
customer-friendly unlimited and worry-free data plans. Our strengthening brand helped us mitigate what otherwise
would have been difficult to navigate increasing our price in the face of a new iconic competitive device and
widespread industry price pressure.
Going to Slide 4, beginning with our first goal, the customer experience, I am pleased to report our 13th consecutive
quarter of improved customer satisfaction with Care and first call resolution. It's a tough streak to keep going, as the bar
keeps getting higher. Our top box and bottom box satisfaction scores also reached best-ever levels according to the
Advanis survey. In spite of the increased complexity and inherent customer questions generated by smartphones which
reached an all-time high of 73% of quarterly CDMA device sales and 54% of the base, calls to Care per customer
decreased yet again to another all-time low, achieving industry best in class levels.
We were recently named the J.D. Power 2011 customer service champion, one of only 40 U.S. companies to earn this
distinction across 800 companies assessed across 12 industries. Also in the quarter a very well-known third-party report

evaluating our CDMA service rated us best in the industry in customer service satisfaction, and we also maintained our
number one ranking for data network satisfaction. Based on internal metrics, our iDEN network achieved best-ever
performance for blocks and drops.
If you'd please go to Slide 5, our brand continues to strengthen. For the fourth consecutive quarter the Sprint brand was
the fastest-growing national postpaid wireless brand in the country as measured by net subscriber growth. The Sprint
brand added 310,000 net postpaid subscribers, and our entire postpaid business was net port positive versus our
competition for the second consecutive quarter. Last quarter was the first time our postpaid business had ever achieved
being net port positive, including the Nextel brand. Unlike last quarter, the gains in Sprint brand customers did not fully
offset the decline in Nextel customers, but our postpaid subscriber loss number improved 80% versus last year.
Our total company net adds of 1.12 million versus the net loss one year ago was our highest number in five years, and
our retail net adds of 732,000 was also a five-year best. The quarter's MVP was churn. We registered our best postpaid
churn number ever, and the best year-over-year improvement we've made in quarterly churn in five years. In Sprint's
entire history, if you were to pick the four best individual quarters for churn ever, those four would be the last four.
Prepaid churn was also strong, hitting our lowest level in over five years.
Turning to Slide 6. As you know, subscriber performance depends upon a strong brand. The Reputation Institute is a
very well-respected research organization that publishes its findings on corporate reputation each year in Forbes
magazine. Their extensive research has found that seven factors drive a company's reputation, which is arguably
synonymous with a holistic measure of a company's brand. These seven factors are performance, products and services,
leadership, governance, the workplace, citizenship and innovation.
We recently learned that of the 1,500 large companies that the Reputation Institute includes in its worldwide survey,
they found that from 2009 to 2010, Sprint's corporate reputation was the most improved of any company in the world
and Sprint showed one of the largest gains they've ever seen in any year by any company. We are seeing other brand
metrics improve as well, with purchase consideration and first brand preference achieving best-ever levels in the
quarter. Our net promoter score, according to a recent Yankee Group study, improved far more than for any carrier over
the past year, which is consistent with the results of another, very well-known, third-party study.
Our brand stretches beyond the consumer market. ATLANTIC-ACM recently ranked Sprint the number one brand for
the first time for U.S. wholesale excellence and for global wholesale excellence. Sprint achieved additional number one
rankings for U.S. provisioning, network and customer service, and for global voice value.
Moving on to prepaid, which is on Slide 7, we achieved our best-ever quarter for prepaid net adds, 846,000. With each
of our brands, Boost, Virgin and Assurance, posting positive gains, and as I mentioned, our best prepaid churn in over
five years. Boost won the 2011 J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction award for non-contract or prepaid services. Purchase
consideration for both Boost and Virgin were also at best-ever levels last quarter.
Our device leadership is also key to the brand, as is the innovation and citizenship demonstrated through our green
initiatives. The new Samsung Replenish, pictured on Slide 8, our fourth green phone, sets a new benchmark for
renewable devices. It's made with 82% recycled materials, housed in recycled plastics, and it's energy efficient and
built with far fewer environmentally sensitive materials than a typical smartphone. We're pricing this Android 2.2 touch
QWERTY smartphone at only $49. We're also making available another technical breakthrough, a back panel that's a
solar charger, as a $29 accessory. Our green products do well, but they haven't reached mainstream status, so to take
green mainstream, we're lowering the monthly rate for this Smartphone only by $10 a month for new or existing
customers.
Sprint has launched or announced 22 4G devices, the largest 4G portfolio of any wireless carrier in the U.S. During the
first quarter, Sprint launched its third 4G phone, the HTC EVO Shift 4G and the Overdrive Pro 3G 4G Mobile Hot Spot
by Sierra Wireless. In addition, we announced the upcoming availability of two 4G tablets, the BlackBerry 4G
PlayBook and the HTC EVO View 4G, as well as two more handsets, including the HTC EVO 3D and the Nexus S 4G
from Google.

Sprint dominated the device recognition coming out of the recent CTIA show in Orlando. You've got to see the
no-glasses 3D screen on the new EVO 3D to believe it.
Turning to Slide 9 and our final priority, cash, adjusted OIBDA was $1.514 billion and represented the highest
sequential percentage improvement in OIBDA in over five years and the first year-over-year increase in OIBDA in
over four years. The main reason for this improvement beyond normal seasonality is ARPU, mainly postpaid but also
prepaid. Postpaid ARPU showed both its biggest year-over-year gain and largest sequential increase in over five years.
Wireless service revenue grew sequentially 2.9% the highest increase in four and a half years. Cash flow remained
positive and in the first quarter we paid off all of 2011's remaining maturities.
Finally, I'd like to make some comments about the proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T. It's a well-known
fact that innovation and competition go hand in hand. Innovation and customer choice would be threatened if a duopoly
were created. As investors in this industry, I bet there are a few listeners on this call that would like to see wireless
prices rise which would be more likely in duopoly structure, but I believe these industry benefits would be more than
offset by industry health risks like the decline in innovation and creativity that could result from a duopoly.
Sprint's innovative influence on this industry demonstrates why the wireless industry is much better off by having a
strong number three player. I think there is little doubt Sprint's leadership in rolling out the first national 4G network
greatly influenced Verizon's decision to pressure the industry suppliers to accelerate the market availability timetables
for the LTE standard and Verizon's own timetable to roll out 4G services which in turn accelerated AT&T's
deployment timetable for 4G. As a result, after losing global wireless technology leadership when Europe introduced
2G with GSM, the U.S. has regained wireless network technology and innovation supremacy because of America's
leadership in 4G. If Sprint had not been a legitimate high ARPU postpaid customer competitive threat, the U.S. would
still be a wireless also-ran. Our leadership in pricing and in simplicity has led others to follow too. AT&T recently
enacted a rate plan in response to losing their iPhone monopoly, which looks eerily similar to Any Mobile, Anytime,
the rate plan introduced by Sprint in 2009.
Many of you on the phone are analysts and investors thinking about the macro impact of such a merger on our industry.
It seems that some believe that a duopoly and the inherent price stability that might result from marginalizing the
innovative number three competitor is a good thing for carriers any way if not for other wireless industry suppliers and
participants based upon the increases in the AT&T and Verizon stock prices since the proposed merger was announced.
But I don't think enough thought has been given to the likely reduction in wireless innovation, the possibility of more
regulation to make up for the loss of competitive market forces and the influence more regulation could have on
diverting away investment dollars from wireless to say nothing of the impact a carrier duopoly could have on other
industry players like network infrastructure or handset suppliers or app developers. Sprint is pro competitive and our
investment thesis is that all boats will float higher in a vibrant and innovative industry, especially an industry that has
the unbridled potential of wireless.
Now I'd like to turn the discussion over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Joe Euteneuer, who wasn't here in the first
quarter but who has come up to speed remarkably quickly, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail.
Thank you.
Joseph J. Euteneuer
Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start out by saying how excited I am to have joined Sprint. In my
short time here so far I have been very impressed by the team that Dan has assembled, and I look forward to helping
Sprint realize the full potential of the opportunities ahead of us.
Moving on to Slide 10, I'd like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the first quarter. Sequentially total
consolidated net operating revenues grew slightly as growth in wireless service revenues were offset by declines in
wireless equipment revenue and wireline revenue. Total consolidated revenues grew by 2.8% compared to the year-ago
period primarily due to higher ARPU and postpaid and prepaid subscribers, growth in the number of prepaid
subscribers and higher wireless equipment revenues partially offset by net losses of postpaid subscribers and lower

wireline revenues.
Wireless service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, improved by 2.9% as compared to the
fourth quarter 2010 and 3.7% as compared to the year-ago period. The sequential and year-over-year improvements
were primarily due to higher postpaid and prepaid ARPU and growth in prepaid net subscribers. Postpaid ARPU
improved by nearly $1 as compared to the fourth quarter 2010, and as Dan mentioned, this was the largest sequential
improvement in over five years.
Postpaid ARPU benefited sequentially from higher monthly recurring charges, primarily related to the $10 premium
data add-on charge, which we have applied to all smartphones activated since January 30. We expect sequential growth
in postpaid ARPU in the second quarter due to continued growth in smartphone sales and the $10 premium data add-on
charge.
Prepaid ARPU improved sequentially driven by growth in Boost Mobile ARPU and improvement in rate plan mix
among our Virgin Mobile Beyond Talk customer base. Looking forward, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber
base among our brands, can cause overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate in the short term. In 2011, we continue to expect
wireless service revenues to grow, wireline revenue to decline, and total consolidated net operating revenues to be flat
to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving on to Slide 11, I'll talk about the drivers of consolidated adjusted OIBDA. As Dan mentioned, consolidated
adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was slightly over $1.5 billion, up $199 million sequentially and $36 million from the
year-ago quarter. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA grew year-over-year for the first time in over four years. Adjusted
OIBDA margin improved 230 basis points sequentially, the largest improvement in almost four years. Wireless
adjusted OIBDA grew sequentially primarily due to growth in wireless service revenues and reduced net subsidy and
sales costs driven by fewer post-date gross ads and upgrades. Wireless cost of service was slightly higher sequentially
as the benefit related to the change in intercompany rates was offset by higher costs, including increased 4G wholesale
costs from growth in the number of 4G smartphones and the settlement of the pricing dispute with Clearwire, which I'll
discuss in a moment.
Wireline adjusted OIBDA declined as compared to the fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to lower revenue associated
with the intercompany rate change and the migration of wholesale cable, VoIP subscribers off of Sprint's wireline
platform. As a reminder, each year we update our intercompany rates for transactions between our Wireline and
Wireless segments to better reflect market-based pricing. The change has no impact on consolidated adjusted OIBDA,
but does have a positive impact of wireless cost of service and an equally offsetting negative impact on wireline
revenue as compared to prior periods.
As previously communicated, that impact is expected to be slightly less than $250 million for the full year 2011 and
was approximately $60 million sequentially for the first quarter. We previously expected a sequential decline in the
first quarter enrolled wireline adjusted OIBDA of $25 million related to the cable VoIP migration. However, the
sequential impact was less than expected, due to migration delays by our wholesale partner. In addition, cost reductions
offset some of the sequential decline in wireline adjusted OIBDA. Due to the timing of migrations, we now expect the
full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable VoIP customers to cause wireline adjusted OIBDA to decline by
approximately $150 million for the full year 2011 as compared to our previous expectation of slightly less than $200
million for 2011. We continue to expect the cable VoIP migration to last through 2014.
Again, we are pleased with the consolidated adjusted OIBDA results for the quarter given, that we faced a number of
postpaid competitive pressures in the first quarter, including device launches as well as service plan and device pricing
changes.
We expect the competitive environment to remain challenging in 2011. However, we are encouraged by the consistent
improvement we have seen in the Sprint brand and continue to focus on making further progress on postpaid subscriber
results. We expect for the full year that improvement in postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of prepaid
subscribers will benefit adjusted OIBDA. However, we expect those benefits to be offset by negative impacts of
entering 2011 with fewer postpaid subscribers, the projected decline in wireline cable VoIP revenues and higher

wireless cost of service driven by data usage and higher subsidies associated with the highly competitive handset
pricing environment. As a result, we expect for the full year 2011 adjusted OIBDA to be relatively flat with 2010,
excluding incremental operating expenses associated with Network Vision, which we expect to be between $200
million and $250 million.
Now moving on to Slide 12. We ended the quarter with approximately $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments. We also had $800 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver, for a total liquidity
position of $4.8 billion as of the end of the first quarter. We repaid the $1.65 billion note in January, 2011, which was
our only note maturity due in 2011. Our next note and loan maturities totaling $2.25 billion are not due until March of
2012.
Going forward, we plan to continue to maintain adequate liquidity to support a balanced fiscal approach, allowing for
repayment of debt, investing in capital expenditures and future growth. Our accrued capital expenditures, excluding
capitalized interest, were $555 million in the first quarter, compared to $608 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, and
$419 million in the first quarter of 2010. Capital investment in the first quarter continued to focus on wireless quality
and capacity. We continue to expect the full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding
capitalized interest, driven largely by CDMA capacity and Network Vision.
We generated $178 million in free cash flow in the first quarter. This was down from the $913 million in the fourth
quarter, primarily due to a one-time federal tax stimulus refund of approximately $153 million received in the fourth
quarter of 2010, approximately $150 million in higher cash interest payments, which is typical for the first quarter of
each year, $100 million pension contribution, and other working capital changes. We intend to make additional pension
contributions during the remainder of 2011 totaling approximately $35 million.
Looking ahead, we expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2011. However, our 2011
annual free cash flow is expected to be substantially lower than in 2010 due to the rollout of Network Vision.
Now moving on to Slide 13, as a reminder, the goals of our Network Vision initiative are to enhance voice and data
services for our customers, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs, and improve environmental sustainability.
With this project, we believe we will be installing new equipment and software, including multimode base stations,
allowing for the flexibility to offer multiple technology standards using a range of spectrum brands. As part of Network
Vision, we also intend to re-purpose some of our 800-megahertz spectrum for CDMA service to enhance coverage for
customers and launch the next generation of push-to-talk services in 2011 on the CDMA network. As previously stated,
it is expected that iDEN cell services will be phased out beginning in 2013.
The Network Vision project progressed well through the first quarter. We will continue to conduct testing in the
laboratory and in the field, and we expect to begin initial deployment in 8 of the largest metro markets following
successful testing in early fourth quarter. Our expectations of the cost and benefits related to Network Vision are
unchanged since the program was initially announced. As previously stated, the Network Vision project is expected to
yield $10 to $11 billion in net benefits over a seven-year timeframe. The total incremental cost to the Network Vision
program over the estimated three- to five-year deployment period is expected to be between $4 and $5 billion.
We project that slightly over 50% of the incremental costs will be capital while the remainder will be operating
expenses. We plan on ramping up capital expenditures related to Network Vision for the remainder of 2011. As part of
our 4G strategy, we have amended our agreement with Clearwire for wholesale pricing. The agreement resulted in
simplified data usage base pricing structure. As previously disclosed, we have agreed to pay Clearwire $175 million in
prepayments for 4G wholesale services to be used in 2011 and beyond, and minimum usage commitments of $300
million in 2011 and $550 million in 2012.
Additionally, we look forward to expanding our 4G capabilities through custom network solution deployments and
re-wholesaling services which will be possible under this new agreement.
In February, we shared that we would provide our long-term 4G strategy by midyear. We are still on target to provide
our plans within this timeframe. With the flexibility to use our own spectrum and network assets and also to deploy
spectrum owned by others, Network Vision provides us the opportunities to provide 4G services that were not available

in the past.
Before I conclude, I will cover our forecast for 2011, which we have reconfirmed today. The company expects postpaid
subscriber net additions for the full-year 2011 and to improve total wireless net subscriber additions in 2011 as
compared to 2010. We expect full-year capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $3
billion. In addition, the company expects to continue to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2011.
In conclusion, one of the things that impressed me the most about the predecessor is his relentless focus on controlling
cost. You can expect the same from me. Sprint has clearly shown progress on improving revenue trends over the last
several quarters, and we have a plan in place with Network Vision, which we believe will significantly improve the
cost structure of the business over the longer term. As I look forward to the remainder of 2011 and beyond, maximizing
shareholder value and cash flow will be a primary objective for the business. Again, I'd like to reiterate how excited I
am about the opportunities ahead for Sprint, and I look forward to talking to all of you more in the future. I'll now turn
the call back over to Yijing for Q&A.
Yijing Brentano
Thank you, Joe, and welcome to the team. In just a minute, Carmen will instruct our listeners on how to queue up for
the question-and-answer session. I want to point out that you may access an audio replay or a webcast of our
presentation on the Sprint Web site. We will now open the line for your questions. Carmen, please instruct our
participants.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of David Dixon (FBR Capital Markets).
<Q - David Dixon>: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on your spectrum D&A. It looks like you're
settling around the 800 band, the 1,600 band, the 1,900 band, and 2,500 band, and I know you're not at the point yet
where you can outline your 4G plan, but what's the flexibility to alter your spectrum D&A as we go forward? And I
look at the 1,600 band, for example, and I see you've only got a five-by-five band there. I just would like to get a sense
of the flexibility that Sprint has as we go forward with respect to spectrum usage.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Hey, David. Way to start off the morning with a technical question.
<Q - David Dixon>: I think it's an important one as we look forward to 4G, though.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Yeah, I think what you're highlighting is what Network Vision allows Sprint to do is, it allows
us to flexibly use the spectrum that we currently have, as well as it does give us the potential to host spectrum on our
cell sites that others may own and want to more cost-effectively deploy by entering a spectrum hosting arrangement
with us. So I don't know what else I can add to it at this time, because we are going to, as you indicated at the beginning
of your question, and Joe indicated in his remarks, by the middle of the year, we're going to lay out kind of a
comprehensive spectrum plan with respect to data services and 4G.
Steve, I know you're on the phone from far away. Do you want to add anything to that? Or would you rather not?
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Hi, Dan. Hi, Dave. Steve, I think we've talked about this quite a bit and we will lay
something out by midyear. And I understand your point on the amount of spectrum we've got, but we do have the
flexibility to use various spectrums, ours and others, and I think that as we lay it out we can be fairly clear on what
we'll use, how many megahertz in each one of the spectrum bands for you.
<Q - David Dixon>: I guess the other thing I'm noting is that as you look at the standards going forward, it looks like
you can start to couple noncontiguous bands. Is that something that you're looking to take advantage of out of the gate

<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Well, not necessarily right out of the gate, but yes we're working with the standards
bodies on that. I think that's something that I would prefer that we discuss once we're ready to lay it out in detail.
<Q - David Dixon>: All right. Thanks very much for the update.

And your next question will come from the line of Jason Armstrong (Goldman Sachs).
<Q - Jason Armstrong>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a couple, first on ARPU, obviously some really
good progress in the quarter. I'm wondering if you could talk through the $10 add-on plan on smartphones, just maybe
the percent of subs that were sort of impacted incrementally from that change, i.e., didn't have that plan in place before
and had it pushed on them and then specifics of how that contributed to the ARPU after the course of the quarter. And
then second on churn, good progress there as well this quarter, I guess the pushback would be the prime customer
percentage has moved down a bit so people might question whether voluntary or involuntary churn is actually
contributing to this. Just wondering if you could help us think through those two. Thank you.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Jason, Dan here. A couple of things, first we don't disclose the specific numbers with respect
to the $10 smartphone benefit to ARPU. It clearly benefited ARPU in the quarter and it will benefit postpaid ARPU
next quarter because it basically was put into place at the end of January in Q1. It's not pushed on customers. Existing
customers don't get an increase in price. It's only customers, in essence gross adds or customers that upgrade to one of
the smartphone devices that carry the data, the premium data charge, that are affected.
Second, with respect to churn and your comment about sub-prime, in essence last quarter it rounded – it was 83 and
change. It rounded up to 84. This quarter it's 83 and change. It rounds down to 83. There really is not a significant
change at all in terms of our – it continues to be very solid prime mix. We have seen significant improvements in
voluntary churn in actually the last two quarters. We look at – really what affects churn is on contract and off contract,
and when we can tell – somebody is on the phone. I don't know what you can do about that.
Anyway, with respect to our off-contract churn, which really tells you a lot about how your customer service and
loyalty is resonating with customers, the last two quarters have been our lowest two quarters, our best two quarters,
ever for off-contract churn. So we feel good about the progress that we've been making in churn, and churn is going
down for all the right reasons.
<Q - Jason Armstrong>: Great. Thanks, Dan.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: You're welcome, Jason.
Operator
And your next question will be from the line of Phil Cusick (JPMorgan).
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Hi, guys. Just a couple, first following up on Jason's question, contract expirations in previous
years have sort of declined in 2Q, and that led to sort of a seasonal drop down in churn. Dan, is that still valid for this
year?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Will you ask your question one more time? I want to make sure I understand it.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: So in previous years we've talked about how contract expiration sort of slowed down in 2Q, and
that led or was at least part of the driver for seasonal reductions in churn from 1Q to 2Q. I wonder as you project
contract expirations over the next couple of quarters is that still fair and we can look for churn to come down over that
next quarter?

<A - Yijing Brentano>: Hey, Phil. As we look at the seasonal trends first quarter to second quarter, traditionally we
have seen a decline. However, this year we don't expect to see as big of a decline given than we beat seasonal trend
from fourth quarter to the first quarter already.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Okay. That helps. And then for Joe, can you talk about the balance sheet a little bit? You're
running a big cash balance. I know you just got in, but we don't have any maturities over the next year, but you do have
a couple of pretty big maturities in '12 and '13. What do you think about refinancing those, the potential for paying
them down early and taking down some of that cash balance? When the previous CFO came in a couple of years ago,
revenue was declining very quickly. Now we've got a fairly stable revenue base. And do you really need $4 billion in
cash on the books? Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: No problem. Look, you're exactly right. I just got in here in 30 days, and I'm getting my
arms around the rollout of Network Vision and the rest of our maturities going forward. The good news is the
performance to date has allowed the company the ability to access the markets, because of the stability it's brought in
its operation and its consistency in execution. So over the next 30 to 60 days, as I get my arms around this, we'll come
back to you with more detail on what's going to happen to the capital structure.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And your next question will come from the line of John Hodulik (USB Securities).
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Great. Thanks, guys. I guess getting back to two things, really, just getting back to the $10
surcharge. Dan, did that have an effect on the upgrade rate in the quarter? And as a result, not just – you not just got the
benefit from the ARPU standpoint but also from a margin standpoint, because you're disincenting people to upgrade to
smartphones, number one. And then so if you could give that number, the upgrade rate, and maybe talk about
smartphone penetration?
And number two for Joe, as it relates to the guidance, the EBITDA grew call it 2.5% this quarter. You have some easier
comps in the second half. It sounds like you got some real ARPU momentum with the $10 surcharge. How – could you
maybe walk me through why you think flat is a good sort of starting off point without the Network Vision numbers in
there? I would have expected the underlying trends give you a little bit of growth so that even with the Network Vision
stuff you might be in the flattish range? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Sure, this is Dan, I'll take the first part of your question. It actually had a much smaller impact
on upgrades or slowing down upgrades than we had anticipated might be the case. We didn't know. So there actually
was – it did not slow down the upgrade rate significantly that is the $10 surcharge. And again, you look at the numbers
I just gave with respect to smartphone sales, which is a combination of gross adds and upgrades at 73% for the quarter,
a very, very healthy percentage of smartphone sales and upgrades this past quarter.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: And in regards to what you were asking, and with the smartphone sales, and really it's the
competitive environment and really the cost to gain that next subscriber. It's hugely competitive out there, and we're
watching it and with the continued mix on the smartphones, we have to look at that cost. And we can come back to you
in the second quarter as we see what second quarter performance looks like.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator
And your next question will come from the line of Brett Feldman (Deutsche Bank Securities).
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Thanks for taking the questions. You alluded to earlier some thoughts around spectrum hosting.
I know you're not prepared to outline specific plans yet, but maybe we could just talk about the criteria that you might

be using to evaluate those opportunities? For example, would spectrum hosting just be a new line of business for you?
And if you were able to achieve certain levels of revenue and EBITDA from a relationship that would be sufficient? Or
is it somewhat mandatory that there would need to be a more strategic benefit to you guys, to actually allow someone
else to use a portion of your network?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: That's a good question. We actually will take a very holistic view of the economics to us of
potentially doing network hosting with respect to another company and their spectrum. So first of all, we will look at
the economic impact to us, what are the cash flows associated with it? We'll look at the value to us. If there is to use of
that spectrum and the value of that capacity to us. So we'll take a very broad view of evaluating it. It's too early to say
whether we would run it as a – or think of it as a separate line of business. Not yet, but, it could potentially be that at
some point in the future. But we haven't crossed that bridge yet.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: And just to be clear, if you did decide to pursue a spectrum hosting model, that would be
incremental to what's already contemplated in Network Vision?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Yes. There would be – exactly. The Network Vision numbers that we've talked about do not
anticipate spectrum hosting as part of those numbers. So those numbers could change – the cash flows could change,
both positive and negative, in terms of capital deployment and cash coming in from a hosted company if we were to
host someone's spectrum.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Sure.
Operator
And your next question will come from the line of Michael Rollins (Citigroup).
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Dan, I'm curious what your perspective
is in terms of the iPhone. You've mentioned in the past you would see a blip upon the initial launch and then things will
settle down. Should that still be the case now going into the second and third quarters of the year? And if I could just
follow up to that. Are we any closer to seeing a Sprint logo, potentially, on an iPhone? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, nice try on the second question. Is that like the 55th time I've been asked that one? I
think, something like that. And of course we can't comment on any potential discussions with any of our suppliers.
I think what we've said historically with respect to the iPhone is – and I wouldn't call it a blip – we do typically see a
significant impact upon the launch of a new device or, in this case the iPhone 4 on a new carrier, Verizon, but it
continues to be – the iPhone does continue to be a significant, if you will, competitive threat to us first in the hands of
AT&T and then in the hands of Verizon.
The additional impact that the iPhone has had on us recently – continues to have it – is AT&T is pricing the iPhone
3GS at $49 so have you to think about both Verizon's iPhone 4 and, of course, AT&T's response to that, which I
alluded to in my opening comments, of not only continuing to offer the iPhone 4, but offering a lower-price 3GS. So
the iPhone continues to be, quarter after quarter, a successful device and one that provides very strong competition to
Sprint, but needless to say, Verizon's introduction of their new iPhone in Q1 this past quarter did have a notable impact
on our net add performance for the quarter.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks for those details.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery (Morgan Stanley).
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks, very much. Good morning. Joe, a couple of questions on the OpEx line. Can you just
go through the new Clearwire agreement? And given it was sort of signed in Q2, how does the accounting work? Is
there, sort of, prior-period adjustments? Is there anything for the new agreement in Q1, and how should we think about
that sequentially? And then on the Network Vision, you talked about an extra $200 million and $250 million of costs in
this year. How should we think about that layering through? Is that really – Q3 and Q4, or will we see some of that
starting to come through in Q2? Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: So in regards to the capital, you're exactly right. It'll be more towards the last half of the
year, although you will see some in the second quarter. In regards to the Clearwire agreement, I mean, basically there
was a $28 million charge in the first quarter, and then the rest gets allocated over the quarters coming forward on a
predefined schedule.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: So $28 million is the, it was the total amount paid to Clearwire or that was the adjustment?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: That was the amount for the first quarter.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay. And does that reflect the new agreement or not?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Say that one more time, Simon?
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Is that under the old accounting, or does that reflect the new wholesale agreement?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: It's the – go ahead.
<A - Yijing Brentano>: Simon, so the $28 million, part of it is related to the settlement of the 2010 rate, and part of it
is related to the rights that we're getting for re-wholesaling, as well as the CNS, ability to provide CNS services. So that
is a book that will be amortized but the other one is basically a cost of service increase.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of David Barden (Bank of America Merrill Lynch).
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hi, guys. Sorry. Thanks for taking the question. First question would be just following up on
that point on the Clearwire side, is that the reason why year-over-year, Joe, we're seeing this, you know, ramp
downward potentially from a 1Q EBITDA rate that's like run rating at $6 billion but really targeting before division
expenses a full-year number that closer to five, six. Is that really the big delta in the numbers year-over-year?
And the second question I guess relates to just kind of the incremental pricing competition that we're seeing from
T-Mobile, obviously you guys and T-Mobile seemed to have swapped position in the market it T-Mobile taking a page
out of the Sprint play book trying to boost demand through attracting the lower priced customers. And I was wondering
if there's been any kind of sense that the net positive porting rates that you've been seeing against everybody might be
drifting more towards parity as a result of some of the competitive activities that have been going on. Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: So I'll take the first one for you. So remember, Dave, you've got the $150 million impact
on the wireline pressure. You've got subsidies. You've got a little bit of impact on the Clearwire. So you've got a
number of moving parts that are affecting the numbers, and that's why we're being cautious as we look out for the
remainder of the year.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Yeah. I think it's too early to tell, David, whether there's going to be any change in the kind of
competitive or price dynamic in the market or the positions that the various carriers have played. As I mentioned on the
call, kind of what we did in the first quarter because we really are focused on the investments that the company is going
to need to make going forward and things like Network Vision to truly take you have to spend some money to get your

cost structure really competitive and to provide great service. We have done some things in Q1 in the market like the
$10 data add-on fee or premium data charge that we mentioned beginning April 1st, so in the second quarter. Our
loyalty programs aren't quite as rich as they were in the past.
And of course with Verizon's launch of the iPhone, in essence what we saw was AT&T getting more aggressive in
pricing, T-Mobile particularly on the device side becoming more aggressive from a price perspective as well, kind of
all, if you will, moving not only in the first quarter but moving into the second quarter. So we'll just – we're not
expecting there to be a significant change, if you will, beyond what we've seen so far in terms of the brand position and
pricing position in the industry. I don't know if I'm answering your question with respect to the T-Mobile adequately.
Did I – is there something else?
<Q - David W. Barden>: No. That's helpful, Dan. I think that was a question just about the interest towards the
changes quarter over quarter on kind of the porting pressures and changes, and I think you kind of highlighted a lot of
the changes that are taking place. If I could just do a quick follow-up back on, Dan, your comments on the AT&T,
T-Mobile merger. One of the things that's been so interesting about the deal is that AT&T has really put together this
very kind of compelling sales pitch about union jobs and coverage for rural markets and spectrum utilization efficiency
and all these kind of hot button issues that the politicians are being invited to grab onto as reasons to support the deal.
You've kind of highlighted innovation or the lack thereof potentially as being the issue that is the reason not to approve
the deal. Do you guys have kind of a deeper more quantitative pitch that you're really kind of using as your argument
why this deal shouldn't be approved?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Absolutely we do and we're not going to share it on the call. Yeah, it's very hard to find
actually industries that are as concentrated, healthy industries that have that amount of concentration on the top line and
the bottom line that would be created, roughly 78% of the postpaid customers in total industry revenues and roughly
88% of the industry even in the hands of two. And there are of course many more quantitative elements of that analysis,
and I'll leave that to the economists.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And your next question is from the line of Michael McCormack (Nomura Equity Research).
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thinks. And Joe, good to have you back. Thinking about gross adds guys, just
trajectory, obviously there's some seasonality built into that in Q1, but maybe you could sort of identify the puts and
takes. You know, you had the iPhone launch obviously at Verizon, AT&T probably getting a bit more aggressive on
retention. But just looking at your own internal stuff did you see the price increase to have any negative impact on the
gross add share? And then secondly, Dan, maybe just sort of thinking about the hosting spectrum more holistically and
thinking about sort of introducing another competitor to the marketplace, is that something that you want to do? And
where do you see share coming to that competitor and how do you stop cannibalization of your existing base? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, on the first question, yeah, there's no question that, you know, when we make a price
move, there's going to be some impact. And we did feel some impact. But that was not unanticipated with respect to
both gross adds and, quite frankly, from a churn perspective. And I think the improvement we made in churn which is a
very unusual improvement in sequential churn when you go, when you basically buck seasonality going from Q4 to
Q1, shows just how strong the rest of our value proposition and customer service levels are that in the context of a price
increase, when the industry is going in the other direction, to have the net add performance that we did. But to answer
your question, yes. There was an impact on both gross adds and churn as a result of that, but I think we mitigated those
fairly significantly.
With respect to the other, I just don't want to speculate on the, if you will, the theoreticals, of any particular spectrum
hosting arrangement in terms of how we would look at it, but I answered the question a little bit earlier, and that is, we
would take a very holistic view of the economic issues, the strategic issues and what have you before deciding whether

or not we would enter into any spectrum hosting agreement.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Dan, just a quick follow up on the first part. Did you guys get any, I mean, I'm a customer
of yours and I've had my price increased by $20 or $30 a month, and I will continue to be a customer, but have you
heard any negative feedback from the price increase? Because it just seems like pricing power in this market is pretty
tough to come by.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, yes. First of all, existing customers, they are unaffected unless they want to upgrade to a
new device, but even after the $10 charge, our pricing is very, very competitive. We still, we believed we could do that
and still remain the most competitive player for customers that are heavy data users. You know, we're the only one that
offer true unlimited. So if you take Any Mobile, Anytime with unlimited text and unlimited data, just the absolute price
level, we still have a very competitive price.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Yijing Brentano>: Carmen, we have time for one last question.
Operator
And your final question will come from the line of Jonathan Chaplin (Credit Suisse).
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks. Two quick questions for Joe, if I may, and this may be a little unfair given that
you've only been there 30 days, Joe. But if you look at the cost structure at Sprint, have you been able to identify a
bucket of costs that you think you can take out over the course of the next year or two? We had estimated that there's
sort of addressable costs of potentially $600 to $800 million sometime ago, and I'm just wondering what you think of
that estimate? And then also just to get a sense of where things stand on free cash flow. I think the, what's happened is,
we just shifted about $400 million of interest expense into CapEx so the change should be neutral to free cash flow. Is
that correct, and are we still on track for about $2 billion of free cash flow a year, give or take? Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Well, so far, on your last question, remember, you've got to take into account the roll out
of Network Vision, because the capital and operating intensity of that project will clearly have an impact on cash. In
regards to your capitalized interest question, you are exactly right. It is totally neutral. In regards to identifying costs
and continue stuff, remember, Network Vision is the number one thing going on that's going to help increase
profitability on an operating basis, but one thing I've been, probably, in my first 30 days here, the most impressed with
is the discipline as an ongoing effort by the management team that we're constantly looking at ways to take cost out. So
it's something that's already going on, and for me to be able to come in and be part of the management team and team
up with everyone to continue to drive ways to take costs out of the model, I think is something that will be benefiting us
in the future. But I need a little more time before I put any estimates on it.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: So, Joe, is it fair to say that excluding Network Vision, excluding the costs and CapEx
associated with Network Vision where it's sort of around or at least $2 billion in free cash flow a year?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: I don't know that I can give you that exact number right now. But that doesn't seem too
correct to me. But I'm brand new, so you've got to give me a little chance.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Got it. Thank you.
