Robert H. Benmosche
Thanks, Liz, and good morning to everybody. And we have a lot to cover, so I want to be pretty brief, and then I'll turn
it over to David.
The key for this quarter though, and I do want to comment and stress it, is that we completed the last hurdle for this
company for the conditions of closing for our restructuring. And so by issuing 100 million shares and raising that
equity capital, it allowed the Treasury to terminate the Series G Preferred, and so therefore, in my mind, AIG's crisis is
over. We no longer have any direct obligation that we have to be concerned about vis-à-vis the government. Whatever
is owed to the government for what they gave us in the beginning is all covered by collateralized partnerships or the
common shares that we issued to them back in January.
So today, we are independent of government support, which is very important for our employees and our clients as we
go forward. There's clarity; AIG is here. We're an investment-grade company. And if you look at our results for the
quarter, our top line is strong; our retention of clients is strong; our retention of people is strong. And so all of the
fundamentals of running this company are moving in the right direction.
You can see in Chartis, for example, that the combined is now 97 7 for this quarter, working its way down and you
know that's a huge book of business, so it takes time to do that. You also will see in SunAmerica the strong top line in
terms of those products that they sell. That's a good story, as they were back in all of the distribution systems.
UGC has a good control over its Mortgage business. In fact, they're now leading in market share in terms of that
business and have a very strong performance in terms of losses relative to their competitors. That's going well. And of
course, as you saw in ILFC, we've been able to deal with our legacy aircraft with the announcement of this acquisition
from AeroTurbine, so that will give us more options in the late cycle of the life of those airplanes which we did not
have before.
So when you look overall, we're in good shape. I also should mention that Nan Shan looks like it will close. That will
finally get done. That's another $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion we'll be able to bring in-house and deal with paying down the
SPV with the U.S. Treasury. So that's another good sign.
So overall, we're in great shape. We can look forward and focus on operating results, which we have over the last four
or five quarters in particular. You can see it in our performance. And I'll have David now take you through the details
of that so you can reconcile what we reported and some of the nuances in those numbers. David?
David L. Herzog
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Let's turn to Slide 7 for the earnings highlights.
Second quarter net income was $1.8 billion, up from a loss of $2.7 billion a year ago. Importantly, our after-tax
operating income attributable to AIG, which is our principle non-GAAP measure, was $1.3 billion versus $800 million
a year ago. On a per share basis, after-tax operating income was $0.69 for the quarter versus $1.18 a year ago. Book
value per share was $49.18, up 2% sequentially. Adjusted ROE was 6.3 for the quarter, 8.3 year-to-date.
Let's turn to Slide 8. Chartis reported pre-tax operating income of $789 million, down $166 million from a year ago due
to an extraordinary level of natural catastrophe losses. Cat losses in the second quarter this year were $539 million,
largely from U.S. tornados and storms, versus $300 million a year ago.
SunAmerica posted $743 million in operating income in the second quarter, down $115 million from a year ago. The
SunAmerica results included $176 million decrease in the value of our Maiden Lane II investment due mainly to spread
widening on the underlying non-agency RMBS securities. We also increased our reserve for IBNR by $100.6 million
as a result of enhancing our death claim practices.
ILFC operating income was $86 million for the quarter compared to $182 million a year ago. ILFC had $60 million of
interest and other costs associated with their debt issuance and the subsequent tender offer for bonds and took an

impairment charge of about $42 million on a handful of aircraft that we're either going to sell or put into part-out.
As you might have read, again as Bob mentioned, we announced the acquisition of AeroTurbine, a part-out business,
which will provide new opportunities and options for us to manage the older aircraft in our fleet.
Turning to United Guaranty, our mortgage guaranty business, reported $13 million of operating income versus income
of $226 million a year ago. Last year's income benefited from $232 million of favorable prior-year development while
this quarter included $25 million of unfavorable prior-year loss development.
To put this in context, United Guaranty has roughly $3 billion in net loss reserves. In addition, the second quarter
included a $40-odd million favorable settlement with a former underwriting customer. Newly reported delinquent loans
continued to decline, yet overturns for previously declined or rescinded claims increased. Domestic first lien reserves
per delinquency remained steady at about 29,000 per delinquency.
Turning to our Other reporting unit, this reported a loss of $984 million in the quarter versus $135 million a year ago,
due largely to the mark-to-model loss of $667 million on our Maiden Lane III investment and to a lesser extent our
capital markets wind down portfolio. As you know, Maiden Lane III is a special purpose vehicle that holds multi-sector
CDOs purchased in the fall of 2008 in which we own a subordinated tranche plus a 1/3 residual interest.
As of June 30, the value of our share of Maiden Lane III was $6.4 billion, down 10% sequentially, but importantly up
28% from our initial investment. We essentially gave back the $744 million gain in the first quarter. Prior to the second
quarter, we reported eight consecutive quarters of gains.
In the second quarter, credit spread widening and the corresponding impact on fair value model discount rate
assumptions were the key drivers in the Maiden Lane III values. Cash flows within the underlying CDOs remain steady
and we still anticipate receiving pay-outs beginning in 2014. The Maiden Lane III cash flows to date have paid down
$12 billion to the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, or about half of their senior loan.
Asset management, which is included in Other, had income of $92 million for the quarter, down from $303 million a
year ago, due largely to the tightening of credit spreads in the asset book from a year ago. Capital markets had a loss of
roughly $160 million due to the unrealized mark-to-market loss on the super senior credit derivative portfolio versus a
gain last quarter. That loss was driven by a decline in values of the multi-sector CDS book. The wind down, again, it
continues to progress very significantly.
This book had seven quarters of favorable marks before the second quarter and our view of intrinsic value hasn't
changed. Remaining in the multi-sector book is about $6 billion of notional for which we hold liabilities of roughly
$3.2 billion, most of which we have already posted collateral against. Independent views support our belief that the
actual settlements under these contracts will be less than the GAAP liability in the collateral postings we have, thus
giving rise to the potential intrinsic gains we believe are worth the GAAP P&L volatility that we are required to report.
As previously disclosed, the second quarter marked the end of the active wind down of AIG FP. The remaining
derivative portfolio of the capital markets are predominantly non-complex market derivatives entered into to manage
the risks of AIG and its affiliates or our hedges on those positions.
At the end of the second quarter, approximately $29 billion of notional remains in the CDS portfolio of which $22
billion does not require active trading management. The remaining $8 billion CDS, which is being actively managed,
has over $1 billion of upside, we believe, against a modest contingent liquidity need going forward.
Also during the second quarter, AIG FP agreed to terminate two super senior regulatory capital transactions with a
combined net notional of over $24 billion, that notional as of March 31, and those have had previously been subject to
possible additional collateral postings. Finally, our remaining investment in AIA appreciated by about $1.5 billion in
the quarter.
Turning to Slide 9, which shows the after-tax income reconciliation, reconciling items have declined meaningfully as
most of the restructuring activities are behind us. Also we adjust for taxes since we apply a pro forma tax rate to our
operating earnings. The taxes are added back here to the GAAP net income to get to GAAP net income since we aren't

paying much tax and we currently have a full valuation allowance.
Jumping to Slide 11, our capital structure. This reflects the January 2011 recapitalization and reduced leverage. Our
leverage is currently in the low end of the range of our long-term target and we still assume a 20% to 25% debt to total
capital as part of aspirational goals.
Turning to Slide 13, Chartis. Overall, I would note that Chartis reorganization into Global, Commercial and Consumer
business is beginning to develop some positive momentum. Net premiums written, excluding Fuji and the impact of
foreign exchange, increased about 2.4%. Prior year development was insignificant for the quarter after considering
related loss-sensitive premiums.
The four business lines with the largest reserve strengthening at year-end 2010 saw little activity in the quarter. The
combined ratio on an accent year basis, excluding cats, was 97.7%. The expense ratio remained essentially flat. We are
intensely focused on reducing general operating expenses in a thoughtful and deliberate way, but we will continue to
make strategic investments in projects that better position Chartis for the future.
Turning to Slide 14, net premiums written benefited, as I said a minute ago, from our Fuji acquisition, but otherwise
were around 2.4% up for the quarter. Pricing is trending positively overall, in particular in the U.S. market. We're
experiencing low single-digit increases on average led by Commercial Property and Worker's Compensation lines.
Customer retention Bob mentioned is also strong.
Turning to Slide 15, Chartis Investments. Net investment income for Chartis was $1.14 billion in this quarter, up 2.6%
from a year ago. The primary driver of the increase in improved interest and dividends and the effects of the
consolidation of Fuji. Chartis continued to reduce its muni bond position, which was 28% of the Chartis investment,
invested assets in the quarter down from 31% last quarter.
On Slide 17, turning to SunAmerica Financial Group. SunAmerica's operating income was $743 million in the quarter,
down $115 million from a year ago. As you can see, SunAmerica's operating income has been relatively stable for the
last five quarters. This quarter's volatility relates to market volatility for RMBS, and in particular, and its effects on the
value of Maiden Lane II, which is included in the SunAmerica Group. We also increased our reserve for IBNR by
roughly $100.6 million, as I mentioned earlier. Our business remains diverse, strong, good momentum in sales and
deposits, customer retention and importantly, net flows.
Turning to Slide 18, premiums, deposits and other considerations. Life insurance CTTE sales increased 29%
sequentially, largely driven by retail sales. Western National, while continuing to maintain its pricing discipline, again,
achieved sales of over $2 billion in the quarter due largely to certain bank partners negotiating lower commissions and
exchange for higher crediting rates for our customers. All in, total net flows for retirement services of $726 million
were positive for the second consecutive quarter.
Turning to Slide 19 for SunAmerica investments, net investment income was $2.46 billion, down $167 million from a
year ago. As I mentioned, Maiden Lane II negatively affected this quarter by $176 million versus a positive $120
million a year ago. Partnership income was strong again this quarter due to performance of our private equity and
hedge fund investments, which are reported on a one-quarter and one-month lag, respectively. Excluding Maiden Lane
II, investment income increased by 5% on increased interest and dividends and partnership income. Most importantly,
our base yields increased sequentially as we redeploy cash; more on that in a minute from Bill Dooley.
Turning to SunAmerica spreads on Page 20, reported spreads declined despite the redeployment of cash. Declines and
other enhancements, which is mainly Maiden Lane II, more than offset the growth in interest and dividends. Looking
ahead as we continue to take capital gains to realize the economic value of our substantial capital loss carry-forward
deferred tax asset, reported spreads could be pressure. We're choosing economics over reported GAAP measure.
Now a few words on income taxes on Page 22 and 23. As more fully described in our second quarter 10-Q, we apply a
framework for evaluating the need for evaluation allowances. Among other factors, AIG must emerge from its recent
cumulative loss position, demonstrate a level of sustainable profitability. AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group has
reported taxable income over the first half of 2011 and is currently projecting taxable income for the full year of 2011.

Page 5 of 14
In addition, the group expects to emerge from the cumulative loss in recent years in the second half of 2011.
If these factors were met, the valuation allowance for the net operating loss, the non-life capital loss carry-forward and
the foreign tax credits could be released during the fourth quarter. Realization of the life capital loss carry-forwards
remains more challenging and that portion of the valuation allowance will be released as the carry-forwards are
realized.
We still expect an effective tax rate of roughly 25% to 30% for the rest of the year on our operating income driven by
our substantial investment in tax-free munis. Other discreet items in any given quarter will impact the rate as well. This
quarter, among other things, we've settle disputes previously reserved for and the effect was favorable on the quarter.
And, finally, a word on our outlook. Consistent with the next steps of our company and our increasing focus on
long-term operating results, we outlined a number of long-term aspirational goals in our first quarter 10-Q, which we
affirm again this quarter. We expect to continue to execute on the operating and capital management actions to achieve
these goals.
At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Bill for a few comments on the cash redeployment. Bill?
William N. Dooley
Thank you, David. As we entered 2011, we had high investable cash balances in the insurance companies. And over the
course of the first half of the year, we invested those cash proceeds in various asset classes to give to various durations
necessary for the insurance companies. So in the first half of the year, we invested just under $50 billion and the
average yield across the board on those investments were roughly between 4.5% to 6%. So when we entered the third
quarter, we were fully invested with that – with all of the cash that was available at the beginning of the year.
Robert H. Benmosche
Okay.
Elizabeth A. Werner
Okay, operator, at this time, we'd like to turn the conference call over to Q&A. We'd like to try and take one question,
one follow-up from all of the analysts. And then hopefully, we'll have time to do more and they can get into queue.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Good morning, everyone. My question, and I'll give them up front and they're not related but
they're similar. I'm trying to understand the $100 million reserve charge in SunAmerica for incurred, but not reported
debt. And, two, it seems for two quarters in a row we've taken charges on a revision and outlook on cash flows for life
settlement contracts. Given about 6,000 contracts, it seems like a pretty significant charge over two quarters. I want to
talk about whether that will moderate and what your outlook is there.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: We'll have Jay just briefly give you an update on what the process changes were, and
then we'll have Peter talk about the life settlements. Jay?
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: Good morning, Josh, it's Jay Wintrob. The increase of $100.6 million in the IBNR was in
response to industry-wide regulatory inquiries which we were in receipt of regarding our life insurance claims

settlement practices and compliance with the unclaimed property laws. Our practices in that area are currently and have
been completely consistent with all the applicable legal requirements and all of the historical industry standards.
Having said that, we use this as an opportunity to enhance our practices and we voluntarily initiated a review using, for
example, the Social Security Administration's death master file. And as a result of that review, we chose to post the
IBNR of $100.6 million. So that's the background on that.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Is it most certainly non-recurring in nature?
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: Right now, most certainly, this is now part of our claims practices going forward. We will
continue to use this and other information as it develops. And again, the inquiry was industry-wide, not specific
towards American General or SunAmerica Financial Group.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: But the answer to the question is I believe that the process change that Jay talked about,
and it's more about a process change. There's a question about what practices are, but we've looked at our practices and
said we think we should do it a different way. On the basis of what we've changed our practice to be, the team believes
that they've got this worked out in this IBNR and this puts the problem behind us. And on a go-forward basis, it will be
part of normal operating procedures. So you would see that it's just part of our numbers. So I think this closes it out,
from what we can see right now. Let me turn it over to Peter.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: On the life settlements impairment charge, I'd like to just put it in the context of the overall
life settlements portfolio, which totals a carrying value of $4 billion. We have instituted increased scrutiny of the
longevity assumptions with updated medical information on individual lives. This is a book which has fairly large
insured values per life. And as a result of those updated actuarial assumptions which were validated by third-party
scrutiny in this quarter as well, we have added the impairment charge. We would not anticipate future charges,
anything of that scale.
But on the other hand, as I said, it's fairly lumpy in terms of individual lives. But when we take an impairment, it's an
asymmetrical charge wherein any single contract is impaired, but you don't take positive news when it comes in. So
there's an asymmetrical aspect of it. When we take an impairment, we basically look at current yields on similar
contracts to mark down the position.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: In the Q, you described it as an enhanced process change; you had $60 million of charges in
1Q and here $180 million here. Is the process change fully in effect so that we don't expect this to recur as sort of a
change in the outlook? Or just be mark-to-markets from here on out?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: It's not mark-to-market; it's effectively cost accounting. So you're basically looking for
impairments of individual lives, and so if you've got evidence that your assumption there is too aggressive then you
mark that to market, but you don't mark up the other bit, lives where you have information that suggests that you have
it valued too low. So the enhanced process is just increased scrutiny on this book with additional third-party scrutiny to
validate our own assumptions. That's what's changed and I would not expect charges of this magnitude going forward;
but on the other hand, I would not expect it to be zero either. There will be some volatility and it's asymmetrical
because the positive news comes in the form of a higher expected yield over the approximately 10-year duration of
these contracts.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: But we also have taken a – completed a very deep, strategic review of what we're doing
here. We're going to think about how we modify it, but this is not an area that we're going to be emphasizing going
forward. We're just thinking about how to deal with it. So over time, we're studying this as an asset class and we don't
think it's something we're going to be growing.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Okay. Thank you for the color.

<Q - Donna L. Halverstadt>: Good morning. I had a question about a business that's a – it's a small slice of your
business mix pie, but I'm just not clear how you think about it. And I wanted to understand philosophically or
strategically how you're viewing United Guaranty, whether it's core or non-core or just merely a placeholder until some
future point in time when we know if there's going to be a more robust future demand function for private MI. And as a
follow-up to that, the pace of flux in the MI industry is picking up rapidly, and I was curious whether or not you'd be
interested in participating in any restructuring of the current industry make up?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: We'd see UGC has really done a dramatic turnaround of that business. I feel we have
employed excellent technology now behind the claims process and so they've gotten themselves very much under
control for the legacy book. They've done a wonderful job of reinventing how they underwrite mortgages, so they have
a model now that works very effectively on new business. And the experience that we've been seeing over the last,
started in '09, so you'd look at '09, '10 and '11 so far, that experience is exceptional relative to our history as well as the
industry. So we are pricing for the right risks and we're getting the risk that make sense for us as a company and we're
not competitive in those risks, which we obviously are concerned about.
Having said that, our market share has grown dramatically and with that performance, we don't see any need to help
anyone else out. And so for now, the business we operate that, as well as ILFC, is do no harm to the core franchises of
the company. But unlike ILFC, we feel that UGC does provide us a tremendous insight into a major aspect of our
investment, which is residential mortgages and so on. We also believe that as the government begins to pull back in
some way out of the mortgage guarantee business, there may be a better market for us, and here, this may grow. And so
for now, it's running very well and it's enhancing whatever we do here, not only from a small amount of earnings, but
also by the intelligence it provides us of what's going on in the economy. So for now, we see it as a keep.
<Q - Donna L. Halverstadt>: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yeah. I've got one question and Ed Spehar is going to have a question as well on the Life side.
My question on the Property-Casualty side, I'm wondering if you could talk about some of the claims trends you're
seeing? Obviously, with the review last year, there was some negative surprises in claims trends in various businesses.
As you've been through now 2011, I'm wondering if you can update us on the claims trends, particularly in places like
excess Casualty and excess comp.
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Hey, Jay, it's Rob Schimek speaking. I think you can see from our quarterly review of
our carried reserves that we did not experience any significant deviation from our expectation during the quarter with
respect to claims trends. That's one of the things we focus on each quarter. We have an expectation based off of our
carried reserves of what should happen during the quarter and we compare that to what actually did happen during the
quarter. I think we, generally speaking right now, it's a class of business by class of business distinction here, but
generally speaking, we're seeing rate change in line with lost cost trends in particular, for example, with respect to
workers' compensation where you're seeing rate increases. But it is line of business by line of business specific. I think
the overall point is that actual results are trending in line with our expectations.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: The other is, it's important to stress that they've enhanced their process as well. I mean
what you're seeing us do is enhancing a lot of process because we really want to tighten this place up and really
improve the quality of our performance. And about $10 billion of our reserves this quarter were looked by third-party
actuaries, so we're going through it quarter-by-quarter. And they validated that our reserves are, if anything, just
slightly above what they saw as essential estimates. So I think it's $10 billion, but as go through it, we're seeing

<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah sure. As we said earlier, we've got about 7.5 billion of DTA, net DTA related to the Life
capital loss carry-forward. And as we look at the Life portfolio, it has about, oh I think about $8 billion or so of gross
gains. And so that – and then if you tax back the gains, that sort of gives you a sense of how to think about the real
opportunity right now because that's the inventory of gains that we have. And then the question is how do we go about
achieving that. In part, we are realizing capital gains in the life companies themselves, actually selling the securities.
And then there are other strategies involved where we have other opportunities to realize, at least for tax purposes, the
gains, and we are in a process of evaluating it.
My sense is, Ed, as we've said, maybe up to 25% of that number, of the $7.5 billion, we would expect to get because
the expiry dates run between 2013 and '14. And so time is very different than on the NOLs, which run out until 2028.
So the fourth quarter evaluation, as I was commenting on, will be around the NOLs, which we expect to realize fully,
the foreign tax credits we expect to realize fully and the non-life capital loss carry-forward we expect to realize fully.
Hope that's helpful.
<Q - Edward A. Spehar>: So, David, as a follow – yeah, it's helpful. So if you expect it to maybe up to 25% of the
$7.5 billion, that would suggest about $3 billion of gains harvested in the portfolio, right?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Well, no. I think – think of it differently. If there's about 2.5 -again, $2 billion to $2.5 billion
of DTA and the DTA is effectively that's 35% of the actual gain. So you need gains of – if we were to realize all $8
billion worth of gains, take 35%
<Q - Edward A. Spehar>: No, I got it. I got it. All right, I had the math – I had the math backwards. I guess the
question though, if you had $6 billion of gains, wouldn't that be probably giving up maybe around $700 million of
annual investment income?
<A - David L. Herzog>: There's a tradeoff and that's why I'd say we're balancing economics here against a GAAP
reported number and a GAAP reported spread. And we're sensitive to that, but that's why there are other ways to realize
those gains other than just straight out harvesting.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Yeah, I think that's, Ed, I think what we're doing right now is we're assembling a, I
guess world-class team in my mind because there'd be – there may be someone maybe as good, but there'll be nobody
better that are quicker minds around how we begin to deal with this and how we can do things in a way such that we
trigger a taxable gain on what it is we have here. So sometimes, you don't actually have to sell it that you get caught
with a taxable gain. So there's all kinds of theories and strategies we're putting together and we're going to do
everything we can to maximize this number. However, we're also mindful that we don't want to do it to the extent that
would harm Jay's business. So we're being mindful of the NII there and that's a challenge. We've got a team to do it and
that's why David is going to be conservative come the fourth quarter as to what he thinks can be realized of this
[indiscernible] (34:03).
<Q - Edward A. Spehar>: Thanks. We vote for economics if you care. By the way, the jobs number was pretty good.
<A - David L. Herzog>: What was it?
<Q - Edward A. Spehar>: 154.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: They said I have to wait. My boss says it's...

Michael Miele of Goldman Sachs has our next question.
<Q - Michael R. Miele>: Thanks. Just a couple of questions here. Trying to reconcile the development. We've got a
98% ex-cat combined ratio at Chartis, 97.7% ex-cat in prior-year development. The development shows as being zero,

91 adverse and then 91 in return premiums. And then in the Q, it looks like about $100 million in additional adverse
development from the first quarter. So just trying to – that's Page 125 of the Q. Just trying to reconcile those if I could.
And one follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Well, hey, Mike. It's Rob Schimek. So let me just provide clarity here. So first of all, I
think you generally said this correct. So prior-year development for the second quarter is adverse, but we write
loss-sensitive business, and on the loss-sensitive business, we have accrued premiums. And so the net of those two
items in the second quarter are largely offset. The way that it works in the combined ratio itself, though, is that the
prior-year development affects the numerator, but the accrued premium or the loss-sensitive premium affects the
denominator. So it's not an exact zero-sum gain in the combined ratio itself. And then I think we talked about in the
first quarter one of the significant drivers on our development in Q1 was the fact that we had a settlement of a historical
issue associated with one particular line of business. It's disclosed, I think reasonably clearly, in the 10-Q, but it was
that item that really drove prior-year development all in the first quarter of 2011.
<Q - Michael R. Miele>: Okay. But so in the second quarter, you had – looks like you had about the adverse, so just
on that adverse versus the loss-sensitive, so is that the same business so you had adverse, and then in addition, you had
additional premiums related to that adverse development because it was business you had written on a loss-sensitive
basis? Or are they two separate items?
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: You said it exactly, Mike. So we have the adverse development on business that was
written years ago and the premium accrual is on that same business. You recall that you just remember the way this
actually worked is we do our analysis across the entire portfolio, maybe in excess of 1,000 different cohorts of data that
we're analyzing. So the adverse development is the sum of all of those ins and outs. But all of the accrued premiums on
the loss-sensitive business, 100% of it relates to business that's also being included in and it is the driver of the net
adverse development that we experienced for the quarter.
So the answer to your question is absolutely, positively, these are directly and specifically inter-related. So they're an
exact match between adverse development and the premium accrual on the loss-sensitive business. I'm just saying to
you, there's thousands of different ways that we slice this data, and so there are other pieces of increases in prior-year
development and other places where there's decreases in prior-year development. But the primary driver of why you
have net adverse development is related to those premiums that we also accrued on loss-sensitive business.
<Q - Michael R. Miele>: I'll follow-up after on that one. Just had just another math question. But if I could, I just
wanted to understand what happened again, Chartis U.S., is it consumer lines it sounded like from the Q you
discontinued a couple of programs, otherwise saw some growth there. Commercial lines, you had a big E&O policy; it
sounded like higher rates in comp, commercial, decline in specialty comp. Just trying to understand what got you to the
plus 4.6%? Is it a combination of those items? Or is it underlying that got you there? And then the expense ratio, there
was about a 200 basis point decline sequential. Just trying to understand how to think about those as well. Thank you
very much.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, the first thing is that as we have looked at all of our lines of business, all of our
individual relationships through the scrutiny of whether they meet our risk-adjusted profitability targets, certain
programs just didn't make the cut. And the particular consumer example you cite was one that, whatever way you look
at it, it just – it didn't make sense going forward, so we terminated that program. In terms of the overall trend, we saw
an increase in ratable exposure, which helps the general positive trend. Hopefully, the economy continues its recovery
and that trend doesn't reverse itself, but we're not holding our breath. And in terms of other favorable rate trends,
property is probably the most promising, especially property cat – especially outside of the U.S., but in the U.S. we're
also seeing a slight hardening.
<Q - Michael R. Miele>: And then the expense ratio?
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Well, I'm sorry, one other thing that I would mention for you there, Mike, is that in the
second quarter of last year, we did our first cat bond, and so the prior-year premium associated with commercial
property is reduced by the amount of premium that we ceded on that cat bond, which is approximately $100 million. So

we're higher in the 2011 quarter simply because we did not see the premium again on a new cat bond. So just wanted to
add that.
<Q - Michael R. Miele>: Very fair. Thank you. Real quick on the expense ratio, just if that's okay; about 200 basis
point decline. Just trying to understand, you're clearly making some changes and cutting some specialty comp lines. I
imagine there's still some outstanding claims on those. Just trying to get a handle on how the expense ratio goes down.
Is that where we think it's going to be? Or is that just kind of a dip here in the second quarter?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, let me start with an overall comment on the expense ratio and then I'll hand it over to
Rob. The expense ratio is not something we target. It's an outcome of things that we do target, which is improvement in
our costs, regardless of whether they appear in the expense ratio or the loss ratio. And I think that we're very conscious
of the importance of reducing our fixed costs and then focusing on unit costs associated with claims management. And
so as we do that, that has an effect on the expense ratio. Secondly, as our business mix shifts from high-severity,
low-frequency to a higher-frequency, low-severity businesses, then the expense element goes up, but the amount of
capital intensity goes down.
So as we factor in capital costs, that again is another important shift. So as we shift towards these lower risk consumer
lines, then we expect the expense ratio to go down and the acquisition costs are obviously higher as well in those lines.
So it's an outcome of our strategic shift towards lower-risk businesses with better repeatable earnings characteristics.
But we're very focused on expenses, however they're categorized. And so as far as the specific shift, maybe Rob, why
don't you explain that shift?
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Well, I'll just give you a couple more things to keep in mind, especially here in 2011 and
I think certainly for the first part of 2012. We embarked on a number of very important, strategic, fundamental
investments in our platform, including for example work we're doing on Solvency II in Europe and we're also
undergoing a very significant finance transformation effort inside of the Chartis finance organization to put us all onto
one single common financial platform around the world. Each of those items, among others, are investments that we
think are very important to the long-term [indiscernible] (43:13) sort of viability of our platform. And those will cause
our expenses to go up as we go across the next year or so.
However, you'll see us also continuing to demonstrate progress on the items that we have been targeting as an overall
reduction of GOE. One thing you will see from us is, as we now have a full year of Fuji consolidated into our
operations, Fuji carries a higher expense ratio and you should expect that that will also have an impact on us as we
move forward in the rest of the year. We do a lot of work on a quarterly basis to make sure that we've got an
appropriate evaluation of bad debt, whether it's on premiums or whether it's just on any receivables that we have on the
books. And so one of the things that benefited us in the current quarter was a reduction in bad debt expense also. And
that will be lumpy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, really just based off of the facts and circumstances of that analysis.
<Q - Michael R. Miele>: That was very helpful, Rob and Peter. Thank you very much.

We'll hear next from JP Morgan's Jimmy Bhullar.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar CFA>: Hi and good morning. I had a question on capital flexibility. Obviously you had raise
equity earlier this year to replace the Series E preferred and maybe you have to hold that as a question. But you sold
Nan Shan since though – what do you believe your current excess capital position is on the balance sheet? Also how
much free cash flow you expect to generate this year, given the high cat losses? And then any comments on potential
uses of this capital?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: The one time – I'm going to turn it over to David, but I want to stress that raising the
100 million, selling the 100 million shares was a condition of closing to demonstrate we could. Remember, for us to be
allowed to be where we are today, completely independent of government support, that we had to prove we can get
unsecured debt all the way through de-risking FP and our credit ratings and also raising equity capital. So the G was put

in as a stock gap until we demonstrated that, so that's really about bringing that – bringing us to that level at this point
in time.
And we've also told you that we want to over-solve the liquidity during this period of time so that the rating agencies
can absorb where we are and see how we operate throughout 2011. So that's what we did. And again, keep in mind that
we had to demonstrate our strength having given up $30 billion of committed government support plus the implied
support above that. So that was all part of that condition of closing and maintaining strong investment-grade ratings on
a standalone basis. Having said that, David can now talk about what we're going to do with the proceeds.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah, Jimmy, good morning. The Nan Shan proceeds will be used to repay or pay down the
AIA SPV balance. So there's about $11.5 billion of obligation that the SPV has to the U.S. Treasury. The Nan Shan
proceeds of nearly $2.2 billion will be used to reduce that balance, so again, which is a great outcome for all the
stakeholders. So that's where those proceeds are going to go. I would point you to our 10-Q disclosure, Page 142. We
talk about the capital liquidity availability at the holding company, the nearly $13.1 billion. As we discussed earlier, it's
not so much about excess capital today as much as it is about the generation of distributable, available capital as we
continue to execute on our business. And again, we reaffirm our aspirational goals which we set forth in the first
quarter Q that the $25 billion to $30 billion of capital management activities over the course of the next several years
we believe are still very achievable, particularly in light of the continued progress that we're making.
So again, we'll continue to try to optimize the capital structure of the company. We're building sufficient liquidity at the
holding company. Again, the final determination of whether or not we are designated a SIFI will ultimately be
determined sometime later this year we expect. And so again, all of those will play into when and how much and to
what degree we commence our capital management. But at this time, it's about building the pool of available capital.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: And by the way, we have done a lot of sensitivity testing around SIFI and we're very
confident that SIFI will not cause us to go up, but we are well above wherever even SIFI is at so that we don't see it
getting in the way of our flexibility and our thoughts at this stage of the game from what we've studied.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar CFA>: Okay. And then any comments on free cash flow that you expect to generate this year?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Well, we have, as we laid out as part of our earlier equity markets discussions, capital
dividend capacity at our operating companies and those expectations have not changed. And so we will continue to
expect to receive dividends from our operating companies to bolster the $13.1 billion we have.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar CFA>: And lastly, on AIA, you have restrictions on selling that; I think you can sell some of
that in October – beginning in October. But how do you view that asset? And obviously, it gives you exposure to the
international markets to the extent you continue to own it. But do you think you can hold onto it? Or is it more going to
be opportunistic?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I think we're going to study it, and when we get to October, we'll know what the
markets are. We'll know where we are. As we talk about the SPV that it's collateralizing, as David just said, we're $11.3
billion. We've got about $2.6 billion of cash that's sitting there in support of contingencies for MetLife because of the
sale of the MetLife stock and the deal with Alico. And so when you take that out, we're down to about $6.5 billion after
Nan Shan comes in. And that's collateralized, for example, by ILFC as well as well as AIA, and so there's a huge
amount of money. We're going to be taking a look at strategically where we are, what we need to do, what makes the
most sense come October, and then a team will do that which we believe will give us the best shareholder value for the
company going forward. It's all about how to create shareholder values moving into the fourth quarter as quickly as we
possibly can.

<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Hey, good morning. Going back to the SunAmerica question for Jay. So $8.4 billion in
cash and short-term investments were deployed during the quarter. You go from a base yield of 5% up to 5.36%, but
you also harvested I think I read $3.4 billion of gains. So now we're at 5.36%. If nothing were done going forward in
terms of harvesting that $8 billion of gains that you have left, where does the base yield go? And the other part of it is,
if you're willing to discuss how much of that gain you want to harvest, what kind of impact would it have negatively?
<A - William N. Dooley>: This is Bill Dooley. Let me just make a comment on with the base yield increases on future
cash flows. A lot has to determine on, obviously, where the market goes in that period of time. So that's a harder
question to answer. But when we're taking the gains on the SunAmerica portfolio, we're doing it in a deliberate way so
we can kind of close the gap between the give up and what we're getting. The other thing we don't want to do is to
create another large cash balance at the Life company level. So I'm looking for offsetting assets that are basically the
same type of assets, even though there's going to be a yield difference because of the movement of the marketplace. So
everything's being done in a very deliberate way...
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: So you want to minimize the impact and it won't be too...
<A - William N. Dooley>: We're trying to minimize the impact, but at the same time, pick up the gains.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Got it. Got it. So then with the $8.4 billion that you deployed, shouldn't that yield of
5.36% go up next quarter barring any – taking gains on the other stuff?
<A - William N. Dooley>: Well, as the sales take place, the gains are coming in. And – but I'm re-deploying those
funds at lower yield levels just because of the movement in the marketplace.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Right.
<A - William N. Dooley>: But economically, as David was saying, for the consolidated entity, we're much better off
by taking those gains and having a smaller yield on the underlying assets in the insurance company.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah, Andrew, it's David. Just to make sure we've got our facts right, I think we've taken
about $350 million of gains thus far this year in that zip code. Not 3.5 billion.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: I'm sorry, that was what you sold for – you sold 3.5 billion to get that amount of gain,
right?
<A - David L. Herzog>: That's fine; good, good. Just want to make sure you understand where...
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Yeah, no I do. I do.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Thank you.
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: If I could just add to what Bill and David said. A couple things, Andrew. One is some of
the cash was redeployed rather late in the quarter, so I don't think we've seen the full impact of that yet in the base rate.
All subject, as Bill mentioned, is to reinvesting new cash flow in this quarter. But again, that's one point. The other
thing is that the, in terms of being deliberate, we are still in a negative IMR position in our Life company. So 100% of
these gains are going also to increase our statutory capital at this point as opposed to increasing our IMR reserve. So
that's the kind of thing we're taking into account as we do this in a deliberate way.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Got it. So that's good, Jay. So there is some yield – so there is some interest income
pickup as we go into the third quarter. Nothing you could kind of give us a sense of to model for?
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: Yeah, I'm not comfortable with that, only because there's still the third quarter to go. But
we know that all of the activity in the second quarter is not reflected in the base yield.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Okay. And then just while I got you, the discipline around Western National in terms of
there was a big pickup in deposits. Maybe just give a little clarity on what was so disciplined there.

<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: Well, we continue to target approximately 12% to 12.5% after-tax internal rate of returns,
and we're getting our pricing. We're closely coordinated with our asset management group on the investment side and
Bill. We were back reinstated in all of the distribution that we were in prior to the fourth quarter of 2008. And I believe
we have going now the most we've ever had, I think 12 separate rate for compensation trade-off programs across all of
our different banks: large, medium and small. And that's been a big, big driver of the activity where banks are trading
off commission compensation in order to offer the customers moderately higher crediting rates, and that's a win-win for
everybody.
So we feel good about what's happening at Western and in our fixed annuity business. The absolute level of interest
rates historically has had an impact on that. Higher is somewhat better. On the other hand, we see our customers more
and more interested in guaranteed returns for some meaningful part of their portfolios. So the pricing is solid and the
sales activity has remained solid. And I think Western and everyone there is doing an excellent job with it.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: You know, the one thing, Andrew, the one thing to keep in mind, and for everybody to
keep in mind, is Western has a product chassis that is unique to the industry. So it's not – think it about as today, I think
they price maybe 230 different combinations and permutations of different capabilities so that they – here's how much
money we have and how do you want to slice and dice it. And as Jay just said, several very, very large banks have
decided to finally see what happens when you cut commissions and go ahead and see if we can get the volume to do
better. And we've seen huge volumes in these institutions that are very large.
And so this is a competitive advantage because of the way and the uniqueness of that front end, and you add to it a very
strong, low-cost operation that comes out of Amarillo, Texas, for now which is a very high-quality group. You put that
together and it gives them the opportunity to get this kind of price for this kind of volume. So it really is unique and it's
very hard for competitors to get to this overnight because you've got to build that model and then get people
comfortable in using that model. So it really is an incredible capability.

We'll move on to Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Good morning. First, Bob, I just had a follow-up on the comment about the treasury
SPV in terms of the $6.5 billion that would be left in potential assets or sources to repay that. You had cited AIA and
ILFC. Any thoughts on Maiden Lane III, your Maiden Lane III stake, $6.5 billion? Should we assume that that's not on
the table because it's I guess fully in control of the Fed? Or is there a chance that you can monetize that, say, within the
next couple of years? That's my first question.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: You guys got some extra money? Because we can talk. I don't know how anybody's
going to buy our interest. It's totally under the control of the Fed. All I can say is that the cash flows, remember, in the
two years or so, it's gone from $24 billion to $12 billion. It's doing about $350 million a month in cash flows, so the
cash flows are strong regardless of the pricing that's going on here. We're all trying to figure the pricing out better to
reflect the real value here. But there's no question Maiden Lane III has a tremendous amount of value for us down the
road. And so we would think if you do the numbers, that sometime during 2014, it depends on how strong they stay,
that our $6.5 billion to $7 billion that's sitting in there will start to flow in here. And so you just have to take that out of
the equation.
It's just something coming down the road, just like Maiden Lane II; we had hoped to take the volatility out of Jay's
earnings. That didn't succeed. But again, that's another one that has a lot of economic value over time that'll flow in. So
the only properties, and remember, those are collateralized, so in order to free up the collateral, you're going to have to
pay it down. And those are two major properties that are there supporting, and I think Maiden Lane III is there, but
that's just an extra safety valve down the road. But the cash coming in Treasury wants first priority on that cash because
