MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation second quarter 2011 earnings release conference call hosted by
Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the
web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other
recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox.
After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] During this conference call,
Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters
that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed
herein.
At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.
Ursula M. Burns
Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. This is a reminder of the strategy that we're
executing on to transform our business. At I said before, many people talk about transformation, and we're actually
doing it. Through these four priorities, we mark our progress and measure our results. First, capturing the sizable
opportunity from scaling our services business; you will see this quarter that we grew our services revenue by 6%, with
a very strong performance in both document outsourcing and business process outsourcing. Our pipeline grew 21%,
and we continue to benefit from revenue synergies through cross-selling with ACS.
Second, maintaining our leadership in document technology; we continue to hold the number-one revenue market share
position overall and in color, and we are launching new products that solidify our strong leadership. This quarter,
revenue and installed were impacted by the supply constraints stemming from the earthquake in Japan. We're on track

to reduce backlog while meeting new demand in the third quarter.
Third, continue to improve the efficiency of our business operations, running a lean and flexible annuity-based
business; this served us particularly well in Q2. Our disciplined approach to expense management offset the
incremental supply chain cost and helped drive strong bottom-line results.
By executing well on these first three priorities, we are delivering on the fourth: expanding earnings and returning cash
to shareholders. Adjusted earnings per share were up 13% in Q2, so we're well-positioned for a solid second half of
2011. We plan to invest more in acquisitions that further scale our services and expand our distribution. We will
resume our share repurchase program during the third quarter, and we're increasing our expectations for full-year
earnings.
As with most businesses, we face headwinds or tailwinds during any 90-day period. Our success is determined by how
agile we can be to effectively manage complex challenges while staying focused on our priorities. Considering the Q2
cost and revenue headwinds related to Japan, I am pleased with our progress and confident in the direction that we're
heading in for the rest of the year, and let's take a look at Q2 results.
Our performance in the quarter reflects progress in our services-led technology-driven business and our sharp focus on
operational improvement. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.27. As I mentioned, that's up 13% from a year ago. On a
GAAP basis, earnings were $0.22 per share. This includes $0.05 primarily from the amortization of intangibles.
Revenue was up 2%, aided by the strong euro. Technology revenue was flat, and service services revenue increased
6%.
As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, supply constraints resulting from the earthquake in Japan did increase our
costs and impact install activity and revenue in our technology business. I'll provide a more detailed update in a
moment, but can tell you that we're already seeing significant improvement and we expect to be back to normal
operations in the fourth quarter. Our effective expense management helped to offset the incremental costs incurred
from the supply chain challenges so we were able to maintain steady margins in the quarter. Operating margin of
10.4% was up 0.3%. Gross margin of 33.4% is within our range and reflects the result of more revenue coming from
services. We generated $347 million in operating cash flow during Q2.
We faced some unique challenges relative to cash usage during the first half of the year, including cash needs from
ramping new contract signings and incremental cash required to support the supply chain constraints. As a result, we
are lowering our full-year guidance for operating cash flow to $2 billion to $2.3 billion. Our second half of the year is
typically stronger for cash generation, so our plans stay the same for $1 billion in available cash to be used toward
modestly sized acquisitions and about $700 million in share repurchase. Considering our expectations for significant
year-over-year cash improvement in 2012, we remain confident in our guidance for next year of $2.6 billion to $2.9
billion in cash from operations. Our CFO, Luca Maestri, will provide more detail on cash flow and our financials in a
moment. Then Luca and I will both take your questions, so let's turn to Slide 5.
Before we go into more detail on the results, here is the status on the supply chain issue. The Q2 impact was expected,
and created a backlog for orders taken in the quarter, orders that we'll be filling during the balance of the year. We're
working very closely with our colleagues in Japan to accelerate production and ensure we're meeting our customers'
needs. That means alternate sourcing for components and materials, often at a higher cost, and it means more expensive
distribution methods, like air freight, to expedite shipping. We're pleased with Fuji Xerox's operational management
during this challenging time.
As you will see in the Q2 results, our equity income from FX was better than expected. It's difficult to project if this
will continue since FX is still working through the uncertainties in their business and in their geography. We continue
to expect that production levels will be back on track over the next couple of months and that we'll resume normal
supply chain operations later in Q3 and into Q4. We maintain a 24/7 focus on the management situation in Japan and
throughout our supply chain. I'm confident that the worst is behind us, so we can focus intently now on reducing
backlog and meeting new demand.

Let's turn to Slide 6 for a more detailed review of Q2 revenue. Here you'll see the relatively even revenue contributions
from our services and technology business. We expect the services percentage will continue to grow as we invest more
in broadening our outsourcing portfolio and expanding our offerings globally. This growth strategy results in more
long-term contracts that benefit our annuity stream, which is now 84% of total revenue.
Total revenue of $5.6 billion was up 2%, or down 1% in constant currency. Equipment sales, as I said, were largely
impacted by the supply constraints. With a series of recent product launches and a supply chain recovery, we expect
improved equipment sales in the second half of the year. As Luca will share with you, our new products are very well
received in the marketplace and fill a need for affordable and more productive color printing in offices and print shops.
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of key metrics in our technology business. The metrics on this slide will look very
familiar to you. We've reported on them for a while, reflecting our strategic focus on moving black and white pages to
color devices. You'll see strong progress this quarter, with color MIF growth of 15% and color page growth of 8%.
Digital page trends are the same on a quarter-over-quarter basis, no change, and continue to reflect declines in
transactional black and white pages. It's important to note that our MIF metrics exclude printers, excludes our business
in developing markets and products sold through Global Imaging Systems; and page counts include only estimates in
those three areas.
That said, as we execute on our strategy to expand indirect channels to increase our Global Imaging business and to
grow document outsourcing, we increasingly have less ability to accurately measure all the pages printed on Xerox
systems and a number of machines in the field, so going forward, you'll see us report less on MIF and pages. Instead,
we'll provide more context on install activity and revenue growth.
More important to our annuity stream is our growth in services. The multi-year contracts for our outsourcing business
deliver strong recurring revenue. In Q2, services revenue was up 6%, or 4% in constant currency. Our leadership in
managed print services contributed to 10% growth in our document outsourcing business, and the breadth of our
offerings in business process outsourcing resulted in 9% BPO growth. Strength in both of these areas offset a decline
this quarter in IT outsourcing. Luca will share more details in a moment.
I'm often asked if the pressure on government spending are impacting our business, especially in the BPO space. We
are exceptionally well positioned with federal, state, and local governments around the world. Revenue from our
government contracts often fluctuates based on usage patterns. For example, in Q2, growth in transportation services
helped offset the lower volumes from unemployment claims. This is another benefit of having a diverse portfolio in
BPO. It gives us flexibility to manage through the changing dynamics in government spending. So our government
business does go through cycles, but net-net, we review our stronghold in this space as a key asset of our business
today and going forward.
In the quarter, signings for Xerox's services totaled $3.5 billion, up more than 15% from last quarter and down 10% on
a trailing 12-month basis. This decline was due to the cyclical nature of contract signings and longer lead times for
large multi-year deals, some of which were completed this month. Our pipeline remained very strong, up 21%, and
helping to fuel our healthy annuity stream for the long term.
So, summing up the quarter, I'd characterize it as a good overall progress quarter, especially considering the
unprecedented supply chain challenges. We've effectively executed on all of our key priorities, to scaling our services
business through our expertise in management services and BPO, strengthening our leadership in document technology
through expanded distribution and innovation that accelerates the adoption of color, effectively managing our global
operations, and generating cash that we can return shareholder value through stock buyback and dividends.
With that, let me turn it over to Luca, and I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?
Luca Maestri
Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter in some respects, given the impact
from Japan, but eventually we were successful in offsetting the constrained revenues and delivered strong EPS. This is

encouraging as we look forward toward Q3, where we should see recovering technology and acceleration in services.
Revenue growth was 2% in Q2 at actual currency, with a three-point benefit from currency. Services drove the growth,
and was up 6%, while technology was flat. In the second half, we expect revenue to be within our 3% to 5% guidance
range.
Operating margin in the quarter was 10.4%, up 0.3% year-over-year and up over a point from Q1. We saw sequential
improvement also in gross margin; however, year-over-year, gross margin was impacted by the mix of business, by the
ramp of new service contracts, and incremental supply chain cost related to Japan. This impact was more than offset by
disciplined expense management. RD&E and SAG ratios improved significantly due to restructuring synergies and
improved bad debt trend. We remain on track for our full-year objectives of $270 million of restructuring savings and
over $120 million of cost synergies.
Equity income in the quarter was $34 million, which slightly exceeded our expectations and reflect the restructuring
benefit for Fuji Xerox more than offsetting the disruption from the tsunami. The $34 million includes $4 million in Fuji
Xerox restructuring costs which we're not adjusting out this year.
Adjusted EPS was $0.27, and grew 13% year-over-year. The only adjustments to reported EPS were the amortization
of in intangibles and the loss on early extinguishment of liability from the redemption of the trust-preferred securities
that we mentioned during the Q1 call. As a result, GAAP EPS was up 38% year-over-year.
Let us now move to the technology segment on Slide 9. Technology revenue, up %2.5 billion, was flat at actual
currency and down 4% at constant currency, due in large part to the impact of Japan on product availability. Segment
margin of 11.8% was up over 1 point year-on-year, and continues to reflect the benefit from restructuring and synergy
savings.
Entry install performance is weighted heavily towards developing markets and, as I indicated during the Q1 call, faced
a difficult compare in Q2 given the 56% install growth that we had during Q2 of 2010. The recent product launches
should drive improvement in product segment during the second half. Mid-range growth continued despite being the
product segment most impacted by the Japan shortages. This performance reflects our very competitive color portfolio,
which was further strengthened by the launch of our latest ColorQube family of products in Q2, and we expect this
favorable trend to continue as we start to address our backlog situation in Q3.
In high-end, we saw mixed performance. IGen4 had a very strong quarter, reflecting demand for new features. The 800
and 1000 color press also showed good growth, but not enough to offset declines in the entry production color space.
We have a product gap in this category which we anticipate will be helped by a series of product actions, the first of
which is the recent launch of the new 8080 product line. In summary, good progress on cost and expenses offsetting
impacts from Japan to drive operating profit growth of 10%.
Moving on to services, Slide 10, services revenue was up 6%, with BPO up 9% and document outsourcing up 10%.
ITO revenue was down 10%. BPO's 9% growth was driven by recent acquisitions, as well as human resources and
healthcare payer services, and by increasing customer care and transportation volumes. This growth more than offset
declines in government services – lower unemployment claims volume, as an example – and the timing of contract
run-off and ramp. BPO signings were at $1.8 billion, which is lower year-on-year but up over 40% sequentially. And
we have good prospects and high expectations for BPO signings in Q3, which have started on a strong note. ITO
revenue declined 10%, driven by lower third-party hardware and software sales and lower recording revenue, as we
have not yet seen the contract ramp from recent strong signings.
Document outsourcing had a very good quarter, with revenue up 10%, thanks to the ramp of the new signings and
improving page volumes. Signings of $1.4 billion were also strong, with both renewals and new business up
double-digits. Overall signings declined 10% on a trailing 12-month basis, but grew over 15% sequentially. The trailing
12-months calculation includes the 10-year $1.6 billion California Medicaid deal we signed in Q1 of 2010, as well as
the Texas Medicaid renewal that occurred in Q2 of 2010 for close to $1 billion. We continue to see strong growth in
our services pipeline, up 21% including synergies, and this is of course a positive indicator for future signings.

Segment margin of 12.1% was up 1.8 points sequentially but down 0.5 point year-on-year, reflecting impacts from
contract startup cost and lower volumes in some government transaction areas. In summary, overall solid performance
in services, with expectations for improvement both in signings and in ITO during Q3.
With that, I now move to the balance sheet slide. As we communicated during Q1 earnings, we called our 2027
trust-preferred securities in Q2, and we refinanced this amount via a very successful bond offering at a lower cost. The
securities carried an 8% coupon, and this action will reduce interest expense. Our Q2 ending debt balance increased to
$9.3 billion, but to be clear, our interest-bearing liabilities remain unchanged, as the trust-preferreds used to be
recorded as a separate balance sheet line.
The vast majority of our debt is, as you know, in support of our financing business. Of the $9.3 billion debt balance,
$6.3 billion can be associated with the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance debt is calculated
assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $7.2 billion, and these finance assets represent committed revenue
streams from our customers. We have a debt payment in August, which will get us to our year-end debt balance of $8.6
billion, and with the majority of our debt supporting our financing business, we have a strong capital structure in place,
allowing us to return value to shareholders starting in Q3.
Slide 12 provides further detail on our cash performance. Cash from operations of $347 million improved over Q1, but
fell short of our expectations. Performance was driven by earnings of $327 million, and working capital was a slight
contribution to cash flow. Pension and restructuring outflows as well as CapEx of $135 million were in line with plans.
While the second half of the year is seasonally our strongest, we are reducing our full-year operating cash flow forecast
to a range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion to reflect our lower first-half performance and some headwinds that are unique to
this year. First, we are achieving growth in services in a slightly different way than we had anticipated, due in part to
the mix of business and the combination of contract run-offs and revenue ramp. For instance, we are currently ramping
multiple Medicaid and transportation contracts, which require major upfront costs before they produce significant
revenue or cash. We're also supporting ACS's investments in several new services platforms, and we are seeing new
signings with higher startup cash requirements.
We are also affected by the situation in Japan. In Q2, we have absorbed incremental cost and cash outflows related to
air shipments, souring from alternative suppliers, as well as pre-purchasing raw materials. This will continue into Q3.
The higher than normal inventory backlogs and the shift of revenue towards the end of the year also cause a negative
impact on cash. As Ursula said earlier, this adjustment to 2011 guidance does not change our 2012 cash from
operations guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, as we will have year-on-year improvement from lower pension
funding, lower restructuring payments, and higher net income. The guidance adjustment also does not impact the $1
billion of available cash for share repurchase and acquisitions.
Let me walk through the math. CapEx forecast for the year is now slightly lower, at $500 million. This estimate is in
line with the $246 million that we spent in the first half. Debt reduction and dividend assumptions remain the same, at
$600 million and $300 million, respectively. The remainder of the available cash is coming from our year-end cash
balance. Cash from operations at the end of 2010 came in ahead of expectations, and we exited the year with a cash
balance of $1.2 billion. We do not require a cash balance at this level and can make this excess cash available for share
repurchases. This gets us to approximately $1 billion of available cash, consistent with our prior guidance of buying
back $700 million of stock in 2011.
In conclusion, we continue to execute on the strategy Ursula outlined in the beginning. We grew earn earnings by 15%
through a combination of services growth, operating margin improvement, and lower interest expense. And we are
focused on leveraging our annuity-based business model to drive cash flow and return value to shareholders with a
share repurchase program beginning this quarter.
With that, back to you, Ursula.

Thanks, Luca. And let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. Xerox is now the world's largest
enterprise for business process and document management. Our expanded offerings, our broad distribution channels,
our global scale, renowned brand, and innovation, give us a differentiated advantage in the marketplace. We're
leveraging this competitive position by taking a services-led technology-driven approach to growing our business, and
we continue to operate efficiently, maintaining steady margins and increasing earnings despite the recent Japan impact
on costs and revenue.
Our capital strategy contributes to our bottom-line results and positions us well to continue delivering shareholder value
through dividends and, beginning in quarter 3, share repurchase. We're on track to deliver solid results in the second
half, and we're increasing our full-year guidance. Full-year expectations for adjusted EPS have been raised to $1.07 to
$1.12 per share. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.24 to $0.26 per share.
And with that, I thank you again for joining us today, and now let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah, hi. Thanks. Can you talk about what gives you confidence that you can generate
so much cash in the second half to still hit your lowered estimate? You've got to do close to $2 billion in cash flow
from operations in the back half of the year, the high-billions at least. How do you get there?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, Ben. As you know, second half is seasonally strong. If you go back and look at past years,
you see that we generated very significant amounts of cash in the second half. Look at, for example, the 2010 cash
generation. So that – and earnings are stronger. We expect working capital to be favorable. And those are going to be
the primary drivers. So we are fairly confident that we're going to get to that range.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. And then what is the savings from the interest expense, the lower interest
expense? If you're going to buy, over the next year-and-a-half, $1.7 billion in stock, what happens to the interest and
other expense? Does it stay the same, or is there real savings there?
<A - Luca Maestri>: So interest expense are going to be significantly down this year because we're taking that down,
and we are refinancing at better rates. For example, with the refinancing of the trust-preferreds, we'd be generating on
an annual basis about $20 million in savings. About $11 million of that will have an impact during 2011. And so we
will continue to see reduced interest cost as we go into 2012, as well. The share repurchase will come from available
cash, and we do not expect any requirement to increase debt for that.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah, and you're not earning much on that, I'm sure. Okay. And then, you still
committed to buying back $1 billion next year even though you have lower cash flow than expected this year?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Our buying back for next year, we talked about having $2 billion of cash available, and we
actually said 70%, so it's probably going to be a higher amount.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, higher amount than the $1 billion. And we are still committed to the share repurchase,
starting this quarter, flowing through the fourth quarter all the way into 2012.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. And my final question is just around changing metrics around the pages and
machines in-field, et cetera. So I think at your Analyst Day you said, well, pages are going to decline, but we have
higher-value pages, so we can still grow. So I guess I just want to ask, big picture, is that still true? And then,
secondarily, I wanted to ask about, just in terms of what metrics – you want us to focus on MIF, and how are we going
to use that to really understand the growth of technology. Thanks.

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And thanks for the question. On the changing metrics, I think I gave a little bit of color on
what's happening. It's actually good news for our business. It's implementing the strategy that we laid out. We have a
great channel in Global Imaging, and we're moving more and more accounts over to Global Imaging for them to farm
and grow. We have a growing reseller business, where we acquire distribution and move them onto Xerox technology.
We have growing business in DMO. You get the message, that literally we're moving our distribution channels to a
broader set of channels.
The good news about that is that we get more activity. The bad news about that is that we don't get all of the visibility
that we would have gotten if we sold them directly through our channels. And while I'm not trying to hide anything,
we're just trying to not estimate on estimating on estimating and get ourselves into a level of inaccuracy. So what we're
trying to do and what we will do on a go-forward basis is to tell you in detail the activity levels that we achieve and the
split of that activity level between black and white and color. And we can tell you that because we see that throughout
our chain. And we'll talk about revenue, and revenue split by black and white and color will also give an indication of
how we're performing in our metrics. So installs or activity and revenue are the places that we'll focus as much energy
as we can to give as much visibility as we can. This is not to try to hide anything. It's literally just that our business is
actually growing in a way that we don't have deep visibility into the pages or the MIF. Hope I answered --
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Congrats on navigating a challenging environment out
there, lots of moving parts. I guess the first question is, can you give us some sense of sort of the slope of sort of the
return in business as you work through the Japanese supply constraints, and do you think – is it your opinion that we'll
exit this year, enter next year with the Japanese supply chain issues behind us?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: The answer is we started to see improvement at the tail end of last quarter, and we're starting
to see it in the beginning of this quarter. This is not an inexpensive way to do business. So what -- two things will
happen in the rest of the year; one is we have a backlog that's built up. We are staying in contact with those customers,
obviously making sure that we keep the orders on hold, and as the supply chain loosens up, as Fuji Xerox production
continues to ramp and we get them here – generally still in third quarter, by flying them here, so the cost will still be
high – as we get them here, we'll be able to not only alleviate some of the backlog, but we'll also be able to fulfill new
demand, and that's the mix that we have to do.
As we go into fourth quarter, the production should be at regular levels, and we should be tailing out of – still having
some, but tailing out of shipping things here by air. Now, there's a lot of ancillary costs around it that we don't talk
about. It's really complicated, as you said, to manage this. We have parts that we have to move around in an unusual
way. We have people that we have to move around in an unusual way. I think that by fourth quarter, we should be done

be on a regular business-as-usual basis.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Okay. Ursula, that's helpful. Thanks. And I guess just a follow-up to that, is there any chance
that, if you don't see demand come back to the degree that you think it will, that there's some sort of counterbalance on
the cost side that would sort of serve as a tailwind [ph] to top income dollars (30:44)? So, for example, if demand
doesn't materialize, you don't need to air-freight certain things out, so you get a bit of a counterbalance there. Or is that
not the right way to think about it?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Not the right way to think about it. Let me be clear. Demand is not the problem here. Demand
is not the problem. We always have demand problems, as you know. That's what we do. We sell things, and people can
just call them up and get them from us. But this is not a demand issue. This is a supply issue. So we're responding to --

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. My first question is just about revenue expectations for the second
half of the year. Historically, you see seasonal weakness in third quarter, but it sounds like maybe that won't necessarily
be the case this year, given the backlog that you had in second quarter, so if you could just kind of talk about how we
should think about revenue in the various segments as we look at second – well, second half, basically.
<A - Luca Maestri>: We expect revenue growth for the second half to be within our guidance range of 3% to 5%, and
in terms of the dynamics of the two segments, technology 1% to 3%, services over 6%.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. But when we think about the backlog, it seems as if you could have done better in
terms of revenue in second quarter, clearly, because you weren't able to ship the product. So how do...?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: If you look – Shannon, if I can just – I'm sorry for interrupting you, but if you look on a
normal business seasonality, we would have lower revenue in quarter 3 than we have in quarter 2. It's usually our
lightest quarter. This year, because of some of the reasons that you brought up exactly, we will have higher revenue in
quarter 3 than we had in quarter 2, so we will definitely see some of that recovery in quarter 3 from quarter 2. We'll see
improvement in technology revenue in quarter 3 for sure.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. Great. That's what I thought was probably the case. And then can you talk a bit about,
on the BPO signings, if we think of sort of net of the large contracts that you had in the prior-year period, what was the
growth there? Are there any large contracts pending, just how you sort of see the pipeline for BPO?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Okay. Let me start with the signings, and then we'll talk about pipeline. You're right. We had two
what we call mega-deals that affect the metrics. It's the California Medicaid, which was a new signing last year, and
Texas Medicaid, which is a renewal from last year. If you exclude from the calculation – we don't want to exclude
because, of course, it's good business for us, but if you exclude the two mega-deals in the metric, then we would show
signings growth of 9%. The pipeline in BPO right now is very strong. We talked about a total services pipeline of over
20% growth, and BPO is in the same range, and we've got a lot of good prospects, particularly in the commercial area,
particularly on the commercial segment.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. Great. And then my last question is just with regard to sort of end demand, what
you're hearing from your customers, thoughts about Europe, just any color you can give, given some of the questions
that are out there with regard to the macro events that are going on, and it seem as if enterprise is holding in there, but
I'm curious as to what you're hearing.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We are seeing enterprise – I'm going to start with your last comment. We are seeing
enterprise hold up. We're not – it's interesting. Europe is not – we're not impacted by some of the situations in Europe
yet, but we are very cautious about this. The trends here are not – and the noise from this part of the world is not getting
better, I don't – so we are operating really tight to the cuff to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves, meaning
that we know that we're not going to be oblivious to the continued economic weakness in Europe. So we're not seeing it
yet, but we'll see how it goes.
U.S. enterprise is good, no fundamental change. We are seeing slowing of decisions, particularly in the government
sector, which doesn't surprise anyone, and volumes down in some parts of our government business. Luca referred to

unemployment benefits which are down, primarily because people are rolling off the rolls, not necessarily because
they're getting jobs. So government we see – it's still a great business for us, still strong local, state, and federal, but it
goes up and down depending on the contracts that we see. Technology business, it's kind of going along as normal. We
don't see a lot of changes anywhere in the world. We do see weakness, which we saw last quarter, in the Middle East,
but we're just dealing with that as a normal outcome of business, and strength in Russia, normal goals there.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: And I know you don't sell into China, but through Fuji Xerox and what you've done there, as
well as India, any comments on sort of what you're seeing there?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We do sell into India, and we are particularly pleased with some of our services success in
India. That's where we're focusing a lot of our energy, particularly document outsourcing services. We've engaged with
a significantly deeper and more pointed focus since the beginning of this year, and we're seeing some success there.
And, Luca, why don't you talk about China.
<A - Luca Maestri>: So China – in general, Asia-Pacific – was a good region for Fuji Xerox during Q2. Of course
they've got significant issues in Japan, and the issues in Japan will continue into Q3. Particularly, they're going to have
power shortages during the summer. So yes, there, Asia-Pacific and China business have offset some of the domestic
situation.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you very much. Ursula, is there any way to normalize what revenues would have
been if you could have gotten normal fulfillment, just what would revenue growth have been, either in total or however
you want to answer it?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah. We think that, at a minimum, we were impacted by about 3 percentage points – at a
minimum – in technology. It didn't really affect anywhere else than technology, at a minimum.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Now, the reason why we haven't gotten into this and trying to do a big mathematical thing is
because, when something like this happens, you do a lot of things. One of them is redirect your sales force, and you
make them, because we have a supply shortage, significantly less effective than they would have been normally.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So we don't spend a lot of time actually trying to figure that out. What we are preparing to do
is to assure that we have – which is what we're doing -- the supply that's needed to fulfill all of the backlog and to take
on new demand. But, yeah, we definitely suffered to the – at least 3%. That's what we know, the orders that we know
that we took and couldn't fulfill.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right. Okay. And then, Luca, when you gave the revenue targets for September, just to be
clear, were those in constant currency or as you think they'll be reported, with the help of FX?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes. Good question. Sorry I didn't mention it before. 3% to 5% we are saying right now for the
second half of the year, we say constant currency.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay
<A - Luca Maestri>: And of course if the rates stay where they are right now, there could be an uplift of another point
or so from currency.

<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, then fair enough. And then on – ITO was certainly a little lower than we were
thinking. How does that track as we get into the second half of the year?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, better. So ITO was not a strong point for us in the quarter. Interestingly enough, we
had some really good – very good signings in ITO this quarter, but we had a little bit higher than normal set of losses,
and some of those we knew. We knew that we would be coming down in some of the ITO biz because they were
ramping down – not because we lost them, but because they were not going to be there anymore. What we see in
signings, as I said, is signing projections are good, and the contract ramp for some of the things that we won look good.
In quarter 3, we must, we will improve our ITO business. As you know, we talked about MGM and Allscripts, two
very, very, very large ITO businesses that we won, which is very encouraging.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: BPO still stays like an engine in document outsourcing, as well, and ITO should improve in
the third quarter and fourth quarter.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. And then my last one is very strong expense management, very nice job. How does
SAG and R&D track as we look at Q3 specifically? Because it looked like head count stayed about the same, and yet
your expenses were down materially from the March quarter or from last year, however you want to look at it.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah. So I think what we did in Q2, we really want to protect the quarter, and we took a lot of
actions and it came out right. At the same time, we want to balance this for the rest of the year with, ideally, we want to
continue to invest in the business – brand investment, people investment – and we want to grow the business. So I
would say that probably some of the performance that you see in Q2 will not repeat in the second half on the expense
side.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right. So I would assume that translates to OpEx goes up sequentially from Q2.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Not necessarily. Not necessarily.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Slightly.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, slightly. So I think we have a really good pulse on our costs and expense in the
businesses, as you know if you've been following us. The balance here is – as Luca said, it's really important. We have
an anomaly in quarter 2 that will carry on some to quarter 3. But what we have to balance – we have to do this in
expenses, we have to do this in cash – we want to actually make a quarter and rob the business for the future, so we
have to invest in people, we continue to invest in people, we continue to invest in our brand. We're continuing to invest
in the BPO and IPO business to make sure that we can grow that. And to make sure that we could do that, we took
some extraordinary actions on costs, but not so much that they would actually -- they're not so wild that we can't keep
some of them going.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Thanks very much, guys. I will cede the floor.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Great. Thanks very much. Ursula, on services, your 6%-plus growth outlook appears to be
at the higher end of the 4% to 7% guidance range you've talked about in the past, so assuming that the DO and the ITO
pieces of it grow in the mid-single-digits on a full-year basis, that obviously implies very strong double-digit full-year
growth for BPO. First of all, I guess, can you just clarify how much of that is coming from acquisition? And secondly, I
think you mentioned commercial as being strong, but any other color you can share on verticals or even geographies
that are driving strength when you look out would be very helpful.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I'll have Luca start, just – and then I'll dive in after you've done that.

Page 11 of 15
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah, so in BPO, clearly, we are expecting to continue to grow very robustly. A good chunk of
the increase comes from acquisition – you were asking the question. Out of the 9%, I would say 5 points this quarter
were from recent acquisitions, so obviously this is part of our model, right? We continue to make acquisitions in the
BPO space to fuel this growth. It is a growth engine really for us, and also on the services side, so you should expect to
see growth rates that are above the range that we've given for the services segment overall.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Right. And as far as color on the mix, you were right. Commercial was stronger than
government. The mix of commercial is in our sweet spot, the spot that we participate in, and participate well – all of the
customer care, some of the healthcare sides of the business. In transportation for sure we had strong signings across the
board, and we were able to have some of those signings – over 15 of them outside of the United States. So we're
starting to see the expansion that the strategy calls for, which is to have every line of business contribute to growth, and
to accelerate that growth by going outside of the United States, and we're doing both of those.
The notable difference is in certain segments of the government, where we're seeing two dynamics. One is volumes
being a little bit lower. We talked about unemployment as one – clearly, that's obvious; people can understand that –
but transactions like that. But also for our new business that we're seeing coming, that we're pursuing, longer times to
get to closure of a deal, meaning we're participating very well and we are often down-selected, but we have to do a lot
of work with state and federal governments to get the thing actually signed. Not perfect, but very, very good that we are
in the throes of the last deals, and they'll eventually come. It's just taking a little bit longer.
So commercial, good; healthcare, good; transportation, customer care, good; federal okay but a little bit slower than I
would like it to be; and ITO, as we said, we had a weakness in the second quarter. That will definitely be remediated in
the third, given the ramp that we're going to see from the signings that we already have.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Okay. That's really helpful. I guess if I could just ask one more, Ursula, you've noted a
couple of times today just expectations for a very solid second half, yet when we look at your revised EPS guidance for
the year, you've taken the full-year guidance up roughly by the amount of the second quarter beat. I guess, should we
read into that as conservatism, or is there anything else you're trying to signal in terms of visibility or some other
uncertainty that's being factored into that guidance?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I'm definitely not trying to signal conservatism. I probably shouldn't be chucking about
it. It's hard to get through these quarters, as you probably know. We have headwinds, for sure, that we're working our
way through, from a slowdown in the economy. There's no doubt that that's – we are navigating well, but we don't see a
big tailwind from the economic forces around the world anywhere. We still see headwind from Japan. We are
balancing that headwind with all of the things that we're doing to run the business, and I think that the guidance that
we've given for the second half is prudent, very prudent, given all that we're trying to do and all that we're trying to
balance.
<A - Luca Maestri>: I think you're right. I think we are quite bullish on revenue. We definitely see some pressure on
margins, Japan being a case in point because of course all the incremental costs that come with that. But in general,
because of the uncertainty that you see around the world – in Europe, in government, the supply chain – where we
sense some pressure on margin and therefore we balance these things, and that's the way we ended up with the revised
guidance.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you.

to handle demand during the first half of Q2. I guess the question is should we expect air freight and other
logistics-related cost to actually go up in the third quarter as you try to work down the backlog, or do you expect those
costs to go down sequentially?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: No, air freight will definitely go up in quarter 3. It will definitely go up in quarter 3, and I
think you understand why. You produce, we could put everything on a boat, but then customers would definitely not be
pleased with us because they've been waiting for a while. So what we're doing is balancing towards the heavy side,
particularly in quarter 3 – the first portion of quarter 3, a large amount of our supply coming by air because now they've
made it and in order to get it here in a reasonable time to come by here. As we get to quarter 4 – tail end of quarter 3
and quarter 4, we start to put more and more things on the boat, and the timing should be able to work to have a normal
supply gap, order-to-install gap for clients.
And if it turns out the way that we are predicting and the way that – we have people all over the place in Japan,
including our guys there, we should be able to be into normal air ship in the fourth quarter. But the third quarter we will
definitely be heavier into air ship than even we were in the second quarter.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. And then I guess the logical follow-up, Ursula, is how much of the incremental
cost is associated with air freight, and if we take a look at total cost associated with the tragedy there, will they be up or
down sequentially in Q3?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: They'll be up in Q3. They'll be up in Q3, no doubt about it.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And total cost, we just haven't really – we haven't really given it out. Part of the reason is we
haven't really stepped back yet and added it all up. We're adding it up as it goes, and we will work that with our
partners around the world, et cetera, et cetera. But quarter 3 is going to be more – it's comprehended in the numbers that
we've given you, for sure. But, yeah, not much more to say.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay.
<A>: Freight is an important element of the incremental costs, but we set up alternative supply as we pre-purchase
materials, so there's many different costs that come into the equation. Clearly, air freight is an expensive proposition
though
. <Q – [06NY1W-E]Richard Gardner – Citigroup Global Markets (United States)>: Okay.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So thanks, Rich...
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Actually, could I ask one more question?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: No – yes.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Thank you. A little bit of a longer-term question, on ACS, you're taking down your cash
flow guidance this year, in part due to the fact that you've got more new business this year than you had expected and
less renewal. You've also talked about a big opportunity for ACS longer term being expanding that business into
Europe, and a question that I get a lot from investors is whether there's going to be another surprise in terms of cash
flow or expense guidance next year as you ramp up investments in infrastructure to handle that expansion of ACS into
Europe, leveraging Xerox's presence there. I'd love to get your thoughts on that.
<A - Luca Maestri>: So, clearly, expanding to new market requires use of capital. At the same time, we are present in
Europe. We're going try to go to market with a model that really leverages the existing Xerox infrastructure that already
is present in Europe. There's going to be some use of capital, but we are comprehending that into our numbers. As we
look at 2012 cash, really, there are some drivers that are outside of the ongoing operations that will provide us some
positive factors. We're going to be spending less on pensions. We're going to be spending less on restructuring. So we
feel that we certainly are going to generate more cash next year. ACS, already today, even though most of their
business is U.S.-based today, they already have a global delivery model, so it's not that we need to go and invest on the

delivery model. It's more like the sales force end of the business.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you, Rich. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. I have a question, I guess digging a bit more into the cash flow, which I
know you've had a lot of questions on already. But I recognize that you guys are pretty confident in the second half,
and that lends to confidence in the new target. But on the off chance of the low-probably event that you do have some
incremental unexpected pressure on cash flow in the second half, how should we think about the risk to the buyback
program? How much buffer room do you have in terms of that cash flow target coming down and in terms of maybe
pulling from other areas of capital management to maintain the current share buyback target, if unexpected events
occur on the cash flow line?
<A - Luca Maestri>: We consider the share buyback a key priority for the second half, so obviously we're going to be
very focused on getting to an available cash of $1 billion. The $300 million on acquisitions I would say is a number
that is on the low end of the range that we've given previously, and we feel that it is part of our growth model, so we
need to continue to spend on acquisitions. But there's a number of items on the profit and loss and in the cash flow that
we're going to be working very hard, and as we think about priorities, we know that we need to deliver on the buyback.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Great. And then one final question. You had mentioned earlier that you had longer lead
times on signing in multi-year services contracts. Can you give us a little more color on how you're thinking about this
as a near-term dynamic or a longer term dynamic? And if it is a longer-term dynamic, what do you think is driving
that? Is this an industry-wide phenomenon, or is this something that's sort of endemic to Xerox specifically?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I don't think it's endemic to Xerox at all. I think the bigger the contract – and this is
what we're – when I talk about longer cycles for signing, generally in government and generally big things. These are
not fall-off-the log contracts, so it's an industry-wide phenomenon. It's associated with some of the uncertainty in
government and just changes – you get new people sitting in different tiers, that kind of stuff – and due to the fact that
they are big. I would not – this should not be considered like a problem. It clearly fixes – or it gives you some ups and
downs in quarters, but they do sign. They do sign. They have to sign because the work has to get done. And generally,
if they sign, we win. So I am confident in this part of the business just getting back to normal. I don't think it's
something – I think you said – endemic or systematic.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you. Next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I also had a cash flow question or two. Of the $350 million of cash flow
reduction in the guidance for the year, how much is related to the supply chain and how much is related to the services
business?
<A - Luca Maestri>: I would say it's 60/40 – 60% services, 40% Japan.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: And does that upfront capital commitment – I guess I'm trying to understand why that
wouldn't continue as you try and grow that business going forward. Have you changed any of the terms and conditions
you're willing to take on in trying to close some of these contracts? And to sustain growth, why wouldn't you continue
to need to deploy that capital?

<A - Luca Maestri>: Some of the increased cash requirements are coming from the fact that our renewals are maybe
slightly less than we would like, right? And hopefully that trend will not continue going forward. Secondly, we have a
number of investments going on right now for services platforms. Think of this Medicaid platform, which we call
enterprise. Then we've got another platform called eligibility, again related to government services. These are
investments that, once they're made, we're going to leverage throughout a number of business lines, and so we do not
feel that they're going to be a recurring drain on cash. But, clearly, we've always said it all along, if you want to grow,
working capital probably is not going to be the source of cash that it has been for Xerox in 2009 and 2010.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: For my last question, I wanted to come back to this question around page growth. Last year –
for all of last year, equipment sales grew around 9%, and now that's continuing to translate into, what, about 4%, 5%
declines in page volume. What does it take to get that page volume to turn up?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah. So part of the reason why we're actually thinking about this is because we absolutely
do see activity growth, color growth, et cetera, all of the things that we spoke about, there's a lot of stuff going through
different methodologies that we don't naturally capture. As I said, Global Imaging, growing like a weed, the pages that
are captured – equipment that goes into Global Imaging and the pages that come from there, the best that we can do is
estimate them. DMO continuing to grow, the best we can do is estimate them; and then competitive devices that we
have, when we win document outsourcing deals, we don't count them at all. So we just can't be as accurate as we once
were in this area.
I think that we are seeing, in this bad time, sequential flatness, so we're seeing no change which, if you think about it
based on what happened in the second quarter of this year, is actually a good sign, a good indicator -a bigger mix
toward color; from the things that we can even count, a stability in pages; and then the places that we don't count, a
significant growth in activity, particularly in Global Imaging and DMO. So I actually am feeling better about pages
than I have in the past. And so what does it take to turn them? I think we're doing all it takes, which is selling more,
installing the right types of devices, et cetera, protecting the base like we can, et cetera.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Next question, I think final question. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes, thank you. Good morning. A couple questions here real quickly. Luca, could you
talk a little more about how investors should think about the contribution to earnings from revenue growth and mix
longer term? Obviously, share buyback's going to help out here in the near to mid-term, and you guys have some
incremental OpEx activities, but when do we really get the benefit from revenue growth and mix?
<A - Luca Maestri>: For which year?
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Let's do 2012 to start.
<A - Luca Maestri>: So we talked about revenue growth next year of, say, 4% to 6%. We think that that growth
should translate into earnings. Mix is going to be primarily towards services, which carry slightly better margins than
technology, so that should be a positive, as well.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: And then ...
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So the business – I'm sorry, go ahead. Go ahead.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: I'm sorry to interrupt. Go ahead, Ursula.

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: No, no. Please continue, and then I'll kind of bring it all together at the end. Go for it.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Well, I was going to ask, just in terms of your confidence today seems a little less than
usual, Ursula, regarding the color business, and can you guys just talk a little more about maybe clarifying what
happened in color in terms of the high-end deterioration, how much was tougher compares versus the supply
constraints versus other?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I am actually just the opposite on the color business. We have unbelievable activity
levels, given the supply constraint that we had in mid-range color, so in the office color space, we are "growing like a
weed." We're doing very, very well. At the very high end of color, the iGen space, very big page [ph] compares
(1:01:00), iGen space and the 8000/100 (sic) [800/1000] – the color press series, very, very strong performance. We
have – I talked about this last quarter as well. We have a gap. In the high end of the entry production space, we have a
gap that we are filling. We launched a product – just launched a product called the 8080, and we have more offerings to
come that will help us regain our position in this space.
I actually feel extremely confident about color, and interestingly enough, I am very confident about black and white.
The only problem with black and white is it's not growing, but our share position is very strong. If a deal comes up, we
win more than three-quarters of the time, so I'm strong there -- confident there. It's just that that portion is not growing.
I spend a lot of time on color – we spend a lot of time on color, and we are all over it. We're number-one color
shareholder – we're number-one revenue shareholder, et cetera. So I don't want you to walk away from this call with a
statement that I'm not confident about it. It's just the opposite. I'm actually very confident about it. And as supply
comes, I think we'll be fine here, totally fine here.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. Thank you.
Ursula M. Burns
