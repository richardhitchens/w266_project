MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Accenture's fourth quarter fiscal 2012 earnings
conference call. At this time all phone lines are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer
session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded, and with that, I'd now like to

KC McClure
Thank you, Doug, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2012 earnings
announcement. As Doug just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today
are: Pierre Nanterme, our Chief Executive Officer and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to read the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will take you through the financial
details including the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth
quarter and the full year. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. Pam will then provide our
business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2013 and then we'll take your questions before Pierre provides
a wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursement or net
revenues.

release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
We are very pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year which enabled us to meet or
exceed our annual business outlook for all of our key metrics. Our strong performance demonstrates that our growth
strategy continues to differentiate us in the marketplace and that we are running our business with a focus on delivering
value to shareholders.
Pam will provide details on the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year in a moment. Here are a few highlights for the
year. We delivered record new bookings of $32.2 billion. Revenue growth was strong and broad based across our
business with an 11% increase in local currency to $27.9 billion, also a record.
Earnings per share were a record $3.84, up 13% and at the top of our guided range. We expanded operating margin 30
basis points to 13.9, also at the top of our guided range. We generated exceptionally strong free cash flow of $3.9
billion and continue to have a very strong balance sheet ending the year with a cash balance of $6.6 billion.
We continue to return cash to shareholders with more than $3 billion in share repurchases and dividend payments
during the year. And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $0.81 per share, which is a 20% increase over
our prior dividend.
Clearly, we continue to execute extremely well across all dimensions of our business, and I want to take this
opportunity to recognize the contribution of the [indiscernible] (4:24) team of Accenture which is totally committed to
our clients and to our success.
Now let me hand over to Pam who will read you the numbers in greater detail. Pam, over to you.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre. And thanks to all of you for listening today.
I am pleased to give you some details on Accenture's fiscal year 2012 fourth quarter and full-year financial results. We
finished the year strong across key dimensions. We had record bookings in consulting and outsourcing and a quarterly
total for the first time of over $9 billion. Our free cash flow as we cross year end was outstanding and most notably, we
were able to meet or beat all of the elements in our original annual business outlook provided a year ago.
Now let's get to the numbers for the quarter and the fiscal year. Unless I state otherwise, all figures are U.S. GAAP
except the items that are not part of the financial statements or that are calculations.

New bookings for the quarter were a record $9.2 billion and that level of bookings also notably reflected a negative 9%
foreign exchange impact compared with new bookings in the fourth quarter last year. Consulting bookings were $4.3
billion and outsourcing bookings were $4.9 billion, both individual records.
As Pierre mentioned, new bookings for the full fiscal year also hit an all-time high of $32.2 billion, $1.2 billion above
the upper end of the range we signaled in June. These bookings reflected a foreign exchange impact of negative 3%
compared with new bookings for fiscal 2011. Consulting bookings for fiscal 2012 were $16.6 billion and outsourcing
bookings were $15.6 billion.
Let me give you some details on bookings in the fourth quarter, first, in consulting. In management consulting,
bookings were strong this quarter, particularly in the Americas and some parts of Europe. They continue to include a
greater proportion of larger projects of longer duration with a focus on business outcomes. The strongest growth in
bookings was for sales transformation and for finance and enterprise performance work.
Technology consulting bookings reflected demand for network transformation, data center consolidation, desktop
transformation and IT strategy all to drive cost savings and increase the business value of IT spend. We see more
significant opportunities to capture here and this is being focused on by our technology leaders.
System integration bookings were the highest for as long as we've been tracking them. Our bookings continue to reflect
client demand to implement and modernize both ERP and industry specific systems, which is also creating platforms
for advanced analytics work driving more business value.
We also see clients evaluating their legacy application portfolios, which is leading to growing demand to build and
integrate software-as-a-service, or SaaS, and other cloud solutions. And our clients demand for mobile, digital and web
solutions across multiple types of devices is becoming more and more pervasive. Emerging technology trends are
gaining momentum.
Turning to outsourcing, technology outsourcing bookings continued to be very strong and broad-based across our
operating groups and geographically across the Americas, Asia Pacific and parts of Europe and Africa. We continue to
work closely with many, many clients around the world. Not only to help them capture immediate cost savings, but to
turn fixed costs into variable costs and to improve their IT effectiveness as they continue to work to transform their
operations to become more competitive.
BPO bookings were very strong, a quarterly record, driven by our cross-industry offerings especially finance and
accounting. Bookings were broad-based across most of our commercial industries. Strong demand for our services was
most pronounced in the Americas, including in the U.S. where we have our industry-specific solution in credit services.
Our BPO business built momentum all year long in fiscal 2012 with strong bookings driving increases in market share
each quarter and the business is well positioned going into FY13 as well.
Finally on bookings, we had bookings of over $100 million at 11 clients with all 5 operating groups represented.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $6.84 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and
9% in local currency over the same period last year. As we had expected, these revenues reflected a foreign exchange
impact of negative 7% compared with Q4 last year. These revenues were at the upper end of our guided range of $6.6
billion to $6.85 billion and reflected growth in local currency in all five of our operating groups in the fourth quarter.
Consulting revenues were $3.74 billion in the fourth quarter, down 4% in U.S. dollars and up 2% in the local currency.
We had strong local currency growth in Asia Pacific, single digit local currency growth in the Americas and we're just
under flat in local currency in EMEA.
Outsourcing revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. We saw strong
double-digit growth in local currency in all three geographic regions and across the majority of our industry groups.
Net revenues for the full fiscal year were $27.9 billion, an increase of 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency.
Consulting revenues for the full year were $15.6 billion, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency and
outsourcing revenues were $12.3 billion, an increase of 16% in U.S. dollars and 19% in local currency. I'm pleased

with the net revenue results delivered in fiscal 2012 and how we continue to rise to the challenge in meeting our clients'
evolving needs.
I'll take you through some Q4 details by operating group. Financial services revenues increased 16% in local currency.
Outsourcing revenues reflected very significant growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific across all three industries:
banking, insurance and capital markets. Consulting revenues, which reflected strong growth in insurance, grew
modestly as the gains outweighed declines in banking in the Americas and EMEA.
In banking, transformation needs continue to evolve as a key driver of future demand. Consulting revenues also
included the recognition of revenues related to higher than normal pre-contract costs incurred in Q3 as I mentioned last
quarter.
Health and public service revenues increased 10% in local currency reflecting very significant growth in health again
this quarter with strength in both consulting and outsourcing and across geographies. Our investments in health are
paying off. Our health offerings are resonating in the market.
Public service had modest growth again this quarter reflecting good demand for our offerings in some parts of Asia
Pacific and globally in consulting for human services. Growing our public service business is still challenged in other
parts of the world as we continue to reposition this business for the future.
The products operating group, our largest, had local currency revenue growth of 8% driven by very strong growth in
outsourcing globally in both our technology and BPO offerings. From an industry perspective, growth was driven by
retail, life sciences and industrial equipment in all regions. Both the Americas and Asia Pacific grew double digits.
EMEA grew modestly as strong outsourcing growth was offset by a modest consulting decline again this quarter.
Resources revenues grew 7% in local currency with growth across all industries led by energy and natural resources.
Strong growth in outsourcing reflected demand for flexible, cost effective sourcing to meet increased demand in
ongoing operations. Consulting growth moderated but continued to reflect solid global demand for operating model
programs and a focus on driving short-term efficiencies.
In utilities we are building momentum with our smart grid offerings to support our clients in advancing their energy
efficiency programs.
Communications, Media and Technology revenues increased 4% in local currency. Very strong outsourcing growth
was driven by our clients' continued focus on improving the efficiency of their operations. Outsourcing growth
included a short-term increase related to a contract with a client in Europe which will ramp down throughout FY13.
CMT's consulting revenue declined in all three regions. This was most pronounced in EMEA and in communications
globally where certain communications clients continue to move away from building core IT system capability for
traditional markets and to move toward more value-added services. In emerging markets and in high tech globally,
there's renewed system integration activity to build core capability on new platforms.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin in Q4 was 32.9% compared with 33.1% for the same period last
year, a 20 basis point decrease. Gross margin for the full year was 32.3% compared with 32.9% in fiscal 2011, a
decrease of 60 basis points. Higher contract profitability was more than offset by investments in offerings and
acquisitions.
Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $839 million, or 12.3% of net revenues compared with $821 million,
also 12.3% of net revenues, for the fourth quarter last year. And sales and marketing costs for the full year were $3.3
billion, or 11.9% of net revenues compared with $3.1 billion or 12.1% of net revenues in fiscal 2011, a decrease of 20
basis points.
General and administrative expense was $469 million, or 6.9% of net revenues compared with $472 million or 7.1% of
net revenues for the fourth quarter last year, a 20 basis points decrease. G&A costs for the full year were $1.8 billion, or
6.5% of net revenues compared with $1.8 billion or 7.1% of revenues in fiscal 2011, a decrease of 60 basis points
year-on-year.

Operating income was $940 million in the fourth quarter reflecting a 13.8% operating margin. This compares with
$923 million, also 13.8% operating margin in the fourth quarter last year. Full year operating income of $3.9 billion
reflected a 13.9% operating margin compared with $3.5 billion or a 13.6% operating margin for fiscal 2011, a 30 basis
points year-over-year expansion.
In continuing to manage our business to modest margin expansion, we executed well to drive profitable growth, to
invest in our business including in gross margin and to manage our cost structure in a disciplined way, i.e., to grow it at
a rate less than revenue. This is what we set out to do and we delivered.
In terms of operating groups, health and public service operating income decreased year-over-year in Q4 and operating
margins fell, due primarily to delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts, some write-offs in our public service business
in U.S. federal and investments in health initiatives.
For the full year, I am pleased to again note that products posted strong year-over-year operating income and operating
margin gains and also that resources delivered very strong operating income and margin all year long.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.8% compared with 27% for the fourth quarter last year. The higher rate in
fourth quarter this year was due to increased reserves and a change in the geographic mix of income. The year-to-date
effective tax rate was 27.6%, in line with our annual guided range of 27% to 28%.
Net income was $636 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $683 million for the same quarter last year, a
decrease of 7% and the decrease was driven by the higher tax rate. For the full year, net income was $2.8 billion,
compared with $2.6 billion in fiscal 2011, also a record this year and an increase of 11%.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.88 compared with $0.91 in the fourth quarter last year. The $0.03 decrease is made
up of a $0.03 increase from higher revenue and operating results including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange
this quarter, a $0.03 increase from the lower share count, which was more than offset by an $0.08 decrease from the
higher effective tax rate and a $0.01 decrease from lower non-operating income.
For the full fiscal year, diluted earnings per share were $3.84 compared with $3.39 in fiscal 2011, an increase of 13%
and at the top end of our guided range of $3.80 to $3.84. The $0.45 increase is made up of $0.40 from higher revenue
and operating income including the impact of foreign exchange, $0.08 from the lower share count, offset by $0.02 from
a higher effective income tax rate and $0.01 from lower non-operating income.
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding were 27 days, down from 30 days both from last quarter and from Q4
last fiscal year. This was unusually low and did include an uptick in client prepayments.
Free cash flow was $1.6 billion rounded resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.7 billion net of
property and equipment additions of $115 million. For the full fiscal year, free cash flow of $3.9 billion rounded was
about $400 million above the top end of our previously guided range. This significantly higher level reflected better
than expected DSOs, as I just mentioned, and reflected the operating results in the quarter. Cash from operating
activities was $4.26 billion and property and equipment additions were $372 million.
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at August 31 reflected the strong cash flow and was $6.6 billion, it
compares with $5.7 billion at August 31 last year.
Moving to some other key operational metrics, we hired more than 60,000 people in fiscal 2012 and ended the year
with q global head count of 257,000 people. Our global delivery network grew from 141,000 people at the beginning of
the fiscal year to 162,000 people at the end.
In Q4, our utilization was 87%, consistent with Q3. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 12%, down
compared with 13% in Q3 and down from 14% in Q4 last fiscal year.
Before I turn things back to Pierre, I'll provide an update on how we performed in FY12 on our ongoing objective to
return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed
approximately 12 million shares for $696 million at an average price of $58.18 per share.

For the full year, we repurchased or redeemed 36.6 million shares for $2.1 billion at an average price of $57.32 per
share. In fiscal 2012, we delivered on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders. The total was $3.05 billion
reflecting $2.1 billion in share repurchases and $951 million in dividend payments we made during the fiscal year. Our
weighted average diluted shares came down 2.1% over the fiscal year.
Earlier today, we announced that our board of directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $0.81 per share. This
dividend will be paid on November 15 and represents a 13.5 cent per share or 20% increase over the previous
semiannual dividend we declared in March.
To sum up, we delivered all year. We executed our strategy, stayed close to our clients and were mindful of our costs.
All of this allowed us to respond well to the stronger demand for outsourcing and moderated demand for consulting
that evolved during the year. I'm very proud of Accenture people and their extraordinary ability to drive our business in
a way that serves both our clients and our shareholders so well.
So let me turn the call back to Pierre to give you a brief update on some exciting things going on in our business and
then I'll finish up with our initial business outlook for fiscal year 2013.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, Pam.
As our very strong results for fiscal year 2012 demonstrates, we are executing our growth strategy in a focused and
disciplined way, providing differentiated services that create tangible and measurable value for our clients.
Although the global economic and geopolitical environment remains volatile and uncertain, the diversity of our
business continues to serve us very well. We are working with clients across 14 industries and more than 120 countries
providing a full range of market-leading services. We have an unmatched depth and breadth of industry skills with
153,000 people in our operating groups and growth platforms aligned with specific industries.
As demonstrated by our record new bookings, we are seeing strong demand for services. Our clients continue to invest
in transforming their operations, to address the challenges presented by the long-term trends of globalization,
regulation, rationalization and technology innovation.
To help our clients address these challenges, we combine our unique capabilities across management consulting,
technology and business process outsourcing, and we provide highly differentiated industry-based end-to-end services.
Let me bring this to life with some recent wins in the marketplace. We are helping Oi, one of Brazil's leading
communication providers drive greater operational efficiency and transform its business. In addition to managing their
billing and collection, finance and accounting, HR and [indiscernible] (23:44) functions we're also leveraging analytics
to target further process improvements, to lower costs and improve quality across their business.
We are working with BP, the global energy company, to consolidate and run its finance and accounting function across
Europe and North America. We are standardizing reporting and metrics and using advanced analytics to drive greater
insights into the business with a goal of improving business controls, transforming risk management and reducing
operating costs.
And at the same time, we continue to invest in building our industry expertise. I'm pleased to report that just this week
we completed the acquisition of Octagon Research Solutions, a provider of clinical and regulatory information
management systems. This acquisition significantly expands the range of services we provide to pharmaceutical clients,
enhancing our ability to help them achieve more efficient global regulatory submissions and enabling them to get
medicines to market faster and at a lower cost.
I'm also pleased with the progress we've made in fiscal year 2012 in the fastest growing areas of cloud, analytics and
mobility where we are now operating at scale in response to increased demand from our clients.

In cloud, through a five-year contract valued at more than $280 million, we're helping a major global client completely
transform its sales, customer service and delivery functions worldwide. The new cloud-based solution is part of the
clients' efforts to increase revenue and customer satisfaction while also reducing operating costs.
In Mobility, we are helping a leading company in the energy industry develop and roll out advanced mobile
applications to its global workforce of more than 25,000 employees. The program will enable staff in remote locations
to use mobile devices to access customer information in real time, significantly increasing efficiency and improving
customer service.
As you know, geographic expansion is another key dimension of our strategy. We continue to invest in growth markets,
both mature and underpenetrated markets as well as our priority emerging markets. In fiscal year 2012, we made good
progress in our ten priority emerging markets increasing revenues 16% in local currency. We are particularly pleased
with the growth in China, South Africa, Brazil and India where we are executing very well and gaining market share.
I would also like to highlight our excellent results in the United States, which continues to be our largest market and
delivered strong revenue growth of 13% for the year. And of course, we continue to run Accenture as a high
performance business with a relentless focus on value, cost management and productivity to further improve our own
efficiency and competitiveness and deliver on our commitments to shareholders.
With that, I will turn it back to Pam who will provide our business outlook for fiscal year 2013. Over to you.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre.
I'd like to first share with you some thoughts on how our business is shaping up for fiscal year 2013. We see very good
opportunities in most markets around the world and our Q4 bookings and healthy pipeline confirm this and position us
well as we move forward. At the same time, we remain very vigilant about understanding the impact of the evolving
global macroeconomic environment. We will continue to be focused on managing our global business tightly.
For fiscal 2013, we expect growth rates in outsourcing to continue to be higher than in consulting based on the book of
business we have and the opportunities we see. While our consulting bookings have been solid in recent quarters, we
anticipate they will continue to convert to revenues at a slower rate going forward, as they did the in latter part of fiscal
year 2012.
Our outlook components and our intent to update you quarterly remain the same for fiscal 2013. We will continue to
provide a quarterly outlook for revenue so that you have a basis for understanding our quarterly phasing expectations
during the year.
So, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.35 billion. This
assumes a foreign exchange impact of negative 3% compared to the first quarter in fiscal 2012. Our revenue outlook in
Q1 reflects growth in 4 of our 5 operating groups and a slight decline in revenue for communications, media and
technology. We do anticipate that CMT will return to growth later in the fiscal year based on recent bookings and how
new business is shaping up.
Let me turn to our assumption for foreign exchange for the full fiscal year. Based upon how the rates have been
trending over the last couple of weeks, we currently assume the impact of foreign ex-change on our results in U.S.
dollars to be negative 1% for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. This assumes the weakening dollar we've seen over
the last few weeks. If the dollar were to return to the levels of a month ago, the FX annual headwind could be more like
negative 2%. We will update the annual foreign exchange assumption each quarter.
For the full fiscal year 2013, we expect Accenture's net revenue to grow in a range of 5% to 8% in local currency over
fiscal 2012. For the full fiscal year 2013, we are targeting new bookings to be in the range of $31 billion to $34 billion.
As you know, our bookings can be lumpy from quarter to quarter.

In fiscal year 2013 we expect operating margin to be in the range of 14.0% to 14.1%, a 10 to 20 basis points expansion.
We will continue to balance profitability with making investments to position our business for the future. You should
expect some fluctuations quarter to quarter as we've seen in the past.
We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%. In determining next year's expected rate, we
have evaluated our projected geographic mix of income, our reserves and some future final determinations.
For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $4.22 to $4.30 or 10% to
12% growth
Now let's turn last, but not at all least, to cash flow. As you know we had very strong cash flow at the end of fiscal 2012
which reflected an unusually low level of DSOs, 27 days at the end of Q4. We have reflected a more normal level of
DSOs in our forecast for fiscal 2013, i.e., a few more days. We he have also decided to provide a substantial
discretionary contribution, $500 million, to our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plan during the first half of fiscal
2013.
So taking these things into account for the full fiscal year, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.2
billion to $3.5 billion, property and equipment additions to be $420 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $2.8
billion to $3.1 billion.
To give you just a little more on our thinking about capital allocation, we are on course to continue our strategy this
fiscal year to both invest in our business to grow as well as to return a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. I
will share more with you on this topic at our investor and analyst day in two weeks.
So in conclusion, we're staying focused on what matters most, driving value for our clients and for our shareholders.
We look forward to having some of our business leaders around the world share more details at our investor and analyst
day.
So KC, let's take some questions.
KC McClure
Thanks, Pam. I would ask that you each keep your questions limited to one question and one follow-up to allow as
many participants as possible to ask questions. Doug, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Thanks so much. Great bookings here. I want to ask or I guess better understand how the
bookings will convert to revenue. Pam, I know you mentioned that there was some slower conversion there. Can you
just help us better appreciate that, how we can track that and more importantly, just reconcile your bookings guidance
with your revenue guidance? Any change, again, in book to bill or any other metric that we should consider?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes. Hi, Tien-Tsin. Well, first of all, in the book to bill, we were sure pleased with those in
Q4. 1 to 1 in consulting, probably about 1 to 6 in outsource.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Right.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: So I think one of the things I mentioned that in consulting, we do see what's being booked
being sort of larger, longer duration things and those do convert to revenue, just as a basket, slower, because there's less
of the littler, faster converting stuff in the mix. So we do expect that trend to continue.

<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Right, so as I think about – I guess the correlation between bookings growth and revenue
growth, is it fair to say that's going to break down a little bit next year? Because it sounds like it's getting, you know, a
little bit more complex, I guess.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah. I think bookings are lumpy, right, and I think that we did have a number of large things.
I mentioned we had 11 clients where we had bookings of over $100 million, so some of those are big things over a
longer time period and so I think it's hard to correlate it exactly just in terms of then trying to sort of link that to a
revenue growth rate in the first quarter.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Okay, fair enough. Maybe just a quick follow-up, in terms of contract profitability and in
cost containment, no surprises on the margin guidance, but I'm curious, contract profitability has been a big help here.
Is there still room to go on that front, or are there going to be different levers to pull for margin expansion in fiscal
2013? Thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: We'll never give up on contract profitability and particularly pricing and then how we
continue to manage our costs and look at the whole value equation for clients. I think that is – definitely continues to be
a push for us. But at the same time in terms of managing our business to operating margin, we're going to be looking
for those efficiencies in SG&A to continue.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks for that.

Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks. On a high level, first, maybe for Pierre, your growth rates overall are clearly above
industry average and clearly above your peers. Can you just give us some specific color on some of these 11 large
contracts you've won in the sense of what was the driver of you winning that? I mean, your market gains are noticeable
at this point and maybe some specific examples of what in an RFP you showed that others did not and is that
sustainable?
And then maybe just a follow-up on a similar question to the – specifically to the financial services vertical given the
growth and how strong it was there? Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, sure. Thanks a lot, Darrin. Regarding – I mean, what's differentiating us in the
marketplace and I think the terrific thing in the two illustrations I mentioned previously with Oi and BP, first is our
constant focus on large global companies. Second is, indeed, what we see from a transformation standpoint in the
marketplace and to drive transformation for such large clients, you need to combine multiple capabilities, if you will,
and this is what we do with those two illustrations from MC, technology, BPO, AO and on top of that, we're bringing
things such as the cloud or such as the advanced analytics. I think we have a unique positioning so far which is
resonating very well with the clients and differentiating us into the marketplace of combining capabilities, operating at
scale, working for those very large global organizations and really focusing on bringing an outcome.
You know, FS is a good illustration of what's going on. FS, as you know, financial services and especially banking, but
it's true for insurance, are industries facing significant transformation from a regulatory standpoint, of course, Solvency
II, Basel III, but as well, from an operational standpoint and again, we are very pleased with what we're doing
especially from an outsourcing standpoint where our outsourcing bookings as well as revenue growth was very good
and it's perfecting, again, our positioning in supporting those large organizations in some major transformations, so
that's what's explaining our current differentiation.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: In financials, just to be clear, regulatory drivers is a major variable as well as just an overall
cost optimization in transformation? Is there any other major drivers that we should keep in mind for that segment just
given how strong it's been?

<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I mean, those are the major ones and particularly in banking, frankly, insurance has been
strong for us for a number of quarters now. Just one other thing I'd like to point out because these were really strong
results in financial services, is they did include a couple of things from a compare perspective that I should point out.
First of all, we talked to last quarter a little bit about pre-contract costs and of course, these are costs that were in the
quarter and then the revenues came through in this quarter so that had maybe just about a two-point impact on financial
services. We also made two fairly sizable acquisitions in the beginning of last year and those, you know, have done
really well. I mentioned the credit services business which has really come on strong this year.

Our next question, Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: All right, guys. I'll just say, wow, in response to your bookings results and I have a question
on the bookings front as well. After the blowout bookings in the August quarter, are you now somewhat needing to
replenish your sales pipeline and should we expect bookings growth to potentially be sort of artificially low in the
November quarter after all of the strong bookings that you posted in the August quarter?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, Rod, first of all, I don't know about the word artificially. I think there's always some
lumpiness to our bookings. That said, I think what I was pleased about is that the pipeline is still up quite nicely. I think
it's only really in the very big deals and we also look at the very big deal pipeline where we do, indeed, need to do some
replenishment but that would be normal and natural at this point after that quarter of bookings. We 4even had a couple,
frankly, that came in early, right? We expected them in Q1. They came in Q4, which was fantastic, and so there is a
little bit of that, and so yeah, the bookings in Q1 will be lower but I wouldn't say – I wouldn't use the artificially word.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: All right, but you did have some deals that were somewhat pulled forward faster than you
normally would occur at this time of the year?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, one or two. You know, not like it's some big thing.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay. And then, Pam, can you give us an update on your contracted revenue growth and
then as we look at the growth outlook for consulting versus outsourcing, are you confident that consulting
year-over-year growth in constant currency can remain positive for each quarter in the next year?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I am confident that it will be positive for the first quarter and for the year and you know,
that's, I think, how it will come out. The first quarter, at this point, I see a little positive, single-digits, it could be sort of
as low as flattish, but we do see positive and for the year, low to mid-single digits positive.
In terms of our visibility, we do see, you know, as we look forward over the next four quarters, that's contracted
revenue is up 9% over last year. Interestingly beyond that, contracted revenue is up 13% more than the prior year as we
looked at that and so that just points at this longer duration thing that's going on with some of the bookings, but the 9%,
you know, gives us confidence with the 5% to 8% revenue – projected revenue growth.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: All right, wonderful, thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you, Rod.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thanks a lot, Rod. I had the same reaction like you; I said, wow, when I saw the 9 in front of
our bookings for Q4.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: How do you say, wow, in French, Pierre?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Wow.

Our next question is from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Great. Hey, guys, real quickly just in terms of the head count build as you think about fiscal
2013, just maybe if you can reconcile, the head count build for the end of the year seems a little bit slower, at least
versus what we were looking for and I'm trying to reconcile that against obviously the record bookings and the record
finish to the year here. Just help us think through what is in the pace of the head count adds relative to the pace of
bookings at this point in terms of a little bit – what looks like a little bit of a slower number there?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, I didn't necessarily see it as slower. I mean, I think as you look through the quarters of
the year, we added 7,000 in the fourth quarter to our billable head count and that was more than any other quarter in the
year. So I mean, I think, Julio, I mean, we're doing what we're always doing, which is balancing supply and demand.
We also have had good results with attrition, right, and that has meant that we haven't had to hire as many people.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: That makes sense. What about for fiscal 2013, what's the gross expectation for adds?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Probably a little bit less than this year, but again with the lower attrition, that's the main driver
of that and then just, again, how we see the business shaping up.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Got it.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: We're pleased with that, if I would add. If we have lower attrition, it means that we will have
less cost for recruiting people.

Our next question is from Moshe Katri with Cowen & Company.
<A - KC McClure>: Hi, Moshe.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Thanks. Not to beat a dead horse here talking about bookings, do you think that the booking
numbers are a function of improving demand, strong competitive wins, maybe execution from Accenture?
And then you mentioned pricing briefly. Is that an important lever for you guys in order for you to continue this very
mild expansion in EBIT margins on an annual basis and maybe you can talk about how you can continue to get that
leverage from the pricing?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah. I think just one thing I'll point out and then I'm going to let Pierre weigh in as well. One
of the things that I think is interesting is that our sole source wins have been averaging about 60% over the last few

quarters and I think that's up from the 50 that we've been quoting in the past. So I think that our ability to drive really
valuable propositions for clients to their specific business needs and shape those things. I mean, I think that has
certainly helped us.
Pierre, why don't I let you give a little more here?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. That's exactly right. Those bookings that you see are extremely important for us. It
reflects how we differentiate in the marketplace. We're winning against the competition. Whether what we're selling is
resonating with our clients and I think this is where we are and of course, it's giving us the confidence moving forward
as we enter fiscal year 2013. So I think what we see is our current positioning is strong in the marketplace with this
combination of [indiscernible] (46:00) focused on these large and global clients and bringing this combination of
industry expertise together with technology leadership and then end-to-end services to deliver tangible and measurable
values and today, this is what the market is expecting from a company like us and I am indeed extremely pleased with
the bookings as the best proof point of our positioning.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Great. And, then on pricing, any color there?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, pricing interestingly remains pretty stable in a competitive environment and we're
always going to be pushing on it where we can.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Are there any specific areas where you think that you do have some of that leverage to bring it
higher?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I mean, I think again right, where you take a value focus and that's really strong, that's where
it makes the most sense, because then you're able to really generate the value for the client as well as for us. So that's
the focus we try to take with it.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: All right. Thanks, guys.

Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys, how are you doing?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Good.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Doing well.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Good. I just want to ask about the health and public service margin, I know it was lower, but it
sounded like it was mostly one-time in nature, the write-down, so we shouldn't expect that going forward? Is that right,
Pam?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, it did include some one-time things. We did the delivery inefficiencies on a few
contracts and some write-offs we had. I mean that unit of the public service piece generally does trend a little lower
anyway, but this quarter was impacted by those things.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, and then just following up on the head count, I mean, net head count was up about 9%
year-over-year. If you hire about the same or a little less in gross adds, lower than the 60,000 you hired this year, then
that's going to moderate from the 9% for fiscal year 2013. I guess the concern would be then what does that say about
fiscal year 2014 growth rate if that head count growth is going to slow? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that
because maybe there's a break there between revenue and head count that needs to be understood?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I don't think it really says much at all about FY14 growth rates at this point. I mean, it's really
based on where we need people, attrition and how the business is shaping up for 2013. I mean, that's really it at this

point.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. All right. Thanks so much.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: No reason to be concerned. I mean, managing head count is probably, I guess there are many
things we're doing right in Accenture but there are some things we're doing very well, which is managing
supply/demand, productivity. We have a long experience of doing this and indeed it's all a combination of the
productivity you expect, the supply/demand country by country, your pricing hypothesis and you put all of this in our
algorithm, if you will, and we believe that we are targeting the right head count growth we need to deliver to our
clients.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: That's great to know because a lot of people will look at that as a leading indicator of future
growth so if it does moderate, doesn't sound like you guys are losing any confidence in the out year number. Thanks so
much.

Our next question is from George Price with BB&T Capital Markets.
<Q - George A. Price>: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Nice job.
Pam, the fiscal 1Q revenue guidance, if I'm looking at the math right, suggests constant currency revenue growth more
like in the kind of 3% to 7%-ish kind of range which is a little bit below the annual range. I guess, in light of the macro
uncertainty that's out there, particularly in Europe, how should we think about that in relation to the full-year guidance?
Is this kind of the slower ramp of bookings? Is it the compares? Are there any other factors or assumptions maybe you
could talk through?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah. I think it's both of those and just how the consulting will continue to ramp up and bleed
through during the year.
<Q - George A. Price>: Okay. And I know that you talked about returning capital to shareholders, we'll get more at the
analyst day. I don't know if you can maybe say anymore at this point perhaps qualitatively relative to fiscal 2012?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: What do you mean by qualitatively?
<Q - George A. Price>: Just, you know, do you anticipate returning more to shareholders in 2013 than 2012?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, I will give you more details on it, but I think you could expect it to be more and be
consistent.
<Q - George A. Price>: Okay. And, would Accenture ever consider levering the balance sheet at all, doing maybe
more sizable share repurchase or special dividend, anything like that? I know that certainly has not been the thinking of
the company thus far, but, we certainly, with the debt markets the way they are, I have certainly seen more of that. Just
curious of your thoughts on that, thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah. I mean, I'm personally not a big fan of that because I think we will always look for
ways to put our capital to work. It will be part of our program, of course. We've raised the dividend 20% which you
heard about today. We expect we will do approximately a 2% reduction in the shares outstanding. I mentioned that
we're doing the discretionary payment for the benefit plan and of course, we have an acquisition pipeline. So, these are
the things that we think are driving growth in our business and value to shareholders and we're focused on those.
<Q - George A. Price>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.

Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifle Nicolaus.
<Q - David Grossman>: Thanks very much. Pam, I'm wondering if I could just quickly follow up on the bookings
conversion question. That's something that you guys have been pretty consistently talking about all year and I was just
curious, do you view that as something as a cyclical outcome, or is this something that perhaps, you know, reflects
something more secular?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I think it reflects some shifting demand patterns in consulting which ultimately I think are
good in the sense of sort of this larger, more durable, more value-driven kinds of consulting bookings and I think it
bodes well for the medium term. So I think that's most of it. I don't know whether that's cyclical or secular or what, but
that is a demand pattern that we do see and that we view as very, very positive for us.
<Q - David Grossman>: And is that something that's pretty consistent through each of the verticals?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: It's different in some ways through the verticals and also around the world. I mean, it does
depend on – and sometimes client by client, just depending on what their needs are, how much transformation they
need to do, and then in other places, in some of the emerging markets, it's all about building scale for the first time. It
really does differ, but it's a theme that we do see really moving through the business at this time.
<Q - David Grossman>: Thank you for that. And, then, just one question. Typically in the 10-K, you disclose the

<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Mr. Baltimore, yep.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Anyway, we've been picking up some static and noise that several countries are becoming
more, you know, protectionist in nature, sort of buy local, India being one of them. I was wondering if that was
becoming an issue for you. It seems like I have seen more local companies winning large awards lately and less wins
for Accenture and IBM.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: We are extraordinarily local. We are French in France. We are American in the U.S. I think
we have quite a unique combination of being global by nature and we are leveraging the scale of Accenture in terms of
balance sheet, in terms of brand, in terms of finance, in terms of capability, but when it comes to delivering to our
clients, we are extraordinarily local operating in more than 120 countries around the world and we're operating in those
countries with local leaders, totally rooted in their business community, very close to our clients and that's the way
we've been operating for a long time and I think this is, indeed, pretty probably unique to our organization this
combination.

As you know, we do not have any headquarters. Physically, we are all operating in our different countries. I'm
operating from Paris when I'm in Paris. Here we are in New York, so that would be my answer.
Now do I really see a trend that clients will turn to more local providers? I don't really see that and definitely not for
our clients, the global companies. Maybe that's something that might happen in other market segments, but if you take
the market segment of the G2000, those companies are global by nature and they are turning to global providers who
could deliver local countries.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: And notably, our revenues in India were up quite nicely, as I believe Pierre pointed out.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Great. My other question is around sort of the real new tech spending, investing in sort of
cutting-edge stuff. Outside of retail, which really needs to do that, are you seeing – what sort of pace are you seeing
relative to say a year ago as far as the commitment to sort of reach out with some of these new technologies or are the
transformation deals you're doing sort of more traditional Accenture work?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I think what's interesting is, first, those new technologies, I mean, combining the mobile,
cloud, analytics, socials are growing even faster [indiscernible] (57:26) than we expected and we're very pleased with
that. That's why I was extremely pleased to report our progress we are making in those new technologies and the fact
that now we are operating at scale.
The second point, which I found very telling is, if you take what you are calling more traditional deals, now all those
deals, and whether they're with BPO or BAO, we'll have a part of those deals in form of analytics and this is exactly the
two illustrations that I mentioned with both Oi and BP. You have different components of the traditional solutions, if
you will, together with elements such as advanced analytics to drive more rapidly to more tangible results and more
value.
So this is a combination which is now very interesting and the fact that we can provide what you are calling the
traditional services together with infusing those new tech in those deals is, again, I think differentiating us from the
competition.

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, [indiscernible] (59:05) on Europe as long as – anyone could understand what's
happening in Europe.
First, we are growing in Europe. You see our results in Q4, but as well in all the areas. I think the other things I'm fairly
pleased with if you take our Q4, we've been growing in most of the large countries in Europe. I'm thinking about the
UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain so when you look at this we in Accenture are growing in those countries.
From a trend standpoint, very pleased with our performance in terms of outsourcing. As you know, most of the
European companies are facing large restructurings and outsourcing is a good way for them to drive that
transformation. Of course, we're watching more carefully what's happening in the consulting standpoint but overall I'm

pleased with where we are in Europe, especially considering the challenges facing by that part of the world.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: Are there any markets that are dragging in particular that you'd highlight?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: You know interestingly not really. The ones that showed declines are really small countries.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - KC McClure>: Doug, we have time for one more question then Pierre will wrap up the call.
Operator
Very well. We will go then to the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Hi. Just one question, two parts. First, on the decision-making side, any change at the small
consultant contract level? And then I have just one more.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah. As I mentioned, Joe, the – we do see a little less of that kind of stuff. So maybe some of
those are getting deferred in different parts of the world and it does differ by part of the world. For example, we see
more of that in Europe and shoot for the second.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Okay, and you haven't seen any change in that or any changes because of the election or
anything like that?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: In the U.S., not really, no.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Okay, and then the last one for me, you talked about CMT turning around, I think, in the
second half of next year. Maybe you could talk about what causes that turnaround? Thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, again, I think we did see, as I mentioned, we had declines in consulting in CMT and
there's a lot of transformation going on in traditional communications companies and so we're working closely with
them and that's leading to a lot of outsourcing work. Based on some of the work that's been booked, CMT did have
record bookings in Q4 and just sort of the business shaping up, we do see it coming back. We see some, you know,
interesting system integration work coming back, particularly as it relates to some of these tech trends and so this is
how we see it that CMT will return to growth during fiscal 2013.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thanks, Joe.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thanks, again, for joining us on today's call.
As we enter fiscal year 2013, I feel confident in the ability of Accenture to continue to drive profitable growth and
deliver our business outlook for the year. Our long and enduring relationship with the world's leading companies
together with our global scale and highly diversified portfolio of business position us very well to win in the
marketplace and continue to gain market share.
And, of course, key to our success are the skills and capabilities of the 257,000 Accenture men and women around the
world who are focused on running our business with rigor and discipline and I want to thank each and every one of
them for delivering great business outcomes for our clients every day.

forward to talking with you again next quarter and also to seeing many of you in person at our investor and analyst
conference in New York on October 11th. In the meantime, if you have questions, feel free to call KC. All the best.
Talk to you soon.
