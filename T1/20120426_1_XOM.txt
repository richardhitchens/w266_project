MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Today's
call is being recorded.
At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and
Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal
Good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is
ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2012. I will refer to the slides that are available
through the Investors section of our website.
But before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on slide
two.
Moving to slide three, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic
growth slowed in the first quarter, primarily due to continued contraction in the European Union. The U.S. and
Japanese economies are also expected to show declines from fourth quarter levels.
China growth, while still robust, was also lower in the first quarter.
Energy markets were mixed in the first quarter, with higher crude oil and non-U.S. natural gas prices. Industry refining
margins also improved from the fourth quarter. While U.S. chemical margins remained strong, Europe and Asia

continued at near bottom of cycle conditions.
Turning now to the first quarter financial results, as shown on slide four, ExxonMobil's first quarter 2012 earnings
excluding special items were $9.5 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion from the first quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate
for the quarter was 49%. Earnings per share for the quarter excluding special items were $2.00, down $0.14 from a year
ago.
The corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share
purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Through the end of
the first quarter 2012, we had repurchased the number shares issued for XTO, and total shares outstanding are now
lower than they were prior to the acquisition.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share, a 21% increase from the last quarter.
Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the second quarter of 2012, unchanged
from last quarter.
CapEx in the first quarter was $8.8 billion, up 13% from the first quarter of 2011. Across our diverse portfolio, we
continue to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas,
and finished products while supporting economic growth, including job creation.
Our cash generation remained strong, with $21.8 million in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the
first quarter of 2012, cash totaled $19.1 billion and debt was $15.7 billion. The next slide provides additional detail on
first quarter sources and uses of funds.
Over the quarter, cash increased from $13.1 billion to $19.1 billion, including cash on deposit associated with asset
sales which have not yet closed and therefore are not yet reflected in earnings. The combined impact of strong earnings,
depreciation expense, lower working capital, and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $21.8
billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property, and equipment, or
PP&E, of $7.8 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.2 billion. Additional financing and investing activities
decreased our cash by $0.8 billion.
Moving on to slide six and the review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's first quarter 2012 earnings of $9.5
billion decreased $1.2 billion or 11% from the first quarter of 2011. upstream earnings decreased $873 million, while
downstream earnings improved by $487 million. Chemical earnings were down $815 million. Corporate and financing
expenses were flat. Corporate and financing expenses remain within our continued guidance of $500 million to $700
million per quarter.
As shown on slide seven, ExxonMobil's first quarter 2012 earnings were essentially flat compared with the fourth
quarter of 2011.
Moving next to the first quarter business highlights, beginning on slide eight, we continue to advance our global
portfolio of high quality projects. The Kearl Initial Development project is now 90% complete and is on schedule to
start up later this year, with initial gross production of approximately 110,000 barrels per day. The initial fleet of haul
trucks and shovels are onsite and assembled, and all pipelines are mechanically complete.
In Angola, the Kizomba Satellites project remains on schedule for a mid-2012 startup, with peak capacity of 100,000
gross barrels of oil per day. The development design will optimize the capabilities of existing facilities, allowing for
increased production levels without the investment in an additional floating production, storage, and offloading [FPSO]
vessel. Onshore fabrication is complete while FPSO modifications and subsea pipeline installation are expected to
finish in the second quarter.
In Nigeria, we completed construction of three wellhead platforms as part of the Nigeria Satellites project. The
structures are currently being moved to the field site for installation. These are the first offshore platform structures to
be fully constructed in Nigeria. The project is on schedule to start up in late 2012, with peak capacity of 70,000 gross
barrels per day.

Also in Nigeria, the Usan deepwater development achieved first oil in February and has a production capacity of
180,000 gross barrels per day.
In Russia, construction is complete on the Arkutun-Dagi gravity-based structure, with float-out scheduled for later this
year. The project remains on schedule for startup in 2014.
In March, ExxonMobil along with our partners finalized the Settlement Agreement with the State of Alaska regarding
the Point Thomson unit, which enables the progression of the initial development phase of the Point Thomson project.
The Settlement Agreement sets out the near-term development plan for the Point Thomson field. The initial production
system will include processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and 10,000 barrels of
condensate per day. Detailed engineering and purchasing of long-lead equipment is currently underway. Pending
approval of the draft environmental impact statement and other required permits, startup of the initial phase of Point
Thomson is anticipated in the first quarter of 2016. Alaska's North Slope holds more than 35 trillion feet of discovered
natural gas, and Point Thomson is a key component to the development of this resource.
Turning now to slide nine, we continue to make progress on our strategic cooperation with Rosneft. Earlier this month,
Rosneft and ExxonMobil signed a series of agreements to implement the long-term Strategic Cooperation Agreement
that our companies announced last August. The execution of these foundation agreements for our joint venture with
Rosneft establishes the key terms for our cooperative exploration and development of the Kara Sea and the Black Sea.
President-elect Putin also recently announced fiscal terms to encourage offshore development in Russia. These
improved terms eliminate the export tax and lower the mineral extraction tax. The fiscal terms will be fixed at 15 years
for the Kara Sea and 10 years for the Black Sea deepwater.
In addition, we commenced joint exploration activities in the Black Sea, where seismic acquisition is now nearing
completion. We are also planning for seismic acquisition in the Kara Sea for later this year. We expect to begin
exploration drilling in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe as soon as prospect mapping is complete and a rig is contracted.
Additionally, Rosneft will take equity and promising exploration and development projects in the United States and
Canada, including the La Escalera Ranch project in the Delaware Basin in West Texas and equity in the Harmattan
acreage in the Cardium play of the Western Canada Basin in Alberta. Rosneft also has the opportunity to acquire a 30%
interest in 20 blocks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Rosneft and ExxonMobil will jointly study tight oil
production technologies in Western Siberia.
Turning now to deepwater exploration on slide 10, ExxonMobil maintains a diverse and robust global deepwater
portfolio, which supports an active drilling program aimed at testing new play concepts, exploiting opportunities in
proven basins, and drilling near-field wildcats. For example, in Romania we drilled a successful deepwater play test on
the Neptune block in the Black Sea with the Deepwater Champion drillship. Following this encouraging play test, we
are planning additional 3D seismic data acquisition to support future drilling opportunities on the block.
We also participated in an exploration well offshore Tanzania in the first quarter, which discovered approximately 5
Tcf of recoverable gas in a high quality reservoir. A second exploration well is planned for second quarter 2012 to test
another prospect on the block. We also maintain an active global unconventional exploration drilling program, as
discussed on slide 11.
In North America, we hold a material position in multiple unconventional plays across 8 million acres, and we continue
to increase our lease holdings in emerging liquids-rich plays like the Woodford Ardmore. Our acreage position in the
Woodford Ardmore play tripled in 2011 to more than 170,000 acres, with acquisition costs on a per-acre basis roughly
50% below major industry acquisitions in the Eagle Ford play.
In the first quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase an additional 58,000 acres through strategic acquisition,
which will increase our total acreage position to more than 230,000 acres. This will further expand our position in a
play where we already hold 170,000 net acres, with an estimated potential to recover 600 million oil equivalent barrels
at an attractive unit development cost of approximately $10 per barrel. We continue to focus drilling activity to
maximize the development of this liquids-rich play with ten operated rigs. Current drilling is focused on delineating the
acreage as well as determining optimal well spacing and drilling and completion practices.

We also hold a large heritage position in tight oil plays in Western Canada, including the Cardium and Viking plays.
We are actively drilling in the Cardium, and achieved first oil production in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are
currently drilling in the Viking and have additional drilling planned this year to further delineate this tight oil resource.
Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 12, upstream earnings in the first
quarter were $7.8 billion, down $873 million from the first quarter of 2011. Stronger crude oil and non-U.S. natural gas
realizations increased earnings by approximately $1.3 billion, as crude oil realizations increased by more than $13 a
barrel and non-U.S. average gas realizations increased $1.27 per thousand cubic feet. However, the positive effects
resulting from the increase in realizations were mitigated by a higher effective tax rate. A decrease in U.S. natural gas
realizations of $1.25 per thousand cubic feet also negatively impacted earnings by more than $300 million.
Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $850 million, due mainly to the impact of lower entitlement
volumes in West Africa, base decline, and divestments, partly offset by the ramp up of Angola and Iraq projects.
Earnings were also negatively impacted by the unfavorable timing of liftings, as we were under-lifted in higher margin
areas such as the North Sea and West Africa. All other items, primarily the absence of gains from asset divestments
combined with higher exploration and operating expenses, decreased earnings by $1 billion.
upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the first quarter of 2012 were $18.83, reflecting the unfavorable mix impacts
and higher effective tax rate.
Moving to slide 13, oil equivalent volumes decreased by more than 5% from the first quarter of last year, mainly due to
the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, decline, and divestments. Volumes were positively impacted
by the ramp up of projects in Angola and Iraq and less downtime. Excluding the impact of higher prices on entitlement
volumes, OPEC quota effects, and divestments, production was down about 1%.
Turning now to slide 14, first quarter operational performance was consistent with plans, including the successful
startup of the Nigeria Usan development. Additional projects startups expected in the second half of the year, including
Angola Satellites, Nigeria Satellites, and the Kearl Initial
Development Project, are key to achieving our 2012 volumes outlook. Although seasonal factors, including demand
and the timing of planned maintenance activities, will impact volume profiles during the year, we expect full-year
volume performance to be consistent with our March outlook.
Turning out of the sequential comparison starting on slide 15, upstream earnings decreased by $1 billion versus the
fourth quarter of 2011. Stronger crude oil realizations and non-U.S. natural gas realizations positively impacted
earnings by more than $300 million, as crude oil realizations increased by more than $7 per barrel and non-U.S.
average gas realizations increased $0.26 per thousand cubic feet. However, the positive effects resulting from the
increase in realizations were mitigated by a higher effective tax rate. A decrease in U.S. natural gas realizations of
$0.70 per thousand cubic feet also negatively impacted earnings by $170 million.
Production and mix effects, mainly higher natural gas volumes from stronger seasonal demand in Europe, increased
earnings by $100 million. Earnings were negatively impacted, however, by the unfavorable timings of liftings as we
were under-lifted in higher margin West Africa. Other items, primarily the absence of gains from asset divestments,
decreased earnings by more than $1.2 billion.
Moving to slide 16, oil equivalent volumes were up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2011, as the impact of lower
entitlement volumes in West Africa and divestments were more than offset by stronger seasonal gas demand in Europe.
Excluding the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects, and divestments, production was
up almost 3%. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement.
Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 17, downstream earnings in the
first quarter were $1.6 billion, up $487 million from the first quarter of 2011. Margin effects decreased earnings by $40
million. Continued benefits from our refining optimization activities contributed to the positive $210 million in volume
and mix effects. Other factors, primarily higher gains on asset sales, increased earnings by $320 million.

Moving to slide 18, sequentially, first quarter downstream earnings increased by $1.2 billion. Improved industry
refining margins contributed increased earnings of $840 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $70
million. Other factors increased earnings by $390 million, largely due to higher gains on asset sales and favorable
foreign exchange effects.
Turning now the chemical financial and operating results and starting on slide 19, first quarter chemical earnings were
$701 million, a decrease of $815 million versus the first quarter of 2011. Lower margins decreased earnings by $520
million, especially in Asia-Pacific and Europe, while volumes and mix effects were flat. Other factors decreased
earnings by $300 million, reflecting higher planned maintenance expense and the absence of favorable tax items.
Moving to slide 20, sequentially, first quarter chemical earnings increased by $158 million, driven by stronger demand
for specialty products. Margin effects increased earnings by $50 million. Volume and mix increased earnings by $60
million, while all other items increased earnings a total of $50 million. While the first quarter continued to show
cyclical weakness in Europe and Asia margins, ExxonMobil continues to leverage feed advantage, integration, cost
discipline, and premium product offerings to strongly position us throughout the chemical business cycle.
Moving to slide 21, ExxonMobil's first quarter financial and operating performance was strong and reflects the ability
of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong results. As we continue to focus on operational
excellence, deploy high-impact technologies, and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains
well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.
That concludes my prepared remarks this morning. I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you Mr. Rosenthal. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug. How are you?
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: I'm doing fine. My question is on the big increase in the dividend. And specifically, at the
analyst meeting, Rex seemed pretty clear that a more balanced approach to distributions might be forthcoming. But on
this point, the size of the increase represents a very marked departure from the 6% to 7% annualized growth rate you
guys have provided over five, ten, and I think even fifteen years. So my question is whether or not you could provide
some color on this change, and specifically how we should consider it in the context of overall dividend policy at
ExxonMobil.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Doug, that's an excellent question given our announcement yesterday. Let me start with
your last comment and move backwards from there.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We've really had no change in our dividend policy. The policy remains the same, as does
our total allocation of cash generated by the business. We do have a continued trend in dividend increases, as we have
said before. If you go back over our long history of the company, we have in other quarters had fairly significant
dividend increases; so again, no change in policy. But as we said at the analyst meeting, we are always evaluating the
dividend policy and our cash distributions and studying how things are going. And the Board decided yesterday to
make the increase they did. But you also notice that our share repurchases remained at the $5 billion level that you saw
across last year.
So I would say the strategy remains the same, invest in that very robust investment program we have. And you saw our
first quarter CapEx, very strong as those projects proceed. Have a continuously growing dividend, and then take the

balance of the cash and buy shares. And that policy and strategy I think continues on.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay, great. Let me just ask you one more question. There have been a lot of cross-currents
about the position in Iraq, and specifically Exxon's current license, the strategy in Kurdistan, and eligibility and/or
interest on the upcoming licensing round. And so could you provide an update on that position which covers these
items to the degree possible, David?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I really can't comment a lot on that other than to say the contracts that we have in place –
and it's our intent to honor and fulfill those contractual obligations. I will note, in the South we reached another
milestone at West Qurna, where production has reached right at 400,000 barrels a day. And we're very pleased how that
effort is coming along and the progress we're making there. We continue to develop the field and do the things that we
committed to do, and so progress continues. But other than that, I really wouldn't have any further comments.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay, David. Thanks a lot.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.
Operator
And now we'll hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug. How are you?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Not too bad. I have a couple also, if I may. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about the
higher E&P tax rate. I'm wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color as to why that was, if it was just mix
effects and what the driver was. And in the context of the same issue, you also mentioned under-lifts in the
international portfolio. It's unusual for you to mention that, I guess, to the extent that it was material. Could you
quantify that for us, either absolute or on a per-barrel basis? Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. I'd be happy to answer both of those, Doug. First of all, let's start with the tax rate.
You got the right word when you said mix. We have – and it's a number of mix effects that we saw across the first
quarter. One of those that goes unmentioned is really the difference in a lot of the crude prices around the world. People
tend to focus in on Brent and WTI, but there was a lot of variability. For example, the Middle East crudes tended to do
better than those markers. Some of the Canadian crudes, particularly the heavier crudes, tended to do less. You also
have different fiscal regimes in each of these countries. And frankly, we saw some of the highest realization increases
in countries with higher tax rates and some of the lower than average increases or even decreases in countries with
lower tax rates. So that mix there and then the corresponding mix of where your earnings were generated that uptick in
this quarter on the tax rate.
When we talk about the under-lifts, they were a factor this quarter, so maybe I'll go ahead and give some specifics here.
In the first quarter of 2012 on an absolute basis, we were under-lifted about 45,000 barrels a day. Last year in the first
quarter, we were actually over-lifted by about 18,000 barrels a day. So the delta quarter on quarter was about 63,000
barrels a day. All of that under-lift was in either West Africa or the North Sea, which tend to be some of our higher
margin areas.
The impact was actually quarter on quarter a little bit bigger sequentially, and so let me provide those numbers to you.
Again, on an absolute basis, we were 45,000 barrels a day under-lifted in the first quarter. As I mentioned, last quarter
we were actually over-lifted about 37,000 barrels a day. You might recall, across last year we talked about quarter to
quarter we were a little under-lifted and we made a bunch of that up at the end of the year. So if you take the 45,000
barrels we were under-lifted in the first quarter and the 37,000 barrels we were over-lifted in the fourth quarter,
sequentially we were down about 82,000 barrels a day. And again, all of that was in West Africa. So it's a bit unusual
that you have that level of a lifting timing effect, but it did occur in the first quarter. And as you would guess doing the
math, it did have an impact on our reported earnings.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: David, would you be able to quantify the net income impact, or is that not something you want
to get into?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have the net income effect on that. But again, as I mentioned, those are some of our
higher margin barrels. And you can probably use your own estimates and come up with a number, but I don't have one
for you today.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: We'll figure it out. Thanks a lot, David. I appreciate it.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thanks, Doug.
Operator
Moving on, we'll go to Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
<Q - Robert Arthur Kessler>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Robert.
<Q - Robert Arthur Kessler>: Congratulations again on the Rosneft exploration JV. I wanted to go back to that for a
minute. Your recent presentation and that of Rosneft highlighted or focused extensively on the oil prospectivity of the
Kara Sea. What about gas? By that, I mean estimates from the USGS and others place more discoverable gas potential
in the area than oil. To the extent that you discover natural gas, do the agreements contemplate and does the fiscal
structure allow for economic development of the gas?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: That's an excellent question, and I'm glad you highlighted to begin with the progress we
made because we really have made substantial progress, I think, in the meeting we had last week. The term 'historic'
was actually used. And so we're very pleased, as are our partners in Rosneft, with the progress that we've made.
I know there are a number of estimates out there in terms of the prospectivity in the Kara Sea. I think I've seen some
different ones. The one you've mentioned, I think WoodMac [Wood Mackenzie] has some numbers out there. Clearly,
there's oil and gas potential out there. I don't think we know yet how to assess that, and really that process is just getting
underway. But again, as we said at the meeting, we are highly encouraged by the prospectivity on the oil side because
of the extension of the prolific West Siberia basin plays that are already in existence and are already producing, so
that's what lends that.
Looking forward, it's really premature to start discussing the contract details or arrangements or fiscal terms and that
sort of stuff in detail. I would just point out again for those on the call that aren't as familiar, our position in the Kara
Sea is equivalent in size to basically the North Sea and all of the leased acreage in the Gulf of Mexico. So again, a huge
area of land, over 30 million acres, highly prospective, but again, under some rather harsh conditions, a challenging
environment to work in, and will require all of the technological and operational capabilities of the two partners to
explore that resource; and should it be successful, to then exploit those resources and move forward with development
and production. We have a lot of experience in the Arctic, even in Russia. And again, if you just look at the parameters
and the vectors, we're encouraged by the progress. We're certainly excited and looking forward to the joint venture, as
are our partners; and in particular as I mentioned, getting the seismic activity underway and preparing to drill our first
wells here in the next two to three years.
<Q - Robert Arthur Kessler>: Thanks, David. The scenario that was presented in terms of potential FID [Final
Investment Decision] date and potential first production, both those were presuming this was an oil discovery that
would be made. Is that right?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I think that's generally correct. Again though, I would just caution on looking forward.
There's a lot of work to do, a lot of effort to be done here. And so I don't want to really start getting into specifics about
FID dates and production and that sort of thing other than to say the schedule that we have in front of us, which is

really getting that seismic underway this year, developing that drillable prospect inventory, siting that first well, and
getting that well done in what industry perspective-wise would be a fairly short timeframe. So again, we're going after
it aggressively, but this is true frontier exploration. And we'll certainly be disciplined and diligent in our approach. And
again, it is early days, so I think we'll focus a little more on the prospectivity and potential and a little less on what
some of those specific dates might be in the outer years.
<Q - Robert Arthur Kessler>: Understood, thanks very much.

And Morgan Stanley's Evan Calio has our next questions.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Good morning, David. How are you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Evan. How are you?
<Q - Evan Calio>: Here it's afternoon, it's flying by here; a question on Kearl. I appreciate your comments and
progress update. I know you guys have secured a transportation solution. But can you provide more color on planned
route to market so we can better understand potential relative realizations versus waterborne crudes? I know you had
mentioned earlier they were quite lower than others.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, if we're thinking about the initial phase, the first phase that's coming on this year, I
can tell you we already have placement for that first page – first phase. I'm sorry, so it's not an issue. We have multiple
options within our own refining circuit to begin with as well as some other options. But basically, we're looking to
place those first barrels with existing infrastructure and routes. And again, the bulk of that will likely find its way
within our own system, but we have some other options. I think what's important to know is that we can start up Kearl,
take it up to its full initial production of 110,000 barrels a day without any concerns over logistical constraints.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay, good. And secondly on Argentina, have your plans, pace of activity, or thoughts changed at
all in Argentina following the YPF nationalization? I know you have almost a 900,000-acre position. I'm curious to see
how you're thinking or accounting for any potential investment risk there.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Let me start out by saying that our position, ExxonMobil, and our activity down there
has not been affected by some of the recent activities that you mentioned that have occurred down there. Our activity,
our exploration activity is continuing. In fact, I can tell you in the first quarter we did complete our first two wells and
get those down. We're in the process here in the second quarter of fracking those wells, and we'll be testing them in the
second quarter. So those plans continue and the objectives are being met. As you mentioned, we have a very large
acreage position there. We're encouraged by the early results that we're seeing down there and look forward to
profitably moving on with that venture.
Having said that, of course, we are monitoring events that are occurring down there and what's happening, and we'll
take all of that into consideration. But as we sit here today, we're meeting the objectives we set for the year, and our
plans are continuing. And again, we have a very long, successful history in Argentina, and going forward got a great set
of acreage down there. And again, we continue to work on that per our plan coming into the year.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Have you had contact with the government and have some confirmation, or is there any update on
dialogue going there of your importance to the development of that resource?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have anything specific to identify. Obviously, in any country where we have a lot of
activity going on and investments, we're always in contact and dialogue with the appropriate government agencies as
well as our partners. So I wouldn't look for anything specific out of any meetings or contacts. Those are ongoing just as
they always have been, but wouldn't have any specifics to offer other than normal conversations that go on as we
continue to really look at what we have down there and put together our plans and move forward.

And now we'll hear from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Thank you, David, a couple of questions regarding North American gas potential.
ExxonMobil has a successful and large global petrochemicals business, global LNG business. The petrochemicals has
focused on Asia and some of the Middle East growth. Can you comment on whether you see your now large domestic
gas position as creating opportunities on both the export of LNG from the U.S. or potentially Western Canada and/or
coming back to the U.S. in terms of some of the petrochemical expansions, which you guys have otherwise focused on
in the rest of the world? Do you see that as more of an opportunity going forward for you and/or how do you plan to
take advantage of that? Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Arjun, that's a good question. And of course, behind that it all starts with some of the
obvious competitive advantages that we have across the entire space that you covered, our large, prolific gas acreage
that we have in the U.S., the advantages we have certainly and have already demonstrated and you're seeing in our U.S.
based chemical business and, of course, our global position in LNG. So given that competitive advantage background, I
don't think it will come as any surprise to you that we're studying and assessing the very opportunities that you referred
to.
I don't have any specifics to offer you, again, other than to say we do have some advantages from all the way through
the integration of resources into products. And as we're always doing, we're thinking about how to optimally develop
those, take advantage of the acreage position we have, the resource potential we have, the technology, the marketing
advantages, et cetera, to again on an integrated basis exploit those resources. So any ideas you have and are thinking
about and the things you read others are doing, you can rest assured we've got folks looking at that and studying that as
well.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: And maybe just a related question. Can you talk about any update on your activities in
the Marcellus and Utica as well as the Bakken in terms of maybe how the rig counts are trending and what you're
expected to do here over the rest of this year? Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. I'd be happy to. Let me start with the Bakken and back up a little bit because that is
an area where we have been over the last many months increasing rigs, and we have continued to increase our rigs.
We've now got eight operated rigs running in the Bakken, and that is progressing very well, and we are encouraged by
that. In the Marcellus, we've got five rigs operating. Actually, we've got four rigs operating. And as you know, we've
got just under 700,000 acres in the Marcellus and another 87,000 in the Utica. And so we continue to progress there.
But I can tell you overall, when you're looking at our rig count and what we're doing, I think it's important to step back
and think about what we're doing overall. You might recall across most of last year or so, we tended to have I recall 70
– 72 rigs running. In total, we've got about 64 on average in the first quarter. We're running 61 rigs today. And we have
continued to shift those to the liquids-rich plays that I mentioned, really focusing on the Bakken, the Permian, the
Ardmore that I mentioned there. We're looking at and getting ready to plant some wells, get some wells down in the
Utica. So all of that's going well, and again, continuing to acquire liquids-rich acreage at attractive prices and shift our
rig fleet over to those areas while minimizing the incremental exposure to dry gas wells.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: That's great. Thank you so much.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.

And now will hear from Iain Reid with Jefferies.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Hi, David. Good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, Iain. Good morning.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Can I come back on the production in Africa? You talked about the under-lift. But if you add that
back, you've still got a very substantial fall from the first quarter of last year in your African production. I think you
said PSC effects. You've been through some threshold effects. Is that right to say that the 50,000 – 60,000 barrel a day
decline ex the under-lifts is due to threshold effects, profit all or cost all?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let me come at it a different way, and remember the production that we list is the
production and the under-lift is really just the sales. So if you come back to just the Africa production decline that you
saw in the supplement between the first quarter of last year and the first quarter this year, the bulk of that is accounted
for by the entitlement effects that I mentioned, mostly the price and spend but a little on the net interest side.
Everything else washed out.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay, so this is production, not liftings?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, what we show you – thank you. Let me clarify that. What we show you in the
supplement, that's a production number. We had some project ramp up that I mentioned, and we also had some better
downtime performance, I'm pleased to say. And then that was basically offset mostly by declines. So the impact you're
seeing there really is the impact of higher prices on our entitlement volumes.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Are we talking about Angola mainly here? And is it possible to say which fields, Blocks 15 or 17?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: A lot of it is Angola, but it's also Nigeria and some other places. And then, of course, our
large producing operations there are Blocks 15 and 17.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. I'm just thinking more generally about second quarter production. You've got some
maintenance I believe in Angola coming up, maybe a little bit of field ramp up at Usan and Pazflor. Are we looking
generally around the same level of production in the second quarter as we saw in the first quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I really don't have any guidance to give you on second quarter production, no real specific
events. We do see that the projects continuing to ramp up a bit, but I really don't have a real forward outlook for you.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. Can I just ask one more?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: You mentioned a couple times asset sales affecting earnings, and yet there's nothing in the special
items here. Is it possible you could tell us with the absolute asset sales was in the first quarter relative to the first quarter
of last year, in terms of the impact on earnings?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you're looking across the total corporation, as we mentioned in the press release, the
absolute earnings associated with asset sales in the first quarter of 2012 was about $400 million, and that was generally
all in the downstream. If you look compared to the first quarter of 2011, the number was about the same, about $500
million. But there the bulk of that was in the upstream, so you had a switch there. The key variance that you see in our
sequential earnings as we go from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, the total earnings from
asset sales in the fourth quarter last year were about $1.4 billion, about $1.1 billion of that in the upstream and about
$300 million of that in the downstream. The big sequential impact you see is in the upstream, and that's really the
absence of that significant investment that we had last quarter.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay, thanks very much.

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let me just mention just to be clear. In the downstream, the asset sales that we had in the
first quarter related to the previously announced divestments in Malaysia and Central America. We have not booked
anything in Japan, as we mentioned last quarter. That will be later in the year.

Now we'll open the floor up to Paul Cheng with Barclays.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hi, Dave. Good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Paul, how are you today?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Very good. If I could, I was looking at your cash flow statement. On the working capital and
other is a positive swing of $6 billion. That seems to be a big number, even for the size of Exxon. Is that related to
timing of taxes payment or anything like that? Or maybe my question is should we assume that that is here to stay, or
that at some point in the later year it's going to get reversed?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let me answer that one first, Paul, and then I'll let you go to the second question. That's
actually very straightforward. During the first quarter, we saw a big decrease in working capital, and that was literally
all due to higher payables. We had some other ins and outs. But the real net effect you're seeing there is a fairly decent
increase in our payables accounts.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Is that related to crude purchase?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, it's related primarily to crude purchases. And of course, that's price driven as you saw
the prices ramp up across the quarter, such as when you got the end of the quarter you had some pretty high prices. But
again, nothing really out of the ordinary if you look at the quarter and you look at what prices did, but I'm glad you
asked the question because that is the impact you're seeing there.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Great. In Woodford Ardmore, what is your current production? I know you normally don't want
to go down to too much granularity in terms of what is the well production run rate, that kind of thing. But can you also
tell us what is the split between say the back oil condensate NGLs and natural gas in that play, and if there's any rough
estimate on your 30-day IP that you've been seeing on those?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, Paul, I'll be consistent with your expectations and just say no. I'm not prepared to give
that level of detail today. I think what's important is not necessarily the actual production that we're generating there.
What's real important is the effort we have underway now to delineate that acreage, to analyze what we have, and really
put together that comprehensive long-term exploitation and development plan that we have, and that's what will deliver
the volumes and the rates and the earnings down the road. But as we sit here today, I think what's important, we're
adding acreage. It's very attractive acreage. If you had a jigsaw puzzle of that area, you'd see that the things we're
adding are plugging right in to adjacent properties that we already had. So the acreage position I mentioned isn't just an
acreage position. It's a mostly contiguous acreage position which, as you would guess, gives us really good
opportunities to optimize around the development.
So we are seeing nice increases in production as the wells are coming on stream, and we're encouraged by those results.
But our focus is less on what today's production is but getting the rigs down there. I think I mentioned we added two
more rigs this quarter to the Ardmore, so we've now got ten running and we're working on that area. And as the actual
production goes into sales later on, we'll be in a better position to give more information.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Dave, can I sneak in a quick question?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.

<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Poland, how many additional wells do you plan to drill this year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, if you take a look at our Polish position, I think I mentioned last quarter the wells that
we had drilled and how those turned out. I'll tell you that during the first quarter of this year, we did acquire a fourth 3D
seismic activity. The processing of that seismic is ongoing. And the analysis we get out of that compared with the
learnings we got from the wells that we drill will really give us an all-inclusive set of results that we can evaluate and
then plan our go-forward plan. But I've got to tell you; the go-forward plan is really dependent on the 3D seismic. And
again, the real geo-science evaluations and evaluations that we'll do are really going to drive our future plans, and those
just aren't set just yet.

And now we'll move on to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, Blake.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: I wanted to go back, if I could, on two issues that you covered previously, one being the
dividend and the second Russia. On the dividend, if I look historically, it's around this time of year that the Board
basically sets the policy for the year. Is it fair to think that the dividend will remain at this level for the balance of the
year, or do you think that we have an opportunity to reevaluate and potentially increase further in a later quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Blake, that's a good question, but I really don't have a comment or wouldn't want to try to
speculate or forecast what we might do going forward. I think again, we did raise the dividend yesterday by 21%. The
policy is unchanged if you look from a macro perspective, but I really wouldn't want to try to speculate or forecast
anything on a go-forward basis.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Fair enough. The question on Russia, I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about how
you arrived at the North American assets to contribute to the JV. When you look at Exxon's portfolio in the U.S.,
obviously you've got quite a few options. I'm just curious on the Cardium and Delaware. Was it just similar geologic
characteristics, or was it more financially motivated? Any color you could give would be appreciated.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, I'd be happy to provide a little more color on that. If you look at the assets that we're
talking about in terms of what our partners would get here in the U.S., it's actually a variety of a number of high-quality
assets. I mentioned the Cardium, a very attractive tight oil play for us where we've got wells going down and we're
drilling. We talked about West Texas and some of the unconventional oil plays we have going on there. And of course,
the ability for Rosneft to improve their understanding of the technology that's at work out there. And some of the
practices we have and that we're doing to optimize the development of that is important to them. And as I talked about,
as we learn about the unconventional resources together, what we have in Canada, what we have in the U.S., what they
have in Western Siberia, there will be a lot of learning out of that.
I also mentioned the Gulf of Mexico, where they're going to have an opportunity to farm into 20 blocks. And as you
know, we have been expanding our own activity in the Gulf of Mexico, have had some very nice success recently. So it
would certainly not be a surprise that those would be attractive acreage opportunities for them. So again, I think you
have to step back and look at this partnership just the way we described it. It's a strategic agreement for both parties. It
allows us to bring to the table, each of us, very high quality prospective resources, all of which rely on state-of-the-art
and forward-looking technology applications, and bring together the best of both companies and also in the interest of
both companies going forward. And we're talking about other opportunities elsewhere around the world. And so again I
keep coming back to the term Strategic Cooperation Agreement because that's really what it's all about, and you'll see

And now we'll hear from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Hey. Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. So strong cash flow, good returns, but I
guess there's still some criticism of Exxon's overall liquids position in North America and your shifting – lowering rig
count and shifting to some of the liquids plays you have. But can you give us some color on the ability for Exxon to
really move the needle in terms of acquiring acreage outside of the Woodford Ardmore, the Cardium, and Viking that
you're talking to?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, I think it would be fair to say, Ed, it's really both. We're obviously taking advantage
of opportunities, again to concentrate acreage where we already have a position, and those efforts are bearing fruit. And
of course, as you get bigger and more concentrated positions, you've got a real opportunity to better, again, the analysis
and exploitation of those resources.
Moving the needle, there are certainly opportunities, we believe, for that, however you define moving the needle. But
those are really going to come, again, with a very deliberate, disciplined, analytical approach to how we go about doing
this. I think as I mentioned last quarter, we're very fortunate to have the financial strength the company does and the
flexibility to be able to go after these things in a disciplined, diligent way without moving worrying about paying the
bills at the end of the month, and we continue to progress in that arena.
We are looking at a broad range of other opportunities that are out there. I can't give you the specifics yet because we're
still in the evaluation phase. But there are a number of those out there in North America, and frankly in other areas. But
I'd be remiss if I didn't also remind you of the success, recent success we've had with liquids in the Gulf of Mexico,
with the big discovery we had there last year. So when you look across North American liquids opportunities, it's not
just the unconventional oil potential, but it's also the potential that we have in our attractive acreage position in the Gulf
of Mexico. And then broader speaking, I think it's important, and you raised a good point when you see the decline in
our liquids production recently.
I'll just reiterate one of the comments that we made at the analyst meeting in March. If you look at the projects that are
going to start up between now and 2016, I think the number we quoted was about 80% of that production will be
liquids. So whether it's the Kearl project, whether it's the Africa projects, some of the other things we've got going on,
we have a strong portfolio of liquids projects in development. And also the pipeline of opportunities on the exploration
side is quite robust. So I think if you continue to look a little longer term, I think we're going to be in really good shape.
And we're looking forward, as I mentioned in my remarks, to getting the projects up that we have on the plate for this
year; and then in particular when you get in that 2014 to 2016 timeframe, bringing some of those big projects along as
well.

placing on the ground to get up to those contracted volumes that you guys have?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Faisel, help me out a little bit. In particular, infrastructure, what did you have in mind?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Pipelines and water injection facilities, stuff like that, processing facilities, I guess the basic
midstream and infrastructure designed to deliver that oil to market.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, it's a couple of things. If you're looking in the field in particular, of course, it's
important for us to get the flow lines in and do some of the debottlenecking that we can do and thus get some
production up that way. If you look broader at the infrastructure in terms of the common seawater project, some of the
lifting capabilities, in particular there was a major ramp up in the capability to take oil out of the country last quarter.
So there are a number of projects going on. Again, some are local and help get the production up, some are broader.
Those are progressing as well. I really don't have any specific comments in terms of timing of some of the other larger
infrastructure projects, but those are progressing as well.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, and then last question for me. On non-U.S. downstream in the quarter, if I strip out the
gains on asset sales, and also Imperial Oil reported a pretty nice number in refining as well. If I take that out, it looks
like outside of Canada and the asset sales that non-U.S. downstream reported fairly low earnings. Can you talk about
what's dragging those results this quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you're looking at the downstream earnings, you're really talking about quarter over
quarter. Is that your emphasis, first quarter 2012 versus first quarter 2011?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Yes, that's right.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We had a number of things. I think the one I'd probably note, if you look at the margin
impact that we showed slightly negative relative to some higher industry refining margins that you see quoted. We had
a number of price timing effects on our feed slates into the refineries that had a negative impact there and probably
would have given you a little impact there that you weren't expecting, nothing out of the ordinary. It was positive in the
first quarter of last year. We had the absence of that in the second quarter. So quarter on quarter you saw that. But I'll
tell you, ex-those effects, things came in just about as we expected.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.

Now we'll go to Allen Good with Morningstar.
<Q - Allen Good>: Good morning, David. If I caught you correctly, you said 87,000 acres in the Utica. That seems to
be up from the 75,000 you reported at the Analyst Day. I was just curious if you could confirm that. And then you
talked about the acreage adds in the Ardmore. Are there any other liquids-rich plays that are currently of interest Exxon
and you've been adding acreage in during the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes. Let me just confirm first of all the number I gave you of 87,000 is correct, and that is
up from the 75,000 that we mentioned at year end. We have been incrementally adding some attractive acreage there as
we've gone across the quarter.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay. And then as far as the discovery in Tanzania, I just wonder. Does that change Exxon's
outlook there in East Africa? And would there be any potential there for additional acreage adds or maybe farm-ins
with some already operators there in the region? Because it seems like it's a light portion of your portfolio currently.
And obviously the Tanzania discovery is a positive there. I just wonder. What's the outlook for Exxon in that region?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Let me first hit the overall that you mentioned. There have been a number of
discoveries announced by industry in that area over the last several months. We are very pleased to have the position
we have in the block that we farmed into. It was a very nice discovery. I think I mentioned about five Tcf of

recoverable gas, so that's very positive for us. We are very interested in appraising that prospect further and have some
plans in place to do that.
In terms of going forward and looking at other things, I wouldn't be any more specific other than to say we're always
looking for opportunities, for good opportunities. We were looking when we found this one and pleased to have it. So
without being specific or really any departure from past practice, we're always looking for good opportunities. This is
one. We're pleased to have it; probably get our next well underway here in the second quarter to further appraise that
prospect. And I'll tell you in terms of additional opportunities, there are a series of additional structures on the block we
have to take a look at and do some more work and appraise. So more to come from on that block with our partner,
Statoil; and again, we're both very encouraged with this, lots to do on that block, but always looking for additional
opportunities.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay, thanks for the commentary.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.

Argus Research, Philip Weiss has our next questions.
<Q - Philip H. Weiss>: Thank you and good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Phil. How are you?
<Q - Philip H. Weiss>: Good. How are you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: All right.
<Q - Philip H. Weiss>: Most of my questions have been answered. I just had one small one. On your profitability per
barrel, it was down relative to the movement in realizations. And I just wondered if that was a function of the under-lift,
or if there's something else going on there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: It's a number of the things I mentioned. Certainly, the under-lift would be a big component
because you have the reported production that you're dividing the earnings by, and then that's why I really wanted to
give you the detail on the under-lift. It's a big impact. Also, the tax rate impact I mentioned because of some of the mix
that we saw, of course, had an impact on calculated unit profitability. Other than that, in the quarter we did see a little
higher OpEx, including some exploration expense, higher that you would have seen in the supplement that we gave
you. But again, it's really the U.S. gas price on the North American side and then the mix that we saw overseas and
some of the other factors that were the real driver there.
<Q - Philip H. Weiss>: Okay, great. Thanks, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you. I believe we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay, and Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James has our last question.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: All right.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. Can you give an update on the status at PNG LNG? There
have been some press reports about local conflict with residents, and construction I believe was suspended for a period
of time.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, let me give you a progress update on how we're doing in the first quarter. We've done
some additional drilling and a number of other efforts associated with the project, everything from the civil works to

the work we're doing on the gas conditioning plant and just a number of progress items related to the pipelines, the
plant, and all of that. So that project is really progressing on schedule and we're very pleased with how things are going
there.
You have seen in the press some of the issues around unrest. It's one of the challenges we have with the project. Each
large project we seem to do around the world has its own unique set of challenges, so there's nothing out of the ordinary
here. We are managing that situation in conjunction with the local communities and with the government. And as you
would guess, there have here and there been some impact at the individual work sites where some of this activity has
occurred. But I can tell you if you step back and look across the whole project, and it is a complex project, we are on
schedule. We're progressing as planned, and there's no change to our outlook for a 2014 startup of that very attractive
project.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay. Can you just say if construction is currently ongoing at the LNG site?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Construction is ongoing, yes. We're continuing to progress all phases of the project.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay, very good.
