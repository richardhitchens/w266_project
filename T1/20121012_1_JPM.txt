MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference
Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the
presentation. Please stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial
Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go ahead.
Douglas L. Braunstein
Thanks, Operator, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which, as you
know, is available on our website, and if you refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back
of the presentation, I'll kick us off on page one. We generated record net income of $5.7 billion. That's on record EPS
of $1.40 per share for the quarter. That came on revenue of $25.9 billion, up 6% year-on-year, 13% quarter-on-quarter.
Our return on tangible common equity was 16% for the quarter, and in the back you'll see our return on Basel I
risk-weighted assets was 1.7% for the quarter.
We characterize the business across all of our lines of business as strong performance this quarter, and I want to
quickly highlight up front a few contributing factors we're going to talk about as we go through the presentation. First,
we really had positive franchise trends in market share that we've been talking about for several quarters as we continue
to invest in our businesses. We maintained our number-one rank in year-to-date global IB fees. We had record deposits

in CBB, record production revenue in the Mortgage Bank, sales volume of 11%, increase in Card, record revenue in the
Commercial Bank, record assets under custody in TSS.
Secondly, we saw positive year-over-year loan growth, although a modest decline quarter-on-quarter, and that is
despite the fact that we continue to experience the runoff from our various consumer portfolios we've talked about. On
a reported basis, total loans for the company were up 4% year-on-year, and if you look at core loan growth, excluding
the runoff portfolios, on a comparable basis to the presentation I did at the Investor Day, core loan growth was up 10%
year-on-year. We had record loan balances in the CB, up 15%; record Business Banking loan balances in CBB, up 8%;
record Asset Management loan balances of $75 billion.
Third theme you'll see is credit. We continue to see the same core trends in the past couple of quarters, consumer loan
losses still very high by historical standards, continue to improve in both our Real Estate Portfolios as well as Card, and
losses continue to remain very low in the Wholesale side.
And then the last theme is strong capital generation for the company. We ended the quarter with a Tier 1 common of
$135 billion, that's up $5 billion quarter-on-quarter; strong Basel I and Basel III ratios of 10.4% and 8.4%, respectively.
That estimate for Basel III of the 8.4% is post NPR, and it compares to the 7.9% we reported last quarter. I would also
note we continue to work with the regulators on the implementation of the Basel 2.5 rules that were recently
announced, and that's going to allow us to continue to refine our estimates as we go forward.
Finally, you see, as we always do, put a number of significant items up front here for the quarter. I'm going to discuss
these where relevant in the financials, but I also do want to remind you that, in addition to these larger items, there are
always positives and negatives that run through the P&L. So, for example, we didn't highlight the $200 million
negative of DVA because it wasn't significant enough for us to highlight up front, despite the fact that I just did.
If you move on to the businesses on page three, and the Investment Bank, we have circled net income of $1.6 billion
for the third quarter. That's on revenues of $6.3 billion. If you take out the DVA, it was $6.5 billion in revenue for the
quarter. That's up 45% year-on-year, 8% sequentially; $1.7 billion of net income and return on equity of 17%. IB fees
for the quarter of $1.4 billion were up almost 40% year-on-year, and we had particular strength this quarter in the debt
issuance activity. Given the favorable rate environment, our clients are taking advantage of funding, both going long
and increasing their funding capacity.
Markets revenues of $4.8 billion were up 24% year-on-year, 5% quarter-on-quarter. Very favorable performance in
Fixed Income, up 33% year-on-year, 7% quarter-on-quarter; and we saw broad-based strength across the Fixed Income
product set, and particular improvement in our credit-related products this quarter.
Included in Fixed Income, for the quarter and going forward on a P&L basis, was the impact of the synthetic credit
portfolio that we transferred to the IB at the very beginning of the third quarter, and I want to highlight three items here
about the synthetic credit portfolio. The first is the IB did book a modest loss this quarter in the position. That's
included in the $3.7 billion of revenues in Fixed Income. We did continue to reduce risk in that position this quarter.
And you'll also see the IB VaR for the quarter was $122 million. That did reflect the addition of the synthetic credit
portfolio as well as a model change we implemented this quarter and then a reduction of the diversification benefits for
this quarter as well.
If you look at Equity Markets, revenue of $1 billion, essentially flat year-on-year; cash volumes continue to remain a
challenge, but it was offset by good results in equity derivatives as well as our Prime Services business. And the last
comment on the IB, if you look at the comp to revenue ratio ex-DVA, 32% for the quarter, 34% year-to-date.
If you turn to page five, Consumer & Business Banking, CBB, you see circled net income of about $780 million. That's
on revenue of $4.3 billion, down 7% year-on-year. This will be the last quarter we talk about it on a year-over-year
basis, but it was impacted by the Durbin Amendment as well as the theme we've been talking about of narrowing
deposit margins. If you look quarter-on-quarter, revenues are flat, and it really reflects those core business trends that
have been offsetting margin pressure.

So deposit growth of 9%, we had a recent FDIC deposit survey that showed our deposit growth at several times the
industry average, and the way we analyze that data, it actually showed we grew share in our consumer deposits in all of
our 50 top markets this year. The record Business Banking balances of $18.6 billion, we opened over 1 million
additional checking accounts year-over-year, 2.5 million more active mobile customers. We continued to make
progress on CPC, $155 billion of client investments under – assets on the balance sheet, and we opened our 1000th
CPC location actually on October 1, so it didn't make it into the 9/30 numbers.
And just the final word on expenses, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, you see expenses here
returned back to first quarter levels, and you're going to continue to see overhead ratios remain elevated in the near
term, given the rate environment.
If you turn to Mortgage Production and Servicing on page six, circled net income of a little over $560 million this
quarter; record production-related pre-tax income of $1.1 billion, and that's been driven by a couple of items. Volumes
were $47 billion this quarter, up 30% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-quarter, driven by the favorable rate environment for
refinancing as well as HARP volume. You'll also see current margins really remain well above historical levels. We
would expect those margins to compress over time.
Repurchase impact was essentially neutral for this quarter, similar to what we talked about last quarter. And then you'll
see, on the Servicing side, we continue to be challenged by very high default-related expenses, including the
foreclosure-related matters and the ongoing costs that are associated with the settlement and the consent order. We do,
unfortunately, expect these expenses to remain elevated longer, and that is consistent with the general expense guidance
that we gave you last quarter, certainly through the end of this year.
If you turn to page seven for Real Estate Portfolios, you see net income of $60 million. Revenues are down 13%. That's
the same theme we've been talking about, decline in NII as we ran off $22 billion of loan balances in the portfolio, 11%
reduction year-on-year. And we're going to continue to see this trend impacting our annual NII by about $500 million,
plus or minus, and this quarter was consistent with that.
Circled credit costs of $520 million on the page really reflects three items. First, we had a modest improvement in the
credit quality trends, and that resulted in a $595 million charge-off number on a comparable basis to how we reported
last quarter. And as a result of that, going forward, you'll see our guidance for net charge-offs is $600 million, plus or
minus, on a quarterly basis.
Second, we recognized an incremental $825 million of charge-offs, we believe one-time, based on new regulatory
guidance, and I'm going to talk about that on the next page. And as a result of all of that, we reduced our reserves by
$900 million this quarter, essentially reflecting our improved expectations for losses going forward. We've included, by
the way, the reserve analysis that we discussed last quarter. It's on page 20 of the appendix. And you'll see, on an
adjusted basis, based on all of these actions, we continue to have a very healthy loan loss reserve of 234% of our
annualized net charge-offs on an adjusted basis.
If you turn to page eight, we thought we'd give you a little bit more description on the regulatory guidance. It
essentially required that substantially all the loans that we have on our books discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy be
written down to their collateral value, and that's regardless of their current delinquency status. And so that impacted
about $2.8 billion of mortgage balances, predominantly home equity loans, and that's what added the $825 million in
charge-offs for the quarter.
I just want to highlight a couple of facts we have on the page: 97% of those loans that we just wrote down to collateral
value are current; 85% are actually paying principal; 50% have been making payments for at least two years following
bankruptcy, 80% for one year; and 85% of the portfolio's FICO scores have all improved since bankruptcy, about 75
points on average. If these loans perform the way we expect them to, we would expect to recover a significant amount
of the current net charge-offs for this quarter over time.
The guidance, as a result of this action, impacted our nonaccrual loan balances, as did the previous regulatory guidance
we implemented in the first quarter on junior liens. So if you see at the bottom right, we've tried to give you a pro
forma trend analysis, and if you look at, absent these changes, the circled number of $5.1 billion on nonaccrual, that's

Page 4 of 17
the number to compare apples-to-apples to the third quarter of last year, and so you see a reduction of a little over $1
billion in nonaccrual balances.
Page nine, Card Services & Auto, circled net income of $950 million; that's up 12% year-on-year. That's on revenues of
$4.7 billion. It's down slightly year-on-year but up 4% quarter-on-quarter. I had mentioned before, we saw strong sales
volume in Card. In fact, we have now had double-digit sales growth for the last seven quarters if you exclude the Kohl's
portfolio, and we continue to believe this is market share growth as we get a larger percentage of consumer spend in the
United States.
The revenue rate you see on the page of 12.46%, based on strong interchange revenues and lower reversals this quarter,
and consistent with the guidance that Gordon had given you on Investor Day. Net charge-off rate continued to decline,
3.57%; that's down in absolute dollars $380 million year-on-year. And just a quick moment on Auto, had very solid
performance, originations up 7%, 9% quarter-on-quarter, and that's really been based on the improving auto
environment as well as continuing strength in used car pricing. Final note on expenses, they are down 9% year-on-year,
and that's largely due to lower marketing costs.
If you turn to page 10, the Commercial Bank, circled net income of $690 million; that's, as I mentioned, on record
revenues of $1.7 billion, driven by record loan balances. C&I growth for our portfolio continues to exceed the industry
average, so it was 19% year-on-year versus a 13% industry average growth. Record middle-market loan balances now
for the 10th consecutive quarter, up 15% year-on-year. I will note, utilization continues to remain relatively flat, and
given the strong cash positions on a number of our customers and the current environment, we're not sure that we
haven't reached a new normal here in terms of utilization. The credit environment continues to be very benign in the
Commercial Bank, so excluding recoveries, nine basis points of charge-offs this quarter.
Treasury & Security Services on page 11, net income of $420 million; that's up a little under 40% year-on-year but
down from a seasonally strong second quarter. Revenues are up 6% year-on-year, and that's really the result of the
higher deposit balances you see – particular growth, by the way, in international deposits – and higher average trade
finance loan volumes. International trade loans grew almost 25% year-on-year. We also had record assets under
custody during the quarter. One note here on investment spending, as we continue to invest, this is now beginning to be
offset by some of the efficiency initiatives that we've talked about in prior quarters, so it actually reduced expenses
year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, and the impact you see is improving margins year-over-year.
Asset Management on page 12, $440 million of net income, up 15% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter; that's on
revenues of $2.5 billion. The results in the quarter were really driven by the improving markets as well as the
continuation of long-term product flows. You'll see it's our 14th consecutive quarter of long-term flows, almost $21
billion this quarter. We've had a little under $60 billion over the last 12 months into long-term portfolios, and that's
really based on continued strong investment performance as well as the banker build-out we've been investing in. Loan
growth, as I mentioned, is up almost $20 billion year-on-year, and that's really from increasing contributions from
mortgage production as well as international.
If you turn to page 13, Corporate and Private Equity, net income for the quarter totaled $220 million. It reflects really a
number of things. So, in Private Equity, you see net income loss of $90 million. That is principally mark-to-market
positions for the quarter. In Treasury and CIO, net income of $370 million, that's on revenues of $713 million, and I'm
going to talk about that revenue in a number of items.
First, we had almost $900 million in revenues from the extinguishment of the gains on the redeemed TruPS. We told
you about that during our second quarter call. If you, second, look to mark-to-market losses in CIO, it was a loss of
approximately $250 million, and included in that loss was $450 million from a loss on the remaining indexed positions
that we left in CIO, and that really reflects credit spread tightening that we had this quarter, and you'll note that we've
effectively closed those positions out now by quarter-end.
Third, we did recognize $460 million of pre-tax gains through securities gains, and in addition, while not on the page
here, we did mention last quarter our AFS-related AOCI, so that's our security portfolio gains, was $8 billion pre-tax;
that number actually increased to $11 billion, a $3 billion increase on a pre-tax basis, $2 billion after taxes.

And then the final component here is we did book negative NII, given the low rate environment. And given that
environment and the reinvestment opportunities which I'll talk about on the NIM page, you would expect to see this
line item be a loss of $300 million, plus or minus, for next quarter, and that will obviously have an impact on NIM as
well. The last piece is Other Corporate here. We booked $700 million approximately in pre-tax costs for additional
litigation reserves, and that was largely offset by a number of items, including some tax adjustments this quarter.
So if you turn to page 14 on NIM, you see that NIM declined four basis points quarter-on-quarter, our core NIM
declined eight basis points quarter-on-quarter, and a number of items affecting NIM for the quarter. On the negative
side: Prepayment speeds impacted the yields of the Mortgage Portfolio in our AFS portfolio. Secondly, as I mentioned,
ongoing low rate environment and the impact on reinvestment opportunities impacted NIM, as well as repricing of our
floating-rate instruments in that portfolio, given the low rate environment. And then the third is really a mix issue. We
increased our average deposits for Central Banks this quarter, primarily in the Fed, and that impacted NIM as well.
Now, on the positive side, we did have a reduction in costs for deposits that were paid across our deposit-taking
businesses this quarter. And the last note here is our long-term debt balances and interest expense were down on
average quarter-on-quarter, but the long-term debt rate benefit that we got from redeeming the TruPS was more than
offset this quarter by the impact of accounting, primarily FAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness that we have talked about over
a number of quarters. And given all of what I just talked about going forward, and the current rate environment, we'd
expect to see continued modest pressure on NIM for the next several quarters.
I think I've covered the significant points on page 15 and have talked about all the issues in terms of outlook on page
16. So, with that, Operator, can I ask you to open up the line for questions for Jamie and myself?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi. Thank you. Obviously, great mortgage production, curious if you can parse out how much
related to HARP versus the overall rate environment, and if you think you have any visibility as we head into fourth
quarter and next year.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, so refi was about 75% and HARP was about 15% in total. And next quarter will probably
be pretty good because you still have low rates and the pipeline stuff is still pretty high, the applications.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. Thank you. Staying with the mortgage theme, I guess I'm – the overall message seems
like, in your words, housing has turned and you lowered reserves a little bit. You've got a lot more reserves to go, so
what things do you look for, for that to continue, and is it apples and oranges when you look at the other side of the
coin and see that repurchase claims are up, litigation reserves are up, and there's been a whole lot of press lately about
some cases going against the industry, or some court rulings going against the industry on the put-back side?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yeah, so, Glenn, maybe I can separate it out. On the mortgage reserve side, what we
said in outlook is if the trends continue the way we are, you should expect to see more reserve releases, but that's
subject to the current trends. On the repurchase side, that data in the back in the supplement is both GSE and private
label, so the trends we talked about last quarter on the GSE side that run through the mortgage lines, continue, and so
you saw our actual paid claims of $230 million, our reserve release I think of $218 million, if I'm recalling correctly.
We expect that, subject to obviously certain changes, to continue. And then, on private label, we have told you, based
on what we knew, that we thought we were well-reserved for those issues, but obviously circumstances can change,
and that will change our reserving policy when and if appropriate.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. Last quickie, is there still about a 30-basis-point delta for what you're showing us on the
advanced approach in Basel III Tier 1 common, and if you use the standardized?

<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yeah, so if you're – are you asking – the delta has shrunk. If you are asking, which we
didn't put in, the impact of NPR on Basel I, that delta has shrunk as well.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, cool. I can follow up the rest offline. Appreciate -
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The only thing I want to point out about capital, the 8.4% Basel III, which obviously is an
estimate, upfronts, phases in everything that we know of today. It does not phase in what we know about our own
runoff and the ability to create new models down the road that reduce it. So we would estimate, if you did all that, we're
close to 9.5%.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Close to 9.5% -?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: In other words, we're phasing all the bad stuff up front and not any of the good stuff. The good
stuff is the runoff we know that's going to happen in the next two years, and we obviously are going to build models to
have better RWA outcomes on CRM and some other issues, and they're just not in there yet.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Understood, and last one, on the resubmission, is that a November event for when we get
thumbs-up/thumbs-down from the Fed?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We don't know. They'll let us know. Remember, this is only going to affect the first quarter
buyback...
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Correct.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: ...which isn't that substantial for our company, and we have to reapply for the full-year CCAR,
which would affect what we can do after March 31, which we'll be doing soon. That's the more important number.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A question on just the reinvestment strategy; Doug, you
mentioned, going through page 14, the challenges. I guess the question is, do you, at this stage, continue reinvesting in
RMBS to the extent that you have the runoff occurring today, obviously the front of the curve collapsed there in
RMBS, or do you go into more Treasuries and Ginnies, given the fact that you're a little light on that asset class
anyway, relative spread has improved? Or do you loosen the credit box and try to drive up the loan growth?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, number three, definitely, which is loan growth is probably more important. I wouldn't say
it's loosening the credit box; it's just maybe being more – a little competitive on pricing. Treasuries, no, and the
benchmark for the reinvestment of the portfolio would be Fannies or Ginnies or Freddies. And obviously there are
issues to that about the convexity it creates when you do that. And the other thing, which we're obviously working
through, with new RWA, you've got to combine liquidity need with the RWA charges. So, right now, we're staying
fairly conservative. There will be other opportunities down the road.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And on the loan side, you think you can drive some incremental loan growth through
just pricing activity, just being more competitive on rate?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think, Jumbo, yes, just be more competitive on rates, and we think they're very good credits
going forward. And you can see we're growing the Commercial Bank, we're growing Auto. Card, we hope to grow. So
we want to grow all those things. And we've got good margins. So we want to push the loan growth a little bit.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So then, switching gears, just talk a little bit about FICC, FICC results very good this
quarter. The question on the outlook has to do with some of the structural changes that are going on as we move into
next year, in particular clearing where there's some debate around collateral requirements, collateral shortfall, not going

to be able to re-hypothecate as much going forward as you did, as you are able to right now. So how are you thinking
about the FICC line, and what are you doing to try to maintain the kind of run rate that you've got, given those
pressures?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, so we don't know if there's going to be a "collateral shortfall. " It's not quite clear yet. And
the rules for liquidity stuff is not quite clear yet. Clearinghouses, they're both an opportunity and a risk. And so we
hope to get – we're building the system so we can provide cross-collateral for clients and ease of transaction and cheap
transactions for clients. And obviously it may change some of the volume that goes to other things. But I'm not sure, in
total, that that's going to change a lot the FICC line. Our experience has been that as things go to clearinghouses or
electronic execution, sometimes volume goes up and makes up for it.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, I'm good. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Good morning. Jamie, I'm really interested in getting your view on how you think QE3 overall
is going to impact JPMorgan specifically. So we can see obviously the short-term benefits of a lot of mortgage
origination revenue, potentially a positive impact on the economy, but of course the negative is lower mortgage rates,
lower MBS rates, and what that does to the margin. So I'm just sort of interested in getting your view on is QE3 a good
thing or a bad thing for JPMorgan.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, you basically laid it all out already, which is lower rates hurts you a little bit, but it
obviously helps mortgage origination and, ultimately, housing prices, because low rates can drive that part of the
economy a little bit. If it were to drive the economy, and I'm not sure it will, that would be a plus for us. So I think
they're doing their job not to help things or hurt things, but to try to drive the economy and drive jobs. If that works, it's
a good plus. I personally think that the fiscal policy is going to be more important than the Fed policy soon. The Fed
needs help with rational fiscal policy.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: How do you think about this idea that, in the near term, clearly, you're going to mint a lot of
extra money on the mortgage refi boom, but once that's behind you, you're simply left with a lower margin? How much
does that concern you or not?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Not a lot. If you look at – the margins in production are very high. They're well over, like 2%,
and a norm would be under 1%, so obviously, one day that'll normalize. And in the meantime, you get volume and
higher spreads. On the other hand, we have huge excess servicing costs, which probably would more than offset that.
And when housing recovers, charge-offs will come down. So, to me, if the economy gets better, we're fine. You lose
some production income, but everything else will be better.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: And then, finally, there's a lot of big banks that are sort of framing a component of their
operating expenses that they think is abnormally high right now, based on the extra mortgage servicing, the foreclosure,
all the things related to continuing through the end of this credit cycle. Is there any sort of number or range that we
should think about for JPMorgan in terms of those excess mortgage-related costs coming down as housing continues to
recover?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think the big one to look at is the excess servicing cost due to the high level of defaults and the
high cost of defaults and the consent orders, and look at that number as about $500 million a quarter. It's a little more
than that. That number will eventually be zero. But I don't think it's going down to zero – it'll probably take eight
quarters before it goes down to a number approaching zero, maybe more. It's going to take a while to work through all
of that. But that number will disappear. Production income will also come down at one point, for all the reasons you
said. When rates go back up, you're not going to have all the refis we have today, and you'll probably have more
competition and purchase money originations reducing margins. And, obviously, when the housing recovers, the losses
we're bearing on charge-offs will reduce too, just owning the real estate portfolio.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up, actually, on that question
from Ed and the eight quarters that you indicated, Jamie, any idea – that's actually a pretty – it's obviously an extended
time period; any idea about what the trend line would look like, or is it too early? Is most of the benefit that comes from
that reduction going to be back-end-weighted, or will it be pretty linear, any idea about that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, I would expect none next quarter. I would expect a little bit in 2013 and a lot in 2014. But
those are just – I'm just – this is just rough estimates. We don't really know.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Of course. Great. That helps. Thanks. And then the $700 million of litigation this quarter,
does that mean that you guys had adverse development, or was it largely one-time items there? And I guess said
another way, is there an adjustment from the previous views that litigation reserves really don't need to be built from
this point?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No. I think we're – you're separating it. When we talk about mortgage, the private label stuff we
said we thought were substantially fairly well done, but there is other mortgage stuff that goes in and out and we adjust
for. And there's constant other litigation. So when we know we have something we can estimate what it is, we put up
litigation reserves for it. Unfortunately, I think litigation costs will stay high for a while too. There's just constant
development in litigation. It's not all mortgage-related.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then thinking about CCAR application, not just this quarter's but also next year's,
are you approaching it any differently, or is there any increased caution when you think about the fact that there was a
material weakness of internal control at JPMorgan? It seems like that might be something that could really sharpen the
pencils at the regulators, and so was just kind of curious, as you approach the application, whether or not that adjusted
how you thought about your application at all?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Listen, look, it's obvious that we had a gap in the armor here, and like I say, an arrow went right
through that gap. But other than that gap, we think we have pretty damn good controls and stuff like that. That material
weakness will be fixed. We've got a great company. We've got huge cash flows, huge capability, and we could
probably buy back a lot of stock next year and still hit the 9.5% Basel III at one point. And so I think a rational thing to
do is, if the stock is at the right price, to buy back stock. Obviously, we're going to apply – we don't know – the CCAR
rules will change next year, so when we see those rules, we'll decide.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Yeah, early going, understood, just was curious whether or not that was going to adjust your
approach at all?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I would hope not. I would hope that when you look at the company in total, you see pretty good
disciplines and pretty good controls.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Fair enough. And then last one for me, I know that nothing is official, but I don't know
whether or not you or Doug might want to comment on the story in the Journal that got some attention yesterday about
maybe different roles for Doug in the future or who might be successor if Doug decided he wanted to do something
different?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, look, obviously, I find it hugely irritating that people yap to the press like that. But Doug is
a top professional. He ran our U.S. Investment Bank coverage for many years. He's been a top CFO. And we will let
you know when and if we intend to make changes when we make them, not through gossip in the press. I should point
out that we have a very strong bench in this company. We've got a lot of talented people. So, if and when we make a
decision like that, we'll make it. I also want to point out, we always have conversations with senior people, and

everybody, about the future for them; their career, what they want to do next, when the timing makes sense for them
and the company. That's kind of a normal conversation. I wouldn't put that as an abnormal type of conversation.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Fair enough. And actually one more, sorry. Trying to think about the implications of this
announcement, the Bear lawsuit that was announced; as I thought about it, wouldn't this – if you have the ability to
come after a firm that acquires a troubled financial institution at a time of crisis, after the fact, opportunistically, with
perhaps political motivations, shouldn't that raise concerns from a safety and soundness perspective from the Fed? Isn't
that kind of a key tool that the Fed uses in times of crisis, and shouldn't that create an issue for this lawsuit?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I'm not sure it creates an issue for the lawsuit, but I agree with you, as a policy matter, it's going
to make it much harder in the future for companies to buy a troubled company.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. Kind of following up on that a little bit, Jamie, you made some comments
earlier in the week about the ongoing costs of some of those – or the total costs, I should say, of some of those
acquisitions. I would assume that some of the costs in the quarter, both litigation and otherwise, you're still kind of
feeling that. Have you ever sized or are you willing to size what that might be?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So let me – first of all, I just also want to mention, when the government bankrupted GM – you
do remember they did bankrupt GM – they absolved GM of all prior legal liability. So the government is being a little
inconsistent here. Clearly.
So when I made a comment publicly at another forum that when we did Bear Stearns, remember, we put up substantial
reserves in purchase accounting, so it didn't run through the P&L, for closedown costs, litigation, consolidation, and
materially, risk management, like to get down the risk that we got in Bear Stearns. And so included in that number, I
said, was what we did put in purchase accounting. Since then, we've put on more reserves for mortgage-related stuff
somewhat related to Bear Stearns, somewhat related to WaMu, somewhat related to JPMorgan Chase itself, and so it's
increased the cost to us. And that's unfortunate, but that's life. And we've reserved for the things we know about and we
think about now. So it's already in our numbers, the comments I'm making. Those were not future-looking additional
reserves.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Okay. On a separate matter, the Card business had pretty strong revenues this quarter. Is
there anything you could kind of call out in terms of what drove that improvement? Is there something going on there,
and can we expect that to continue?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, so – and, first of all, the losses there are very low, and you really shouldn't expect much
improvement from here. They're at historical lows. But what we are really proud of in the Card business is that these
new products – Sapphire, Freedom, Ink, products like Blueprint, our rewards program – are doing very well. We've
been gaining share every single year for four years now on Card. And you see it in the spend numbers, not in the
outstanding numbers, but in the spend. So spend was up like 11%. And if you compare that to a lot of competitors, it's
more than double the growth of the average competitor. And that obviously is driving revenues. We also have merchant
processing there, which I think, if I remember correctly, grew 18%, that's in the revenue line. So the Card business has
been doing very well. They're finally making up for the years that they didn't do very well.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Right. And just to follow up, at the Investor Day, I think Gordon had mentioned that you
expected marketing spend to be kind of flattish in 2012, and I think Doug had alluded today saying that part of the
reason costs were down was that marketing spend was down. Given that performance, is it something that you're going
to start marketing more aggressively, or is there just enough spending going on?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, I think marketing was high last quarter and normal this quarter...

<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Got it.

with plans and marketing plans, and we think they're going to have very good returns, we're going to spend the money.
That's what we do. We don't sit here and set a marketing budget and meet it. We actually try to review all of the
programs we have, and when we have attractive things to do, we're going to do them, even if it reduces the current
quarter profits.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: You spoke a bit about getting more aggressive on loan pricing, in part because you feel
better about the economy and in part because of just the lower-for-longer interest rates. But what do you need to see to
lower lending standards a little bit, specifically on the consumer side, as you think about Mortgage and Card and maybe
even Auto?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Can you repeat the question again?
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Well, in short, what do you need to see, either macro-wise in the economy or from a
regulatory point of view, to loosen some of the lending standards, which I think for the industry are quite high on the
consumer side?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, I think it's – yeah, so mortgage is high, okay? And mortgage is high, appraisal standards
are too high, the verification of income is extreme, and since we don't know the rules of securitizations and QRM, I
think it's going to loosen over time. I think doing mortgages today, you get very good credits, very good underlying
collateral. Remember, a lot of credits can't get loans today. It will loosen over time. And I think you just need a
stronger economy, and some decisions, some of these regulatory rules, or even some of the Basel rules, could create
kind of cliffs in mortgages, so the risk-weighted assets, I think if you go below 680 FICO, dramatically jumps. There's
huge incentive not to do any mortgage below 680. And so I think some of those things, hopefully, will be sorted out in
the next six months or nine months. And Credit Card, Auto, Student, and other, I don't think you should expect to see
major changes.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, as we think about other levers, because rates are going to
stay lower for longer, anything on the expense side that you're thinking about or could talk about?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, we're doing budgets now, and we're always going to drive efficiency in expenses. And our
expenses, what I like about our expenses is, in those numbers is constant investment. And you see that, more bankers,
more branches, more systems, more countries, more – that is what's important for driving the future of the company.
So, obviously, some expenses will be going up because they're good expenses, and some expenses are coming down
because you become more efficient, and we're always trying to drive down what I call bad expenses, expenses driven
by bureaucracy, stupidity, and stuff like that. So we'll fine-tune it, and when we have Investor Day next year, we'll
probably give you a better outlook for what we expect. But right now an expectation would be kind of level, the plus –
what we can save will offset the investments.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just lastly on some of these servicing-related costs, I realize there's a lot of
puts and takes. I often get asked the question, home prices are starting to go up, how quickly do these costs come down,
and obviously the time to foreclose has actually increased, I think, versus six, nine months ago. What's the one or two

key macro data points that we can watch to be somewhat of a leading or even coincident indicator for these servicing
costs?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Okay, so in servicing, it's $500 million a quarter, which will eventually go to zero, and the real
driver of that is things in default, delinquency, or foreclosure. As those things come down, you're going to see those
costs come down. And, second, we have to finish the consent order and that, but I think they're all kind of related. In
real estate, home prices going up will reduce real estate losses; jobs will reduce real estate losses. The number of homes
underwater is 2 million less now than it was, like, a year ago. So, obviously, those things are all big pluses. I think you
just need a good economy, and you'll see charge-offs start to come down faster than they've been coming down
recently.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Good morning.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: First question is, what is loan utilization this quarter versus the last few quarters?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You guys, can you turn up your mic? I can't hear you, Doug.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: You can't hear me?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, I can hear you now, I'm sorry.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Can you hear me now, Jamie?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, we got you.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yeah, okay -
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So what's – yeah, go ahead.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: So, Mike, it's loan utilization in the Commercial Bank.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: However you can give it to us.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: We typically talk about utilization in the Commercial Bank, particularly in the middle
market, it's in the low 30%s, and it hasn't changed much. And I mentioned that's because most of those companies are
very flush with cash as well, and so until they start to really invest more, you're going to see those utilization rates
around where they are.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And your margin guidance, it seemed a little bit worse than before. Is that simply due to
QE3?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: No, our NIM guidance is largely identical to what we said last quarter, modest pressure.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: But you say for a few more quarters; it seems like it's pressure for longer, or no?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It could be, because the implied curve has pushed lower rates out much longer, so the pressure
can go on for a little bit longer than we would have thought before.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: But, Mike, remember that also – that relates to decisions we are going to make, how long the
duration of our portfolio is, what we do in making loans, how we want to manage the risk-weighted assets. So there's
been a lot of changes in the business. We've got to adjust to those changes.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And part of that adjustment, is that being more competitive on pricing for loans?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I would say competitive, but not necessarily more competitive. So we try to stay competitive in
most pricing, get under – do the credit right and be competitive on price is more important than be competitive in
pricing but – I mean don't be competitive in pricing but have bad underlying credit standards.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So are you lowering pricing on your loans?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: On Jumbo loans, we did a little bit. Mostly of the loans -
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And what about -?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Most of the loans, probably not.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yeah, Mike, I will tell you, in the NIM this quarter, if you look at the loan yields,
relatively flat across the company. But again, as the low rate environment and people looking for assets to put on their
balance sheet, we're going to have to remain competitive.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Actually, in the Jumbo, I'd say actually we just reduced rates to meet the market. We were
probably a little high.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I guess what I'm leading to is how elastic is loan pricing. If you assume that the lack of loan
growth in aggregate for the U.S. is not due to the supply of money, but it's due to the demand for money, will lowering
pricing actually improve that demand? And I know it's a difficult question to answer, but it goes to how much lower
you might want to price your loans.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're not going to price a lot lower to create demand or something like that. I think it's a little
elastic – we see the elastic in Jumbo. We're not going to change our underwriting standards in Card. We're not going to
change our underwriting standards and pricing. We got a little more competitive in Auto. But, again, that's just
following the business. These are competitive businesses, and we have to compete. We have to decide whether we're
going to meet lower prices or not. So, in Auto and Jumbo, we did. I would say, in the Commercial Corporate side,
probably not much.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then one more question, on the margin as it relates to mortgage – I know this is a tough
question – how much longer do you think the mortgage margin should hold up in terms of the gain on sale, or what
factors should we think about when modeling that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think as long as rates stay low, refis will stay high, and volume will be high, and very high
volume clogs up the system and allows higher pricing. I think that once you start to see rates go up – which, personally,
I think will probably happen sometime in 2013, but I don't know that – you're going to see lower refi and more
competitive pricing, more home purchase but more competitive pricing. So we don't expect to count on the high
margins and mortgage origination forever. Maybe you're going to have it for – you're going to have it next quarter or
maybe for a couple quarters after that, but it won't last for that much longer.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thanks a lot.

Commercial Banking segments, for the fourth quarter and into the first half of next year, given some of the political
risk that we face over the next few months?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: When you talk about the fourth quarter, I don't – if you look at the Commercial Bank, you can
pretty much project the results for the next quarter, so the fiscal cliff isn't going to change this. It's NII from loans on
the books and from Treasury deposits and things like that. The Investment Bank would be more sensitive to what the
market reacts to if they get very scared about the fiscal cliff. But we just don't know. We're going to be prepared.
JPMorgan will try to be there for its clients regardless. And I'm not sure it's going to drive the fourth quarter results that
much. I think the only place you'll see it really drive it would be in the Investment Bank if volumes dropped
dramatically. But I can give you arguments why fiscal cliff could drive volumes up in the short run.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Doug, maybe for you, a question on the Investment Banking VaR, which was, on a reported
basis, up about 70%-plus. There appears to be a methodology change in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Can
you provide a little more detail as to how we should think about that and what you're thinking about the VaR in the
fourth quarter?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, so, as you say, much of that increase was the transfer of the synthetic credit
portfolio, which we expected, some other mix changes. The model changes, we updated models for that portfolio based
on Investment Banking models, which we believe are a better indicator of risk, and there was a little less diversification
benefit this quarter. These VaR numbers are well within the numbers that the IB has operated in before. And we did, I
think, qualify, at a company-wide level, the impact of the model change reduced VaR company-wide by a little over
$35 million.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then a question on your deposit costs, they're down about six basis points
quarter-over-quarter, as you mentioned, Doug, in your prepared remarks. One side of the question is how much lower
do you think you can get those, and if you're not able to drive those down, what affect does that have on NIM pressure
over the next couple of quarters?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: It's likely we're getting close to the bottom there. And so to the extent other factors
continue to have pressure, you're going to see a little bit more slippage. I will say some offsets that we didn't get the
benefit of from a hedge accounting standpoint is our financing costs, we would expect to see some improvements there,
absent the accounting changes.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then finally for me, you noted that peripheral European exposure on a net basis
was a little less than $12 billion this quarter versus a $6.3 billion net number last quarter, looks like most of the increase
came in Italy and Spain. Is there any color you can provide on what's going on there?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The increase was mostly from the reduction in short positions out of the synthetic credit
portfolio.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The rest is kind of business as usual in Italy and Spain, and we are still doing business there.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Right, okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And you should expect to see that exposure go up a little bit from here too.

also mentioned that it will be business as usual in terms of how you formulate your ask. So, if the synthetic credit loss
isn't really going to impact the process and your ask, is it safe for us to assume that you'll ask for at least as much as
you did last year, if not more?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: First of all, we don't have the final CCAR rules yet. And they're going to change some of them,
and we've got to see that before we see it. And we're also working through all the new RWA rules of Basel 2.5, the
NPR Basel III, and all the new liquidity rules, LCR. We're going to get it all right, and then we're going to apply. I
think we'll be able to buy back a substantial amount of stock and meet the 9.5% Basel III in 2013, by late 2013. But I
can't give you the number right now. It may be more or less than last year what we applied for.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, thank you very much. Jamie, going back to the mortgage originations, on the
correspondent channel, you've really been increasing market share. Is that something that – I know there's a lot of
opportunities out there with a lot of guys exiting that business, and I know in the past that you've shrunk that a little bit.
But is that something that we should continue to see if the mortgage market remains healthy, you'd grow market share
in that channel?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, I think – we did shrink it from we had like – I forgot the number, 2,500 down to 700 or
800, more looking at the complete relationship in correspondent. But the correspondent, so I think it's a pure economic
transaction, other people got out of the business, and we probably just ended up with a little more share for that reason.
It's not a big strategic thrust. If the mortgage folks come in and say that they can generate a lot of servicing at a very
economic rate and do more, we would do more.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. And then another question is, is you saw Wells Fargo get hit with the Department of
Justice suit on FHA originations, and I know there's been a lot of litigation for all these institutions. Have you had any
talks with the Department of Justice on what – I know BofA settled with these guys for the same issues. Have you had
any talks that have been disclosed, any talks with the Department of Justice on these FHA-type originations?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No, we haven't disclosed anything, but I would expect that when these things come out,
everyone's going to have to do – have something of the same order, that this is an ordinary course of business. But it's
unlikely that you have three people get it and not the fourth.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then, lastly, you talked about -
<A - Jamie Dimon>: But we were not very big in FHA.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Okay.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. And then the last one is you talked about – I think Mike Mayo asked, I forget who – that
you don't see anybody really doing FICOs below 680. Is that just putting on your portfolio, or 680 and selling to the
GSEs? We know the -
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, conforming loans, you sell them, that's fine. You meet their standards. What I was referring
to is that some of the new Basel rules create these little cliffs on risk-weighted assets. And if I remember correctly, one
of the cliffs is created when you go below 700 or 680 or 650, and that therefore it's going to be harder for certain people
to own mortgages, even if they're very well underwritten, even 60% loan-to-value is below 680 because of the high
risk-weighted capital charge. I think some of that is stifling mortgage originations to those folks. That's all I'm saying.
And I think it should loosen up over time. And I'm not sure the regulators intended that when they put up the new Basel
rules.

Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW.
<Q - David J. Konrad>: Good morning. I just had a question regarding the comp ratio in IB, came in, at least, lower
than I expected, at 32%. I guess, is that a mix shift in the revenues this quarter? And maybe if you can give any color
for next quarter and maybe – I was thinking the long-term comp ratio guidance was 35% to 39%. Should we think of
that as being lower longer-term?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So we've always said 35% to 40%. We actually use a formula which uses returns on capital and
the type of revenues and the type of profits, et cetera, risk-adjusted and all that. And so that's the numbers that generally
goes through it. But as a rule of thumb, I would think about 35% being a good number.
<Q - David J. Konrad>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, and obviously, every year it changes, and competition changes, and whether you're investing
in certain parts of the world, you may fund that separately because you can't take that out of – people are working hard
today to fund a big investment in another part of the world. So it'll change over time, but 35%. If you look at our
Investment Bank, 35% comp, I think it's like 25% non-comp, which means a 40% margin. That's pretty good. That's
pretty good. If we can sustain that, I would be a very happy guy.
<Q - David J. Konrad>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: In a competitive environment.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yeah, hi. Jamie was quoted the other day saying that JPMorgan was establishing a fiscal
cliff war room, and I was wondering, can you tell us what exactly you meant by that and how you're positioning the
firm for that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think I was referring to that I was asked a question at the Council on Foreign Relations about
the eurozone crisis and the fiscal cliff. We do have a kind of war room eurozone crisis. We've done extensive work on
it. I also mentioned we've probably spent $50 million or so getting prepared for the debt crisis that we had nine months
ago or so. And we're preparing – I wouldn't call it a war room. They misstated it. We've got to get prepared for the
fiscal cliff, like what does it mean, and maybe not so much for us but for our clients. How are they going to react, what
do we have to be prepared to do. And, unfortunately, when things like the fiscal – if the fiscal cliff actually happens,
you have to be prepared for various scenarios, including the worst possible one, even if you don't predict it. So that's
what we're thinking. What could really happen, what are we missing, how bad could it be, and we've got to be prepared
for it. We're hoping it doesn't happen.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay, that's it for me. Thank you.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Okay.

<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Yeah, good morning. Two questions, I think one on what's left – you had transferred – you
closed out of the positions in CIO and transferred the rest to the Investment Bank. Can you give us any update on your
thoughts on when that could be completely exited? And any other indications of size or impact in the quarter would be
great.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, last time we gave you some measures, CS01s, VaR, RWA, and a couple of stress tests. We
said extreme stress $800 million to $1.6 billion. That was July 13.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Almost any measure you look at of risk would be down 20%, 30%, or 40%, so certain risks are
down 40%, certain risks are down 30%, certain 20%; and the stress risk, in addition, is down by that amount. The folks
are doing a great job managing it. It had a modest loss this quarter. We feel completely comfortable with it. It obviously
could lose money. It could also make money. And we always said we hope by the end of the year it's a non-issue and
we don't have to talk about it anymore. We're still on track for that.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: And so it seems like it's reasonably well-hedged in the Investment Bank?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The folks are doing a great job hedging every conceivable piece of it they know about, while
conducting client business.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right. Okay, maybe a follow-up on Europe; certainly, the funding environment's gotten better.
Do you feel that there has been somewhat of a game change there, and are you feeling better about embracing market
share opportunities there and putting more balance sheet to work, or you still have some hesitation in Europe?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: In the last couple months, they've made, I would say, a lot of progress. If you look at the OMT,
even though it has conditions, but it's a big statement to make sovereign debt good for Italy and Spain, the
conversations about the Banking Union and guaranteed programs, which would protect from a run on the banks in
Spain and Italy, and also trying to redo this fiscal – which will take years, but the fiscal agreement among the eurozone
nations. So I think they've made a lot of progress, and you see it reflected in bond rates.
I still think it's going to be a roller coaster. There'll be ups and downs as good things happen or bad things happen.
They're only in a mild recession. I think that's a very good thing. And we have always made the decision to continue to
conduct business in France and Germany and the UK and Spain and Italy. So we continue to be worried about it. We're
going to be prepared for bad outcomes' but we're there. And if there are opportunities – we haven't seen unbelievable
opportunities like asset sales or something like that – we'll participate if there are assets we want or things we want to
do.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right, so you think the improved tone in September is sort of carrying so far into the fourth
quarter?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I hope so. But we don't run the company guessing on things like that. We're trying to build our
client business. And, yeah, I hope so. I hope they continue to make progress. The tone is good. We're prepared if that's
not true too.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay, great. I'm done. Thanks.

And there are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing comments?
