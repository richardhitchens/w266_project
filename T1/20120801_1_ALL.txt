MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate Corporation Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your
host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Block, you may begin.
Robert Block
Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for Allstate's second quarter earnings
conference call. As usual, we will begin today with some prepared remarks from Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and me
followed by a question-and-answer session. Don Civgin, head of Allstate Financial and Esurance, Judy Greffin, Chief
Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, Controller; and Matt Winter, Head of Auto, Home and Agencies are here as well.
Yesterday afternoon we issued our press release and investor supplement as well as our 10-Q for the second quarter.
We also posted a slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are all available on our
website.
Referring to the first slide of the presentation, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding
Allstate's operations. Actual results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2011,
our 10-Q for the second quarter 2012 and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. This
discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our
website. I will be available after this call to answer any follow-up questions you may have.

Now, we can begin the discussion of our results with Tom Wilson. Tom?
Thomas J. Wilson
Well, good morning. Thanks for your interest in Allstate. My remarks will focus on our performance relative to our
2012 priorities within the context of our consumer-focused strategy and then Bob and Steve will cover the quarter's
results in greater detail. So let's begin on the top of slide two.
As you know, our strategy is to provide unique protection products to each of the four consumer segments in the
marketplace. The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, serves those customers that want local advice and assistance
and prefer to purchase competitively differentiated brand of products. In this business, we are successfully introducing
new differentiated products such as our Claim Satisfaction Guarantee, Good Hands Roadside and House & Home.
Our support of Allstate agency and marketing programs continue to be expanded with good results. Premiums written,
though, were flat for the Allstate brand as our efforts to raise returns in homeowners negatively impacts retention of
homeowners and we had lower new business sales of auto insurance. We did increase the emerging businesses and
Allstate Financial products sold through Allstate agencies.
The lower right customer segment is served by Esurance, which we acquired in October to give us a growth platform
for self-serve customers that prefer a branded product. We continue to believe our capabilities will make us a more
powerful competitor and policies in force are up this year. The results at Encompass and Answer Financial also
improved this quarter.
Our four 2012 priorities are to create shareholder value by one, maintaining auto profitability; two, raising returns in
homeowners and annuity businesses; three, growing insurance premiums; and fourth proactively managing investments
and capital.
So moving to slide three, we had another very good quarter with financial results showing progress on our priorities.
On a consolidated basis, we recorded net income of $423 million and $432 million of operating income both,
significant improvements from the net and operating loss posted last year in the second quarter. The improvement was
driven by lower catastrophe losses and a favorable reduction in the underlying combined ratio. While catastrophe losses
this quarter were reduced from last year's record setting quarter, this quarter's losses were still high versus the long-term
average. It reaffirms our 2008 decision to focus on improving returns in the homeowner's line.
Book value per share has increased 9.8% this year, reaching almost $40. Return on equity for the last 12 months
increased 11% on a net income basis and with 11.4% on an operating basis, getting closer to the 2014 goal of 13%.
Good progress was made on our 2012 priorities as well. We maintained auto profitability with the Allstate brand
standard auto combined ratio of 95.5, which is better than last year's second quarter. Esurance's combined ratio
increased, largely reflecting higher advertising expenses, acquisition costs, amortization and catastrophes. There was
modest upward pressure on auto loss costs but this is well within our pricing parameters. Homeowner returns continued
to improve with an underlying combined ratio of 64.6, which was 4.8 points better than last year's second quarter. This
reflects both our long-term effort to raise prices and improve underwriting selection as well as a moderation of loss
costs. We are pleased with the results but recognize there is more work to be done until returns are adequate and
sustainable.
Allstate Financial's annuity returns were essentially unchanged economically, but the reported results were higher
largely as a result in the shift in the location of income from limited partnerships. Overall, Allstate Financial had $138
million of operating income, which is comparable to last year's quarter on a slightly smaller asset base.
Insurance premiums increased in the quarter by 3.8% from the prior year, largely reflecting the acquisition of Esurance
and increases in emerging businesses in Encompass. Esurance's policies in force have increased by 13.5% since the
beginning of this year, as our new advertising and pricing sophistication resulted in economically attractive growth.
The investment portfolio had a total return of 1.8% in the quarter with a small increase in investment income, $27

million in net capital gains and a $442 million increase in unrealized capital gains.
We remain focused on balancing returns and preservation of capital by favoring intermediate corporate credit
investments in this low rate unstable economic environment. We also repurchased $275 million of common stock in
this quarter. All in all, good progress on all four priorities.
Bob and Steve will now provide more detail on the various components of these results.
Robert Block
Slide four provides our net premium written and combined ratio for property liability. Overall premiums written of
$6.86 billion grew 3.8% compared to the prior year, a growth rate similar to that of the first quarter 2012 driven
primarily by our acquisition of Esurance, which continued to grow both premiums and units, as well as positive growth
experience in both the Allstate and Encompass brands.
Allstate brand standard auto net premium written of $3.9 billion declined slightly from the prior year quarter as auto
profitability actions taken in New York and Florida coupled with actions to improve homeowner returns continued to
hamper overall growth. Excluding New York and Florida, net premiums written for the Allstate brand standard auto
grew slightly from the second quarter 2011. The drop in units was partially offset by an increase in average premium.
Retention at 89% was down 0.2 points from last year's quarter driven by declines in New York and Florida with the rest
of the country increasing slightly.
Allstate brand homeowner's net written premium of $1.64 billion increased 2.1% from the second quarter 2011. Rate
actions designed to improve homeowner returns more than offset the decline in units as average premiums increased
9.2% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2011.
In the second quarter we received approval for rate changes in seven states averaging 10.2%, worth 1.2% on a
countrywide basis. In addition to the rate actions, we have introduced our new product called House & Home in nine
states, seven of them in the second quarter of 2012. We are pleased with the results thus far as early results indicated,
we are getting a little lift in new business acquisition for both the homeowners and auto insurance.
Within the Allstate brand, the other personal lines which comprise emerging businesses posted net written premium
growth of 1.8%. We also experienced net premium written growth in Encompass of 5.9% driven by a substantial
increase in new issued applications as well as increased retention ratio. Sequential growth in policies in force was
achieved in emerging businesses, Canada, Encompass and Esurance.
On the bottom half of slide four, the recorded combined ratio for property liability was 98.0, a significant improvement
from second quarter 2011's 123.3. A lower catastrophe loss and an improved underlying combined ratio were the
primary reasons for the favorable results. The underlying combined ratio was 86.3, a 1.2 point improvement from the
second quarter 2011. Seasonally the second quarter has produced the lowest underlying combined ratio in every year
since 2005.
Moving to slide five, we provide the loss trends for Allstate brand standard auto for the last few years. The top half of
the slide displays the gross frequency and paid severity for bodily injury and property damage coverages. After four
quarters of frequency reduction, both bodily injury and property damage frequencies increased from prior year by 1.9%
and 1.4% respectively. Paid severities for bodily injury and property damage also increased by 3.4% and 3%
respectively. While this represents a modest increase in loss costs for these coverages, when you include the results for
the other coverages coupled with the impact of an increase in average earned premium, the underlying combined ratio
improved slightly to 93.4 from 93.7 in the second quarter of 2011. We continue to gain approval for rate changes this
quarter with 19 states approved at an average in those states of 4.4%, for a country-wide impact of 1.5%.
With maintaining auto profitability being a key priority for us, we added the next slide to give you a longer term view
of this key metric. Since 2001, we have produced strong profitable underwriting margins in the Allstate brand standard
auto, averaging a combined ratio for the last 11 years of about 93. The chart on the bottom of the page gives you the

underlying combined ratio since 2008 by quarter and year. While there's some seasonal fluctuation, the pattern of
profitable margins is evident. It has been and will continue to be very important for us to maintain auto profitability.
Before moving on to homeowner loss trends, we made a commitment to you to provide an update on Esurance. Details
for Esurance underwriting results can be found on page 24 of our investor supplement. Growth accelerated in the
second quarter, with premiums written of $224 million. Keep in mind that seasonally the first quarter tends to be the
highest quarter of the year in terms of premium volume. Policies in force grew to 892,000, up 13.5% since year-end
2011. The underlying combined ratio was 106, including 16.2 points of advertising expense. The recorded combined
ratio for the quarter was 116.7. Overall, Esurance is performing as we expected.
On slide 7, we provide charts on homeowner rate activity, loss trends and profitability. In the upper left, we show the
country-wide rate effect of the approved rate actions over time. As I mentioned previously in the second quarter, we
received approval for rate changes in seven states averaging 10.2% worth 1.2% on a country-wide basis. So over the
last four quarters, we have averaged over 8% on a country-wide basis, a level consistent with the last few years.
In the upper right, we display the frequency and the paid severity trends excluding catastrophes. In the second quarter,
frequency declined 6.7% compared to the prior year while paid severity increased 2%. Given these modest loss cost
trends, coupled with approved rate actions, the underlying combined ratio shown in the lower left declined by 4.8
points to 64.6. The combined ratio, the reported combined ratio for the second quarter was still unprofitable at 104.9.
We will continue to focus on improving the margins in homeowners.
Taking a closer look at the underlying combined ratio for Allstate brand homeowners on the next slide, the top chart
provides the results for the underlying combined ratio by quarter. The underlying combined ratio began to improve in
the back half of 2011 and continued into the first two quarters of 2012. The chart on the bottom of the slide provides
some insight into this improving trend. It plots the percent increase in the average earned versus the underlying loss
trend.
It also answers the question, with all the rate increases Allstate has taken, why hasn't the underlying combined ratio
improved faster. First, looking at the earned premium line in red, we observe that the increasing trend beginning in
early 2011, one that is more reflective of the approved rate action levels. It takes time for the rate changes to be earned
because it's an annual policy. Second, the loss trend in blue essentially matched the change in the average earned, so the
underlying combined ratio didn't show much improvement until the last year and a half. So the improvement we have
experienced in the underlying combined ratio was driven by rates being earned and by favorable loss trends.
Results for Allstate Financial on slide 9 are reflective of our efforts to improve returns while shifting the focus from
spread-based to underwritten products. In the second quarter, total premiums and contract charges increased 2.2% from
prior year, with underwritten products up 3.1% from the second quarter of 2011.
Allstate agencies increased like unit sales with issued policies growing 2.5% compared to the prior year quarter.
Operating income of $138 million increased 2.2% from the prior year, helped by the inclusion of equity method limited
partnership results this year as well as lower crediting rates that were partially offset by worse mortality in both life
insurance and annuities, lower yields on fixed income securities and the continued managed reduction in spread
business.
Net income of $132 million declined relative to last year, driven by a reduction in net realized capital gains. Operating
returns on attributed equity were relatively consistent with the first quarter 2012 levels. Life insurance returns were
10.8%, accident and health were at 16.3%, and annuities came in at 5.9% as of the end of the second quarter. The
overall return was 8.7%, 0.4 points better than year-end 2011.
With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.

Thanks, Bob. We continue to proactively balance portfolio yield and return objectives in this challenging low rate
market environment, delivering a total portfolio return for the second quarter of 1.8% on a GAAP accounting basis and
3.8% through the first six months of the year. On slide 10, we can see the size and composition of our overall portfolio.
Improved fixed income valuations, portfolio income and positive cash flows from our property liability business more
than offset the ongoing managed reduction of Allstate Financial's spread business. These factors combined to raise the
portfolio valuation to $97.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, compared to $95.6 billion a year ago in 2011 and
$97 billion as of the first quarter.
Our portfolio actions during the second quarter continue to focus on optimizing our fixed income portfolio position on
the yield curve, shifting more toward the intermediate term part of the curve and favoring corporate credit over
treasuries and equities. You can see the result of these actions, which reduces reinvestment risk and will preserve
capital when interest rates begin to increase in the asset allocation breakout, as well as the scheduled maturity profile.
Slide 11 highlights portfolio income and yield trends. For the second quarter of 2012, net investment income was just
over $1 billion, comparable to the second quarter of 2011, and total portfolio yield was 4.6%, higher than the second
quarter of 2011 and consistent with the first quarter of 2012.
Limited partnership results were the primary driver of the favorable variance to the prior year quarter. You may
remember that we prospectively changed our classification of equity method limited partnership results to net
investment income from realized capital gains at the beginning of the year. This brought us more in line with reporting
practices of our peers.
Investment income provided from limited partnerships was $107 million in the quarter, comparable to the total from the
first quarter and $89 million higher than the prior year quarter. The increase reflects the change in classification, as well
as an improvement of $34 million in limited partnership performance. If our equity method limited partnership results
had not been reclassified, second quarter 2012 net investment income and portfolio yield would have been lower than
the prior year quarter as seen from the chart on the bottom of the slide and consistent with the reduction in Allstate
Financial's liabilities and lower interest rates.
On slide 12, you can see that we realized gains of $27 million in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of $30 million
compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our portfolio management actions and other trading activities generated
approximately $70 million in trading gains from the sales of fixed income and equity securities, which were offset by
$50 million in write-downs for the quarter.
Impairment and intent write-downs continue to trend significantly lower than prior year periods. Derivative results
reflect reduced usage as we are focusing the management of rate risk and the cash market to portfolio positioning on
the yield curve.
We finished the quarter in a strong capital position as shown on slide 13. Shareholders' equity of $19.5 billion increased
$1.2 billion from year-end 2011. Statutory surplus for both property liability and life remain strong, and deployable
assets at the holding company level were $2.3 billion.
We continue to buy back our stock, purchasing $275 million during the second quarter. That leaves $319 million on our
current $1 billion authorization. Our book value per share hit a new high of $39.73 on the strength of our operating
performance, improved portfolio valuation and active capital management.
Now, let's open it up for your questions.

<Q - Bob Ray Glasspiegel>: Good morning, everyone. A quick question on homeowners that I've asked before, what
inning do you think you are in, in the cleaning of this business? And I guess put another way, how many more quarters
do you think we'll be hearing that aggregate premium growth or PIP growth was held back by homeowner's actions? It
seems like your underlying is getting close to the low 60s this quarter, and your – I thought the relatively low cat ratio
of 12 points versus your peers was an encouraging quarter relative to your cat management programs. So where do you
think you are, Tom?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, Bob, if nothing else, you're consistent. So thank you for that. As we said, look, this is
a business we have about $6 billion of capital up in. We're looking to get in the mid-teens kind of returns on our capital.
So we obviously have a ways to go. Matt can talk specifically about what he's doing. I will say I feel very good about
the results in the underlying trends we see. Clearly, we had a little bit of benefit, I think, lower fire losses and a few
things this quarter. But the geographical focus Matt has brought to the business has been quite good and he can talk
about sort of the things he has going there. So Matt?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Sure. Thanks for question, Bob. I usually tell people if I could predict the weather patterns,
both cat and non-cat, I could tell you what inning we're in, but until then and since I can't, I can't really give you an
answer to what inning we're in. I can tell you how we're approaching the business, though. This may not surprise you,
but like politics, this business is entirely local, and it's like playing a game of whack-a-mole at the amusement park.
Everywhere you turn, something pops up and you have to deal with it aggressively. And as Tom said, we've decided
that trying to have one person with a club managing all of these interactions is impossible.
So we pushed some of the decision making down to the more local level and empowered local management, state
managers and people who can watch individual geographies, not just by state but even within a state, to manage and
react to trends very quickly as opposed to trying to manage them all from a centralized basis. And so that has enabled
us, I think, to react very quickly to trends as they emerge. So the things that we're watching pop up may be somewhat
unexpected, but they're still manageable. And in some cases, we've been able to react so quickly that they don't even
emerge as micro-trends, much less macro-trends.
So we'll continue to approach the game that way. Depending upon how weather pans out and how a couple of other
factors pan out, we'll determine how soon we're through some of the stabilization mode and get into the growth mode
that we all want to be in. But we know our task, and that's to get rate adequate, manage our volatility, create a
sustainable base for growth and then focus on that growth.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: And Matt, I think we're down about 200,000 policies in homeowners, I think first six
months, is a close number. I don't think you should see that rate of decline change in the second half of the year, in fact,
it may be a little higher as Matt does some specific targeted actions that he talked about. So we feel good about it, but
we're not there yet. As Matt said, he's not ready to turn on the spigot just yet.
<Q - Bob Ray Glasspiegel>: Well, expect the same question next year at this time.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay. We'll count on it, Bob.
<Q - Bob Ray Glasspiegel>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore Partners. Your question, please.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Hi, good morning. Great job on the quarter, by the way. The first question is from the expense
ratio. That's been picking up because you've been taking rate, which is a good thing. But any sense for any specific
projects that you plan to reduce the expense ratio?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I'll make a general comment and then Don can speak about what we're doing in advertising
in Esurance, and Matt can talk about the work he's doing. We obviously look hard at our expenses all the time, Vinay,
as you would expect, and we're always trying to reduce expenses and shift those to where we need to put them. Part of

the reason for our increase in expense ratio would be the Esurance increased advertising. We also spent a little bit more
money in advertising in the Allstate brand this quarter as well. Matt has a number of programs going on though to
simplify and reduce costs. So Don, maybe you want to start and then Matt, you jump in to yours.
<A - Don Civgin>: Sure, Vinay. Of course, Esurance has a slightly different business model than Allstate does since so
much of the expenses are acquisition related and charged up front. And so as we have grown the business, and that
growth has been pretty substantial here in the second quarter with new policy sales are up over 30%, as that happens,
what happens is you're expensing a lot of advertising expense up front, which obviously has an impact on the expected
impact on the combined ratio for Esurance.
I would tell you the integration is going quite well. The other expenses are coming down as we expected them to, so
we're getting the efficiencies and we're getting the savings we expected from the acquisition. We are intentionally
spending the money on advertising, quite honestly, because the response has been so strong to it, and we're seeing some
very solid growth. So you will see a tick up in the combined ratio, but what's important for you to understand is we are
looking at this from an economic combined ratio, and if you allocate those acquisition expenses through the life of the
contract, the business that Esurance is writing is combined ratio under 100. It's actually quite attractive business. On a
GAAP basis, it's going to raise the combined ratio for some period of time. But that's what happens with that
accounting model and high growth levels.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes, Vinay, it's Matt. So I'll give you a little perspective on the expense ratio and how we're
approaching it. We look at this as two prongs, and we don't believe that you can manage the expense ratio just by
managing down and cutting expenses. Because if you do that, actually, you so constrain growth that you'll actually hurt
the expense ratio. So we're trying to do a balanced approach to managing the expense ratio through targeted efforts on
growth and pruning out all the unnecessary and non-value added expenses in the business.
Most of that is through simplification of workflows. I have a team working with my back office right now focusing on
removing handoffs, simplifying processes, dramatically reducing service level agreement times, and taking out
expenses through productivity, as opposed to reducing expenses through other efforts that might impact growth. So
we're looking at this in kind of a balanced way. We think we're making some good progress on it, but we don't want to
try to cut our way to success there, because we think it'll be counterproductive in the long term.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Vinay, this is Tom. And if you look forward, as I know you always do, as we look forward
to next year, you should expect us to continue to compete aggressively in the marketplace, as both Matt and Don just
talked about. We're also going to have to spend more money on technology because all of the customer segments we
talk about, whether they be the Allstate agency local advice and assistance or Esurance, are adapting to new
technologies quickly. So we're going to probably spend more money on technology as we move forward next year.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay. That's helpful. The second question is on PIF. Could you help us understand how you're
looking at PIF as you get into the back half of this year and early next year, especially considering that the new
commission structure for agents is going to come up to force on January 1 next year?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Maybe I'll make a comment about all the different businesses. Matt can talk about the
commission stuff, and maybe Matt, you want to talk about sort of agency relationships because that's related to it as
well.
So obviously, we expect Esurance to keep growing. We like what we got there. Don talked about that. Encompass has
started to grow, but they got a long way to go to get back to where we were. So I'm hopeful they'll continue to push
their packaged policy growth. The Allstate channel we've talked about at length in terms of the headwinds of the
homeowners business and what's going on in New York and Florida, we should start to cycle through those. But I don't
think you should expect to see dramatic growth in PIF there.
Allstate Financial, we continue to make some progress on life sales and the Allstate benefit business. And then you
should expect to see the size, this is not really related to PIF, but the size of the fixed annuity business continue to come
down. We're down to about 4% or $1.5 billion so far this year. We would expect that business to keep coming down, if
you're just thinking about growth in total as a company. Matt, maybe you want to talk about the commission structure

or agency relationships?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Sure. I want to make sure I understood the question. So if this is not the answer to your
question, please follow up again. But you mentioned the change in commission structure as if that was going to impact
PIF and our ability to grow. And in reality, the primary change that's taking place in January is a simple variable comp
piece that's been drawn in as part of the overall commission structure. And that variable comp piece, that 1%, is earned
back by the agents through a series of fairly simple and very controllable actions on their part about physical presence
and the location and what it looks like, having sufficient number of licensed sales professionals to support the agent,
maintaining continuing education credits and things that are manageable, within their control. And in addition, they'll
have the ability to earn an extra 1% based upon customer experience results and customer satisfaction through a survey.
So I don't anticipate that the change in commission structure will impact PIF in any meaningful way. My expectation is
that it will improve customer experience and align the interests of our agencies and the company and the policyholders
together in a more productive manner. The collateral or tangential question you raise is agency relationships, and that
has impacted PIF to some extent in that they have been distracted a little bit by the change in commission structure, as
they were learning it and trying to understand its impact and trying to figure out how to manage their cash flows.
We have had an aggressive agent re-engagement strategy underway for the last several months. It began with a fairly
massive gathering at the national forum in Las Vegas, where we had over 4,400 agencies present, and the vast, I would
say over 40% of whom had never been to a national conference before any time in their history of affiliation with
Allstate. So we managed to pull together a bunch of people who do not typically have the opportunity to hear from
management, learn best practices from each other and share and develop. And that was used as an opportunity to give
people a chance to ask questions about the new commission structure and the new bonus structure, to learn about it,
figure out how they can maximize their own compensation and get their heads back in the game.
It's been productive. It hasn't solved everything yet. We understand how important agency morale is. We know it's
critical that they understand how much we believe in them and how much we want them to be successful. And we will
continue to work on it and align with them, and our goal and belief is that we can make these compensation changes in
a positive way without negatively impacting anything.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Fair enough. Yes, sorry, go ahead.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We did a survey after the event, and in the 80% to 90% said that we feel good about the
company. We think management understands us. We're feeling good about where we're going to go. So you would
rather be at 100% rather than in the 80% to 90%s, but if you look at a large geographically dispersed and diverse
workforce, we recognize we have room to improve. But it's also not as – you have to listen to the broad set of opinions
as opposed to just the noisiest ones.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Fair enough. Just as a follow-up to that, I mean, my concern was just that as you approach the
Jan. 1 date, you might get some more requests for terminations from agents, just because they don't want to move to a
lower commission structure, and should that affect the PIF. So that was really my question.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes, well, let me clarify. It's not a low commission structure. It's actually an opportunity to
earn a higher commission through certain activities and customer satisfaction. And we believe strongly that once they
understand that and see how achievable it is and they see their true earnings potential, that it will actually be helpful to
attracting and retaining more agencies as opposed to a catalyst for departures.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay. Thank you.

goal prior to 2014?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Jay, we are still 2 points and $19 billion is a ways to go. And so it's, you are talking about
$600 million or so by the time you sort through it all, and so we have some work to go. We still feel good about it.
Obviously we have the headwind which when we made that projection of interest rates are a lot lower, so we had to
work our way through that. But we still feel good about getting the 13% by 2014. To the extent we get there sooner,
we'll just make our shareholders even happier.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. And then on the underlining combined ratio guidance, I struggle to remember whether if it
had come in better than your range, if you had changed the guidance over time.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I'm not sure I, so -
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: It's coming in better, clearly, in the first half compared to the guidance range.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Yes.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Is there a point at which you might improve the guidance range?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We put the guidance out there as 88 to 91. There's obviously a fair amount of bouncing
around because of frequency, which can move 1 point on you either way which translates right into 1 point. So we have
had good frequency so far this year. It is a full year number. Don't feel like changing it right now. And it's just one
component of what we try to do. You know what, I would really ask you to focus on the four priorities we have, and
say are we delivering on those four priorities. We provide that guidance to help people do their analysis, but as you are
well aware, that is only a small piece of what overall results are. It doesn't include catastrophes. It doesn't include
investment income. It doesn't include all of Allstate Financial's stuff. So there's a lot of pieces missing. So I'm not
inclined to change it right now, because it's a full year number. But I like where we are at. I'm feeling good about the
business right now.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay, and then finally switching gears to property liability, net investment income, it was up
pretty meaningfully on the linked quarter basis, $352 million versus $313 million. I realize limited partnership had a
benefit there, but the pick-up in taxable non – the taxable fixed income was also a benefit. So I'm just trying to get a
sense of what do you feel the right normalized quarterly run rate is there?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, that's a complicated question. Maybe I can get Judy to talk about – Judith, you talk
about the difference in sort of what we have done in repositioning the portfolio into the intermediate part of the curve,
what we do with equities and at the end of the first quarter. And then maybe talk a little bit about the role and what we
have going on over the next sort of 12 months. That might help Jay get to his number. I don't think, we're not going to
give you a specific number but Judy can give you those components which will help get you there.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: So when you look at it with LPs and without LPs, you are right, we are doing okay in both. I
would say without LPs, it's stabilized as well. And as Tom mentioned, we are doing a lot in terms of optimizing the
portfolio. And one of the things we did in the first quarter which we might have mentioned before, was that we sold
some equities and bought high yields in the property and casualty company. We liked that trade from an economic
perspective. And it also has helped investment income on year-to-date and what we have also done is continued to
optimize the portfolio on the interest rate curve. So over the past several quarters, what we've done is we've sold near
term maturities and sold longer duration maturities because we are still concerned about long-term interest rates
eventually going up and where we've really focused our efforts in the intermediate part of the curve, 5 to 7 year
maturities. So that's helped us maintain our income but it's also helped preserve the income going forward, because we
will have less coming off the portfolio than what we would have had we not done anything.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: I see. All right. So if I look at that $352 million for the quarter, was there anything in there you
would view as extraordinary in the quarter?
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: No, except for the LPs. I think LPs are more difficult to project and we had a pretty good first
quarter in the equity market and that might have pulled some of what we thought was going to happen throughout the

year forward. And you have to remember that we report those on a lag and the second quarter equity market wasn't as
good as the first quarter. So the LP component is going to be a little bit more volatile. We are focused on both, yet I
think we have also seen some stability because of some of the actions we have taken in the core portfolio as well.

Our next question is from Michael Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Thanks. Good morning. So in the prepared remarks the term moderate was used in
regards to the rise in auto loss cost trends. But when I look on paper, it looks like the rise largely in frequency was
somewhat steep. So could you provide color on what could be driving the increase and could you also comment on
whether non-cat weather costs were lower this quarter versus in 2Q 2011. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Non-cat. So let me just get to the right page. When you were looking at -
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: I was looking at slide 5.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Slide 5 and you are looking at the gross frequency numbers.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Correct.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: That's a percent change year over year. So I think maybe I will make a general comment.
We obviously try to factor in severity and frequency into our pricing. Matt can talk about how he's doing that. I don't
see anything particularly abnormal in this.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes. So, it is true that you saw some unfavorable trends there, but just remember that 2011
and the beginning of 2012 were both at the low end of the historical bound. So the rise looks disproportionate, but it is
clearly within historical volatility bounds. There are certain geographies that were impacted by ex-cat weather which
drove frequencies higher, such as Texas where we had a bunch of issues. Not only was Texas the site of three of the
four largest cats, but also had a lot of ex-cat weather that drove frequency.
So as I said, we monitor the quality of our book on a fairly micro basis. As these emerge, if we can't explain them or
they weren't predictable, then we take immediate action to manage them. So we don't feel concerned about it, but we're
certainly watching these as they emerge. But as I said in an earlier response, I think some people have interpreted some
of these as large macro trends and the more we look at them, they are very, very locally based micro trends that
influence a larger number. Tom and I talk all the time about how averages lie. And so we don't look at the overall
average number. We look at the micro targeted local numbers and those are within expectations and within historical
bounds.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay. And next, so $320 million left in the buyback authorization. Is that tracking ahead
of expectations and would the board consider increasing the program before year-end?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: It's a little faster than we had originally planned on. We thought the price was cheap, so we
kept buying it back and we were generating enough capital and have plenty of capital at the holding company level to
do that. So we got on top of it early and aggressively. The way we do it is when we get close to the end of the program,
then we go back and look at whether we want to do a new one. But we typically finish a program, then start a new one
as opposed to sort of continually increase the size of the existing program.
As you know, we have traditionally done that in February when we have a good read on statutory capital for the year,
and where it came out. Last year of course, we accelerated that because we again thought the price was cheap and were
buying it back. As soon as we get done with this one, we'll sit down with the board and look at it again. I think you
should expect our philosophy to stay the same, which is if we have capital that's not being deployed in the business, we
believe it's the shareholders' capital, and we will pay that back out to the shareholders. Largely we have done that

through share repurchases over the last 15 years and obviously dividends eat up about $450 million a year as well.
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: And we do generally front end load the programs a bit before the hurricane season. So if you
look, we had the same basic trend a year ago also.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: That's a good point.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay, and if I could slip one last one in as a follow up to the previous caller's question,
the new money fixed income yields, would you be able to comment on that? Thank you very much.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: The reinvest yields for the Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial?
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Correct.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: So for Allstate Protection, we target again the 5 to 7 year part of the curve. Corporates right
now we'd say that's around 2.5% to 2.75%. And then for AF, it's longer than that, it's more 7 to 10 year. Corporates
something over 3%. But remember in AF, because the contract holder funds are coming down in the annuity segment,
we don't have much reinvest risk there. Really, we are pretty well matched maturities versus what we expect will come
off in terms of liabilities.

Our next question is from Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.
<Q - Alison Marnie Jacobowitz>: Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered but I was wondering if you
could possibly give some commentary around what maybe you are seeing your competitors do or the peers do in auto.
We've heard them indicating severity pressures a little bit more than you have. So are you seeing more rate actions
there?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Alison, this is Tom. Matt might want to make some comments as well. We can't speak to
specifically to what their strategies are. Certainly the decreases people were taking back in the 2008 period of time
when we don't see people doing that, we see more modest small increases. If you look over a longer period of time, so
if you look at our results from 2007 say forward to today, average premium hasn't really gone up much. We've done a
much better job of getting our pricing right for our customers on an individual basis. Frequency has been down a little
bit. Severity has been up modestly. We've controlled it from our standpoint. I think some of our competitors have been
recently talking about higher increases. But that's again back to Matt's point, averages lie. If they got a bunch of
business in Florida and they messed up, then they got to raise it. I don't know Matt, if you see anything different in the
marketplace.
<A - Matthew Winter>: No, I can't really comment on the competitors. So I will just continue to comment on our
approach, which is I think really one of the benefits of our structure and the way we operate, which is the locally based
decision making and monitoring by both state managers, controllers, regional senior vice presidents. Those teams are
able to focus differently and focus more quickly when trends emerge. They also know based upon the local geographies
what to expect. So they know for instance when you aggressively push on BI, or PIP in some states, BI will pop up
next, and they are prepared for that and they get ready for that. And so all I can say is we are managing both frequency
and severity, and dealing with it through appropriate rate, correct class, the typical underwriting discipline that you
would expect to see from Allstate.
<Q - Alison Marnie Jacobowitz>: Thank you.

The next question is from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital. Your question, please.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Hi, just a couple of follow ups. On the homeowners, Tom, I think going back to Investor
Day a year or so ago, the goal was sort of a low to mid-60s underlying combined and you are now at basically a
mid-60s now and you are still taking a lot of rate and loss costs seem to be getting a little bit more favorable. Is it
possible you overshoot that and we could see even better than what your goal is?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Ian, thanks for remembering and I would say, it's always possible but probably not likely.
One of the things impacting this year is mix. There's a lot fewer fire losses in the first half of this year. Fire losses tend
to have very high average severity and so that can rattle through your paids. We also had some, a high number in paids
in the second quarter of 2011. So the decrease is really because of the lawsuit, the decrease is not as big as it appears to
be.
So I think last quarter Matt said he thought about 40% was sustainable, 60% was sort of one time. I don't know what
your percentage is this quarter, but I would say we're happy where we are at. We like where we are going. If we
overshoot, given the volatility of this business, it's possible some quarters we could make lots of money. But as I think
we said at investor conference, our goal is to take this business from sometimes earning a profit to sometimes losing a
profit to always making some money. Sometimes a lot of money, sometimes not so much money, but move it from the
plus or minus category to the plus or plus plus category so that we get a decent return on our capital.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Great. And then switching to the auto side, it seems like there's some concern about rising
loss cost trends in the industry. I know you addressed it a little bit earlier. But just within the context of you also
obviously talked about raising prices commensurately. I mean do you feel comfortable that the pricing you put through
year-to-date has incorporated the loss trend we have seen so far? Or have we seen a little bit of a surprise and maybe
we might be behind the curve for a little bit and we have to keep filing for more rate?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Thanks for the question, Ian. It's Matt. No, we feel comfortable that the rates that we've put in
place have reflected the trends as they emerge. Obviously we don't know what trends are going to emerge tomorrow
and next month. And if they are outside of the bounds, we'll reflect those in the next set of rate taking or underwriting
actions. But again, we haven't been that surprised. BI and PD severities performed within expectations for the quarter.
BI moved with the medical CPI as we would have expected.
We did get – there's been a lot of I guess conflicting information out there about used car prices, Manheim Index shows
a decrease in second quarter after rising first quarter. I know one of the analysts posted something about the CarMax
Index. So there's a lot of variation in there. There's things that are transitioning but we feel good about our rates that we
have taken. Obviously some geographies, some states are more challenged in taking appropriate rate and it's harder for
us there. And others, we have more flexibility and the ability to accurately reflect what's happening.
But our goal is, and I would say this not only for auto, but for homeowners in response to your first question. We're
trying to charge the right rate. It's all about charging appropriately for the risk we are taking, and earning an appropriate
margin and providing the customer with a fair value. And so we'll continue to try to move with that philosophy.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: And competitively, are you seeing any signs that maybe your close rates are starting to go up
or anything that suggests – I mean, it does seem a lot of your competitors are sort of struggling with this change in loss,
trying to maybe have to change your appetite. Has that started to translate for real-time yet or not so?
<A - Matthew Winter>: We have seen some fluctuation in certain states, but I would say it's too early before I could
comment on it, and tell you I see something that's material and sustainable.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Great. Thank you so much.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We'll do what we always do, which is if cat losses are over $150 million, I think it's the third
Thursday after the close of the month, we put the number out. I think we are just closing the month right now. So I
don't have anything to add there.
<Q - Alan H. Straus>: Okay, just I'll ask a second question. Given the capital management, the earnings are a little bit
ahead of schedule. Would you expect to go to your board a little sooner than you expected to for to re-up the buyback?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, I think Steve mentioned that traditionally, it was a good addition to the answer that I
gave on long term, we believe in giving money back to shareholders. We do it sort of annually. We do try to get ahead
of it and then we back off a little bit during hurricane season. We're just headed August, September, October tend to be
the biggest hurricane months. So we probably won't be as aggressive in those three months. But yes, as soon as we are
done with this one, then if we have extra capital and the board approves, we will do another one. I mean it's been our –
the amount we bought back, I don't know, over the last 15 years like.
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: Over $20 billion.

be able to deploy it where they would like to.

Your next question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Yes thank you, good morning everyone. I'm going to pull a Glasspiegel here and ask the
same question I asked last conference call. I can tell from the numbers though that your auto-only PIF growth is up.
You said to me you didn't know last quarter. I can tell you, you are growing in auto-only PIF and I'm wondering if you
can have some color about growth rates going on and where you think that's headed.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Josh, auto-only PIF, are you talking – so we have – we would break it into pieces, right? So
we'd have the Esurance piece, which we said is up 13.5% this year. The Allstate brand is down in actual PIF count. The
Encompass brand is up a little, but it's not a – I think it might be like 20,000 or something like that. And Canada is up a
little. Is there other color other than those component pieces?
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: So when you say Allstate brand is down, that includes policies that were non-renewed
with a homeowner as well as policies that were sold as standalone?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Yes.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: It would be – yes. Maybe this will – if you look at those – maybe Matt wants to comment on
the growth rate in three different categories. So there's Florida and New York. That's one separate auto business. There
is those homeowner markets where he and his team are hitting it hard to try to get our return back. Then there are all
other. That might I think provide some color for you in terms of helping you analyze where you think that's going to
go.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Hopefully, it's a better answer than last quarter.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: I'd like auto only, but you know, whatever. Go for it. Let's here the different
[indiscernible] (57:47)
<A - Matthew Winter>: The good news, Josh, is at least we're trying to answer yours. We didn't try to answer Bob's.
So let me try to break it down the way Tom suggested. First, New York and Florida, obviously our auto [ph] PIF
(58:01) in both states has continued to decline. We are focused on margin improvement actions in those states. We are
seeing some pockets even within New York, we had a new rating plan put in a few months ago. We are seeing pockets
of growth there, but when you look at the entire state, you still have a decline.
And then as Tom said, if you break down the country and our geographies into those areas where we are taking
significant homeowners rate and it's impacting auto growth versus those geographies where we are not taking
significant homeowners rate or we are not having significant non-renewals due to inspections, there is a substantial
difference. There's certainly a big correlation between those homeowners actions in certain states and the impact on
auto.
But I don't want to over generalize and say everywhere that we look at monoline only, we're managing to grow. There
are certainly pockets where we are growing and growing nicely. Some of those are due to new rating plans. Some of
those are due to competitiveness due to changes from some of our key competitors, as one of the earlier speakers asked
about.
I just, I would caution you on over generalizing anything here. We will have pockets of growth and as we stabilize the
actions we are taking on homeowners, it will free up capacity on the auto side. But recall that our target market has
historically been multi-car homeowners. And so when you take homeowners actions, you are hitting your target market
because they bought multiple policies from us. And so I guess that's the best I can answer that, because I'm not sure I'm
seeing the exact trend you are referring to.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Well, I think it was a good answer. What a difference a year makes. My hats off to you.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Thanks, Josh. Should we do one more question?

Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS. Your question, please.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Thanks. I will make it quick here. The first one, I think you may have answered this
already, but the decline in the homeowners frequency that we are seeing right now, how much of that would you
attribute it to underwriting initiatives versus just lower non-cat weather going on so far this year?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Matt, do you want to take that one?
<A - Matthew Winter>: I'm not sure I can give you a percentage. I'd say it's mixed. It's reinspections, correct class
actions, non-renewals as well as ex-cat weather. So I'm not sure I have a the breakdown. Bob, do you?
<A - Robert Block>: No.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I think it's on a quarter to quarter basis. I would say there's – when you look at the mix, as
we talked about fire, some stuff we got a break on for weather and we may not get a break on that next quarter, but
[indiscernible] (61:44).
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes, I mean, fire and ex-cat is at a four-year low. I'm not sure we can expect it to stay at a
four-year low on a long-term basis, and so we have been benefited. If I had to guess, I'd say it's a combination of both
factors, maybe 50/50, maybe 60/40 and I couldn't tell you exactly which is the 60%, which is the 40%.

Well, thank you all for participating today. The second quarter was, as we said was a strong quarter despite the heavy
weather activity. We achieved progress on all four of our priorities, and we look forward to talking you to next quarter.
Thanks very much.
