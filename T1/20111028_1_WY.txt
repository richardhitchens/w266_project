Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation
of special items. In the discussion of the business segments, I will refer to charts 4 through 10. Chart 4: changes in
contribution to earnings by segment before special items. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business
segment from second quarter 2011 to third quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the third quarter refer to changes
from the second quarter unless otherwise noted. We begin our business segment discussion of the third quarter with
Timberlands, charts 5 and 6.
In the third quarter, Timberlands contributed $62 million to pre-tax earnings, $50 million less than in Q2. $28 million
of the decrease was the result of lower earnings from non-strategic land sales. Third quarter land dispositions were $4
million, compared to $32 million in the second quarter. Average third-party price realizations in the west declined 5%
as a weakening Chinese market exerted downward pressure on domestic and export prices. In the south, average
third-party price realizations declined slightly.
Fee harvest volumes were flat in the quarter. Volumes were down in the west as the Chinese export market softened.
Volumes rose in the south. Costs were seasonally higher. These increases were due to road construction in the west and
silviculture spending in the south.
Wood Products, charts 7 and 8, continuing operations in Wood Products lost $43 million, $10 million less than second
quarter. Lumber price realizations were flat. Price realizations for OSB and Engineered Solid Section declined slightly.
Engineered I-joist price realizations rose slightly. Operating rates in Q3 were flat in lumber, improved in OSB, and
were slightly lower in engineered wood products.
Restructuring and impairment charges were $38 million, primarily related to the permanent closure of four previously
idled engineered wood products facilities. This was offset by a $5 million gain on the sale of properties. Charges
related to the sale of discontinued operations were $13 million in Q3.
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. Third quarter Cellulose Fibers pre-tax contribution to earnings was $135 million, $55 million
higher than second quarter. Average pulp price sales realizations declined 4% or $40 per metric ton. Pulp sales volumes
were flat. Maintenance costs was lower and pulp reduction increased 13%. There were no maintenance outages during
the third quarter. There were four scheduled annual maintenance outages in the second quarter.
Real estate, Chart 10. Real estate contributed $10 million to pre-tax earnings, $2 million more than second quarter.
Single family closings increased seasonally from 459 homes in Q2 to 508 homes in Q3. The average price on homes
closed during the quarter increased $12,000 to $403,000. This increase was due to mix. Margins on single family
homes closed also increased due to mix.
Corporate and Other, excluding discontinued operations, Corporate and Other was $5 million lower in Q3. Foreign
exchange charges, primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, reduced Corporate and Other by $18
million. This was partially offset by $7 million of additional gains related to share-based compensation. A decline in
the company's stock price during the quarter resulted in a larger mark-to-market adjustment. Discontinued operations
included a loss from operations of $4 million and gains of $58 million on the sale of Westwood and properties in the
third quarter. Discontinued operations had a charge of $11 million in second quarter.
I would now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Despite a more challenging macroeconomic
environment than we anticipated just three months ago, I'm pleased to report that our quarterly performance improved
as increased earnings from three of our four businesses offset an anticipated earnings decline in our Timberlands
business. In addition to overall factors affecting the U.S. and world economies, the two most significant external factors
affecting our quarterly performance are the same as they were last quarter: U.S. housing and China. I'd like to comment
on these overall themes first and then I'll discuss activity in each of our businesses during the quarter. Following my
remarks, Patty will provide our business outlook on the fourth quarter, as well as financial comments.

First, let me talk about housing, three of our four businesses, Timberlands, Wood Products, and Real Estate are
impacted in varying degrees by current conditions in the U.S. housing market, which I described in this morning's
release as languishing. As we entered 2011, our planning assumption was that U.S. single family housing starts would
total 525,000 for the year, which would have been a modest increase over 2010 construction levels. As we sit here
today in late October, we currently estimate that we will end the year at a level of about 425,000, approximately 20%
below that planning assumption.
Long-term demographics continue to be compelling, but prospective home buyers today exhibit little sense of urgency.
This is a result of a lack of consumer confidence, continued high unemployment rates, concern about potential
downward price risk related to an overhang of foreclosed homes, and a desire to maintain employment mobility. One
last factor affecting home sales is interest rates. Because of Chairman Bernanke's statements, the market now expects
mortgage rates to remain low for an extended period of time. And while low rates are generally a positive for home
sales, the expectation of continued low rates give buyers yet another reason to put off a purchase decision.
Once a purchase agreement has been signed, prospective buyers face an increasingly difficult mortgage underwriting
process that causes many motivated and qualified buyers to move back to the sidelines and wait. Our political climate
has only added to uncertainty, and we see little evidence at this point that conditions will improve before next year's
spring selling season.
The glass-half-full side of me nevertheless sees some good news on the housing front. First, although we generally
don't highlight conditions in Canada, housing activity north of the border has been relatively stable at about 185,000
starts for the year. We produce for this healthy housing market through our lumber, OSB and engineered wood
products mills, several of which are located in Canada. Our Canadian mills also serve export markets, particularly off
the west coast.
Second, although U.S. single family housing starts are stagnant multi-family rental construction is relatively strong in
response to low vacancy rates and rapidly increasing rents.
Rental units are generally smaller than single family homes, but for the most part they are wood frame construction and
use the full range of wood products that we produce, lumber, OSB, and engineered wood. That's good news for our
Wood Products and our Timberlands.
Third, inventory levels of new homes have been at an all-time low, so any pick-up in new home sales will quickly lead
to increased construction activity. Although our forward planning assumptions are based upon today's level of starts,
we have the ability to flex all of our operations as markets improve, homebuilding, wood products manufacturing, and
in the woods.
Let me turn now to China before I provide some specific comments about quarterly performance in each of our
business segments. Growth in China affects three of our businesses: Timberlands, Wood Products, and Cellulose
Fibers. We have long-term experience selling products to China. Today, we sell logs, lumber and cellulose fibers to a
range of Chinese customers, and, although Japan has long been our primary Asian export market, sales to China have
increased significantly over the past 24 months.
On last quarter's call, I noted that we were beginning to see some pullback in both price and volume from China. Those
early indications of softness were realized in the third quarter as credit tightened and demand slowed. Our view is that
this slowdown is temporary, and we expect Chinese demand to return and to continue to grow over the longer term. In
the meantime, we should expect a greater level of volatility in our more traditional markets.
I'll begin my discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter with Timberlands. During the quarter, the
impact of slowing Chinese demand led to price declines. Volumes were relatively steady, but the falloff in Chinese log
prices had a ripple effect on the entire western log market. Export activity from our western timberlands during the
quarter was 40% of total volume, split among Japan, China, and Korea.
Our ability to access export markets from our western lands has long been a significant source of revenue and
competitive strength, and reduces somewhat our reliance on the U.S. housing market. During the quarter, we made

some progress towards additional market diversification from our other timberlands. We tested sales of southern yellow
pine logs from the U.S. south to Turkey and pine logs from Uruguay to China. These sales pale in significance
compared to our long-term west coast Asian markets, but they're a step in the right direction.
Turning to land transactions, the $28 million quarterly decrease in timberland dispositions, which was due to
transaction timing, negatively affected quarter-over-quarter timberland earnings. Our Minerals business remained a
steady performer during the quarter, contributing approximately $15 million. We continue to receive royalties for hard
minerals and from our oil and gas properties. These include both our Haynesville gas shale acreage, shale gas acreage
in North Louisiana and bonuses from new leases with shale oil potential in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale play that
crosses southern Louisiana.
In our Wood Products business, our initiatives to lower cost and improve performance are beginning to show results.
Even with weaker market conditions, our EBIT before special items improved $10 million over the quarter and $59
million over the prior year. As we entered the year, I told you that it was my expectation that our Wood Products
segment would be cash positive for the year based upon our housing construction forecast. The business was
cash-negative during the first quarter due to a seasonal build up in working capital, but we were cash positive in the
second quarter and in the third quarter as we continued to reduce working capital.
Given the downturn in housing that we've experienced, it is unlikely that we will meet our cash breakeven objective for
the year, but we're making progress, and it continues to be our focus as part of our return to profitability in this
segment.
We are pushing all levers available to us to improve our performance in Wood Products, focusing on revenue
enhancement, as well as cost reductions. As in our Timberlands business, in Wood Products, we continue to find
opportunities to diversify our sales outside North America especially from our Canadian mills. Export represent 38% of
our Canadian lumber volume. Japan is our largest export market with over 60% of export sales, shipments to China
have nearly tripled this year. I noted earlier that we're well-positioned in all of our wood products to meet the growing
activity in multifamily construction, and we're focused on growing share where we have competitive advantage based
upon our products and our geography. I'm impatient, but encouraged with our progress.
This morning we made the decision to permanently close our four previously curtailed engineered wood products
facilities, LVL [laminated veneer lumber] facilities in Albany, Oregon, and Simsboro, Louisiana, and veneer facilities
in Pine Hill, Alabama, and Dodson, Louisiana. This is another step in reducing the cost associated with closed facilities
that we concluded we will not need in the future based upon the pace of the housing recovery.
In our Real Estate segment, we turned in another profitable quarter on the strength of our single family operations.
During the second half of the year when we normally have increased closing activity, closings were up 11% over the
prior quarter while margins increased slightly due to mix. Although traffic during the quarter declined 27%
year-over-year, sales increased 5% as we continued to experience higher conversion rates. Local market conditions are
mixed. Our most active markets are Houston and the Maryland and the Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. Our
weakest markets are Southern California and Las Vegas. The most significant indicator of market strength today is
employment.
To give you a little local flavor, in Phoenix where single family permits are down 19% year-over-year, our sales are up
42%. The longer term good news for Phoenix is the job growth will approach 2% in 2011 and the existing home market
is remarkably strong, on track to exceed 95,000 transactions, compared with the prior peak of 92,000 in 2006.
In Houston, where home prices are stable, new home sales are down 30% from last year, but our sales increased 21%.
Similarly, in Washington D.C, new home sales activity is 20% lower than a year ago while our sales are up 23%.
Turning to our Cellulose Fiber segment, we continued to run well and had no planned maintenance downtime. Revenue
declined somewhat during the quarter due to price, as well as mix. Even with pressure from declining realizations, the
overall business result was a significant quarter-over-quarter earnings improvement.

I want to comment on progress on two other initiatives in our Cellulose Fiber segment, both are examples of executing
our strategy to grow with key global customers and to make disciplined investments to improve productivity of our
mills. In early August, we broke ground on our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk, Poland. Upon completion, an
estimated start-up in early 2013, this facility will convert fluff pulp from our mills in the U.S. south into a proprietary
raw material used in diaper manufacturing by a key global customer, supplementing existing production from a similar
facility in Columbus, Mississippi. At our Grand Prairie, Alberta pulp mill, we're generating surplus green electric
power from a new generator fueled by sustainable black liquor, converting an energy expense into energy income.
Lastly, during the quarter, we closed on the sale of our Hardwoods operations and our Westwood Shipping line. The
Hardwood sale, which closed on August 1, included seven Hardwood mills. Year-to-date, revenues from these
operations totaled $220 million and generated a $3 million operating loss.
Our Westwood sale closed on September 30. Year-to-date, revenues from this business were $180 million with no
earnings. The sale of these non-core businesses allows us to focus on our long-term strategic direction. As I noted last
quarter, we will maintain a relationship with our former associates as Hardwoods will continue to be a log customer
and will transport products to our Asian customers on Westwood Shipping Lines. We wish our former associates the
best of success with their new owners.
Now, I'll ask Patty to discuss our outlook and provide a financial summary, and then I'll have a quick recap before we
invite your questions. Patty?
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the fourth quarter by business segment is summarized on
Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. In our western operations, we expect lower selling prices
for logs as a result of a softening export market, reflecting the backup of log inventories into China. Fee harvest
volumes are also projected to be lower.
In the south, we anticipate that selling prices and fee harvest volumes will be flat as those markets did not experience
the same price increases earlier in the year as did the west. We expect growth costs and silviculture costs to increase
seasonally.
Excluding the effect of non-strategic land sales, we expect that earnings in our Timberland segment will be lower than
the third quarter. Earnings from non-strategic land sales will increase from the very low third quarter level.
Our Wood Products business is entering what is traditionally its slowest quarter of the year. Average sales realizations
are expected to decrease for both lumber and OSB as is typical of the seasonal slowdown in the housing market.
Sales realizations for engineered wood products will likely be flat. Sales volumes across all product lines are projected
to be lower. We expect additional production curtailments as we match supply with demand and incur the traditional
holiday downtime especially in our lumber system. As a result, per unit manufacturing costs are expected to increase
throughout our product lines, although log costs should be flat to slightly down. Overall, we anticipate the loss in our
Wood Products business to increase in the fourth quarter, compared to the third quarter of this year. However, we
expect that it will be less than the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting the improvements we are making in the business
as Dan described.
In our Cellulose Fiber segment, global softwood pulp demand is weakening as a result of the high level of industry
inventories and global economic uncertainty. We expect prices to soften in the fourth quarter, offset by slightly higher
shipment volumes. Costs are likely to be somewhat higher for fiber, chemicals and energy due to seasonal increases.
We will not have any annual maintenance shutdowns as we completed our scheduled maintenance in the first half of
this year. Overall, earnings in our Cellulose Fiber segment should be slightly lower in the fourth quarter, compared to
the third, and we expect to generate another record year of earnings in this segment.

In our Real Estate segment, home closings are anticipated to increase over the third quarter. The fourth quarter is
traditionally our strongest quarter for closings in our single family home building business. We expect approximately
600 closings, compared to 508 last quarter. Prices will likely be lower, offset by slightly higher margins due to mix.
Earnings in our single family home building business should be higher in the fourth quarter, compared to the third
quarter. In addition, we do have some land parcels for sale that have the potential to close in the fourth quarter.
However, they are none of significance under contract at this time.
One of our WRECO subsidiaries is a minority party to litigation relating to a joint venture in Nevada known as South
Edge. A reserve for this litigation of approximately $38 million was recorded in 2008. A plan of reorganization was
approved a few days ago, and we expect to make a payment of approximately $30 million in November in settlement of
the litigation.
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, starting with the special tax benefit booked in the third quarter.
During the third quarter, we made the decision to dividend earnings from our Canadian subsidiary to the United States.
This decision triggered our ability to recognize the tax benefit for the difference between the net amount of taxes paid
in previous years in Canada, which is allowed as a foreign tax credit in the United States and the U.S. taxes due as a
result of the dividend. Given our mix of taxable income in 2011, we will carry this benefit forward and anticipate
utilizing the credit over the next three to five years. The full amount of the benefit of $83 million was recognized as a
special item in the third quarter.
We ended the third quarter with cash of $971 million, an increase of approximately $90 million. Cash flow from
operations was $117 million and cash from the sale of assets was $157 million, primarily resulting from the sale of our
hardwoods and shipping operations. During the quarter, we invested $66 million in capital expenditures, which brings
our total expenditures through the third quarter to $159 million. We expect to spend approximately $100 million in the
fourth quarter, which is in line with our earlier guidance of $250 million to $270 million for the full year. We paid $81
million in dividends and repurchased just under 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $29 million, at an
average price of $16.41 a share. Approximately, $5 million of the cash settled after the end of the quarter.
These purchases helped offset the dilution from stock option exercises, investing of restricted stock that took place
earlier in the year. We did not have any debt repayments in the third quarter, and we have no further debt due until next
year. Earlier this month, we did repurchase approximately $12.5 million of medium-term notes due next year for less
than their face value. During the fourth quarter, we will contribute approximately $60 million to our Canadian qualified
pension plan.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions. Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Patty. Although the fourth quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter, as reflected in Patty's guidance, we have
made significant improvement throughout the year. We're not satisfied with our level of performance and every
business is focused on improving results in today's market. That means getting the right facility set, controlling costs,
and growing the top line. This morning you've heard examples of actions and results in each of these areas and I look
forward to sharing continuing progress in future quarters.
And now, we welcome your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the detail.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: A couple of questions on the progress that you still have ahead of you Dan. You've done a
nice job on SG&A, both sequentially and year-on-year, I think SG&A is down $26 million versus the year-ago quarter.
Wood Products are nearing breakeven EBITDA right now, forgetting about the working capital, source of cash. As we
think about what is possible, and if we hold the current environment constant, what further progress do you think you
can make on either of those line items over the next two to four quarters say?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Thanks, George. As I remind ourselves internally and I remind you, our focus is to improve
operations at today's level of starts. We continue to be optimistic and bullish about long-term recovery, but our
experience has shown over the last couple of years that we need to live with today's level of activity, and so that's been
our focus. We have, as you noted, continued to bring down our SG&A cost, that continues to be an ongoing focus. And
in our Wood Products business, our focus has been on, first of all, moving to cash positive and then earnings positive
range and in the Wood Products business that takes both cost management, but also top line growth.
So just couple of comments on SG&A, we make progress on SG&A as we continued to make decisions such as the sale
of our shipping business and our hardwood operations that we concluded in the quarter. That allows us to focus on our
ongoing operations. It does leave us with some overhead that we need to address that have supported those businesses,
but we've made great progress over the last several years in working down legacy costs and bringing down overall head
count across the company to become more efficient in everything that we do.
In our wood products operations, our focus across the entire system is to bring down operating cost, and that includes
manufacturing where we need and have made progress in improving the operating efficiency and utilization of our
facilities that is in part related to the decision that we made during the quarter to permanently shut down these four
facilities. We believe that we can move forward in the housing environment that we have with the facility set that we
have in place.
And then we have a number of initiatives to grow top line, some of that comes from increasing markets offshore as we
discussed this morning and some it comes from finding opportunities where we have perhaps pricing power, where we
have the ability to increase share based upon the products that we manufacture, based upon the location of our
operating facilities where we may be logistically advantaged to serve some markets. And as we look at the home
building business, focused more on mid-size and smaller builders where we can provide products efficiently and
cost-effectively.
We're also increasing some activity in repair and remodel market, going back into some locations where we have not
been active, where we have products that customers would like to sell, and where we have an advantaged situation
relative to our own manufacturing operations. So, it's an ongoing effort, one – whereas I said, this morning, I'm
somewhat impatient, but we're making progress, and it continues to be a focus and will continue to be one. This is not a
process where we get to a certain point and quit.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Sure.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: This is an ongoing effort to improve our cost-effectiveness and competitiveness and I'm
encouraged with the progress that we're making.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks for that, Dan. Maybe one follow-on and one additional question, I'll turn it over.
Given the fact that you may have some unabsorbed overhead, if I heard you correctly, might we see some temporary
lull in your ability to reduce SG&A or either an aggregate or within Wood Products or do you expect the trend, without
sizing it in dollar terms, to continue to be positive on a sequential and year-on-year basis?

<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The trend should be – should continue to be positive, George, I can't give you numbers and -
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Understand.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: And you let me off the hook on that one, I appreciate that. But it's going to be an ongoing
effort and every time we make some changes, we find more opportunities. So, I'm encouraged that the organization is
involved in a number of efforts in order to both reduce cost, but it – also I would reemphasize growing top line is
equally important.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. Quickly just on Chart 1, if I look at the detail there, I can come up with effectively
an operating pre-tax of about $54 million and I can come up with an operating income tax when I strip out the gain of
about $8 million, and when I add those two together I get to your EPS. Considering how much earnings were
contributed from Cellulose Fibers, I was just curious why you actually had a benefit in the quarter. Thanks, guys and
good luck in the quarter.
Operator
Our next question comes from -
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, George, we did have a tax benefit in the quarter.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: But the question, Pat, I guess is why considering how Cellulose Fibers was such a big piece
of it, of the earnings.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, I think the tax benefit is a function of two things, one it's what happens in the
quarter, as well as truing up the year-to-date effective rate. And maybe the way to think about the tax rate, it's a benefit
of about 20% after you strip out the discreet item, so if you were to look for example, on the analyst package, the first
page that shows the consolidated statement of operations, you would see that year-to-date we have earnings of $202
million, that's the earnings from continuing operations before income taxes.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Right.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So from that, take out – we have three discrete items this year. The first one would be the
large timberlands sale that was in the first quarter for $152 million and then you would add back the second discrete
item, which is the $26 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt. And then you would compare that to what we
actually booked for income taxes, which is right below the $202 million, which is the $52 million. And that $52 million
benefit, you would have to add back the third discrete item, which was the foreign tax credit. So, it's the $52 million,
take out the foreign tax credit benefit, take out the Willapa sale – the timberland sale and then also the effect of the debt
extinguishment. Then you'd get $15 million.
So our effective rate – benefit rate through the third quarter and for the year is just under 20% once you strip out those
items.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: It's really a function of the year-to-date rate plus the discrete items that are in the
year-to-date and truing it up.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: All right, thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: If you need – yeah, if you want more detail, certainly give us a call after the call when
we'll be happy to walk you through it.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Yeah. It was more directional. Thanks, Patty.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: You bet.

Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Josh.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: I was wondering, Dan, in light of your comments about a poor outlook on getting to 2012,
and that sounds like the consensus, if you can tell us a little bit more about how inventories and log decks are looking
going into that year, and how tight things would be even if we got a modest improvement right now?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I'm sorry, Josh, could you repeat the question one time please?
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: I mean, in light of your comments about nobody really expecting much from building
season, it did pick up, I mean, spring. Where do you see log decks and overall lumber inventories being so that if we
got some modicum of recovery going into the year, how much slack do you think there is in the supply chain today to
respond to that?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I really can't respond to overall supply chain slack. I think you highlight an issue, which is in
the industry people are cautious. We see these housing starts at relatively anemic level, and so the concern that you
raise is if we see a pick-up, and when we see a pick-up in the spring, do we have the ability to respond? We've had
good weather this year, and so log inventories should not be a problem in most areas. I think we, as well as others are
very careful in managing inventories of finished product and the supply chain has shrunk during this entire recession. If
you think about the supply chain from the manufacturers through the distributor and ultimately to the builders, we've
had shrinkage in the distribution chain – most distributors are managing their inventories much more tightly. And so as
the market begins to recover, I think they'll be tension, and it will tighten up relatively quickly.
I do think the industry does have the ability to respond at a range that is likely to occur. I don't see a huge snapback in
demand in the first quarter just because I think we would expect to see some seasonal improvement unless there were
some major public policy changes. I believe that the system will respond appropriately. Builders have the ability to put
houses on the ground if they have sales. But I wouldn't expect a lot of speculative inventory. And I think that the
recovery will happen in a measured basis.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question?

Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning. You discussed weaker Chinese demand in the quarter and your view that
that slowdown is temporary. I'm just wondering are you seeing any buying or inventory trends in September or October
that is kind of boosting that view or is that more kind of a general view based on longer term trends? And then maybe
to the extent that you can, if you can talk about how you would expect Chinese demand to go from 3Q to 4Q, granted
that there is a kind of seasonal slowdown there?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We started to see a slowdown in China at the end of the second quarter, and we commented
on our last call. And as I commented this morning, that played out during the third quarter, our volumes to China were
relatively unchanged in the third quarter, but would expect that there'd be some falloff in the fourth quarter, most of the
slowdown is – has shown up in pricing. And the evidence is that there is a buildup of inventory in China, some of that
is seasonal, some of it clearly is caused by a tightening of credit in China that has slowed construction. There are some
concerns that have been raised about overbuilding and the real estate market.

We have to remind ourselves that wood products and the logs that are being converted are not going into wood frame
construction, they're used for industrial purposes, but they are used for construction forms, as well as pallets and
packing.
Long-term, our view is that China is going to continue to grow. It's going to maintain its steady urbanization and there
would be a continued demand for wood products coming out of North America. North America should realize its share,
as compared to other sources, which could be New Zealand, Russia, even Scandinavia, but we've been very encouraged
by the pick-up over the last couple of years. We view the current slowdown to be somewhat temporary, and we're
bullish long-term.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Thank you. That's helpful and then just turning to the U.S. side, just following up on the
growth in multifamily homes, can you give us a rough sense of how much maybe less lumber and wood products a
typical multifamily home would use than a single family home, is it 20% less or 30% less?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: First of all, we have to be somewhat cautious when we talk about multifamily. So, when we
see multifamily statistics, they would include both for sale housing that's attached, as well as rental housing. We
happen to be a builder of some for sale multifamily, and they would be town homes in a market like Washington DC,
but the significant change in activity that I was referring to this morning was multifamily rental. In this country that's
generally low-rise. It is generally built with wood frame material.
There is a different mix of product that are used in multifamily units. First of all, the square footage for your average
multifamily unit is smaller than a detached unit. There is a higher percentage of engineered wood products and
especially engineered lumber that go into a multifamily unit. That favors Weyerhaeuser Company because of our
significant presence in the engineered business. And then there are also uses of OSB, OSB is primarily used in flooring
more than wall sheeting in multifamily.
So you have to actually drill down into the individual products, lumber, engineered wood products and OSB in order to
establish a relative range. I can use a rough number, but it is not exact because it does vary, but roughly the square
footage of multifamily rental unit's about half the square footage of a single family detached unit, and I think you could
roughly apply that 50% factor across the wood products consumption, but it would vary dramatically by wood product
type.

<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Hi, Gail.
<A – [006N26-E Patricia Bedient]: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Hey. I guess just looking out to 2012, pulp market seems to have come off fairly hard, so

would be better than they were in 2011? I'm just wondering, can you foresee within your other operations an ability to
kind of offset that type of decline next year within Wood Products, Timberlands, WRECO?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We're not at a point where we're able to make a forecast for next year's operations, Gail. And
at this point, we have seen softness as you note for pricing cellulose fibers products. We've talked directionally about
our Wood Products business and the path that we're on to return to cash breakeven and to profitability. We don't yet
have a forecast that we're ready to share for planning purposes on what we're assuming for housing starts next year; I'd

like to do that the next time we get together on a call because I think it's helpful to you to understand our planning
process, and what we're thinking.
As I noted, we went into this year, and we told you that we were planning on 525,000 single family starts, we didn't see
it, but that enters into our thought process and each of our businesses are making assumptions based upon the factors
that impact them. Single family housing starts is a big one, but also as we look at our cellulose fibers market, we're
looking at global demand, not just North America, but Asia and Europe, and so it's a little bit too early for us to give
you guidance for 2012. But when we get to together next quarter, we'll talk about our view of housing starts, and how
we believe that plays out, and also, our sense of the cellulose fibers markets.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And just one other one on capital allocation, I think given the lack of recovery we've
seen to-date in U.S. housing, you guys have been pretty active doing lots of little things here and there, buying back
debt, you bought a little bit land, you bought back some shares. Can you just help us think of your policy and just how
you plan to allocate capital moving forward given the continued challenges in housing?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We continue to be cautious as we gauge the pace of recovery for housing and our focus in
most of our capital spend over the last several years has been re-forestation and silviculture cost to maintain the quality
and sustainability of our timberlands. We have continued to invest in capital-effective projects in our Cellulose Fibers
business with a goal of driving down production costs, increasing productivity from our existing mills. And that's why I
gave an example this morning of what we've just done in Grand Prairie.
And we've talked on earlier calls about a longer term initiative in our Cellulose Fibers business to be stretching out our
planned routine maintenance from a 12-month schedule to an 18-month schedule. And so we seek high ROI projects
with relatively quick payback that have the benefit of increasing productivity, and also, they improve our
environmental footprint.
We've been spending minimal amount as necessary for safety and environmental compliance on our wood products
facilities, and we've been cautious in our Real Estate business because we already have a large land position, and we're
well-positioned to take advantage of a recovery in real estate, so we're relatively well-situated.
As Patty said in her remarks, we've bought in a little bit of stock. We thought that that was an appropriate use of cash
during the quarter. And we'll continue to evaluate capital allocation on a go-forward basis strategically. The one
business that we've talked before about, long-term intent to grow is our Timberlands business, and so that will play into
some of our thinking in the future when we look at how we allocate capital.

Our next question comes from line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Hi, Mark.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Patty, is it possible to get a sense of sort of the order of magnitude that we might see in the fourth
quarter on those non-strategic Timberland sales?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, Mark, they are lumpy. We had, I think, earnings of $4 million in the third quarter,
and they were down $28 million. I don't think they'll be as big as they were in the second quarter, but significantly
greater than where they were in the third quarter.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay, so if we use something in the sort of $15 million to $20 million as just a placeholder, that
would probably get us at least in the stadium?

<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay, all right, sounds good. Another Timberland question I had, I was just – in looking at a
year-over-year comparison, your log realizations for the most part are up nicely, as are your harvest volumes yet your
EBIT on a year-over-year basis is down, is that just a Timberland sale issue, or is there something else going on?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I'd have to do little bit of research on that one, Mark, because I'm not relating to your
comment. Realizations have risen in the west -
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Right.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: – and relatively flat in the south.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Right.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Volumes can be a little bit misleading in the south because we've got more commercial
thinning happening and the commercial thinning obviously brings a lower realization than log sales. So, I think I want
to get back to you on that particular issue, we'll provide more detail.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: All right, that's – what I'm planning to is kind of it went from $75 million down to $62 million,
yet it looks like the third party log sales are up somewhere in the range of about 25%, as are prices, so I'm just trying to
understand what else I might be missing there?
Dan, one other question on timberland if I could, I just I noticed that the realizations that you get down in South
America are about half of what you get in the southern U.S. on a per cubic meter basis, is that a mix question, or is that
just a fact that we don't have kind of developed markets down there in the way we do in the southern U.S.?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We have less developed markets, and we have less mature timber, it's primarily the timber
itself, Mark, because we're still growing out that forest. We are converting some of that in our plywood mill. As I
noted, we are finding some opportunities, limited opportunities to export, but it is more a function of the age and
maturity of our timberland in South America.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. And then the last question I had, you have really have made great progress in improving
Wood Products, but as you noted, you're still burning cash, is it possible to give us some idea of just the particular areas
within Wood Products that are drawing most of your attention right now as you try to improve performance further?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We are engaged in initiatives in every single one of our product lines: lumber, oriented strand
board, our engineered wood products, as well as our distribution. And so we are focused on driving down cost; some of
that comes from increased facility utilization, and we've made progress there and then growing top line as I mentioned
going into some new markets.
And there's also some improvement that we made even in just increased realizations in existing markets as we
understand our opportunity to price appropriately given our competitive advantage. So, we have a tremendous number
of initiatives across the entire organization both on cost reduction, operating efficiency improvement, and top line
growth, and our goal is that they all come together, bring us back to cash positive but, more importantly, return to
profitability in this business. And we're doing this in an environment with incredibly challenged level of housing starts,
and so the organization is responding well.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Mark, this is Patty, as I think about your question about timberlands, I think there are
probably two primary things affecting that comparison that you went through. One would be the non-strategic land
sales, which I think if you compared the third quarter to-date of this year and last year are down about $25 million.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: That's the issue.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: And then the other would be also some cost increases, primarily in the way of diesel fuel,
which ran up as you'll recall, pretty significantly earlier in the year. So, I think the combination of those two would
pretty much get where you are in your analysis.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay, very good. Thank, Patty. Good luck.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Hi, yes, good morning, all, I wanted to first ask Patty about the buyback in this quarter, we
haven't seen you buy back stock, certainly in the last year-and-a-half or so, and is that just merely planned to offset
some of the options exercises we saw this year or is there something more to it?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, Chip, it might be good just to step back from our overall share repurchase and just
recap from it where we are on our authorizations. So, as you said when we came into the quarter, we did have an
existing authorization that really dated back to 2008 for about $250 million, and we'd only used a small of that
authorization in prior years.
Earlier in the quarter, we purchased about $20 million of shares under that authorization, and when we came into the
August board meeting, we terminated that authorization and replaced it with a new authorization for $250 million, and
then purchased $9 million under that authorization in the quarter.
So at the end of the quarter, we had a remaining authorization of about $241 million. So, as we looked at uses of cash,
we do believe that share repurchase is an important tool for returning cash to shareholders, and as we said in the past,
we'll utilize that share repurchase on an opportunistic basis and given the fact that the stock price during the quarter had
fallen, and that we had received cash for the stock option exercises earlier in this year of just a little over $30 million,
we believe that that share repurchase was a good value for our shareholders. I wouldn't want to speculate on the amount
or timing of what we would do in the future other than to say that we will continue to use that tool opportunistically
where we can create additional value.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: That's great to know. And, secondly, for Dan, just as you look at your house – your markets
where you build homes and just your intelligence since you guys are on the ground in so many places, we're hearing
that rents are going up even where there is not a lot of job creation because people just can't afford down payments.
And in that spirit, are you or in that vein, are you seeing new projects for multifamily construction in some of these
areas where you're seeing an almost shortage of rental property with people not being able to afford down payments
and needing a place to live?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The rental market is relatively strong across the country, and it's very strong in certain major
metro areas, and it's a function, Chip, I believe, of a couple of things. One is, some challenges in purchasing, but I think
more importantly, the points that I summarized on in my comments this morning, I think that the people are sitting on
the sidelines waiting for the signal that it's okay to go back into the home purchase market. And so there is some
concern overall about consumer confidence. There is some concern in some markets about employment.
I think this mobility issue is a big one where people want to maintain their – the ability to be mobile and to take a job in
a different neighborhood or a different metro area if that's what it takes. The mortgage qualification process is much
more difficult than it has been, even over the last two to three years. Appraisals are a challenge, down payments are a
challenge, and I think that that's an area where we have to address some public policy issues in order to break loose a
bit of activity in the system.
Rents are high. In many markets, it is cheaper to own than to rent, and so people are making a choice to maintain, in
effect, an option by renting before they come back into the market. We do have land that we sell to multifamily
developers in some locations. So, we are not an apartment builder, but where we have multifamily land, that's been a
benefit because we can sell to institutional developers of multifamily property and participate in that market. It's also
putting some pressure on labor costs because we are seeing construction labor flow to multifamily projects

<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: And just real, real quickly, I know that FHA loans, you can get like with 3% to 5% down and
you think of a two – let's be radical, $200,000 home and you need $10,000 down, after three or four years if you've
been able to keep your job, it would seem like you've got enough money for a down payment. Am I missing
something? Do the houses you sell, do they are not qualify for these FHA loans? Do you have to have the bigger down
payments or maybe you could just give us a little color on that because we could be on the verge of a turn if we've seen
a number of people save up the last three or four years?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We're going to put you in one of our sales offices, Chip, because you have a compelling value
proposition, and we do sell to some buyers that use FHA financing. The challenge quite frankly, is not the down
payment, the challenge is the credit underwriting process that has become overly burdensome and then there is a
problem with appraisals because we have changed the appraisal process, it's a much more difficult one and in some
markets the challenge is you have a willing buyer and seller for a new home. They agree on a price, but the house won't
appraise for that price because the appraisal includes comparables that may be foreclosures in the same metro area,
although that buyer wouldn't want to buy that foreclosed home.
So that's one of the things that is an impediment in the system today and needs to break loose and I think that to some
extent the buying public is looking for the green light to go on to say it's okay to go back in and start purchasing. And
what we have seen in some markets is investors coming in from offshore that are purchasing multifamily units.
And I think that's perhaps slight capital or capital that is attracted to current market opportunities because prices are
significantly lower than they were at the peak.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Thank you. Two quick questions on Cellulose Fibers. First, I know that first half this year I
think you had about $80 million of downtime costs and then nothing in the second half. You talked about trying to
change the downtime schedules going forward. Are we going to have less than $80 million in downtime costs –
maintenance downtime costs in 2012? That's the first question.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We are on a longer term path of stretching out our scheduled downtime, as we've talked
before, from 12 months to 18 months. That process will take about four years to completely accomplish. And part of it
is we have entered into some capital projects that will allow us to operate safely for longer periods of time. There's also
certification processes that need to take place for those individual mills. And so, 2012 and 2013 will be bridge years
where we will start to stretch out the timeframe on a mill-by-mill basis. It's probably a little bit early to be giving you
guidance for 2012. But I wouldn't expect that you'd see anything significantly different in 2012, as compared to 2011.
This is a longer term process that we have a lot of confidence in, but we need to do it safely.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay, understood. And then, secondly, I guess is somewhat pleasantly surprised that in the
Pulp business you thought that profits would hold up pretty well 4Q v [versus] 3Q given that there's been some erosion
in pricing. I guess I was trying to understand whether there is some lag that happens in the way the contracts are set up
so that some of the price deterioration shows up a little later as opposed to in the immediate. Is that what's going on or
is it just that the fluff pulp really has been holding much more stable?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Fluff pulp has been more stable than NBSK, and we have a mix of products, the primary one,
which is fluff, and it's going to our large customers. So, there is a bit of a lag, Mark, fluff prices have come off their
peaks. They haven't suffered as much as NBSK, and we are expecting a pick-up of some of our specialty fibers in the
fourth quarter. So, generally the – we – in Patty's comments, we talked about earnings being slightly lower as we look
forward to the fourth quarter, and we'll have to see that play out.

other.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. And so basically there is not a significant lag effect to be thinking about for the first
quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: No.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: No.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Thank you.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: We have time for one last question.
Operator
And our final question comes from the line of Joshua Zaret of Longbow Research.
<Q - Joshua L. Zaret>: Thanks very much. Two quickies. First, I would like to get an explanation in Wood Products,
what seems like an unusual sequential quarterly trend and shipments between softwood lumber, which was down about
3% and OSB, which was up about 10%. So, diverging trends, and when you add to that – I'm really curious because the
OSB is on – the volume was 28% above a year ago and I'm wondering if there is anything pushing that up like
hurricanes or something that we should deduct as we go forward, to the fourth quarter.
<A>: Josh, softwood lumber is trending down, that's a seasonal factor related to construction during the fourth quarter.
As we look at our OSB business, we've got two year-over-year changes as we would look back at last year. Number
one, we reopened late last year our facility at Hudson Bay, Saskatchewan. We saw a very little volume coming out of
that in even late fourth quarter as we brought that mill on-line. They had been shut down for a couple of years. It is still
not operating fully, given market recovery, but there is year-over-year volume coming out of Hudson Bay that you
didn't see last year. And then we have a oriented strand mill, Grayling, Michigan, and we've increased production there.
We're operating 24/7 because we've got good demand out of that geographic region.
<Q - Joshua L. Zaret>: So that's a fair level, that 549 that – relative to demand for the third, as you see it to the third
quarter?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Can you repeat your question?
<Q - Joshua L. Zaret>: In other words, there is nothing unusual in that 549 relative to demand. I mean, you've brought
your – housing's done nothing, you've brought your demand up quite substantially year-over-year and even
quarter-over-quarter.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Right, there is nothing in terms of overall market demand, but we have increased production
in those two facilities, number one in Grayling, Michigan because we have opportunities to sell more product. So, if
you think about my general comments on Wood Products, we're working on driving cost down, but we're also looking
for opportunities to increase top line where we have a product that's competitive, where we have a logistical advantage,
we're taking advantage of that, and so we've increased production and increase sales.
And the Hudson Bay mill, we brought back online so we've got increased production this year that we didn't have last
year. That's a mill that we hope to see increase production over time, we are going through a process now in
certification for the Japanese market that create some additional opportunity that perhaps could come out of Hudson
Bay, but it's too early to talk about specifics.
<Q - Joshua L. Zaret>: Okay. And then the second quick question. In Timberlands, the margin for the segment really
took a dive to 23%; it's typically in the 30% to 40%. Can you confirm that that's overwhelmingly due to the less
non-strategic Timberland sales and not to the other cost issues that you have mentioned?

<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: There have been slightly higher costs, some of that is related to fuel, there was a drop in
realizations, modest realize – kind of in the west as we talked about the Chinese market slowing down and the impact
on pricing and then the big factor in the quarter was the land dispositions.
<Q - Joshua L. Zaret>: With the land dis – I mean, the lack of land dispositions for this quarter, but would that be the
biggest factor, the lack of land sales in driving that down or it would be?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: That was the biggest factor in the quarter.
<Q - Joshua L. Zaret>: Okay, great. That's what I was trying to get at. Thank you very much.
Daniel S. Fulton
