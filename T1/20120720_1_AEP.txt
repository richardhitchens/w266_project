MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At
this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn our conference over to our host, Treasurer, Chuck Zebula. Please go ahead.
Charles E. Zebula
Thank you, Josh. Good morning and welcome to the second quarter 2012 earnings webcast of American Electric
Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website,
aep.com.
Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future
results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.
Joining me today for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our President and CEO, and Brian Tierney, our CFO. We will
take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.
Nicholas K. Akins
Thank you, Chuck Zebula. Overall we had another good quarter for AEP. We produced GAAP and operating earnings
of $0.75 and $0.77 a share respectively, and brought our year-to-date earnings to $1.55 and $1.57 per share

respectively. So it turned out to be a pretty good quarter for us. And as Brian will discuss in more detail a little bit later,
our service territory continues to show progress. Although very tenuous in the economic recovery, we continue to see
industrial growth driven by primary metals and oil and gas activities, but we're now also seeing commercial growth for
the first time in years. Residential continues to lag, so we're hopeful that the economy will continue to improve and
show that sustainability particularly from an industrial standpoint, manufacturing, as well as moving to the commercial
side of things, and then residential will pick up as well. So hopefully this economy will continue to make progress, I
know that everyone is focused on the election during this time of year, and hopefully we'll have a return of optimism
that will permeate through the economy that we deal with.
Looking at the quarter, it really does show the discipline of cost control, and the diversity of the AEP System, to
overcome the challenges particularly related to Ohio, also the POLR charges and customer switching. Ohio has not
been a good story for AEP over the last year or so, and – but we're working really hard to turn this around. All of our
other state jurisdictions have improved over the last year, but as you all know, all eyes are on Ohio and very focused on
August, which we believe is August 8.
Before getting into Ohio and other issues, I want to reiterate that our strategy we put before you on February 10 is still
intact, and it really does bear repeating. The major issues that we're focused on is certainly movement to the
competitive market in Ohio, with corporate separation and the formation of our competitive generation, retail and
wholesale trading and marketing functions. That's going to be key for us to execute for in the future after we get this
August 8 order.
Investment in our regulated businesses, we will continue to invest in our regulated businesses and, as we've described,
just that investment, will provide for continued commitment to the growth of 4% to 6% from an earnings perspective.
And we'll continue to focus on growth in our Transmission business well and repositioning that business around the
critical mass to make sure earnings are provided near-term as well as long-term, and that dividend strength certainly is
secured by the regulated businesses as we go forward as well.
So, as we transform ourselves, certainly we'll transform from a resource perspective as well. Generation resources in
response to the EPA, and certainly from the price of natural gas and other fundamental conditions out there, will
continue to change, but we are very focused on providing plans to really emerge as a more diversified fleet as we go
forward.
So, as we looked at some of the issues that we deal with during the year, it became apparent that these basic strategy
components remain our focus and will really enable us to look ahead to the execution that's necessary to reposition the
company for the future.
I've been CEO for about 8 months now, and have been fortunate to preside over two of the most damaging storms in
AEP's history; one, what I'll call a regulated storm and the other a weather-related storm. Let me cover the weather
related storm first, which I had never heard of before the storm actually occurred, a super derecho, which occurred in
late June. I've never heard of it, but I'll certainly focus, during the day it was a 10% chance of thunderstorms, well that
was pretty damaging 10%. Six of AEP states from Indiana to Virginia were affected, some 1.4 million customers and
an additional 300,000 customers were affected in the follow-up storms that ensued.
We marshaled crews from our western footprint, certainly from the indigenous operating companies that were affected,
but also all over the country, from California and elsewhere, and Canada as well, to support the restoration efforts. I'm
very proud of our response. And our management team including myself visited with crews working throughout our
various states to make absolutely sure that the necessary resources were dedicated, restoring power to our customers.
Working for almost two weeks, 16-hour days in almost 100 degree heat, was an extreme challenge that I am confident
that we performed and executed well from an operational and a safety perspective.
The storm was expensive. Approximately $230 million, much of which will be deferred from each recovery, as Brian
will provide a bit more detail on little bit later, but it is, in an odd and perhaps morbid way, it gave the management
team a brief reprieve from the challenges of the other storm that occurred. The regulated storm we call Ohio.

So, let's talk about that one. These clouds are starting to clear up as well. The capacity order of the PUCO demonstrated
a couple of major points. The Commission is focused on providing competitors the ability to compete quickly for
customers by putting in place RPM pricing provisions. And they're also focused on the financial integrity of AEP,
evidenced by the capacity cost being set at 189 per megawatt day with a deferral mechanism to be resolved in the ESP
filing. That's the first step.
So after a significant belly blow in February, AEP is back on its feet and have taken the first step. Now comes the
important part, the second step, to demonstrate that we are walking again before we run. The August order, we
presume, will come out August 8, that order for the ESP, we'll need to define several key issues. The deferral
mechanism for the capacity cost delta from the RPM rates, the level of the RSR, the Rate Stability Rider, to ensure the
financial integrity of AEP, the Distribution Investment Rider, and we'll also need to define the start of the recovery of
deferred fuel that's been on the books for quite a while. The other major issue is corporate separation, we'll need to get
the approval for that, and we expect that as well.
Overall, we need to address the financial needs of AEP Ohio and the ensuing corporate separation to ensure the credit
quality and the cash requirements are met for the emerging entities. You can't start a generation company with a fistful
of deferral IOUs. We must have cash as well to solidify the balance sheets with the Genco and AEP Ohio going
forward.
So make no mistake, AEP is focused on emerging from this storm with a financially secure company and a clarification
of execution to move toward a competitive market in Ohio. The development of our retail effort continues to move
forward positively. I recently visited our team in Chicago, the former BlueStar team, and they are very focused on
advancing the retail efforts, but they are also focused on margins. That's one key issue. I'm not interested in signing up
every customer we can sign up. I'm interested in margins associated with that, because we are providing a hedge,
ultimately for the generation that separated, so we want to maximize value associated with that.
So now we need the structural pieces of the unregulated generation fleet to fall into place so that we can effectively
hedge and compete, [ph] so that this supply (9:23) – and as we discussed with you all in February. So for AEP, all of
our sights are set on moving forward. We continue to see 4% to 6% long-term growth, dividend supported by the
regulated companies, and do not foresee the issuance of equity during this transition.
We are not likely to issue guidance until after the commission renders an order on any rehearing request, so by then we
may be looking at 2013 and 2014 projections, but I have a feeling you all are looking at that already anyway.
So with all that said, we do continue on a very positive path, in other aspects of our long-term strategy as well. Our
transmission efforts continue to move forward. As examples we are now turning dirt on some significant projects, we
have a cell substation in Ohio, that's a $239 million investment. A $200 million project in Indiana, another $200 million
of major projects throughout our Transcos, as well as the Prairie Wind construction is now turning dirt. So, we're
starting that process of construction that really can provide the earnings growth for the future.
We were very disappointed in the order yesterday regarding the Pioneer project, both the technical and factual basis, we
believe, was not fully recognized in the order. The new line doesn't even interconnect with NIPSCO, only Duke and
AEP, and you can't interconnect AEP 765 KV into a NIPSCO's 138 KV system, that's – technically that just doesn't
work very well, and we have a substation pretty close to that that's accommodating to a 765 KV.
So, really look at those factual issues needs to be revisited. Overall, a decision really sends a wrong message to
promoters of transmission solutions, so we are evaluating our options on this as we go forward, but certainly we'll make
our position known, both publicly and probably through filings as well.
However, this doesn't impact the AEP earnings forecast for transmission, because, as we described earlier, we are
repositioning the transmissions business to focus on short-term as well as long-term projects to provide the critical
mass for earnings growth. So we have plenty of projects to take its place. That project management discussion we had
earlier, along with the amount of projects that are being placed in the near term perspective from a Transco and other
longer term projects perspectives, we'll be able to certainly focus on that earnings path and secure that for the future.

So, we spend so much time on Ohio, we forget there are other state regulatory matters that are moving forward. Our
Indiana rate case, the $170 million rate case has concluded its hearings, and we expect an order by the end of 2012.
Intervenor exceptions are due August 15, we submitted our version of what the order should look like, so we'll look to
that toward the end of this year.
The Turk ultra-supercritical pulverized coal station is now 92% complete, and we are looking forward to the first fire in
the boiler so that we can move on with getting that unit operational and into rates in those various jurisdictions.
Also we continue our focus on further developing our EPA response plans. We now estimate our capital spend to be
approximately $6 billion. It could be a little bit higher than that, but nominally $6 billion over the next five or so years,
to accommodate the retrofits and retirements of our generation facilities. We continue to be focused on legislation to
provide for a two-year extension so that we can ensure reliability and reduce the cost of compliance. It makes a lot of
sense for our ultimate customers and the economy in general.
And lastly, I'll talk about our repositioning study. We have engaged McKinsey & Associates to work with us on our
plan to refocus our business on growth and efficiency of operations, enable us to do – to continue to prioritize our
business functions around the OPCo model, and the growth engines of transmission and the development of
competitive businesses.
Our growth will continue to be fueled by the regulated business, but we must optimize our cost structure to enable more
investment for earnings growth. We expect to conclude this study by the end of the year, with sustainable – with a
sustainable process and organizational value that begins in 2013. So again, all eyes are on August 8, we assume, and
then expect – we expect expedient and deliberate execution and progress towards the strategic goals that we've
discussed.
And now I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian X. Tierney
Thank you, Nick. Turning to slide 4, operating earnings for the second quarter were $370 million, up $18 million from
the prior year's level of $352 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of $0.04
per share from the second quarter of 2011. In summary, the favorable effect of lower O&M expense was partially offset
by an increase in the impact of customer switching to alternative electric suppliers in Ohio.
The quarter-on-quarter detail shows a decline in earnings per share of $0.08 related to the level of customer switching.
In addition this year's results were adversely affected by last year's October unfavorable decision on remand from the
Public Utility Commission of Ohio, related to POLR service. Last year's results included POLR revenues, while this
year's do not. These unfavorable drivers were more than offset by lower O&M expense and favorable other items.
O&M expense was down for the quarter adding $0.13 per share to earnings. The lower O&M reflects decreased plant
outage work and lower storm expenses compared to 2011.
In addition, the unfavorable variance in O&M spending reflects management efforts to maintain tight controls on
spending across the organization. The $0.04 per share improvement in other items reflects the favorable effect of a
partial reversal of a 2011 fuel provision in Ohio.
At the beginning of the call, Nick mentioned the devastating storms that hit our eastern service territory beginning on
June 29th. In addition to being destructive, the storms are also costly. As Nick said, current estimates of the storm's
total cost were about $230 million spread across our eastern operating companies. We believe approximately $70
million will be classified as capital and will be recovered in various future rate proceedings. Of the remaining $160
million of O&M, we believe we'll ultimately be able to defer for future recovery up to $130 million. We recognized $4
million in expenses related to the series of storms in the second quarter, leaving an estimated remaining expense for the
third quarter of about $26 million.

Turning to slide 5, operating earnings for the year-to-date period were $759 million, up $15 million from last year's
level of $744 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 for the year-to-date, an increase of $0.02 per share
from 2011. Similar to our discussion of the second quarter results, the year-to-date results reflect favorable lower O&M
expense offset by the effect of customer switching in Ohio, the unfavorable POLR decision, and mild first quarter
weather.
In detail, weather adversely affected the year-on-year results by $0.12 per share. While the weather impact in the
second quarter was comparable, the effect of the mild winter throughout our service territory is evident in the
year-to-date results. Customer switching for the first six months of the year has lowered earnings by $0.13 per share.
By the end of June, 34% of AEP Ohio load had switched to alternative suppliers. The effect of the unfavorable POLR
decision adversely affected earnings by $0.10 per share.
On the positive side, rate changes net of POLR have supported earnings by $0.07 per share. O&M expenses are
favorable by $0.25 per share driven by lower spending related to plant outages and our overall efforts to control costs.
Finally, other items added $0.05 per share to the results, largely due to the partial reversal of the 2011 fuel provision in
Ohio.
On slide six, you'll see in the bottom right quadrant that weather normalized total retail sales were up 1% for the quarter
and three-tenth of a percent for the year-to-date period. The growth is coming from sales to the commercial and
industrial classes, while normalized residential sales continue to struggle.
Before I get into the period variances by customer class, let me give you an overview of the economy in our service
territory. We continue to see economic improvement, although the growth is not evenly distributed across our service
areas.
One of the best indicators of relative strength of the local economy is employment growth. Over the past three months,
employment growth in AEP's metropolitan areas has increased 2%, which is better than it's been over the past year and
stronger than the 1.4% employment growth for the U.S. in total.
The employment situation remains weaker in our eastern service territories, where there are approximately 91,000
fewer jobs than before the recession began and the unemployment rate is 7.9%. That being said, employment growth in
our east region is up 1.8% over the past three months.
Job growth in our western service territory has been stronger. Over the past three months, employment growth in our
western region has been 2.3% above last year. Current numbers indicate there are 17,000 more jobs than when the
recession began.
The strongest improvement has been in Texas with job growth of 2.9% over the past 12 months and current
employment numbers indicate there are 26,000 more jobs now than at the pre-recession peak.
Now let's look at the customer classes, the industrial sector posted the ninth consecutive quarter of growth since the
recession. Industrial sales were up 1.8% for the quarter and 2% for the year, driven by strong activity in the oil and gas
and transportation equipment manufacturing sectors.
I'll talk more about this in more detail on the next slide.
On the top right of the slide, AEP sales to commercial customers grew 1.6% for the second quarter and are six-tenth of
the percent up for the year. Commercial sales growth closely tracks employment growth. The employment growth we
discussed earlier is driving the recovery we are experiencing in this class. Not surprisingly, commercial sales have been
stronger in our west region and especially in Texas where the job growth has been the strongest.
AEP's weather-normalized sales to residential customers were down 1.9% for the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date; part of
this is driven by customer accounts. In our eastern service territory, we have approximately 4,000 fewer customers than
we had last year. Our Texas properties experienced a notable increase in residential customer accounts. This was
related to strong employment and population growth.

The chart on page seven shows the growth in industrial sales for our five largest sectors. As you can see, year-to-date
growth in primary metals is 1.4%, yet sales to this sector declined in the second quarter. Our largest metals customer
was still ramping up to full production during the first quarter of last year. More recent data shows that the primary
metals sector has stabilized at roughly 75% of the pre-recession level.
Also on this chart, you'll notice that sales in the petroleum and coal products sector had been improving with sales up
8% in the second quarter and 7.1% for the year-to-date period. While growth in this sector has been solid across our
territory, there was a major expansion at a refinery in East Texas that drove much of the growth for the quarter.
Besides the sectors shown on the chart, we are also seeing impressive growth in a couple of other sectors. Oil and gas
extraction sales are up 1.3% for the quarter and 3.9% year-to-date. In addition to new customers, several existing
customers have expanded their current operations. Most of these expansions are related to the shale gas activity,
particularly in our Wheeling, West Virginia and Texas territories.
The transportation equipment manufacturing sector, which represents 4.2% of the company's industrial sales, has also
demonstrated a significant increase of 10.9% for the quarter and 8.7% for the year-to-date period. This improvement is
related to U.S. auto sales, which reached the pre-recession annualized levels earlier this year. We've experienced load
growth at existing automotive manufactures in West Virginia and Louisiana. In addition, drivers in the U.S. are
maintaining and not replacing their vehicles as often as they used to. This has resulted in growth at some of our motor
vehicle parts manufactures, especially in Michigan and Ohio.
Turning to slide eight, you can see that as the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and
year-to-date basis, our natural gas capacity factors have increased. For both the quarterly and annual periods, our
generation from natural gas has increased approximately 80%. For our east combined cycle units, the increase in
capacity factors and generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our
Waterford and Lawrenceburg plants, east combined cycled generation has increased 250% for the quarter and 181% for
the year-to-date period.
With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70%, the ability to realize incremental coal to gas
switching within our eastern fleet is reduced. This switching and the general pricing environment for coal, natural gas
and electricity has led to an increase in our coal inventor from 45 days at the end of the first quarter to 48 days at the
end of the second quarter. This is about six days more inventory than at the end of the second quarter of last year.
Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 90% hedged with many units fully hedged.
On slide nine, you will see that our balance sheet, credit metrics and liquidity remained strong. Our debt-to-total
capitalization has remained fairly constant over the last three quarters and currently stands at 55.2%. Our FFO to
interest coverage and our FFO to total debt remained solidly BBB for a company with AEP's business risk profile.
The company's net available liquidity stands at $2.8 billion and is supported by our two large credit facilities which
mature in June of 2015 and July of 2016. That being said, there are some pending developments that could impact the
credit quality of Ohio Power Company. Specifically, the capacity case allows for the deferral of the difference between
$189 a megawatt day and the RPM price.
It is our belief that the ESP order will address the recovery mechanism for the deferral of these costs in addition to
other items. Unfortunately, at this point, we do not know how or when the deferral will be recovered. Both timing and
recovery are important items in determining the credit outlook. The credit risks for Ohio Power have been outlined by
all three rating agencies. Earlier this month, S&P issued a bulletin immediately after the capacity order, stating that
while there are no immediate effects on ratings, they consider deferrals of changes in capacity prices to be unsupportive
of credit quality because cash flow would decline and could result in financial measures inconsistent with the current
rating.
We have informed stakeholders about the importance of supporting investment grade ratings for Ohio Power. In
addition, the balance sheet for this company is able to absorb some level of deferrals, especially if we're able to begin
recovery of our deferred fuel cost and securitize our existing regulatory asset balances, these last two items will be

credit supportive. There are likely both positive and negative items to appear on the credit scorecard for Ohio Power, if
the overall tally is not known. However, our metrics are solid today and we have a focus on reducing our business risk
in Ohio through the transfer of two large plants to regulated affiliates, sizing our cost structure to a competitive
environment and hedging our output.
As Nick said, we are committed to investment grade credit and at this time to not see the need for additional equity
beyond the drip due to some flexibility in our capital spend profile and securitization opportunities in both Ohio and
West Virginia. Our Ohio team is working hard to achieve an outcome in our ESP case that preserves the financial
strength of Ohio Power and our new competitive generation company.
Turning to slide 10 for the remainder of 2012, I have already detailed the estimated cost impacts of the late-June and
early-July storms. We have shown where the economy is recovering in our service territories and the resulting impact
on load. The industrial and commercial load classes are headed in the right direction, yet recent residential load trends
have been weak.
Regulatory uncertainty in Ohio has been a concern to the AEP story for some time. In early June, we started to get
some clarity on Ohio regulatory outcomes, but a big piece of that picture is expected to come with an order in early
August. We are working hard to get a reasonable outcome.
Our earnings so far this year had been the result of positive non-Ohio utility performance and expense discipline
offsetting earnings challenges in Ohio, we will maintain that discipline. Most of all, we are looking forward to being
able to share with you a plan in Ohio that has a clear, reasonable transition to competitive generation model and a stable
regulated wires company with the financially sound AEP Ohio throughout the transition period.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Good morning. I have a question on customer switching and I believe on the call you
had said that about 34% of your Ohio customers have switched, and I want to know how that compares to the
expectation you guys filed in Ohio and I believe that was Bill Allen's testimony. Are you in line with that or are you –
they're switching ahead of what you guys are forecasting?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, I think, it's lower than expectation; however, after this last order, we expect switching
to accelerate.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Just – question number one is, O&M has been one of these great success stories for 2012 so far.
Can you just maybe give a little more color on how much of the year-over-year savings is kind of durable and
sustainable versus kind of timing related around maintenance schedules and that sort of thing with the fleet and what
kind of inflation we should be kind of modeling off in this level?

quite credibly to reductions from the Ohio-related activities and we have adjusted. Some of those – the majority have
been sustainable-type of reductions, although some of them are not and such as the deferral of outages and those types
of things. But that's the whole reason, why we're having the repositioning study done, where we're going through and
defining sustainable cost reduction opportunities either through process-related activities, organizational activities, and
we recognize that cost-cutting – we can't continue a process of cost-cutting and cost-cutting. We have to have a view
going forward of sustainable reductions that provide us a base where we can continue to progress as a company. So
that's what we're really focused on. Brian, you may have some additional detail.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: No, that's it. That's – you hit the nail on the head, Nichol. When we had talked about
guidance that have since been suspended for 2012, we talked about O&M in that $3.4 billion range. I probably put it in
the $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion range and that's what we are doing with McKinsey. We anticipate it being in a similar
range for next year.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: [ph] So it's just flat out for (30:49) next year, and that's interesting. Nick, I guess with the gas
plants running really well, gas prices low, coal prices kind of running into some cash pressures. Are you guys doing
any work to reevaluate the environmental plan for EPA compliance of $6 billion, as far as maybe less plant investment,
more new generation? How is that dialogue going internally?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, that continues to be a work in progress, Dan. I mean it changes as we get new
information and changes as a result of discussions we have with the states and with the EPA. And of course, we
continue to work, as I've said, on the legislative side, because [ph] Equity (31:28) has done an independent analysis
showing that it costs a third less if you wind up with a two-year extension. If you are able to optimize that, but I think
it's important for us to go through the process in concert with the state, and it really focuses on that, that operating
company model where we're working with them to determine what the proper solution is. And you are right, we are –
we continue to search, and as you see some of the changes that have been made, such as the Big Sandy scrubber
proposal being pulled at this point. We are reevaluating that. We have some activity in Oklahoma around coal-fired
generation as well that we have adjusted to. You'll continue to see those kinds of adjustments, because what we are
trying to get to is: number one, a portfolio that each of our operating jurisdictions support.
And then secondly, a portfolio that provides some risk management around a balanced portfolio going forward. So for
us, it's a relatively high hurdle for us to be putting scrubbers on our facilities. In some – in many cases, it's already
done. In some cases, it continues to be an evaluation, even for units such as the 1300-megawatt units at Rockport. Paul
Chodak over at I&M is working with the regulators to determine what the proper opportunities are for that so that we
can meet the emission reduction guidelines, and that's being discussed in all of our jurisdictions. So, you bring up a
great point and it's something that we're very focused on, and we'll continue to try to optimize. As a matter of fact,
when we first started this process, we were looking at $8 billion, and it's come down to just over $6 billion and we
expect it to continue to be refined as we go forward in concert with the states.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Great. Thank you, guys.

<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, we didn't mention the number specifically. It was about $30 million. There was a
clarification in an order that came out this year, that meant that instead of having deferred $65 million, we only needed
to defer the Ohio retail jurisdiction component of that. So that allowed us to reduce the Ohio deferral expense amount
by $30 million.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And is there any ongoing impact that we should think about or is it just sort of this
quarter event?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: There is no ongoing effect of that.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And then the depreciation for shorter generation line, could you give us a sense as to what the –
what's causing that, and what – how much that was in the total $50 million increase for depreciation?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah. For year-to-date, Paul, it's about $32 million, and that's associated mostly with the
Ohio assets that we know will be retiring by 2015. So we had to increase the depreciation on those particular assets to
that 2015 terminal date, and for year-to-date that increase in depreciation is about $32 million.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then that will be going off, right? That's – is that how we should think about it on an
annual basis?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: You should think about those increased amounts through to 2014 to get to that January 1,
2015 retirement date.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then the securitization that you mentioned, do you guys feel you can do that with
the current legislation in place? I'm talking about the deferrals; excuse me, on the capacity charge. Do you think you
can do that with the current legislation, or current – I'm sorry, current law, or do you need new legislation to enable
that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I think we could be able to do that, and I think obviously there's different views of
what the law says, but now there's flexibility in that and we believe we can do that.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And would that be something that you think you can do before sort of all – because I'm
just assuming that we're going to get appeals on this considering how contentious this stuff has been. Do you think that
that would – in terms of securitization, the timing of the potential for securitization, how should we think about that?
Do you think that we'd have to obviously get through rehearing, but beyond rehearing, do you think we'd have to wait
for an Ohio Supreme Court decision, or, do you follow me?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Most likely we would. But nevertheless, we'll obviously start with the financing and so forth
associated with that. Brian?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: And Paul, I'd like to distinguish that as the capacity deferral from the capacity case and
distinguish that from the Ohio reg assets where we're going to file later this month to be able to securitize a little bit
over $300 million of Ohio reg assets. And Ohio Fuel, from the 2009 through to 2011 period, which is a little bit over
$500 million, and we do believe that everything is in place to be able to securitize those amounts, particularly the reg
assets, and then the fuel pending a final order in those cases...
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I think you mentioned West Virginia?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Well, that's another jurisdiction altogether. In West Virginia, we think we'll be able to
securitize about $400 million of deferred fuel in early 2013 as well.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Thanks for your clarification. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Sure, thanks, Paul.

Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: [indiscernible] (37:33) I noticed you didn't highlight retail rate increases as part of the – as an
individual driver, and in the slide it kind of [ph] looked (37:41) that you went backwards in the quarter versus last year.
Is that just timing or – and how should we be thinking about rate increases as a driver of overall earnings for the year?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, in the back part of the slides, Jonathan, you will see that we netted together POLR and
rate increases. So what you're seeing is the overall negative impact of having lost the POLR outcome, but that's
offsetting positive rate increases in other jurisdictions.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Oh okay, thanks.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, we continue to benefit from rate increases in the other jurisdictions.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay. On sales, I guess last quarter you sort of – you had the weak Q1, particularly in
residential, and you didn't adjust the annual forecast, and now the annual forecast is not on the slide, it's more a
year-to-date number. How should we be thinking about your expectations versus the numbers you had for the year a
quarter ago?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, Jonathan, we are coming in lower than what we have forecast for the year. And that's
largely being driven by the residential customer class, that's part of what we're striving to offset with some of the cost
reductions that we've talked about, and that lag in the residential customer classes is definitely impacting the overall
resi – retail sales on an annualized basis.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Jonathan, I think it remains to be seen what the reasons for that are, but typically when
you have industrials come up, and then commercials come up afterwards, and then residentials, either empty homes or
people decide, well, I can't find another job, so they leave. And so it's that piece of it. So you have this recovery that's
occurring, at least we call it that at this point, with industrial being sustainable, commercial starting to pick up,
residential hopefully would pick up as a result with the job creation that Brian had talked about previously. But the
other side of the coin could be from an efficiency standpoint, customers are – because of the economy, or because of
additional plants and so forth, what does the future hold in terms of the residential class. So it remains to be seen, but
something we're watching very closely.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: What's a good number for the year, kind of when you aggregate industrial and residential, is
about flat, is it a good – that's kind of what you're thinking?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No, I think closer to the up five-tenths of a percent to three quarters of a percent.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay. So you must be expecting residential to be a little less negative as you move into the
back half of the year?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, we think so.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay. Can I just – one other thing, Nick, you mentioned having been up and visited the
people at BlueStar...
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: ...can you give a bit more of a sense of where they are in their business plan, where you're
kind of targeting, are there any wins they might have had, just a flavor of how you feel about operations there?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, it's sort of interesting when I visited. We're trying to keep this really a separate culture
from the rest of the organization, because we really do want to focus on that competitive environment and walking into
the place, having a lot of young people in shorts and flip-flops, and – but it is a different environment. But it's one that's

very focused. I mean it's clear that they are focused on and energized by what Ohio can provide for them, particularly
from the unregulated generation side, to have this slug of generation being provided they can hedge against and provide
deals in the market. They are very focused and active on doing that. One of the things that struck me in the discussions
with them was how much they didn't talk about, let's go get as many kilowatt hours as we can. That wasn't part of the
deal. It was, let's go get these contracts. Do it wisely. Do it with controls in place, but focus on margins. And I think
this organization, the back office system integration continues to work very well. Matter of fact, I think all of our
customers, our existing AEP retail customers switch over to the BlueStar systems here in the next – I think in the next
week or two, two weeks?
So it's happening very quickly. And that integration process is going very well. We have AEP retail employees together
with BlueStar employees now, matter of fact we moved several AEP retail employees to Chicago to really focus on that
effort. And I see the mix of the two cultures going extremely well, because they are fueled by the prospect of just
amazing growth potential. So that's my view of it. I think it's going to be a very positive thing for us, particularly when
we get the corporate separation out of the way and they can start actually planning on making deals based upon the
availability of that generation and long-term deals with that. While I was there, they were signing up deals, matter of
fact, they told me several deals, as I was leaving, that they were very proud of from a long-term perspective. So they
are making considerable progress and I'm happy with that progress.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: They are active in the kind of Ohio – in the Illinois aggregation space?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Oh yeah, they're – matter of fact, they are operating in several states right now, certainly
Illinois in a big way, but they are also focused on other activities, particularly in Ohio. They are ramping up for Ohio,
and in the process of marketing in Ohio, and we were successful in the aggregation of Upper Arlington, which was a
major one for us. So they are certainly making considerable progress. Now, they are starting to think about, okay, what
areas do we want to focus on and we've sort of – and we've told them move forward with those activities very – as
quickly as we can, but only focus on those areas that we understand. And that really is going to drive you toward the
[ph] Masso (44:21) markets, the Northeast state, they have New York and Maryland, and other retail areas as well, but
we also participate in auctions in. So as well as our own territory, and they are also faced with the prospect we did – we
are in the process of getting approval to start up our AEP retail organization back in Texas, the lower than 1-megawatt
customers. That filing is waiting for the Commission approval right now. So we're very focused, and they are as well,
and it really is moving forward well.

<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Stephen, how are you?
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great. Thank you very much. Looking at the coal to gas switching numbers for your
combined cycle, and just wondered if you could give some color on during the peak summertime for your combined
cycles, what general output level are you expecting or are there any physical constraints or other constraints we should
be thinking about?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I think our capacity factors have been pretty high for the gas units, running in the, I
guess, in the 78% to 80% capacity factor during the July, July time we've had thus far and generally around that 70% to
80% capacity factor. I think which is sort of amazing given what we're dealing with. I think from a coal-fired
generation perspective, it's dropped off considerably.

As long as we're not having sub $3 per MMBtu price, the capacity on the gas units are going to be – continuing to be
high. There is no capacity constraints that we have on the gas units at this point in time and I think our numbers were
slightly down last month, because that's when we take some outages on some of the gas units, but we're pleased with
our gas capacity factors and our ability to respond actually, what we're – and just as an additional add-on to that, we are
continually concerned about the reliability implications of what the EPA is doing, because one thing we haven't talked
about is the capacity factors of those small older coal-fired units that are dependent upon during the peak.
As we had last year, these units are being called on and connected to the system 54% of the time and running in the
order of 30% capacity factor during these peak months. So, they're still needed and we're going to have to work through
that process. And even with those committed to provide the peak and obviously they have minimum run time
obligations and minimum load obligations we still achieved almost 80% capacity factor on the gas unit. So, that pretty
well tells you, we're really switching back and forth based upon what the peak requirements are but utilizing the energy
component through the natural gas as much as we can.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: That's very helpful. Thank you. And this builds a little on what Dan asked earlier, just
because you think about environmental compliance, but you also add on the pressure of low natural gas. You
mentioned many of these units really are quite needed from a reliability point of view. Is there a chance over time that
some of these smaller units will be candidates for retirement over and above what we've looked at on the region already
or are we kind of reaching a point where we're really going to need most of those coal plants to be around from a
reliability point of view?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think the surviving coal units, you're going to need for reliability. The smaller coal-fired
units, we're going to have to step through the process and determine physically on the system, do we need capacity at
those particular areas. And in many cases, these units are running with reliability must-run status during these peak
months. So, we're going to have to solve that equation. And that could lend itself to more natural gas-fired capacity or
transmission solutions as a result; either way, we'll benefit.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great. Thanks so much.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good morning. How are you?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: As Ohio starts to build out its shale presence is that your territory?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, it is.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Matter of fact, not just the Ohio shale, it's – we have about every shale gas play there is
from Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, on up to the Marcellus shale and the Utica shale. So, we're benefiting from that.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And you indicated a two-year extension on EPA compliance, but now capital of 33%?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Oh, what I'd said was that, if we have the two-year extension, then we have more of an
ability to approach the technological side of things. And that's why I was pointing to the EPRI study, which is an
independent organization, Electric Power Research Institute. They did a study and said that, if you were to take an
additional two years by utilizing technologies, you could actually save half of the units that are scoped for retirement
for that period of time and achieve the same emission reductions at a third less cost.

So instead of $300 billion, costing the country to address the EPA issues, it would cost around $200 billion, which –
that's a substantial cost savings, particularly when you talk about the impact on the economy. And as we go through
this process, we're going to have to – we're going to have to determine with EPA, and perhaps legislation would give
you a lot more flexibility and a lot more security around the solutions and that's what we're trying to achieve.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: So, it's a technology thing, it's not a debottlenecking of capital inputs?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No, it's – we have a plan. We have a plan now for the capital plan associated with
addressing the present EPA requirements. If we're – if the extension is really a focus on giving time for a reliability
standpoint and from a supply chain management standpoint to ensure that we're doing it in a cost effective manner and
from a reliability standpoint.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yeah, hey guys. Congrats on a good quarter.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Thanks, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Couple of model-oriented questions and then one strategic one. On the model-oriented one,
how should we be – like is the – is the impact of POLR that you've seen in the first and second quarter, do you expect a
similar run rate for the second half of the year?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We do, through portions of the third quarter, but then it was shut off during the third quarter.
So, not a similar run rate for the balance of the year.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. Other O&M, do you expect to realize similar year-over-year O&M cuts in the
second half of the year or were the O&M cuts you realized this year largely front-end loaded?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No. I think we expect to have – and this goes back to the discipline. We'll continue to have
those kinds of sustainable cuts through the rest of the year. But keep in mind, we sort of plan the year based upon what
we think the year is going to turn out to be. And then toward the end of the year, if we wind up with additional ability
to do – move projects up because last year, we moved projects from 2012 into 2011. We may move projects from 2013
into 2012 or vice versa. So, it really changes based upon how we see the year going. So, we expect that to continue. It's
a continual process for us, and it shows that discipline around cost side of things.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And last question, more – when you think about Ohio and where it fits into the
broader spectrum of AEP businesses – I mean, you guys have over the last few years progressed a ton in terms of
getting closer to or actually earning your authorized rates of return. Meaning, you're showing that you're a good team in
terms of running and realizing returns out of regulated businesses. You've gone out and bought BlueStar...
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: ...and you're now entering a new competitive business, both on the retail and wholesale
side. And I just want to kind of ask that question, is that really core to AEP? I mean, is what AEP really good at is
running a regulated business and that as you migrate towards more of a merchant model in Ohio and more competitive

model, do you wonder about whether that's really non-core to what your strengths are and that whether those businesses
really fit within the broader bubble of AEP?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: That's a great question, Michael, because, yes, we are thinking about that in terms of the
future and certainly, our Board is too. We – as we think through this process, and it goes back to the February 10
presentation that we did for everyone. It was – it's really there to say that we are a regulated utility. That's what we do.
Now, we're doing the best we can, obviously, with – we're going to have some unregulated generation. We have – we
still have one of the most outstanding wholesale trading operations there is in the country. We're going to put that
together with a retail organization and make sure there is a competitive business that's viable for the future.
Now, the decision will be made later as to whether that make sense for us or not; but it'll be based upon, as we've said
in the February 10 meeting. If we can make it look quasi-regulated, where there's long-term contracts, there's hedging
associated with the activities and the market sees that we have a business that makes sense for us in the future, then that
– we'll continue with it. But I think it's important for us to rationalize that process over the next two to three years and
fully understand what that business looks like.
The other issue, too, is we don't know what happens across the country or what happens in the next two to three years
in various fundamentals or whether states go to competition or elsewhere. So, it really winds up being a very credible
option for us in the future. Hopefully, it'll be complementary; but again, we're very focused on providing regulatory
earnings certainty for our investors. And that's something that we're very focused on.

<Q - Kit Konolige>: Couple of follow-ups. So, looking towards the August 8 order, can you just remind me, maybe I
missed this, but do you expect to get details – the Commission to provide a detailed roadmap for recovery of the
capacity deferrals at that time?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, should be, because one of the expectations out of the order is to define exactly what
that deferral mechanism is. So, we'll wind up with that. And certainly as a result of that, we need to understand the cash
position as well. And then, we'll step forward with the financing and the activities associated with separation of the
generation function from AEP Ohio. So, we have to have that kind of detail.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: So, it is separate – so on – in the August 8 order also, then you expect – is the separation
agreement going to be part of that? And is it going to be clear – the ability to transfer the couple of large coal plants to
the regulated entities?

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. We expect the corporate separation order to be done at the same time.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Very good. And then – so one other separate area then – on the switching outlook, following the
capacity order now, can – maybe I missed this, all right, but can you give us kind of an updated look forward on, now
given where you know you are so far and given what you know about the ability of competitors to charge at RPM
rates? What's the outlook for switching, say, for the rest of the year or even the next couple of years?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. I think, we should expect to see acceleration of switching as a result. And I'd also
believe that the certainty around the ESP order on February 8 will help in that regard. So, from a competitive standpoint
and knowing what the process is, the market will more fully understand. The other thing, too, is they'll understand what
our reaction is because, obviously, we're looking for a decent outcome out of this thing. Otherwise, we have other
options that we need to consider. And that can produce lack of clarity for the market. So, it's pretty critical that we get
this train back on the tracks in a positive fashion.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Thank you.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Josh, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. That question comes from the line of Raymond – I'm going to mess it up – Leung from Goldman Sachs. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Raymond M. Leung>: Hey, guys. It's Raymond Leung. Nice try. Couple of questions. One, to follow on
Michael's question about regulated – unregulated business, what – as you guys think about it, what sort of the right
composition mix, Nick, do you think you should have between regulated and unregulated as you sort of think about that
business longer-term? And then I have some more – couple of other housekeeping questions?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: At the end of a day, it's – that percentage where I can get a regulated PE and still have a
competitive business that looks regulated. So, I think in our February 10th, we had 86% regulated, 14% unregulated
including the 4% of, over our river operations area. So, as I say we're a regulated utility, so in my opinion, for our
shareholders not to experience the volatility in such a large manner associated with the competitive business, we would
want a substantial part of our business enough to where we continue to fall in the integrated regulated utility category.
<Q - Raymond M. Leung>: Okay. And in terms of BlueStar, what type of margins should we expect. Have you
provided any type of range or how we should think about that business in terms of profitability?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, Brian?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We anticipate margins in the high single-digits to mid double-digits, mid-teens.
<Q - Raymond M. Leung>: Is that on a percentage or dollar per megawatt hour?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Dollar per.
<Q - Raymond M. Leung>: And then last thing on terms of your financing plans, and I think you indicated about $1
billion for this year, can you elaborate on that and maybe some any updated thoughts on how you're going to fund the
non-regulated side of the business?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Sure, let me start with the first part of that. We have a maturity coming due at APCo here in
the near-term and we also have some needs for our transmission business as well as we want to take advantage of some
of these low term interest rates to fund our business for the long-term. So a combination of those things are what are
going to add up to that billion dollar need for the end of the year. And then in terms of deregulated competitive
business, we've not talked about how we're going to fund. Ultimately, the competitive Ohio generation, whether or not,
we're going to do at the Genco level or the parent level, though we do believe we're going to have some in term

financing needs until we get to that long-term solution and we'll be looking to put those interim needs in place by the
end of the year.
