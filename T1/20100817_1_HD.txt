Now before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our
executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to,
those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Today's presentations also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is provided
in the financial statements included with our earnings release.
Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.
Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $19.4 billion, up 1.8% from last
year. Comp sales were positive 1.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.72. Our U.S. stores had a positive
comp of 1%.
From a geographic perspective, 70% of our top 40 U.S. markets positively comped in the second quarter. Florida and
California continued their positive growth paths, with performance in line with the company average. We saw a retreat
from some of the very strong numbers in the first quarter, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where key markets like
Portland and Seattle turned to negative comps. But on a year-over-year comparison for the second quarter, every
market except the hurricane-impacted market of Houston improved.
As Craig will detail, one of the clear patterns of the first and second quarters was a shift in the timing of outdoor garden
spend. We had something of a bathtub effect in the first half in garden. Strengthen in the first quarter was
counterbalanced by weakness the second quarter. But overall in garden, the first half came out about where we
expected.
And it's a similar picture for the company as a whole. We anticipated that second quarter comps would decline from the
first quarter. They did, but for the half, we came in ahead of where we had planned. This gives us some confidence, as
we look into the back half. We have two quarters in a row of positive comps in the U.S. We have a continuing pattern
of positive comp transactions in our stores. We're gaining share in key categories, and basic execution across the
business is sound.
We are also continuing to invest in our core initiatives. We opened our 14th and 15th rapid deployment centers, or
RDCs, during the quarter in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona, and we just opened our 16th RDC in
Findley, Ohio, yesterday. RDCs now serve over 80% of our U.S. stores, and we remain on track to reach our goal of
serving 100% by the end of the year. This has been a huge undertaking that has involved the entire organization. And
we think it's a very positive sign that in the midst of this build-out, the company is also improving its inventory turns.
For the third quarter in a row our inventory turns have improved. This is something we hadn't achieved in almost a
decade.
Craig and the merchandising team continue to develop and use new merchandising tools. The benefits of this are most
clearly seen in our reduced markdowns for seasonal categories like patio and barbecue grills, where better visibility into
and planning for seasonal inventory have significantly reduced the markdowns necessary to effectively exit those
categories.
Marvin and the store operations team are also continuing on the path of improving customer service. We've previously
discussed our Customer First Program. Marvin has now launched a version of that for our Pro customers and a special
version focused on our checkout process, and we continue to see improvement in our Net Promoter Scores.
On the international front, our Canadian business had flat comps for the quarter, as it experienced some of the same
impacts in the western regions of Canada as the U.S. experienced in the Pacific Northwest. And our Mexican business
had another quarter of positive comps, making it 27 quarters in a row of positive comp growth.

There are, however, reasons to be cautious across our business. We still see weakness in our Pro segment. We had
anticipated that we would start to see growth in our Pro customers as we moved into the second quarter, and based on
that, we thought we'd see gradual improvement in our average ticket. We're now forecasting modest to flat
improvement on the Pro side, which puts pressure on average ticket. We also are anticipating softer housing-related
activity than we originally thought. Clearly there was some pull-forward of activity from the homebuyer tax credits,
and foreclosures remain high. And, of course, on a broader economic level, unemployment remains stubbornly high
and wage growth weak.
All of these factors counsel caution as we enter the back half of the year. As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are
maintaining our earnings guidance for the year but revising our sales guidance to reflect these concerns. Instead of
significant sequential improvement from the first half to the back half, we now think that the two halves will be similar
after adjusting for commodity price inflation.
Our market has been through four extremely difficult years. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP
remains at historically low levels. But as uncertain as the economic climate is, we are seeing our business return to
sales growth and the hardest hit parts of the country start to stabilize. So we will continue to invest and position our
business for recovery.
I want to thank our associates for their hard work in the second quarter. We are very proud of the fact that 97% of our
stores will be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates.
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising
Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. As expected, second quarter comps showed some deceleration following
a strong first quarter, and seasonal pull-forwards, but we're pleased with our overall performance. The departments that
outperformed the company average comp were lumber, electrical lighting and plumbing. Kitchens and flooring
performed at the company average comp, hardware and paint showed positive comps, while comps in millwork,
seasonal and building materials were slightly negative for the quarter. Based on census data through June, our U.S.
market share is up 28 basis points on a 12-month rolling basis.
We continue to see strength in transactions, but have not yet turned the corner on average ticket. Comp transactions
were up 1.7% in the quarter, but overall comp average ticket remained flat at $52.30. Reflecting the economic
environment, we continued to see negative growth in big ticket. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above,
approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were down 4.9% in the second quarter. This was driven by continued pressure on big
ticket discretionary spend projects, as well as lower appliance sales, which negatively impacted the company's comp by
30 basis points in the quarter. Transactions for tickets under $50, also roughly 20% of the business in the U.S., were up
2.4% year-over-year. The primary drivers of this were the continued strength in repair and maintenance projects and
simple decor. In the second quarter, categories such as cleaning, plumbing repair, roofing, chemicals and safety and
security led the way.
Let me share with you some specifics around our seasonal business in the quarter. We saw positive comp growth across
several seasonal product categories such as barbecue grills, portable power equipment and landscape lighting. This
summer's record heat across much of the U.S. drove double-digit comps in products like air conditioners and fans. In
contrast, the excessive heat kept many DIY gardeners indoors, and we saw softer comp performance in live goods and
landscape than anticipated. As an example, live goods went from high single-digit positive comps in the first quarter to
negative comps in the second quarter.
To put all of this in perspective, of the deceleration in U.S. comps that we saw from the first quarter to the second
quarter, approximately 200 basis points are directly related to outdoor categories, offset by 40 basis points of growth in
air-cooling. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance year-to-date in our seasonal business, and we feel good
about our inventory position in seasonal categories as we enter the third quarter.

We continue to execute our portfolio strategy and drive results from our investments in merchandise category resets,
new product introductions and the implementation of our everyday great value. Let me share a few examples of this.
First, program resets in place for more than 13 weeks are exceeding our expectations. Enhanced discipline around
planning and impact modeling have led to more productive resets and less disruption for our stores.
Second, we have added new products to strengthen portions of a category's line structure. In carpet, we launched the
new Martha Stewart and Platinum Plus programs, which provide customers with lifetime stain warranties. Last week,
these programs provided over 100% lift in sales, versus a year ago from the products that they replaced.
Third, we have been working to provide everyday great values across all levels of price points. In hand tools, we
improved our offerings in both the opening and the upper price point segments. In tool storage, we updated our Husky
product in the upper price point segments. And we introduced Ryobi's Lithium ONE+ technology into cordless outdoor
power equipment. With these introductions, each of these categories delivered positive comp performance in the
second quarter.
Lastly, we continue to drive excellent execution in inventory through better process, new forecasting tools, and
leveraging our new supply chain capabilities. Let me offer some details. Around process, we combined our import and
domestic DCs, which have begun to yield benefits through a more simplified approach to product flow.
We also completed the rollout of our Teradata DCM forecasting tool for centrally-replenished items. This enables us to
make better inventory decisions and react more quickly to trends in the business at a store SKU level. And, of course,
you know about our RDCs, which, among many other things, shorten effective lead-time, eliminate vendor minimums
and improve productivity in our ordering process. The benefits of these actions can be seen in our inventory turnover
improvements and the fact that our in-stocks are at record high levels.
As we move towards the fall, we're excited about several new product launches in our holiday offering that will be set
at the end of the third quarter. We also have several outstanding special buys planned, starting with our current Vanity
Insanity bath event going on now. Customers are responding very well to this event, and you should come into our
stores and check it out.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial
Officer
Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $19.4 billion, a 1.8% increase from last year.
Comps or same store sales were positive 1.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 0.6% in May, positive 3.9% in
June, and positive 1% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 1% for the quarter, with U.S. comps of negative
0.9% in May, positive 3.7% in June and positive 0.4% in July. Please note that in 2010, Memorial Day weekend fell in
our June rather than our May reporting period.
Our gross margin was 33.9% for the quarter, an increase of 41 basis points from last year. Our U.S. business
contributed 36 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, driven primarily by the following factors: First, stronger
sales in certain categories drove us to higher purchasing tiers and allowed us to earn more co-op and rebate dollars than
last year. Second, we experienced lower markdowns than last year due to better management of our seasonal categories
as well as fewer promotions. Finally, our international businesses contributed five basis points of gross margin
expansion, due primarily to higher rebates and lower shrink than last year.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 53 basis points to 23.4%. Adjusting for the strategic charges
taken in the second quarter of 2009, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 43 basis points from last
year. Our operating leverage reflects positive same store sales as well as lower expenses in the following areas. First,
we saw 14 basis points of payroll leverage arising from the nature of our spring hiring. You will recall that we pulled
forward spring hiring into the first quarter, and this, coupled with a higher mix of seasonal and part-time workers,

contributed to the payroll leverage in the second quarter. Second, we realized 13 basis points of leverage from lower
depreciation expense, reflecting our smaller fixed asset base. Finally, we saw 14 basis points of leverage in our general
and administration expenses, due primarily to the rationalization of our management structure and a resulting decrease
in incentive compensation.
For 2010, we expected our expenses to increase by a factor of 50% of our sales growth rate. For the first six months of
the year, we were on our expense rule of thumb, as adjusted expenses increased by 1.8% compared to adjusted sales
growth of 3.6%. We expect to see some expense relief in the back half of the year. So we now believe that our expenses
for the year will grow at a factor of less than 50% of sales growth.
Interest and other expense for the quarter totaled $148 million, down $13 million from last year, reflecting lower levels
of outstanding indebtedness. Our income tax provision rate was 37.3% in the second quarter, reflecting the timing of
state tax settlements. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. Earnings per share for
the second quarter were $0.72, up 9.1% from last year, and reflect $0.02 of benefit arising from our share repurchase
program.
No moving to our operational metrics, during the second quarter we opened one new store in Mexico and closed one
store in China, for an ending store count of 2,244. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 235
million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $328, up roughly 2%
year-over-year.
Now turning to the balance sheet, we continue to effectively manage our inventory. At the end of the quarter retail
inventory was $10.8 billion, down $38 million from a year ago. On a per store basis, inventory decreased by 0.5%.
Inventory turns were 4.4 times, up from 4.3 times a year ago. We ended the quarter with $42.5 billion in assets
including $2.4 billion in cash. This is an increase of approximately $974 million in cash from the end of fiscal 2009,
reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $3.4 billion, offset by $1.2 billion used for share
repurchases, $793 million used for dividends and $407 million of capital expenditures.
Now on the capital structure front, a few items of note. First, in the second quarter we repurchased $700 million or 21.4
million shares of outstanding stock. Second, during the quarter we replaced our $3.25 billion paper program with a new
$2 billion commercial paper program that is 100% backstopped by a committed long-term bank line of credit. As of the
end of the second quarter, we had no outstanding commercial paper. Third, computed on the average of beginning and
ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 11.5%, 220 basis points
higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2009. And finally, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of
senior notes that came due on August 15 and expect to refinance them later this quarter.
As Frank mentioned, we executed well during the first half of the year, but economic recovery is progressing at a
slower pace than we originally expected, as illustrated by the Fed's recent change to its GDP outlook for 2010. You will
recall that our plan assumed we would see ticket growth in the back half of the year. We now think that ticket growth
will not materialize and that our sales growth will come from transaction growth. We believe the back half of the year
will resemble the first half of the year, which when backing out the commodity price inflation we experienced in the
first half, suggests back-half sales growth in the 2% area.
Based on our year-to-date results and our current expectations for the back half of the year, we are updating our
guidance for fiscal 2010. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are calling for fiscal 2010 sales to increase by
approximately 2.6%, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing by approximately 22.6% to $1.90.
Within this guidance, we now expect our operating margin to be approximately 8.3% for the year. This guidance
includes the benefit of our year-to-date share repurchases, but doesn't include the impact of any additional share
repurchases. It is our intent, however, to use excess cash to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of fiscal 2010.
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And Yvonne, we are now ready to take questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.
<Q - Deborah Weinswig>: Thanks so much and thanks for all the color on the call. In terms of your gross margin
performance, which was extremely impressive, how should we think about the impact of the merchandising tools on
the performance in the quarter?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, let me
break down the gross margin expansion for you in the U.S. and then, Craig, you can talk about the tools. But if you
look at the 36 basis points of expansion that we had in the quarter, 16 basis points came from higher co-op and rebate
dollars, as we entered in new purchasing tiers. 12 basis points came from lower markdowns, given our better
management of seasonal. And then 8 basis points came from fewer promotions, and those were primarily credit
promotions. So you can see we got a good deal of benefit from markdowns. And, Craig, you might want to talk about
the tools?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Yeah, Deb. We continue to work to enhance our
assortment planning, utilizing our merchandising tools to try to get the right product in the right place. Obviously, the
advantage when we do that is not only a sales advantage by having the right product there, but also it allows us to
effectively move in and out of the inventory, which saves on the markdowns and really helps us drive the overall gross
margin productivity in a particular product category. And as Carol mentioned, you can see the benefit in the markdown
line.
<Q - Deborah Weinswig>: Okay. Thanks. And then, Frank, you've talked a lot about your Customer First Program
and how that's really improving your customer service in the stores. Can you talk about some of the metrics behind that
and what you've noticed over time as that program has continued to develop?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, thanks, Deb. Marvin Ellison is here, so I'll ask
Marvin to address that. Marvin?
<A - Marvin Ellison>: Hey, Deb. This is Marvin. What we've seen is a continued increase in our internal customer
satisfaction scores. We are benefited by having about a half a million customer surveys per month that we get in when
customers log on and tell us what they think. We're in a great position because our customers are very passionate, so
they tell us what they like and what they don't like.
As a result of that, we've had our Net Promoter Score increase over 500 basis points in Q3 – Q2 rather. That's on top of
a 1,000-basis point increase in Q2 of last year. We're also seeing things like likelihood to recommend, which is our
version of intent to return, it is at record highs for the company, as high as it's ever been in the eight years that I've been
here, so we feel really good about it.
As Frank mentioned, what we're going to do in the second half is put an increased emphasis on checkout. We still noted
that's one of our Achilles' heels from a service standpoint. We want to speed up our checkout process and make it more
inviting for the customers, and we're also going to put a specific emphasis on Pro and service because we know that
when we provide quicker in and out service for our contractors, then we have a chance to grow market share.
<Q - Deborah Weinswig>: And last question, and then I'll turn it back over. In an environment where obviously traffic
trends have been difficult, but you're obviously significantly outperforming, would you – there's obviously a lot of
initiatives on your plate, but would you say that this is one of the keys to driving strong traffic in your stores?
<A - Marvin Ellison>: Absolutely. Craig and I talk a lot about a real simple equation, and that is having compelling
value from the merchants to create footsteps, and then the engagement of the associate to the customer turns those
footsteps into transactions. And we think that as we've increased our product knowledge, we've increased our training
on engagement, we've seen the trajectory in transactions start to go up and continue to stay positive. But it's a
combination of compelling value from the merchandising team that invites the customers in, but when we engage those
customers, we turn those footsteps into transactions. And we're going to continue to focus on that in the second half.

<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: And if I could just
jump in, it really is a team effort, because looking at our in-stocks, our in-stocks are at record high levels. So when
you've got great value, great service and the product is in stock, well that certainly drives transactions.
<Q - Deborah Weinswig>: Well, keep up the great work and best of luck.
<A - Marvin Ellison>: Thank you.
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Thanks, Deb.
Operator
And we'll take next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning to you. I guess two questions. The first, how are you thinking
about forecasting sales as it relates to the macro backdrop of the volatility that we've seen in housing activity? All of us
are – kind of share I think the sales outlook that you put out there, but the drivers are a lot less obvious, given the
housing scheme unless you've seen existing home sales moving up and down with unprecedented volatility. So what's
the basis for your assumption that sales growth stays level over the course of the year, other than it has essentially held
this level for the past several months?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Matt, and it's a great question.
And we obviously spend a lot of time kind of working through how do we forecast the back half. And if you take into
account what Craig was saying in terms of the shift, first quarter and second quarter in garden, you go okay, overall you
start with first half came in ahead of where we expected. Second half was – I mean, but the geography of the half was
not what we expected. And that was driven overwhelmingly by the shift in garden pull-forward in the first quarter and a
bit of a draining in the second quarter.
And then you go okay, we've seen continuing strength in transactions across the business, which is kind of a good sign
across the business. And say that we think that projects forward into the back half, and then as Carol was saying you –
we are lightening our assumptions on ticket growth, in large part because the pros are a little slower to come back than
we thought, and that gets the equation of around a 2% sales growth, and that's the thought process.
I can tell you behind that, I mean we do a lot of things, as you can imagine, we keep talking about private fixed
residential investment, and that's had a great correlation up until recently with our sales. The difficulty with that, and
you hit on it, is a lot of the broader macro numbers actually change pretty quickly. So if you just looked at kind of
quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter what our projections on PFRI were or what the expert projections on PFRI were, they
have changed quite dramatically over the course of the last year. So that does make forecasting in this environment a
little challenging.
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: But I think you
gain confidence based on how you're performing. And while it's early, if you look at our sales in August, we are on our
plan and August sales are better than July.
<Q - Matthew Fassler>: That's helpful color. One follow-up, if I may, and that relates to the appliance category.
What's your sense of how your share transpired in major appliances in Q2 versus Q1? I know that the stimulus
programs were still alive, albeit at a much-diminished rate in the second quarter, and any color you could give on trends
in that business would be helpful.
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Yeah, Matt. This is Craig. When you look at Q2 as
reported by an independent third-party, we actually stepped backwards about 60 basis points in Q2. On a rolling
12-month basis, points were up 80 basis points in the appliance business from that same survey.
<Q - Matthew Fassler>: Any sense as to whether that relates to promotional stance, inventory, marketing? Anything
that you could put your finger on?

<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: We, as you know, we've talked about the fact that
our appliance business, we're very comfortable with our appliance business as to how it's positioned inside of our
portfolio strategy. We're the third player in this business. We're comfortable being the third player in this business.
During the quarter, we very purposely elected not to chase some deep discounts that happened in the market.

And we'll take our next question from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: Good morning, and thank you. First question, just some clarity on some of the comp numbers
you gave. Do you have an estimate for what the shift in Memorial Day might have meant for the May versus June
comp? And then secondly, can you just clarify the 200 basis point swing? Is that just essentially the delta between first
and second quarter that you saw from seasonal?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, to answer
you first question, there was a 70 basis point impact in both May and June. So in other words, May – and I'm talking
the U.S. obviously, May would have been 70 basis points less negative and June would have been 70 basis points less
positive. Then in terms of the seasonal shift, I think that was Craig's comment?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Yeah. The – it was 200 basis points for all of our
outdoor categories that actually was impacted in the quarter comparatively to the first.
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: So if you just
want to work the math, you start with a 3.3% positive comp in the first quarter, and then deduct from that 200 basis
points, add to that 40 basis points from air-cooling.
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Air-cooling. Gets you back to the comp.
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Exactly.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: Okay, so same adjustment both quarters. And then secondly, I'm not sure if I interpreted your
comments correctly, but the paint category sounded like it was still positive, but maybe below average. And I would
have thought with some of your repair and remodel comments that, that would have still been a strong category for you.
So can you just elaborate on what you guys are seeing in that category?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Sure. The paint category was in fact still positive,
although not quite as strong as it was in the first quarter, as we comped over the introduction of our Behr Ultra from a
year ago. So still feel very solid about our paint business, an area that we remain focused on overall.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.

We'll take our next question from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Chris Horvers>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Chris Horvers>: First a follow-up question on the top line, and then one on the gross margin. As you think about
the Pro, you're saying now it's kind of flat to slightly up I think in the back half. How are you thinking about that? Is

that basically saying hey, look, if I just look at roughly a three-year or maybe even a four-year trend and then saying, if
we just keep comping those negative compares, does that imply getting towards a flat level? Or is there some sort of
embedded acceleration as you think about it?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Chris, I, first off, it's more the former than the
latter. So if you think about the commentary that we've had on the Pro over the last several calls, we changed the way
we measure it. We think we've got a more accurate measurement of who our Pro customers are. As we improved the
accuracy of the measurement, one of the things we found was kind of a double-digit decline in the Pro business as you
exited the back half of 2008 and through 2009, gradually improving to where we're now kind of in the low negative
single-digit on Pro sales in our stores. We had anticipated in the back half a more significant recovery, in large part for
exactly the reason you said, you just looked at your stacked comparisons, and now, just based on the performance in
the second quarter, we see that as more gradually getting to flat and then slightly positive.
<Q - Chris Horvers>: Okay. So no acceleration. Just basically...
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Not really.
<Q - Chris Horvers>: Yeah. Okay.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I mean, it's largely just on the comparisons and kind of
grinding through some bad numbers and getting to better.
<Q - Chris Horvers>: Okay. And then actually on the SG&A side, Carol, you talked about less than 50% ratio to sales
growth for the year. Can you talk about maybe more granularly what that means for the back half and what the levers
are there that gets you to those levels? Are you taking cost out? Is it incentive comp comparisons? How are you
forecasting labor and so forth?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. Well, if you
look at our expenses on an adjusted basis, dollar expenses were actually down in the first half. And as we look at the
back half, we expect dollar expenses to be down again. Why? Well, the biggest driver of that is incentive
compensation. And it's all based on relative performance. We're paid off of plan. Last year we smashed our plan. This
year we're expecting to be on our plan, and so the dollars are down year on year. The other driver for the back half of
the year has to do with vacation, sick and holiday, and given the nature of our staffing in our stores, we have less
vacation, sick and holiday expense forecasted for the back half of the year than we did last year.
<Q - Chris Horvers>: And that's the part-time/full-time mix?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: It is.
<Q - Chris Horvers>: Okay. Thank you very much.

We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. We've heard from several retailers that
consumer spending seems to be more event-driven right now, particularly for discretionary items. And in the second
quarter you had Memorial Day, Father's Day and the 4th of July. What sort of trends did you see around those events
and then in between the periods, and how does that impact how you think about the third quarter when there will be
fewer events in that period?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Michael, this is Craig. Certainly a lot of focus and
effort goes into the holiday periods, because those are big sales weeks for retailers, and we were very pleased with the
results that we saw around those events. But when we look at kind of the fundamentals of the business and what

customers are doing right now, customers are, remain focused on maintaining their homes, so repair and maintenance
categories are pretty stable across the business. We have been keenly focused on making sure that we are providing the
right offerings for customers in those day-to-day activities as well as simple decor updates. So categories like faucets
and paint and simple flooring projects are where we're focused, and that is the foundation, as I mentioned in my
comments, to our transactions and really keeping customers coming in to The Home Depot.
As we look to the back half, we think that customers will remain there. They'll remain focused not only in their yards, I
think there is certainly some stress that the yards have been through in the second quarter. So there's an opportunity
there. But we also think that they'll continue to focus on the maintenance and repair and simple updates around their
home. So we feel like we're well positioned for the back half against what we believe customers will actually be doing.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: So just to clarify, it wasn't as though you saw a big spike in your comp around the holidays and
then things dropped off in between?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: No. Not, I mean again, we performed well on the
holidays, and the holiday periods would be above a typical week. Again, put more marketing, more effort behind it, but
it's not like a dramatic...
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: But I think, Michael, in answer to your question, it
didn't seem any more spiky this year than it has in prior years.
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: In prior years.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay, and then as a quick follow-up, were there any other categories that you found to be
excessively promotional during the period that you chose not to participate might have impacted the relative
performance of those categories?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: No, I wouldn't say that there was a ton of activity
outside of the appliances that I mentioned, no.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. Sounds good. Thanks a lot.

We'll take our next question from Stephen Chick with FBR.
<Q - Stephen Chick>: Hi, thanks. You mentioned that the second quarter sales assumptions were similar to the – or
sorry, second half, were similar to the first half I think if you normalize for inflation. And I had, I think you had said
that the first quarter inflation in the comps was about 100 basis points. What was the second quarter?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: The commodity
inflation was 100 basis points for the quarter and for the half.
<Q - Stephen Chick>: Okay. So it was 100 basis points again in this quarter?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Stephen Chick>: Okay. And sorry Craig if I – the math, the 200-basis points math in the shift that you went
through, I'm sorry to make you guys go through that again. But can, I didn't quite grasp – if you could reconcile that
again for us, that'd be helpful.
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: So if you look at U.S. comps at 3.3 in the first
quarter, you take the seasonal businesses, which fell 200 basis points, gets you down to 1.3. Add in 40 basis points of
air-cooling product, which was a plus, gets you back to the 1.7 comp.
<Q - Stephen Chick>: Okay. But the 1.7 comp was the total company – not the U.S. – it was 1 for the quarter, right?

Page 11 of 16
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: The U.S. comp
was 1% for the quarter. So Craig is just tying you out to the 1.7. There's another 70 basis point of shift in the business,
if you will, to get you to the reported 1% for the U.S.
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Correct.
<Q - Stephen Chick>: Okay. So as we work into I guess the second half more importantly, once you – I'm assuming
you've kind of thought about the fourth quarter. If we keep the 2% transaction count comp, let's say we assume that you
get back to – or you're 2% for each quarter, the fourth quarter is a very – it's a pretty tough compare. I mean Canada
had a pretty good, tough comparison a year ago, I think both in terms of FX as well as the strength of the business. So
is there – are you thinking about maybe the third quarter being higher than the fourth? Or should we think about it
being pretty even at two apiece?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I mean, Steve, I'd say we're thinking about it as kind of
even over the two quarters. Without a doubt, as you said, there's a bigger hill in the fourth quarter, because you saw
stronger numbers from us in the fourth quarter of 2009. I would say on the other hand, all of these things are
comparisons, so you've got to look at fourth quarter previously. And so we see them as balancing out, and we have
taken into account – obviously, in Canada we saw a significant improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly the last
month in Canada last year.
<Q - Stephen Chick>: And does the mix of small versus large transaction change much, Craig? The 20% and 20%,
can we kind of think about that being a similar mix in the second half?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Yeah, it's pretty flat. That number doesn't change
dramatically quarter to quarter.
<Q - Stephen Chick>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: You're welcome.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yep.

We'll take our next question from David Schick with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - David Schick>: Good morning. First question I think for Craig, you'd talked about the Pro business remaining
sluggish and limiting the ticket. Is there sort of any evidence as you look at it that the DIY customer is sort of
rethinking the good, better, best spectrum within a category as they're purchasing?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: No, I mean actually we're – again, it varies by
product category, but we're seeing kind of a typical buying pattern throughout the line structure and categories. As I
mentioned in my comments, we actually improved our offerings in – like, for example, our tool storage at the upper
end. That was very well received by the customers. If you look at the Ryobi Lithium in cordless, which is actually at
the top end of our cordless offering in our outdoor power equipment, for a cordless category, that has performed
extremely well.
Likewise, we've also made sure – customer's focused on value across all of the line segments. So we're trying to
strengthen each of the areas as we did, for example, in hand tools. We actual went at both ends of the business and saw
good results.
<Q - David Schick>: Okay. Thanks. I guess this question's maybe a little bit circular, given your comments at the end,
Carol, but the buyback, you've always talked about a more – maybe I'm adding the word regular, but a regular and
substantial buyback when you kind of saw stabilization in the business, and you stepped it up in the quarter. You talked
about it with – you'll do it with excess cash flows. But is this the sort of pace we should expect going forward on

average or absolutely? Or will there be a lot of volatility, or am I thinking about that wrong?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, at the
beginning of the year, we said based on our forecast of cash that we could see us buying about $3 billion worth of
shares in 2010. We've bought 1.2 billion to date, so that's about 40% of the program. As I mentioned on the call, we
needed to save some cash in our bank account to repay the bonds, and this is just a timing thing. We're going to
refinance those senior notes later this quarter. So you should expect us to go back into the market. We will start
repurchasing shares, and as much as $3 billion this year, and in a thoughtful, plan-ful way.

And we'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Hey, guys, Scot Ciccarelli. I guess I had a follow-up comment regarding, or question regarding
the cadence for the second half sales. I guess the question is essentially why do you expect comps will accelerate in the
fourth quarter? Because it looks like to me you would need a fairly meaningful improvement even on a three-year, run
rate basis? I guess I'm just trying to figure out what is it that, about the business that's going to get quite a bit better in
the fourth quarter?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Well, Scot, I mean, it's not an enormous step
forward. I think what you go, what you say is the business, you have to start with fundamental that you think the
business is turning. You go okay, you're going to maintain your comp transactions growth. We think we've got some
plans in place across our business that will continue to drive growth into the fourth quarter. For every turn, I mean as
the business turns, you're going to hit a point where you go gee, I'm lapping where it started to turn last year, can I
sustain it? And so our task is to sustain that turn. But if you said, hey, yeah, the numbers mathematically, it's harder in
the fourth quarter than the third quarter, the comment is not arguable.
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Many retailers are
talking about holiday sales as perhaps challenging this year. Holiday's not big for us. But we think we're going to have
a good holiday season.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Given that it's in hindsight now, do you
guys have any color on what the impact of that housing tax credit may have been on your business? Kind of when you
saw that expire, was there a change either in terms of quantification or kind of what people were buying?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So, Scot, on the quantification side, we really don't
have that. And I'd say that it's going to take another couple of quarters for us to figure it out. I mean we're now going
into a period where for the first time we're going to be having a few quarters without federal tax credits that apply to the
housing-related activity. We feel qualitatively that there was a pull-forward. Hard to know what it was, whether there
were some incremental sales, pull-forward, what's the division between them? I'd say we're really going to have to wait
until the end of the year to have a clearer picture on quantitatively what that was.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yep.
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you.

We'll take our next question from David Strasser with Janney Montgomery Scott.
<Q - David Strasser>: Thank you very much. Two questions. First of all, Canada, and the reason I ask this is because
Wal-Mart said something very similar this morning. It seemed like Canada has slowed down, particularly the west
coast of Canada. I'm just trying to think about as you – which has been such a strong part of your business for awhile,
as you think about it into the back half of the year and think about inventory replenishment and particularly in the
western part of it, I mean do you think, do you sense a trend there? Or do you think it was a somewhat short-lived issue
there?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, David, as I mentioned, it is interesting, because
we get, we see both what was happening in the Northwest part of the U.S. as well as what was happening in the western
part of Canada. And an awful lot of it was just straight, I mean, you hate to say the weather word, but an awful lot of it
in the second quarter was just a straight weather impact.
<Q - David Strasser>: Okay. Because I guess just hearing it from Wal-Mart as well, kind of just jumped out a little
bit...
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I would, I'm sure there are probably other
retailers that experienced the same thing. But we had strength in the eastern part of Canada, which would again,
suggest, look, if you normalize for weather, about, there was, the country as a whole was okay.
<Q - David Strasser>: All right. And it's also the first time I'd heard it. So that is logical. Second question, Carol, you
said that August got a little bit better from July. Anything in particular that seemed to accelerate? Was it
weather-related, you think, August getting better? Any other ways to think about that helped that trend?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, it's early
days. It has cooled off a little bit in parts of the country. And as Craig mentioned, we've got Vanity Insanity inside our
stores. So you should go check it out.

We'll take our next question from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.
<Q - Budd Bugatch>: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to just focus a little bit on gross margin. Carol, I think you
said that you had 16 basis points from rebates in this quarter and 12 basis points from lower markdowns and 8 from
fewer promotions. How should we think about that going forward? The rebates continue and the fewer promotions
continue, or what do you think about gross margin for the second half?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, at the
beginning of the year we told you to expect modest gross margin expansion for the full year. We're up 40 basis points
for the first half on an adjusted basis. I would say 40 is a little bit more than modest. So look for gross margin
expansion in the back half, but not at the same level that we experienced in the first half.

And we'll take our next question from Daniel Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Dan Binder>: Hi. Good morning. It's Dan Binder. I'm just curious with the Fed guidelines on the credit cards and
your profit sharing arrangement, if there was any benefit or detriment as a result of those new guidelines on your credit
income?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, there –
gosh, lots of things have happened, haven't they, as it relates to credit cards in our country. Our cost of credit is capped
at no more than 1.5% of credit sales, and currently we're running slightly under that. But we are seeing something
interesting in terms of the behavior of the cardholders, and that really relates to the change that happened earlier this
year with the CARD Act, where the everyday value propositions that we used to offer, which was if you spent $299 on
the card, it was no interest, no payments for six months, that's now changed to no interest minimum payment for six
months.
And what we've seen is a decline in the penetration of usage of our private label card. Actually in the second quarter it
declined almost 400 basis points to now just 21% of our sales. So as we think about this, private label is a great value
proposition. It's the cheapest form of credit for us. We want more customers to use our card, so we do have a program
inside our stores called Everyday Saving, which on certain everyday items like light bulbs and trash bags and air filters,
if you use our card, it's everyday 10% off. So we're doing a number of things to drive up penetration, but in terms of
our cost, we don't anticipate any change.
Now I could comment, if you'd like, on the Durbin amendment to the financial reform bill. The Durbin amendment
speaks to interchange fees on debit cards. Debit is about 18% of total penetration for our business, and there is PIN
debit and signature debit. PIN debit is cheap. Signature debit was expensive. It cost more than clearing a check. With
the Durbin amendment, the Federal Reserve has been given the right to determine what the fees should be on a
reasonable and proportionate basis. We think that when those fees come out, there could be a benefit to our company
next year beginning in July, and that benefit could be in the $30 million area, which we could then turn around and
reduce retail prices or make investments in other areas.
<Q - Dan Binder>: That's great color. I was just curious with that 400 basis point reduction in penetration of the
private label card, has your overall credit penetration come down?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Overall credit
penetration has dropped 100 basis points, so bank cards picked up 300 of the 400 decline, but penetration is down.
<Q - Dan Binder>: Great. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.
<Q - Colin McGranahan>: Thank you. Just a follow-up question on expenses, I think consecutively you've not only
done well in the quarters, but continued to find ways to reduce the growth rate of your expenses below the growth rate
of sales. We're obviously in a pretty uncertain environment here. If things do tend to trend down, how much more juice
is there in that stone? What are remaining areas that you could still go after to take more expenses out of the business
after all the success you've had?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Colin, I'd say there are always opportunities. I mean the
challenge in our business is how we use things like technology to help us approach things more efficiently and
effectively. We've – embedded in the numbers that Carol was going through was a number of examples like that where
we think we've been able to reduce structure, use technology and provide a better outcome. There are things that we are
working on even as we speak that would do the same thing. So it's – and to be clear, we'd work on those if the
conditions were great or harsh.

<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. Right.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Because they're the right thing to do for the business,
and we think they actually improve the business. So there is still – I can tell you we've got a lot of projects that are
going on that we think help take expense out of the business long term.
<Q - Colin McGranahan>: Okay. Fair enough. And then a follow-up question for Carol. It looks like on a gross basis,
so gross debt to EBITDAR is now down to just a touch over two times, and net debt to EBITDAR by our model is
about 1.75 times. I think a bit below where your target leverage ratios are. Obviously it's a period of uncertainty, but at
the same time it's a period of relatively cheap debt financing. So how are you thinking about the right leverage in the
business and when you might get closer to a target leverage ratio and what that might mean for the stock buyback going
forward?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, first of all,
we agree with your calculation. Secondly, it's important just to reiterate that we will maintain our strong investment
grade rating of BBB+ and that our target adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio of 2.5 we believe allows us to maintain that
rating, so we are under it. We could lever up right now about $3 billion and still stay under that target. But to your
point, Colin, it is a time of uncertainty. So we don't feel compelled to go to market, even though interest rates are very
low, because with the Fed's announcement last week that they're going to keep the size of their balance sheet for the
foreseeable future, it doesn't appear to us that rates will be moving in the near term.
<Q - Colin McGranahan>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Diane Dayhoff, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yvonne, we have time for one more question.

We'll take our next question from Gregory Melich with ISI.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Hi, thanks. Two questions. One is getting back to the point on Pro and the expected improvement
in Pro. What percentage of those larger tickets, the $500 tickets, are Pros at this point, under that new definition? And I
want to follow up to that.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, Greg, don't know. So I'd like to be able to give
you the answer to that with that granularity, but we don't know.
<Q - Greg Melich>: But, so maybe looked at a different way.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah?
<Q - Greg Melich>: If you look at the cadence you expect in the Pro, which at least is less negative turning slightly
positive.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Greg Melich>: We assume that Pro is higher ticket?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Exactly right.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Right. So that is still getting better on a year-over-year basis, and I guess what I'm wondering is
are we then implicitly assuming if ticket's going to remain weak, that non-Pro ticket is actually going to deteriorate?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No. No. No. I think the right way to think about it is
really our planning assumption is look, the ticket remains under pressure, and it remains under pressure because the
recovery of the Pro is slower than we thought. And so exactly when the time is that the Pro turns to positive, I can't tell
you. But what I can tell you from our planning is that where we had been thinking we'd see some improvement on

ticket, that would be – and that that would – I mean if you go back to our call in February, we were talking about the
back half more of a blend between ticket and transaction in terms of what would drive the comp. And what we're
saying now is, no, that's really going be transaction and not ticket, and the big difference there is Pro. So I think don't –
it's – don't be thinking hey, there's some lift that we're – some significant lift we're anticipating from Pro that's going be
offset by some significant decrease in the consumer. The bigger thing to take away is that Pro is slower.
<A - Marvin Ellison>: Greg, this is Marvin. We're going be aggressive and opportunistic with the Pro customers. I
mean we're going to focus on staffing and service levels and getting them in and out really quick, which is a mandate
that they've given us. So we have a field team that is out there building relationships, understanding the needs of the
Pro. We're working with Craig's team to make sure we're merchandised the right way, we're priced the right way, so
we're going to fight as hard as we can to take care of the customer. But again, as Frank said, we just don't anticipate
robust growth in the second half.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. And then a follow-up on the gross margin side, Carol, you talked a bit about, and thanks
for the exact numbers on mix and markdown, but it does sound like those things will start to fade. Could you answer
what was in the quarter in terms of supply chain benefits to gross margin, even if they didn't show up? Was there a
benefit that we just didn't see that we'll see more into next year, or when does that start to be a net positive?
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: We're going to
see the supply chain benefit next year. We didn't talk much about supply chain, although they're doing a great job of
driving the business. We had some cost pressure, as you can appreciate, with some costs coming out of international
carriage. I think many retailers were faced with a similar challenge. But through our excellent productivity and our
distribution centers, we were able to offset a lot of that cost. So no material impact to the quarter and you should see the
benefits next year.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. Thanks for that.
<A - Carol Tomé, Executive Vice President – Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer>: You bet.
