Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings
per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.11 per share. This is an increase of $0.13
sequentially and $0.26 compared to the same quarter last year. We recorded $0.06 of charges relating to asset write-offs
in Libya and the continuing integration of Smith.
During the quarter, we were able to physically assess the status of our assets in Libya. This assessment resulted in us
recording a pre-tax and after-tax charge of $60 million relating to certain assets that are no longer recoverable as a
result of the political unrest. Pursuant to our integration plan, the Smith integration team, which has done an excellent
job, will remain in place throughout 2012. As a result, we will continue to incur merger and integration charges during
2012 that we will continue to highlight separately.
Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue of $10.3 billion increased 8% sequentially. Of this $755 million sequential
increase, approximately 20% of this growth came from the traditional year-end surge in product and software sales, and
19% came from the significant sequential increase in WesternGeco multi-client sales. Oilfield Services pre-tax income
of $2.2 billion increased 12.3% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 82 basis points. Notably,
revenue, pre-tax income, and margins all improved on a sequential basis across each of the three product groups and
the four geographical areas.
Sequential revenue and pre-tax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir
Characterization revenue of $2.8 billion increased 12% sequentially, and margins improved 340 basis points, to 27.9%.
These increases were due to very strong WesternGeco market client sales, robust end-of-year SIS software sales, and
strong exploration activity at Wireline.
Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $3.9 billion increased 6.3% sequentially, while margins remained essentially
flat, at 16.8%. Revenue growth was led by M-I SWACO, with strong performances in North America and Latin
America. IPM had a very strong quarter, particularly in Mexico and Iraq, while D&M posted strong results in U.S. Gulf
of Mexico and Europe/CIS/Africa area.
Fourth quarter Reservoir Production revenue of $3.6 billion increased 6.7% sequentially, while the pre-tax margin
improved 36 basis points, to 21.3%. These increases were primarily attributable to the strong completion and artificial
lift of product sales across all areas. Well Services revenue continued to grow as a result of capacity additions. The
Distribution segment contributed $685 million of revenue and $26 million of pre-tax operating income.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.8%, as compared
to 23.7% in the third quarter. We expect the ETR for the full year 2012 to be in the mid-20s. However, this can vary on
a quarterly basis due to the geographical mix of earnings. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $4.85 billion, as
compared to $5.16 billion at the end of Q3, representing $314 million improvement.
Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.25 billion of CapEx, $636 million of stock repurchases, and
$242 million of pension and retiree medical contributions. CapEx is expected to approach $4.5 billion in 2012, as
compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011.
Yesterday, our board of directors approved a 10% increase in our annual dividend, to $1.10 per share. This follows last
year's 19% increase and reflects our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. During the full year 2011,
we repurchased 36.9 million shares at an average price of $81.15, for a total of $3 billion.
And now I turn the conference over to Paal.

Thank you, Simon. Our overall fourth quarter results showed solid sequential growth, driven by stronger activity for
most of our service product lines and by stronger product sales for completions, artificial lift, SIS, and WesternGeco
multi-client seismic.
In North America, we had a strong quarter, with 6% sequential revenue growth and margins up 163 basis points. This
was led by continued growth in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where market share momentum remained strong for our
high-value technology offering and where operational performance was extremely solid. During the quarter, we moved
a second wide-azimuth seismic fleet into the Gulf of Mexico and we saw strong multi-client sales.
In North America Land, revenue grew in line with rig count, while margins increased moderately, driven in part by
internal efficiencies and active cost management. Pricing in our Wireline and Drilling product lines continued to show
an upward trend, although slowing somewhat compared to previous quarters. In Pressure Pumping, downwards pricing
pressure in the gas basins continued in the fourth quarter, while pricing in the liquids and liquids-rich basins remained
more or less flat, excluding the impact of continued conversion to 24-hour operations.
In the international markets, revenue grew almost 9% sequentially, while margins were up by 91 basis points. Growth
was driven by deepwater and exploration activity in East and West Africa and by strong land activity in the Middle
East and North Africa. During the quarter, we secured a number of key contracts that further strengthens our
international position. This includes a shale gas contract covering stimulation and project management for a pilot well
campaign in the Middle East. We have already deployed a team of shale experts to the country, and we have started to
mobilize assets and prepare the project infrastructure.
In terms of pricing, bidding remained competitive on large tenders for standard technology, while we saw positive
pricing signs in selective smaller tenders in Wireline and Drilling & Measurements. Our pricing upside continues to be
driven mainly by technology and operational performance.
In Marine Seismic, we saw the predicted seasonal drop in vessel utilization during the quarter. However, utilization for
the coming quarters is already looking strong, driven by higher activity in West Africa, the North Sea, and the Gulf of
Mexico. WesternGeco backlog grew to $1 billion in the quarter.
In Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 7% sequentially, while margins were up 124 basis points, driven mainly by
the land business in the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia, the ramp-up of rigs progressed in line with plans during the
quarter, and we saw strong growth in both rig-related and rigless activity. In Iraq, sequential growth was again solid,
led by further startup of rigs and strong activity on both ongoing IPM projects and on individual product line contracts.
Oman also showed very good sequential growth, driven by artificial lift and Wireline.
In Latin America, revenue grew by 11% sequentially, while margins were up by 15 basis points. Sequential growth was
led by Mexico, where offshore activity increased and where land activity on IPM projects was strong. During the
quarter, we signed our first production incentive contract with PEMEX, covering the Carrizo field, with operations
expected to start at the end of the second quarter.
In Argentina, we have established a very strong position in the emerging shale plays. So far, we have conducted a large
part of the shale fracturing jobs in the country, and during the quarter we secured a number of new service contracts in
this market.
In Brazil, another four deepwater rigs were added during the quarter, with the total now standing at 64. There continues
to be active bidding for Petrobras, and during the quarter we were awarded the largest share of the new mud-logging
contract. On land, activity remained strong, driven by IPM projects for OGX and [ph] Petra (12:02).
In Europe, CIS, and Africa, revenue grew 8% sequentially and margins were up 125 basis points. During the quarter we
saw strong growth in activity in Angola, Nigeria, and East Africa, driven by both deepwater exploration and the major
development projects. Based on the positive results on the first pre-salt exploration wells in Angola, we expect strong
growth in West Africa going forward.
In Russia, we saw solid offshore activity in Sakhalin, although this was partly offset by the start of the winter
slowdown in Russia land. The integration of services from the Eurasia transaction is progressing well, and our

preferred vendor agreement with Eurasia Drilling offers a strong growth platform in the active Western Siberia market.
In Libya, activity restarted early in the quarter, with the initial focus on Wireline, core tubing, and artificial lift services.
Our infrastructure, field assets, and workforce are fully operational, and we expect to see steady activity growth over
the coming year.
Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights of the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization group, we
completed the purchase of ThruBit during the quarter. ThruBit technology offers a novel way of obtaining wireline logs
in horizontal shale wells and is based on deploying a slim tool through the drill pipe during the final wiper trips before
starting the well completion.
Today, more than 90% of the horizontal shale wells in North America are not logged due to the total cost of operations
and the lack of a well [ph] site azimuth (13:52) product that can guide operators in selecting the optimal completion
intervals. Building on the ThruBit technology, we believe we can offer a cost-effective solution as an integral part of
our shale reservoir characterization workflow to help open up this market.
In the Drilling group, the integration work continued to progress very well. Synergies with Smith in 2011 surpassed
even our revised targets, and the transaction was again accretive on an earnings-per-share basis in the fourth quarter
and for the full year. Within our operations, we continue our efforts to drive drilling performance to the next level.
One area of focus is the streamlining of our drilling engineering workflows, supported by the creation of integrated
drilling engineering centers in our field locations. In these centers, we co-locate the numbers from our technical drilling
community, allowing them to jointly drive the planning, design, and support of our drilling operations using real-time
well site links. So far, we have established 10 of these centers worldwide, and we have plans to double this number in
the coming year.
In the Reservoir Production group, HiWAY activity continued to expand, with operations conducted for more than 35
clients during the quarter. The number of HiWAY fracturing stages grew by more than 50% sequentially. The
expansion was particularly strong in North America, but international deployment also continued, with operations so
far conducted in nine countries.
In Well Intervention, we continued to build our new technology offering, both on land and offshore. Active core tubing
technology, which provides real-time down-hole data during stimulation and intervention operations, gained further
traction, particularly in the Middle East. In addition, we have started deploying the new LIVE slickline platform, which
offers real-time telemetry for mechanical and basic production services. The largest uptake of LIVE has so far been in
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where the combined capability of mechanical and production services in one compact and
light unit is being leveraged for plug-backs and recompletion operations.
Let's now turn to the outlook, where GDP growth for 2012 continued to be revised downwards during the fourth
quarter and where positive signs from the U.S. and Japan were offset by continued concerns over the eurozone. In spite
of the political efforts to resolve the issues, we expect the uncertainty surrounding the global financial markets to
continue in the coming quarters, and although the chance of a global double-dip recession remains a possibility, we do
not believe this to be the most likely scenario.
In line with lower GDP growth, oil demand outlook was also revised downwards during the fourth quarter. However,
the increasing rate of the emerging markets, the weakness in non-OPEC supply, and a number of geopolitical concerns
have supported oil prices, and absent a global recession, we do not expect prices to weaken significantly.
For natural gas, the continued increase in unconventional gas production, modest demand growth, and mild weather at
the beginning of the heating season contributed to very high storage levels and low natural gas prices in North America.
In Asia, on the other hand, the need for alternative energy sources following the Fukushima incident, along with
fast-growing demand in the non-OECD countries, is maintaining high prices and significantly increasing LNG demand.
Looking at our industry, the general feedback from our customers, and the findings from the recent spending surveys
indicate that E&P investment in 2012 will be up, although the predicted levels vary. The surveys also suggest that
exploration spending will continue to increase. Against this backdrop, we are planning for growth in 2012, although we

are building significant flexibility into our plans, given the uncertainties.
In North America, we expect land rig count to remain flat with Q4 2011, provided the ongoing drop in gas activity will
be countered by increasing activity in the liquids and liquids-rich basins. We anticipate a continued recovery in the
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with strong demand for high-value technologies. In the international markets, we expect
2012 rig count to be up around 10% versus 2011, driven by strong offshore activity in West Africa, the North Sea, and
Brazil, and by land activity in the Middle East, North Africa, and Western Siberia.
Overall, we remain confident that any potential reductions in activity will be short-lived due to limited spare oil
capacity and to growing international demand for natural gas. Furthermore, the breadth of our technology offering, the
strength of our international footprint and contract portfolio, and the balance we have established between our reservoir
characterization, drilling, and production services in the North America market will allow us to continue to grow.
Growth in worldwide deepwater and exploration activity will also favor Schlumberger.
Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Handler from Credit Suisse. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Good morning.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Appreciate your outlook comments, as always, Paal, but given this dramatic falloff in natural
gas prices in the U.S. and subsequent concerns about E&P cash flows, if I could ask you to start in focusing on North
American land. You've been clear about your strategy of reestablishing yourselves here and you've just given your
outlook for a flat rig count, but does this very quickly deteriorating outlook for gas – is it influencing recent contracting
behavior in U.S. land? And then I'll just give you my follow-up now, which is that is it influencing your behavior,
whether it's from a contracting link standpoint or a CapEx standpoint? Are there any changes that you're making now?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at pressure pumping pricing levels, as I said, we continue to see downwards
pressure on pricing in gas in Q4. The liquid basins, we saw pricing basically being flat, some contracts being up and
some contracts being down. Now, how this is going to go to hold, I think, is still uncertain at this stage, right? There is
obviously a chance that the continued flux of capacity from the gas basins into the liquid basins is going to have an
impact on liquids pricing as well. We haven't really seen any downwards trend yet, but clearly, over the past quarter,
the pricing has been flat. So that's basically where we stand on that.
In terms of our view on North America land, like we before, we remain committed to the markets. We have a build
plan for 2012 which is obviously flexible, but we remain committed to the market in terms of adding capacity, provided
that we can get the utilization that we are looking for. So in addition to how we see the North America land market for
pressure pumping, we have also significant demand for horsepower international. We won a lot of contracts in the
international market requiring fracturing capacity. So in the event that we have the opportunity, or basically decide to
shift capacity internationally, I think that will be welcomed by our international operations.

<Q - Bradley Handler>: So that's still an "if" condition. So far, there's no complaints [ph] within the U.S. (22:45)
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: It is still an "if" condition. We have basically decided on a build plan for total pressure
pumping, with a certain allocation to North America, and we haven't changed that at this stage.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Okay. And just to clarify, from a contracting behavior with your customers, are contracts
getting longer? Are you seeking to make them longer, or are your operator customers seeking to make them shorter
now? How does that timing dynamic work?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I would say that over the past quarter, we have – or over the past couple of quarters, we
have shifted more towards term contracts. We now stand at around 80% term contracts for one-year-plus. And really
the only place we play in the spot market at this stage is in the liquids plays. So I think there's been a shift in the market
towards term contracts, and I think we're quite well positioned in that sense.
<A - Malcolm Theobald>: Next question? Hello, Greg? Hello? Greg, can you hear me?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thank you, and good morning. So you'd mentioned that your outlook for North American rig
count's flat this year, and you also said in your release that, basically, revenue was in line with the rig count, so it would
seem to me that the upside here for you guys is really going to be in the Gulf of Mexico. And I was just wondering, if
we strip out the strength of the seismic side, I'm curious as to where you are in your deepwater operations in the Gulf.
Are you back to the pre-Macondo levels? Are costs now fully absorbed in that market? And I guess I'm just wondering,
are your margins now in the Gulf higher than in your U.S. land business?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes, the simple answer to that is yes. This quarter, I think, was the first quarter where our Gulf
of Mexico margins were accretive to North America. So, obviously, there's been a lot of focus in on the multi-client
sales for Q4, which was quite strong, but I think it's also important to point out the strength we have on the deepwater
side for well operations, both wireline and on the drilling segment. So we are quite optimistic in terms of the outlook
for the Gulf of Mexico; firstly, in terms of our market share position, and in addition to how well we can leverage our
high-end technology and operational performance in this type of market. So we see steady growth in deepwater drilling
rig counts during 2012, roughly about a rig a month. So we would be at pre-Macondo levels for drilling rigs in the
deepwater by the latter part of 2012.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay, that's great. And as a follow-up, I was wondering, could you just give us a sense as to
what's different now than before? I'm curious – we're seeing this on the rig equipment side that operators are clearly
taking a much more conservative approach there. How has your business changed? Are you spending more time on the
rigs that you're seeing now? Is it increasing testing? Is it more conservative operations? I was just wondering if you
could just give us a little insight into how your operators are going about their business differently now.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think all the operators are obviously even more thorough than that they were in the past. But
we haven't seen a dramatic change in how operations are conducted. I think there was always a lot of focus on this, but
yes, there's probably somewhat more in testing and maybe double and triple-checking of things. But in – generally, our
position in the Gulf of Mexico at this stage, given the focus that we've had now for, what, four years in our Excellence
in Execution program, is even stronger than what it was pre-Macondo. So we are very well positioned, and that's why
we are obviously quite optimistic in terms of the outlook for the market and also how this is going to weigh in on our
North America performance.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay, great. But according to what your comments are, this is probably where you'd see all
your growth in North America – or most of your growth would come from the deepwater side?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, we don't know yet that. That's going to be a large function of two things – what's going
to happen to the rig count in terms of the reductions in gas versus potential increases in liquids, and even more so,
what's going to happen to pressure pumping pricing.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Thank you, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Paal, I wanted to ask you little bit, with regard to the comment in the press release, as it
relates to competitive bidding on the large tenders for standard technology. I was just curious as to what do you need to
see happen here? What are you expecting to happen over the course of 2012 to change that dynamic, number one? And
I guess, secondly, we've talked in the past, certainly on Schlumberger's calls, about the leverage to the exploration
cycle, and clearly people are encouraged where they continue to see deepwater adds here in the market globally. I was
wondering if you could spend a little bit of time talking about the pricing outlook on the deepwater market globally
here as well.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. So, like you say, we still see competitive pricing for basic technology on large contracts,
while we see some positive signs on the smaller contracts. On the large contracts, our unique high-end technology is
obviously priced higher and we always have significant sell-up potential as the contracts unfold over the years. If you
look at the international service pricing, typically there's a lag between the moves in the rig rates, which we have been
seeing over the last couple of quarters, and our service pricing. So there's a potential upside on that. But I think one
reason why pricing has moved so much in the international market is the market share plays that have been going on,
and I think these are potentially coming to an end.
Partly, that's going to come down to the activity increase that we potentially will see, but I think also another key factor
to this is that there is a growing customer emphasis on operational performance. I think they are fully realizing that
very low service pricing typically gives very low service quality. And I think one example of this is the rate that we
continue to replace competition within our Drilling & Measurement segment. In Q4 alone, the ratio of we replacing
competition and them replacing us was 31 to 5, and this is basically coming down to quality and technology.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Sure. Is it still prudent to think of a pricing inflection internationally as being more of a
positive for your 2013 margin outlook, or is this something that we potentially start to see having an impact in the
second half of this year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think it's still too early to say. Like I said, we continue to test pricing on smaller bids. For the
big bids – and there's not really that many big bids coming up in the coming year – we'd obviously be a little bit more
conservative to make sure we protect and potentially gain market share. But I think it's too early to call it. The only
thing I would say is that there was a growing focus on operational performance, and that plays very well into our
strength in terms of our quality and our technology.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. Thanks, Paal. I'll turn it back.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Thank you very much. And, Paal, I just wondered whether you could help us a little bit of how to
think about the first quarter. It's always sequentially a difficult one to get our heads around. There's product sales in the
fourth quarter; there's multi-client that doesn't necessarily repeat; you have seasonality in North Sea, Russia. Could you
give us a little bit on how you would think about the first quarter and how it's shaping up? It just strikes me that
expectations might be just a little bit on the high side of a natural range.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, I would agree with you, Ole, in that the current consensus is probably somewhat on the
optimistic side or on the high side. Just to comment on how we see the quarter from this point, I think the underlying
activity continues to be strong, and it's driven by steady growth in the international markets and also strong activity in
North America shale liquids. Like you say, we are going to see the normal seasonal slowdown in the North Sea and
Russia, and I think also the sequential drop in product sales and multi-client sales. And I think also there is some added
uncertainty going into Q1 now in terms of the impact of the accelerating drop in North America shale gas activity. So,
generally, I would say that the current consensus is somewhat on the optimistic.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay. And from then on, it clearly becomes more of a standard pattern. The second thing, back to
this international pricing again, rig rates of the deepwater rigs are becoming, again, very, very scarce. You highlighted
what's going on in Angola pre-salt and the potential demand there. With rates maybe pushing back to $600,000 again,
historically, those have been levels where oil companies really start paying attention to technology that can improve
reliability or technology that can shorten cycle time, and yet you don't really talk about pricing. So could you help us a
little bit with how you view the tightness in the rig market and the higher rates impacting either the service quality for
pricing or whether it's the standard technology or whether it's new technology?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes, and like I said in the previous question, I think there is typically a lag between the moves
in the rig rates and the moves in our service pricing, so I think that's the first point. But to your point in terms of what
our customers are looking for, I think, like I said, there's a growing focus on operational performance. Obviously, that
is even more where the rig rates are high, like in deepwater, but we also see that in more conventional offshore
operations as well. So I think that international capacity is obviously one driver that's going to support pricing going
forward because we don't see significant overcapacity in the international market. I think the main reason why there
hasn't been more pricing movement is the market share plays that's been going on. So with the growing focus on
operational performance, I think that is going to help drive pricing going forward, and again, that's what we are seeing
on selective contracts, even in Q4.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: And these market share gains, are they offshore or are they on big onshore contracts today?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think we've seen them basically all over. So I think they are reducing in intensity as
2011 was unfolding and potentially coming to an end, given this growing focus from our customers on operational
performance.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay. Well, thank you very much, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you. Ole.

<Q - James Carlyle West>: Paal, I have a question about seismic; obviously, good finish to the year for the
multi-client business, and I think your original expectations for the marine side of the business was we could see
pricing power materialize around the middle of 2012. Now, given the Gulf coming back and your strong market share
position there, given Angola pre-salt opening up in a big way here, is there the potential that, one, that the pricing
moves could be moved forward a little bit, and two, that the magnitude could actually be higher than perhaps you had
originally expected?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I would answer the question along the lines that we do see the marine seismic market
tightening, so Q4 saw the expected drop in utilization, but that utilization kept growing during the quarter. Q1 is
already looking up in utilization, and Q2 and Q3 is actually looking quite strong. So the Angola seismic commitments
around the Kwanza block awards are going to draw several new vessels into that area.
But Angola alone is not going to be able to create a global undersupply, but I think it's going to contribute significantly.
So, in addition to Angola, we see the North Sea and the Arctic looking quite strong for Q2 and Q3, and also there's
going to be likely stronger activity in the Gulf of Mexico in this coming year. So, basically, we see the potential to
drive pricing up as being a kind of a midyear to a second half of this year event. The amplitude, I am not going to be
able to comment on at this stage.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay. And how do you think about capacity additions at this point, both your capacity
additions and industry capacity additions?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, there were – I think 2011 capacity additions to the 3D market, I think, was in the range
of six vessels. What seems to be on the slate for this year is three, so I don't think these capacity additions are going to
have any material impact to when the pricing inflection point is going to be coming. In terms of our capacity, the first
thing we would do is to convert some of the source vessels we have back to acquisition levels, but we will only do this
when we can ensure that we get the utilization that we are looking for.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay. Thanks, Paal.

Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, Paal, my initial question here is on the CapEx outlook that you've got for – I think it's $4.4
billion or so for 2012; wonder if you can give us some general indication on how that might be weighted between
international and North America; and then, if you can, within that context, just give us some indication on how much
you may have kind of put aside for your pressure pumping investment. Obviously, I don't expect you to give us explicit
numbers, but if you just give us some relative size, it would be really helpful.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. So for the overall number, just to kind of let you know how we are planning the year, so
we're going to look at the year in two halves basically. So in H1, we are going to continue to invest probably around the
average levels of 2011, and then we have secure capacity that's going to allow us to increase capacity with about 25%
in the second half of the year. That can take us up to this $4.5 billion level. Whether we go ahead and spend all of the
$4.5 billion is also going to be a function of how we see 2013 because a lot of the additions that we're going to be
making in the second half of the year are going to be, obviously, coming into play and into real capacity in 2013.

In terms of how we are planning to add [ph] NAM (38:14) versus international, this is obviously going to be fluid, all
depending on how the two markets evolve. But we have capacity and we are ready to add as much CapEx in North
America in 2012 as we did in 2011, but we're going to be looking at this on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then, once again, is it 60% international, 40% North America? How would you think
about the split?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I'm not going to be able to give you that number. I'm sorry.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: No worries. All right. Okay, and just a quick follow-up on, I think it was Ole's question a little
bit earlier, you referenced, I think, the Street consensus numbers being too high. I think you were referencing the first
quarter specifically. Would you then – if that is true, how would you assess the full-year consensus number as well?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think commenting on the full year I would refrain from at this stage. But I think we –
again, we are looking at the year in two halves in that sense, so I think it's – I wouldn't care to comment on the overall
number.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: That's a nice Cajun twist. Good morning. Paal, with regard to – getting back to seismic,
central Gulf of Mexico lease sale seems to be a highly anticipated on the part of E&Ps that I have spoken to. I believe
that takes place this summer. Normally, multi-client spending patterns are very back-end-weighted, as we saw in this
fourth quarter. What do you expect will be the pattern of spending this year, given the fact that such a big lease sale is
coming this summer? Would we expect to see strong sales in Q1 and Q2? How should that unfold?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, first of all, the central Gulf of Mexico lease sale has not been confirmed yet. It's likely to
happen around midyear. We still believe it's going to happen around midyear. It hasn't been confirmed yet. If it goes
ahead and if it is announced, we expect there to be multi-client sales prior to that lease sale. So exactly what levels
they're going to be, it's a bit difficult to predict, but if there's a midyear lease sale, I think our H1 multi-client sales in
North America could be stronger than what they've been in the last couple of years. We are also in a very good position
in terms of the multi-client library we have in the central Gulf, which also plays strongly into this.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Secondly, the follow up here, your North American land margins in the fourth
quarter, what did they do sequentially? Were they flat, up, or down?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Excuse me, our North America land margins?
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yes, sir.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, our North America land margins were up.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Were up. Thank you.

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Paal, you highlighted your forecast for about 10% international rig count growth, but clearly,
activity growth is going to be biased to the offshore. So do think customer spending could come any closer to 15%
growth abroad?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: It's difficult to say. If you look at the surveys, they range a lot. But I think, with the additions
of deepwater rigs happening this year, which is going to come into full fruition next year, and with continued spend in
exploration, we are optimistic on our outlook for the international markets.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay. And I hate to continue to focus on offshore service pricing, but it's clearly a key point
of controversy. Assuming that offshore spending – that the bias in spending is toward the offshore, some of the
guidance we're looking at to get that spending could be up closer to 20% offshore, and I know that the industry has a
fair amount of clarity on when that's going to hit and so therefore can be prepared for it. But are the plans of your
customers coming in above expectations? If the industry hits something close to 20% spending growth offshore, is the
industry going to be able to keep up from a supply standpoint, based upon your own CapEx guidance and what you're
seeing in the marketplace?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, I think looking at what is going to drive part of the spending in the coming year, again,
is deepwater and exploration. There's been a lot of exploration successes in the last year, which again, makes us
optimistic in terms of our view of next year. Looking at where we see most rig count growth, I think in percentage
terms, there is also a bias, like you indicate, in our view, towards the offshore versus the land in international markets.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Are the spending plans, though, of your customers coming in ahead of your expectations,
particularly offshore?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, like I said, there is a range in what the spending plans for the customers are. So I think,
generally, when we say that we expect a 10% rig count in international market, I think that is based on what we have
seen from our customers, and I think whether that is ahead or behind what you were expecting, I think that is what
we're expecting.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, my question has to do with the workflow around
international shale activity, and in particular, referring to the comment in the press release on the Vaca Muerta shale
work in Argentina. Sort of two parts to it. One, if we dial back six or nine months ago, where would you say that
workload is today relative to the expectation then; i.e., are we seeing sort of an acceleration or are we tracking on plan?
And then the second part of the question is, with respect to the work that you're doing around resource evaluation, how
that might translate into market share and the contract differences in international shale versus, say, a U.S. shale like
the Eagle Ford.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. So just generally, first, on the international unconventional market, I'm very comfortable
with our position there. So we won a number of contracts in all the three international areas, and these contracts
typically entail both studies based on this shale reservoir characterization model, as well as the well site operations for
drilling and completing and stimulating these wells. What we see in international markets is that there's typically no
work done on unconventional – or shale without first starting up with these studies when it comes to the reservoir. And
obviously we are clearly leading in the ability to do that, and that puts us in a very strong position in winning these
initial study bids and then building on that into the well site operations.

So, like I said in the script, we won a number of these contracts in all parts of the world. And I would say that the
increase in activity for us in international unconventionals over this year and going into next year is probably somewhat
higher than where I thought it would be going back two or three quarters. So we expect to see strong growth in all the
international shale plays for us in 2012. The work is still going to be around evaluation and pilot projects in general, but
it's still going to represent very good growth for us, and I think the two markets that is going to take off the fastest, I
would say, would be Argentina and China.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Okay. That's great. And just to clarify then, Paal, that when you mentioned, I think you
said significant capacity events overseas, you were specifically addressing Poland, China, and Argentina?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: When I said that we would move significant capacity overseas?
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, we added significant capacity in 2011, and we are prepared to add into the international
markets based on the activity that's coming up. But I would say that the countries that you mentioned – Poland,
Argentina, and China – are probably some of the key ones. But I would say that there's a growing focus on
unconventional and shale also in the Middle East, and we are ready to add significantly more capacity there, as well, as
we continue to expand operations there.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead. Jim Crandell, your line
is open. Well, we lost Mr. Crandell. We'll move on to Robin Shoemaker from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Thank you. Paal, going back to your comments about large tenders with standard
technology and the market share, intense competition going on there. Is that confined to the three large service
companies you normally compete with, or are there new entrants disrupting that IPM work in terms of the pricing
structure?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No, for the high-end technologies, I would say the companies that we generally compete with
are Halliburton and Baker.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay. But on the – what you called the standard technologies, is that also the case?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, on standard technologies and I would say on land contracts and so forth, it's Halliburton,
Baker, and then also to an extent, Weatherford. Those are the main competitors. We don't see any other new entrants
into the market space that we're competing with at this stage.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay. And if I could ask you just if you could comment on this joint venture you signed
with Petrofac and what kind of projects specifically that's targeting?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, so first of all, it's not a joint venture. It's a cooperation agreement. And the kind of
contract that we are looking to work with them on are these production incentive contracts, à la the one we signed in
Mexico during the last quarter. So these production incentive contracts are contracts – they are service contracts, but
they are contracts where we are going to be paid and compensated based on the fee per barrel over an agreed baseline
for the asset that we are managing. So the background for the agreement is that both Petrofac and ourselves, we have
very complementary capabilities, and we also see this market in between a traditional service company model and the
oil company model to do these incentive contracts as a very interesting growth opportunity.
Having complementary capabilities where we are very strong on the subsurface, production engineering, well
construction, and project management, while Petrofac has all the surface facility design capability and also operational

team management. These are quite complementary, and it's going to help us basically to bid on projects of a scale that
we probably wouldn't do independently, and we can also develop these at a much faster pace. So it is not a joint
venture. It is a cooperation agreement, where we're going to be bidding jointly on these type of contracts around the
globe.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay. Just to clarify, on those kind of contracts, the fee-per-barrel, would you expect
your margins to be comparable to the kind of margins you generally achieve in that region?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: We've been doing these type of contracts for almost 10 years, and this was actually – the
original intent of IPM was to get into these type of contracts. So we've been holding a portfolio of contracts for in
between 5 and 10 years. Not many, but the ones that we've had and where we have actually developed our skill set
which makes us confident to go for bigger projects now, for that portfolio, the margins on these contracts are highly
accretive to our average margins.

Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great. Thank you. Paal, appreciate your color and your thoughts on North America; certainly
still, at least in the liquid plays, a tight market or a relatively solid market, and margins are still obviously attractive,
around the 30%, 35% level. In your belief, in your thoughts when you think about North America in 2012, 2013, if
pricing starts to decline more on a widespread basis and we're now in the margins at the 20% to 25% level, do you
think the market will start to pull back on capacity additions, or is that still attractive enough margins that we still could
see capacity adds at the margin or even more so?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, it's a bit difficult for me to predict what all the other ones are going to do, but I would
say that we will continue to invest into this market, provided that we can get decent utilizations on the assets and as
long as the pricing and the margins are still attractive enough. What that level is, I can't really give you a number on,
Angie. But we also have, like I said, significant demand for this horsepower internationally. So we're going to have to
be balancing off – if something was to happen in the North America to the extent of what you're saying, we will look at
basically balancing off how we add capacity into the global market based on the returns that we can get.
But at the same time, I would just want to stress that we remain committed to the North America market, and we are
looking to gain share at the back end of the reservoir workflow that we have established and also HiWAY. And
HiWAY, in a market that is going towards equilibrium, HiWAY is going to give us both pricing and cost leverage into
the market.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Okay. That's very, very helpful. And then one more just as a follow-up, on the margin
side, obviously, we're still seeing some competitive behavior for large projects but strength in some of the areas that
you can add technology. I would assume that it's fair to assume a measured and moderate progression in margins
internationally, and is there any regions that could be stronger or weaker than another?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I would agree with your first statement that some measured improvement in 2012
margins internationally is reasonable to expect. I wouldn't care to comment on exactly where that would be.

<Q - James D. Crandell>: Thank you. I apologize; I think I cut myself off last time. But, Paal, can you comment about
how you see your business under the Petrofac joint venture growing the types of projects that you're undertaking, and
maybe the risks associated with that?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at the projects we are taking on it's generally focused in on managing [ph]
pail (53:51) production in immature assets. We are looking at opportunities in various parts of the world. Obviously,
there's upcoming bids in Mexico; there's other opportunities in South America. But also in the other areas there are
opportunities. And part of the opportunities are linked to a shortage of, I would say, operator capacity to handle this
type of work, where they'd rather prioritize focusing in on high-end and new developments. So I think this is a growing
market and something that we are looking to pursue. But maybe, Simon, do you want to comment a little bit on how we
handle these things from an [ph] accounting standpoint (54:34)?
<A - Simon Ayat>: Yeah, okay, sure. As Paal mentioned earlier, we do have several of these projects, although at the
smaller scale. And basically these projects require some investment up front, which basically we will capitalize. And
then as we go, we amortize it against the profile of the production or the enhanced production that we are compensated
against. Normally, we have a very, very clear plan on the production profile and the baseline and the decline of the
baseline, and we anticipate very well the type of compensation where we amortize the investment against. So, as you
all know, we do follow a pretty good balance sheet, and to some extent, I would say on the conservative side when it
comes to things like this, so this will continue to be the style.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. And as a follow-up question, Paal [audio gap] (55:59) being a couple of your major
competitors have either strongly urged or almost required customers to take a number of their product lines if they're
going to get their frac equipment, how does your strategy in terms of trying to package different Schlumberger product
lines along with fracturing compare with theirs?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I missed the first part of your question. [indiscernible] (56:25)?
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Well, the first part, I think, is that your two largest competitors in North American
fracturing seem to be, if anything, requiring companies to take many of their other product lines if they're going to give
them their frac equipment, and all the way from requiring to maybe strongly suggesting. And I'm wondering how your
strategy in North American pressure pumping compares with that in terms of trying to convince companies to take
different Schlumberger product lines along with the frac equipment on new builds.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, generally, when we work with our customers, they ultimately decide what they want to
buy from us. When we have product lines that, together, can bring more value, we promote that to our customers, and if
they see the value same as us, then typically they will buy it. Now, in terms of forcing them to do something, we never
do that. And I think the forcing is going to go away because – whenever the horsepower supply and demand reaches
equilibrium.

<Q - Michael Urban>: Thanks for sneaking me in. Good morning. Paal, I wanted to follow up on a couple of the
comments you've made on HiWAY, sounds like you have made some pretty good progress from a volume standpoint
and stages run and also some headway internationally. And I think you suggested this, but just wanted to confirm that
you do feel like you're at least beginning to get some of the pricing, and I guess cost savings as well, from that product.
In other words, are you able to get the kind of benefits that you envisioned when you rolled out the technology, just
given that you are seeing a broader maturation of the pressure pumping market and things stabilizing, and as you said,
in some cases, declining?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, I think we are still very upbeat in terms of the performance of HiWAY and also the
future potential that HiWAY brings. As I mentioned, we served over 35 customers in Q4, predominantly in the U.S.,
and while you introduce a new technology like this, it basically takes some time from the initial jobs you do for one
customer until you can broaden the application for a number of customers. So we had 50% growth in stages
sequentially between Q3 and Q4, and I think this is a testament now to the customer base that we have established. And
we continue to expand the customer base, and I think that's really what's going to help us further grow the service going
forward.
In terms of the jobs that we pumped or the stages we pumped in North America in Q4, probably only about 15% of the
total stages we pumped were HiWAY, while we're really starting to expand in terms of the customer base. So I think
there's significant potential as we go forward for HiWAY, and we also continue engineering efforts to extend the
operating envelope in terms of lower temperatures and higher temperatures for HiWAY.
<Q - Michael Urban>: And then, more broadly, on the pumping market globally, you've talked about some of the
flexibility that you hopefully have with respect to adapting the market and allocating capacity. Is that primarily with
respect to the new capacity that you're building, and how much flexibility does that give you, and are you doing things
like skid mounting? Just trying to understand how much capacity could potentially move around relative to a pretty
fluid and dynamic market.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No, I would say a significant amount of our North America existing capacity can also be
moved internationally if we want to. We have standardized the type of equipment that we are operating, and that can be
moved internationally as well. I don't foresee that happening. I think the main thing we're talking about now is how do
we allocate additions from this point onwards. But again, we have a standardized fleet, which is mobile to any part of
the world.

Okay, so before we close, I have one last thing to add. This is the last call that Andrew will be attending. So, having
spent 37 years with Schlumberger, he steps down as Chairman in April of this year, so I would therefore like to take
this opportunity to thank him on behalf of the entire company for his outstanding contribution, and I wish him all the
best in the future. I am sure that as a shareholder, he will listen to our future earnings calls, but I hope that Malcolm
will not let him ask any questions. So, Andrew, thank you again. And I'll now hand the call back to Greg.
