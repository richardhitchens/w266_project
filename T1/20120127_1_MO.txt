MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Altria Group 2011 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. Today's call is
scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask
questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brendan McCormick, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client
Services. Please go ahead, sir.
Brendan J. McCormick
Good morning and thank you for joining our call. This morning, we will only be discussing Altria's 2011 business
results for the fourth quarter and full year, and will not be discussing the status of tobacco litigation.
Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. And I direct your
attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section at the end of today's earnings release for the
review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
For a detailed review of Altria's business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website,
altria.com.
Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Altria's
management also reviews operating companies income, operating margins, and EPS on an adjusted basis, which

exclude certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. Last month,
Altria announced that it would also exclude charges for tobacco and health judgments from adjusted financial
calculations. References to adjusted financial calculations on today's call reflect this redefinition.
Today's call also contains various operating results on both a reported and on an adjusted basis, which excludes items
that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in
today's earnings press release and are available on our website. In addition, comparisons discussed in this conference
call are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.
Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Mike Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Altria Group,
Inc.
Michael E. Szymanczyk
Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone.
Altria delivered strong returns for its shareholders in 2011 in a challenging business environment while taking steps to
continue creating shareholder value into the future. Altria grew its adjusted diluted earnings per share by 7.9%, which
is consistent with adjusted EPS results over the past few years. Altria delivered total shareholder return of 26.9% in
2011, outperforming the return of the S&P 500 for the twelfth consecutive year.
Dividends remain an important component of Altria's shareholder return. The company paid out approximately 80% of
its adjusted diluted EPS in dividends, and increased its dividend by 7.9% in August.
Altria also repurchased $1.3 billion of its shares in 2011 at an average price of $26.91 per share. Altria intends to
complete the balance of the October 2011 $1 billion repurchase program by the end of 2012, subject to the discretion of
the Board.
Altria completed its previously announced $1.5 billion cost savings program ahead of schedule in the third quarter of
2011. Following the completion of this program, we announced a new program that we expect to deliver annualized
cost savings of $400 million versus previously planned spending by the end of 2013.
Altria continues to focus on developing lower-risk products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers. To support this
goal, Altria Client Services has entered into an agreement with Okono, an affiliate of the Danish company Fertin
Pharma, to develop innovative, non-combustible nicotine-containing products for adult tobacco consumers. Fertin is a
global leader in the development and manufacture of nicotine gum, with additional capabilities in other products and
technologies. This new product initiative combines the expertise of the Altria family of companies with Okono and its
affiliates, product development, and manufacturing capabilities.
Altria's operating companies delivered strong 2011 profitability. Adjusted operating companies income and margins
grew in cigarettes, smokeless products, and wine. These gains were partially offset by declines in adjusted operating
companies income in cigars and Financial Services. Earnings from our equity investment in SABMiller also
contributed to Altria's profitability.
PM USA continued to focus on maximizing income from its cigarette business while maintaining modest share
momentum on Marlboro over time. In 2011, higher pricing and effective cost management helped PM USA grow its
adjusted operating companies' income and margins, which exclude the impact of restructuring charges and tobacco and
health judgments.
Marlboro retained some of it strong share gains that contributed to a record retail share performance in 2010, as its
full-year share in 2011 is higher than its 2009 share. Marlboro's retail share gains in 2010 were exceptionally strong
due to an attractive introductory offer on Marlboro Special Blend. Marlboro's share decline in 2011 versus 2010
reflects PM USA's focus on growing income and margins, and not building the brand [ph] on price promote to win
share (6:13).

Marlboro's underlying brand equity remains strong. Price gaps continue to be stable. And retail share deviations that
Marlboro experienced in 2011 were driven by short-term, year-over-year changes and promotional spending in the
marketplace that influenced promotion-sensitive adult consumers.
PM USA's income and margins benefited from our continued focus on equity-driven premium brands. Premium brands
represented over 93% of PM USA's cigarette shipments last year, a much higher premium mix than its competitors.
Marlboro plans to continue to focus on brand-building initiatives and equity-enhancing new products and programs in
2012. PM USA recently launched Marlboro Black, with packaging in non-menthol and menthol varieties, to distinguish
the product's bold flavor. Marlboro has other exciting plans for 2012 and 2013, some of which we will share at the
CAGNY conference.
In the smokeless product segment, USSTC and PM USA delivered strong full-year adjusted operating companies
income growth behind Copenhagen and Skoal. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal grew their volume faster
than the category and gained retail share in 2011.
Copenhagen had a very strong volume and share performance last year, as the brand benefited from continued
momentum from new products introduced over the past few years as well as Wintergreen pouches introduced in 2011.
Skoal grew its volume behind the launch of Skoal Extra varieties and two new Skoal Snus products. The brand's
full-year retail share declined as share losses, including those from seven SKUs delisted in the second quarter of 2011,
offset gains from Skoal's new products. This SKU delisting will continue to impact Skoal's retail share performance
comparisons in the first half of 2012. However, we believe that the actions taken on Skoal during 2011 have stabilized
the brand and positioned it for growth.
In the cigar segment, Middleton made significant progress during the year to improve its competitive position in a
marketplace where low-priced imported cigars continued to grow. Middleton's income and margin performance was
much stronger in the second half of 2011 compared to the first half, driven by more efficient promotion of Black &
Mild. New products and packaging enhanced Middleton's competitive position in the Untipped Cigarillos segment,
where it has not historically focused. Black & Mild introduced Untipped Sweets, Classic, and Wine varieties last year,
as well as a new Aroma Wrap foil pouch packaging. Middleton also began shipping cigars manufactured under its
overseas contract manufacturing arrangement during the fourth quarter of 2011.
In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered excellent full-year operating companies growth while expanding its
adjusted operating companies income margins. Wine shipment volume growth was also strong, as Ste. Michelle
expanded the distribution of its premium products.
Altria forecasts its 2012 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 6% to 9%, to a range of $2.17 to $2.23, from an adjusted
base of $2.05 per share in 2011. We also expect to achieve reported diluted EPS in the range of $2.14 to $2.20 per
share.
Today, we also announced that I have informed our Board of my intention to retire as Chairman and CEO effective
immediately following this year's annual meeting of shareholders on May 17. It has been an extraordinary experience
to lead the reshaping of Altria following the completion of the Kraft and Philip Morris International spinoffs. I believe
the company is well positioned to continue to prosper. As I near retirement, now is the time to transition leadership to
people of an age to guide the company through its next phase of growth.
I am very pleased that our Board has elected Marty Barrington to succeed me as Chairman and CEO upon my
retirement. And I am equally pleased that they have elected Dave Beran to work with Marty as President and Chief
Operating Officer, effective at the same time.
Marty has held various roles in the Altria family of companies since 1993, including Vice Chairman and Chief
Compliance Officer and as General Counsel of both PM USA and Philip Morris International. In these and other roles,
he has participated in the work of virtually every business function of the Altria family of companies through direct
business responsibility for regulatory and external affairs, research and development, human resources and compliance,
as well as working closely with marketing, sales, strategy and business development, and operations. This unique

results in more detail.
Howard A. Willard
Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone.
The cigarette segment's reported operating companies income results for the fourth quarter were negatively impacted
by higher restructuring charges related to the cost reduction program we announced in October and adverse judgments
in the Bullock and Williams cases that we announced in December, partially offset by higher list prices. Reported
operating companies income for cigarettes decreased 5.4% for the fourth quarter.
Cigarette segment operating companies income for the full year increased 2.3% to $5.6 billion on a reported basis,
primarily due to higher list prices, partially offset by lower volume, higher restructuring charges associated with our
new cost reduction program, charges related to adverse judgments in the Bullock, Scott, and Williams cases, and higher
FDA user fees.
Excluding charges for restructuring and tobacco and health judgments, adjusted cigarette segment operating companies
income grew 13.7% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% to $5.9 billion for the full year. PM USA's focus on margin
expansion helped drive these results. PM USA grew its 2011 adjusted operating companies income margins by 3.2
percentage points for the fourth quarter and 1.8 percentage points for the full year, bringing its adjusted margin for the
full year to 40.2%.
PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume declined 4% for the full year and was also down an estimated 4% when
adjusted for trade inventories and one less shipping day. PM USA estimates that the total cigarette category's adjusted
volume declined 3.5% in 2011, the lowest decline rate since 2006. PM USA believes that the historical price elasticity,
estimated at negative 0.3%, remains unchanged; and that the secular decline rate, which reflects societal trends and
adult consumer shifts from cigarettes to smokeless and other tobacco products, has been stable for several years.
PM USA's volume in the fourth quarter increased by 0.2%, primarily due to trade inventory dynamics at retail share
gains for L&M, partially offset by retail share losses on Marlboro and its other brands, as well as one less shipping day.
Marlboro's fourth quarter and full-year retail share declined 0.7 share point and 0.6 share point respectively from it
strong retail share performance in 2010. PM USA's decision not to build Marlboro's share on price promoted share is
reflected in both PM USA's strong margin performance and Marlboro's retention of some, but not all, of the 0.8 share
point that the brand gained in 2010. Marlboro's full-year retail share of 42% continues to reflect the brand's strong
position across multiple flavor segments.
PM USA's fourth quarter retail share decreased 0.4 share point, as share losses for Marlboro and other premium brands
were partially offset by discount share gains, driven by L&M. PM USA's full-year retail share declined 0.8 share point.
The smokeless product segment's reported fourth quarter and full-year financial results were negatively impacted by
higher restructuring charges associated with our new cost reduction program. Fourth quarter income, margin, volume,
and retail share comparisons were also impacted by higher 2011 fourth quarter promotional activities versus lower
levels of promotions in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the rollout of an enhanced retail platform.
Reported operating companies income for the segment decreased 8.3% for the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher
restructuring charges and higher promotional costs, partially offset by higher pricing and volume. For the full year,
reported operating companies income increased 7% to $859 million, primarily due to higher pricing and volume,
partially offset by higher restructuring charges.

Excluding restructuring and acquisition related charges, fourth quarter adjusted operating companies income for the
smokeless product segment increased 3.6%. Fourth quarter operating companies income margins increased 1.9
percentage points to 59.3%, reflecting a difficult comparison to the fourth quarter of 2010, when lower promotional
activity boosted margins. Adjusted operating companies income for the smokeless product segment grew a strong 7.7%
to $896 million for 2011. Adjusted operating companies income margins also grew for the full year, increasing 1.5
percentage points to 59%.
Copenhagen and Skoal's combined shipment volume grew 6.5% for the full year. Copenhagen benefited from new
products introduced over the past few years, including Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen, Long Cut Straight, Extra
Long Cut Natural, and Wintergreen Pouches. Skoal's volume also benefited from its new products. Skoal Extra and
Skoal Snus, partially offset by the delisting of seven SKUs in the second quarter of 2011.
Total smokeless products volume for the full year increased 1.4%, as gains for Copenhagen and Skoal were partially
offset by declines in other portfolio products, including non-focus brands and Marlboro Snus. Marlboro Snus's volume
was negatively impacted by significantly lower levels of promotional support compared to its national launch in 2010
and the shift in mix from packages with six pouches to tins with 15 pouches.
Fourth quarter smokeless products shipment volume comparisons were favorably impacted by reduced promotional
activities in 2010. Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined shipment volume by 13% for the fourth quarter,
while total smokeless products volume increased 9.7%.
After adjusting for changes in trade inventories, USSTC and PM USA's 2011 fourth quarter and full-year combined
smokeless product shipment volume was estimated to be up 6% and 4% respectively. USSTC and PM USA believe
that the smokeless category's full-year volume grew at an estimated rate of 5%.
Retail share comparisons for the fourth quarter were favorably impacted by the promotional dynamics I discussed
earlier. Copenhagen and Skoal's 2011 combined retail share increased 2.4 share points to 49.9% in the fourth quarter
and grew one share point to 49% for the full year.
Copenhagen's 2011 fourth quarter and full-year retail share increased 2.4 share points and 1.5 share points respectively,
as the brand's retail share results continued to benefit from new products. Skoal's retail share was flat for the fourth
quarter and down 0.5 share point for the full year as share losses, including the impact of SKUs delisted in the second
quarter of 2011, were partially offset by share gains on new products.
Fourth quarter retail share the total smokeless product segment increased 1.1 share points, as gains for Copenhagen
were partially offset by losses on other portfolio products. Segment share for the full year decreased 0.1 percentage
point, as declines on other portfolio products and Skoal were mostly offset by gains in Copenhagen.
Middleton's fourth quarter operating companies income and margins improved significantly versus the same period in
2010, when Black & Mild made promotional investments to defend its competitive position in the marketplace against
low-priced imported cigars. Reported operating companies income increased 85.7% for the fourth quarter, primarily
due to lower promotional spending and higher list prices, partially offset by lower volume and higher restructuring
charges in connection with the new cost reduction program. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, fourth
quarter adjusted operating companies income grew 95.5%. And adjusted operating companies income margins grew
16.8 percentage points to 47.8%.
As Mike mentioned earlier, Middleton's income and margins were stronger in the second half of 2011 compared to the
first half. Full-year reported operating companies income decreased 2.4%, primarily due to costs related to
manufacturing infrastructure upgrades and new product costs, partially offset by higher list prices. Adjusted operating
companies income decreased 1.2% for the full year to $167 million. And adjusted operating companies income margins
decreased 2.2 percentage points to 46.4%.
Middleton's 2011 full-year reported cigar shipment volume was unchanged while fourth quarter volume decreased
5.6%, primarily due to changes in trade inventories. Middleton believes that wholesalers depleted Black & Mild cigar
inventories built in the third quarter following Middleton's December list price increase.

Black & Mild delivered strong retail share results for both the fourth quarter and full year. Fourth quarter retail share of
machine-made large cigars increased 0.9 share point 30.8%, and full-year share increased 0.5 share point 29.5%. Black
& Mild's retail share benefited from the introduction of the new Untipped Cigarillos that Mike mentioned earlier.
The Wine segment reported strong operating companies income and volume results in 2011. The wine segment's
reported operating companies income increased by 23.3% for the fourth quarter and by 49.2% to $91 million for the
full year. Excluding restructuring and acquisition related costs, adjusted operating companies income for the Wine
segment was unchanged for the fourth quarter and up 14.5% to $95 million for the full year.
Ste. Michelle's 2011 wine shipments grew by 10.9% in the fourth quarter and 9.6% for the full year, as the company
continued to focus on expanding its distribution of its premium products.
The Financial Services segment's 2011 fourth quarter operating companies income was $10 million, reflecting a $60
million increase in the allowance for losses related to the bankruptcy filing by American Airlines. For the full year, the
segment reported an operating companies loss of $349 million, primarily due to the 2011 second quarter charge of $490
million related to certain leveraged lease transactions, and a $25 million net increase in the allowance for losses,
partially offset by higher lease revenues, which included gains on asset sales. Full-year adjusted operating companies
income for the segment, which is calculated excluding the impact of the leveraged lease charge, decreased $16 million
to $141 million.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping
items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 35% for both the fourth quarter and the full
year of 2011. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.73 in the fourth quarter and $5.70 for the full year, while the lowest
effective priced cigarette was $4.24 in the fourth quarter and $4.22 for the full year.
The cigarette discount category's retail share was 28.1% for the fourth quarter and 27.8% for the full year.
The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.37 per pack,
unchanged from the third quarter and up $0.01 from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Copenhagen's retail price was $4.18 for both the fourth quarter and full year, and its brand's price gap versus the
leading discount brand was 42% for the fourth quarter and 43% for the full year.
CapEx was $30 million for the fourth quarter and $105 million for the full year. Ongoing depreciation and amortization
was $69 million for the fourth quarter and $253 million for the full year.
Operator, do we have any questions?

<Q - Christina McGlone-Hahn>: Not yet. I guess first question, just in terms of the wording with regard to 2012
Marlboro strategy, it seems like you've been trying to balance share with profit growth. And it looks like just from
hearing the comments that 2012 may be more tilted towards share growth, and I just was wondering if you could

comment on that and then maybe talk about some of when you talked about Marlboro Black. Is that nationwide? Is that
positioned like Special Blends, or is it positioned differently?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Marlboro Black is nationwide and it's positioned as Marlboro Black.
Relative to plans for Marlboro in 2012, from a forward-looking point of view, we provided EPS guidance. We don't
like to get into the detail of how we're going to deliver what we think we're going to deliver for competitive reasons.
But at CAGNY, we will provide some additional context regarding our thinking about Marlboro and some of the things
that we're looking at relative to the brand as we go forward through 2012 without providing too much information from
a competitive point of view.
<Q - Christina McGlone-Hahn>: Okay, thanks for that. And then when I think about cash flow, with the $500 million
pension contribution, and I'm curious. I think that there will be a LILO/SILO payment this year. I don't know if that's
definitive or not, if we should be building something like that in. But given the two of those, would that basically limit
your ability to go beyond the $1 billion share repo already announced?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Yes, I think as we look at our balance sheet, we continue to have a strong balance
sheet and strong cash flow. With regard to our share repurchase program, I'm not going to comment on any activity
beyond the program that we've currently announced.
<Q - Christina McGlone-Hahn>: Okay, thank you. I'll pass it on.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Citigroup.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Good morning.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: My first question has to do with the portfolio mix. To be sure, the fact that you've held onto
as much of the 2010 share gains for Marlboro is certainly a good thing. But from my perspective, I'm a bit encouraged
by the discount volume growth. As we look out to 2012, can you talk a little bit about how you see your portfolio mix
in cigarettes evolving?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: I think nothing has changed from a strategic point of view for us. We're focused on
premium brands. This year, L&M recovered a bit of the share that basically it had lost. Our objective there is to hold
our position in the discount segment and transition it to L&M as a brand. So some of that occurred, but our absolute
share of the discount business has remained pretty constant over the past few years as we've ceded some share on Basic
and recovered some of that on L&M.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Fair enough.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: You shouldn't read into that any suggestion of strategic change.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Understood. In terms of the new partnership that you announced this morning, can you give
us any color on when we might see some new product innovations come out of that and whether that would be
Marlboro branding or any other brand in your portfolio?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: I'll tell you what. I don't think I'm going to comment on it any further right now. At
CAGNY, we'll talk a bit more about our relationship and the whole subject of alternative products for tobacco
consumers. And so I suggest that you wait until that point before we communicate any further on the subject.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Okay, that's great, and just one last one if I could. Could you offer some color on your
outlook for SET [State Excise Tax] and FET [Federal Excise Tax] increases in 2012?

<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: We always view that as a risk to the business, and so it's an area where we have to be
prepared to participate, and we do. It's an election year. Sometimes that makes it a little bit more difficult to call, so
we'll see. Right now, we're just watching to see what kind of activity might emerge so that we can be prepared to deal

<Q - David J. Adelman CFA, MBA>: Hi. Good morning, Mike.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David J. Adelman CFA, MBA>: There are three things I wanted to ask you. First, do you think Marlboro can
profitably grow share? And what's your response to, I think, the concern in the investment community that if the brand
doesn't grow, you'll resort to higher levels of promotional spending?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Look, we've been pretty clear with our position relative to the cigarette business. We
believe that the appropriate strategy in the cigarette business is to maximize profitability but maintain modest
momentum on Marlboro because we want to have sustainable profit growth. So I believe that our cigarette position is
very good in that regard. But as I explained in my remarks, I think share deviations on Marlboro this year really have
more to do with differences in promotion spending and timing, both ours and competitive activity, and that it's to be
expected to have some of those kinds of share deviations, particularly in this kind of an economic environment where
you have a certain segment of your consumer base that is more price sensitive and is more volatile relative to shopping
and relative to promotion activity that you see in the store.
I think Marlboro has held up very well in that environment. Price gaps have remained stable throughout that
environment. The brand was able to contribute to expanded margins at Philip Morris USA. And I think it's well
positioned, as I said in my remarks, to go into 2012. So we look at this on a long-term basis. We think that based on the
guidance we provided that we can continue to deliver a solid growth rate and EPS to our shareholders and that
Marlboro will be a part of that proposition.
<Q - David J. Adelman CFA, MBA>: Okay. Secondly, let me ask you about the prepared comments you made about
no change in elasticity, no change in the secular volume decline rate. How do you reconcile those two beliefs with the
fact that year on year, there have been very little retail price increases to consumers? As an example, I think Marlboro's
pricing year on year is up 1%, and yet consumption is down 3.5%.
<A - Howard A. Willard>: David, this is Howard. I'll address that question. As we look over the last three or four
years and we calculate the decline rate, we calculate it as a combination of the secular decline rate and a price elasticity
impact. And as we've looked over the last three or four years, as I said in my remarks, we've seen a very consistent
secular decline rate; and frankly, we've seen the price elasticity hold up pretty well. And that applied even during the
large FET increase here. So again, we've studied this pretty carefully, and we're seeing quite a bit of consistency there.
<Q - David J. Adelman CFA, MBA>: Okay. And then lastly, just a question on the FDA and it's a big picture
question. There have been now some instances, I guess they've had control going on for two years over tobacco, some
instances where the FDA has had some freedom to operate, some capacity to provide indications of its underlying
approach to regulating tobacco, and I guess there are two potential extremes. One is that they'd be non-science based
and extremely hostile. And the other one would be that they'd be cautious and science based, and I'm just curious. To
this point to the extent, Mike, that you have a read, where do you think the FDA is coming out on that spectrum with
respect to its philosophical approach to regulating tobacco?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: I think that so far, what we've seen has been about what we would have expected, a
methodical approach to applying the legislation that was passed. The FDA has the obligation to do that, and that

legislation calls for the FDA to use science and evidence to do things that are in the interest of public health related to
tobacco. And while I still think it's early in the process, I think the FDA has followed the legislation and is moving
right along relative to the legislative imperatives that it has been given; and I think from our perspective, has been
appropriate in the way it has been moving forward. So it remains to be seen what the outcome will be on some of the
issues. And I'm sure there will be places and there have already been some places where you may see industry
disagreement with conclusions that have been drawn or regulations that have been issued by the FDA. But I think that's
always to be expected in a regulatory environment.
<Q - David J. Adelman CFA, MBA>: Okay, thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Good morning and congrats on the nice quarter.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Thank you.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: I just wanted to see if you could give a little more color on the restructuring savings and how
you think you might use some of that. How much would you reinvest in marketing or brand building, and how much
would drop to the bottom line?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Once again, we provide guidance as the forward-looking way for investors and
analysts to have some idea of what we're thinking and what we anticipate will be the outcome for the year. But we don't
like to get into breaking down the internals because it does have a bearing on competition and how people view or try
to determine what our competitive positions might be and what we might do. So I'm going to decline to break it down
any further than the guidance that we've provided.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Okay. And then looking at consumer sentiment, in C-stores specifically we've seen some
trading up to things like better beer and energy drinks have been strong there. Have you seen that to be a tailwind for
Marlboro in that channel as well? And do you feel like you might be getting some trading up coming back from people
who have been switching to cheaper brands?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Look, the premium/discount mix in the cigarette category has remained pretty much
in the range that it has been in over the last number of years. So any activity in shifting between premium and discount
– and remember this is largely a premium business – is really driven by short-term activity in the marketplace.
So we haven't seen any trend-line changes. We see actually a lot of promotion activity between the leading premium
brands, and some trading of volume back and forth, and share back and forth between those premium brands, once
again based on levels of shorter-term promotion spending.
Everybody has to understand that in any category and on any brand, even the most premium of premium brands, there
is always a segment of that brand's consumer population that's more price-sensitive and promotion-sensitive, and does,
in fact, switch from time to time between other brands that they've found to be satisfactory when they can buy them on
promotion. And so we have a segment of that business on the Marlboro brand, even though the brand has a very high
loyalty factor of people who buy the brand 100% of the time.
So I don't see any underlying trend changes right now in the category between premium and discount. I just see
promotion-driven shifting that is short term. And in our view, again, we're managing this category to maximize
profitability and maintain longer-term strength of position for our brands so that they can continue to deliver good
profit growth.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: That's helpful, thank you. And then lastly on Black, I know it just launched, and so I don't
know how much you've seen actually in market yet. But where is that sourcing volume – or where do you expect that to
be sourcing volume from?

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning, Mike. I wish you all the best in your retirement there.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Thank you.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Sure. I just had a quick one, and actually a bit of a follow-up to the last question. Based
on the current economic outlook for 2012, GDP, consumer confidence, those things should all modestly improve
through the year. I'm just curious, just for perspective. Do believe that would be enough – or would the industry
respond with less aggressive promotions in an improving economic environment? Or do we need a real step-up in
improvement in the economy to see maybe more pricing and/or less promotion?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Generally, unemployment and consumer confidence have been factors that have been
associated with the ability for brands to sustain a bit wider gap between a premium brand's price and the lowest price in
the marketplace. But that outcome generally follows those things occurring. And we're still at high levels of
unemployment, and we're still at low levels of consumer confidence.
So I think that – I can't predict the future on how fast or when that's going to change. I'd just say that, if it does, that it
could have some positive impact. But I don't know when that will be.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Sure. And then I wanted to ask a question about the MLP [Marlboro Leadership Price]
program. It's like we have to ask one of those every quarter.
But my question being there have been some adjustments to that program, reflecting some of the guidance you gotten
from retailers. I'm just curious – and it's a bit early, I realize. But is there any increase in participation rates or anything
like that you can speak to, that you think the new program will allow for?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Once again, I think I'll defer it to CAGNY, I think, when we talk about the business in
a little more detail, and a little more time has passed.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, and then one final one, if I could. Do you regard the cigarette inventory levels
today, is it at good levels here? And then I guess related to that, any shipping day differences in 2012 we should be
aware of?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: The third quarter ended with really low inventory levels. Inventory levels in cigarettes
grew a bit in the fourth quarter. And then toward the end of the fourth quarter, after pricing activity in the marketplace,
they declined again.
So it was a complex quarter from the point of view of inventory movement. Probably the easiest way to understand it is
that we began 2012 with inventory levels that are pretty equivalent to how we began 2011.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: And that would be considered a good level for you?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Yes, it's a reasonably normalized level. There's always some movement in these
things that are driven by particular wholesaler or retailer motivations at any point in time. But I think the easiest way to
understand where we are as we began 2012 with inventory, wholesale inventory levels that were pretty equivalent to

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Burritt with Bloomberg News.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for your time. Mike, I wanted – it seems appropriate to ask, since
you're leaving in a few months. I wonder whether you could take a look back and just offer some sense of how the
company has managed volatility in the business and in its share price. I'm just wondering whether conditions are such
now where volatility is less of a risk than it was, say, 10 years ago.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: It's a hard question to answer because oftentimes volatility is driven by external
factors, rather than what we're actually doing and how we're actually performing in the business.
I do think it's fair to say that in the cigarette business, we've gone – in my career, we've gone through really three
downturns, with this last one – I mean economic downturns – with this last one being probably the most severe. And I
think that the cigarette brands and Marlboro in particular has been most successful in the way its business has been
performing and its ability to grow profitability in this last one, which is the longest and probably the most difficult. And
I think to some degree, that's a reflection of what we learned from the other ones.
So I would say that we've gotten better at dealing with that particular area, where from time to time, there are economic
situations that develop that aren't particularly attractive for consumers. And knowing how to run premium brands in
that kind of an environment and continue to give stable, consistent returns to shareholders, I think, is one of the things
that the company is good at.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: And, Marty, if I may ask quickly, obviously you're taking charge. Do you have a sense of -
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: I'm sorry? Are you asking a question?
<Q - Chris Burritt>: [indiscernible] (48:15) just looking ahead, Marty, what are the biggest challenges going forward
in terms of the company managing the volatility that goes with your business? Is it FDA regulation? Is it...
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: I'm sure Marty has an excellent answer to that question, except he's not here.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Oh, I'm sorry. Mike, can I ask you that question?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: And he doesn't get to be CEO until May 17.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Okay.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: So between now and then, you're stuck with me.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: How about giving me a little forward look then, Mike, if you don't mind?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: I think that the issues remain pretty much what they have been. I think the risks to the
business are always competitive risks, marketplace risks, economic risks. We have regulatory risks. We have legal
risks.
They're not new news nor are they unknown. They're pretty much the same ones that have been around for a bit now,
and that we have had a pretty successful track record in managing. But they continue to be the risks that I believe that
the company faces.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Thanks for your time.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: And congratulations, Mike.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Thank you.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Mike, just maybe taking a step back here. In the last couple of years, if we look at the company's
performance, obviously the profit growth, the earnings growth have been pretty healthy. But if you look at just the
revenue growth, you haven't really seen any growth in revenues, even if you just take all of your tobacco businesses, so
certainly a bit of a different algorithm than I think what you've laid out at the time of the spinoff.
So as you go forward, is top-line growth even a consideration for Altria? Can you continue to get pretty healthy profit
and earnings growth really without getting top-line growth? And if so, what has changed the cost side or other factors
that are driving better profit growth, as opposed to top-line growth, as we think about the next few years?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: What you're primarily referring to is the cigarette business, because the other
businesses are growing categories.
But I think in the cigarette business, the answer to the question is that, given the complexity of the math model, it
actually isn't a necessity to have top-line revenue growth in order to have profit growth. And that continues out, I think,
into the future. It's nice to get it when you can get it, but it's not a necessity to get it, in order to have profit growth. And
I think we've demonstrated that.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay, but if you take the total tobacco portfolio as a whole, now that you're going to put the
cigar business with PM USA, obviously, smokeless tobacco is growing, but it's still a relatively smaller portion of your
total tobacco business. So when you look at in totality, is your point that you can still get to the profit growth algorithm
without really getting the top-line growth?
And then maybe talk a little bit more about the cost savings opportunity. You've laid out the $400 million. But beyond
that, are there a lot of opportunities to really get continued cost savings out of the different businesses that you operate?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Just once again, as the growth businesses grow, the cigarette business becomes less of
a percentage of the total profit pool. But we continue to expect that our cigarette profitability is going to grow out into
the future. And my point is it's not really necessary to actually get top-line growth in order to get profit growth out of
the cigarette business.
Relative to cost, we lay those things out as we get to them, rather than provide a lot of forward-looking information, so
I'm not going to report on that. We have a program we've announced. And as we accrue those savings, we'll be talking
about that.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just in terms of the competitive landscape, you see now some of the price
increases coming up either from Newport Red or the discount segment. So as you think about 2012, do you feel better
about the competitive backdrop today then maybe a year ago, where you did have a lot of introductory promotions
going on behind Newport and some of the discount brands that were pretty heavily promoted?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Again, I would describe the cigarette industry right now from a pricing point of view
as pretty stable. If you look at price gaps across the key brands, it's pretty stable but it's very competitive. So there's still
a lot of ebb and flow of short-term promotion activity. There are no fundamental trend changes that seem to be taking
place in the industry.

So I expect it to continue to be competitive. But within that, it's a pretty stable overall industry, and the profit pool
continues to expand.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just a clarification on the inventory comment you made. So the gap in the Q4
numbers, so your shipments coming in, up 0.2%, and your underlying volume being down 3% or 4%. So all of that
difference was attributable to just really the low level of inventory at the end of 3Q, and then just the catch-up to
getting to a normal level in Q4?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: No, I don't think I spoke to that, nor am I going to try to reconcile it. My comment
was simply that inventories at the beginning of 2012 were about the same as they were at the beginning of 2011.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. Should we think anything differently about Q1 in terms of whether any inventory
movement could impact shipments?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: We can't predict what the inventory movement is going to be by wholesalers, so I
decline to comment on that.

<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael Felberbaum>: In regards to the agreement that you announced today as far as non-combustible nicotine
products, other companies have previously announced agreements and ventures into this area. Do you have confidence
that the FDA will ultimately make it possible for companies to market some of these products as less harmful than or
safer than cigarettes? And do think that consumers will ultimately be interested in these alternatives?
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Look, the answer to the first part of your question is I have confidence that the FDA is
going to study this issue and make a determination about it because it's a part of what's in the legislation. And I think
that they'll – that they've already begun to look at this subject, so I do have confidence that it's going to be reviewed.
And relative to how consumers react, I think that's going to be dependent upon the products.

Your next question comes from Ben Schmid of UBS.

<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Good morning.
<Q - Nik Modi>: And congrats, Mike, on...
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Thanks.
<Q - Nik Modi>: ...what they called an illustrious 23-year career.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: Thank you.
<Q - Nik Modi>: So just two quick questions for me. On the smokeless side, it looks like you're having some good
volume gains on the premium end. I'm just curious. American Snuff put out a new contract looking to get more space.
So I'm just curious how you've seen the competitive interaction there, at least at the shelf, what kind of impact that it
has had?
And then the second question is I continue to pick up dissatisfaction at the retail level on broader execution, and this
has been a concern of mine for a year and a half now. I'm just curious. Do you see it, and what is Altria doing to help
address that? That would be very helpful.
<A - Michael E. Szymanczyk>: The answer to your first question is I don't really know the answer at this point.
There's always some movement in the trade programs, and we have had some in ours that we've seen some recent
activity from some competitive activity. And it's hard at this point to gauge what the outcome is because some of that's
still in motion.
Relative to our retail organization, we've been continuing to work through the integration of all these businesses into
one sales organization. And one of the impediments that we had was we had to take the different systems that existed
and take these three categories and put them into our system, which at the time was really designed to accommodate
one category. And over the course of the last couple years, we've built a new system and installed that system in
December and trained the entire organization on that system, and so they're just now getting up and running. We also
will complete a reconfiguration of the organization based on how the business development is with the totality of these
businesses from a geographic point of view versus the way it was originally designed, which was around a cigarette
business. So that has implications for coverage and the amount of coverage and having your coverage in the right
places.
And so all of those things are a continuation of the completion of these acquisitions that we made and beginning to tune
up some of the places where you have some residual effects. So I think as we come to a close on that disruptive activity
in the sales organization that we'll be in a better position. Now we haven't really seen, I don't think, an impact on the
business from that, but it is difficult for our people sometimes when they're having to work with less than optimum
systems, for example, to get their work done.

<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Good morning, Priya Ohri-Gupta. I just wanted to get a sense from you as we model
out the forward year. What sort of core cash balance should we be baking in? For example, I'm just talking about the
amount of cash needed to address your day-to-day ongoing business requirements. Thank you.
