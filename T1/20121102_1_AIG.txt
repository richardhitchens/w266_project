MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the American International Group's Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead,
ma'am.
Elizabeth A. Werner
Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning and all your efforts last night in the face of some of
the challenges, given the hurricane. I do want to just let you all know that management's dialing in from multiple
occasions. So, we just ask you to be a little patient, particularly during the Q&A period. But on the line today, we have
our senior management team, including Bob Benmosche, President and CEO; David Herzog, Chief Financial Officer;
Peter Hancock, CEO of AIG Property Casualty; and Jay Wintrob, CEO of AIG Life and Retirement.
I'd like to remind you too that today's presentation may contain certain forward-looking statements which are based on
management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking

Now, I'd like to turn our call over to Bob Benmosche. Bob?
Robert H. Benmosche
Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everybody. We've got a crisis that we're all facing, but – it seems like a lifetime
ago, but during the third quarter, we did in fact do another major repurchase of our shares, the Treasury was able to sell
down to less than 16% of AIG. So for the year, we've been able to buy back $13 billion of our shares, $8 billion just in
this quarter alone. And we've also – by the way, I'm on page three, for those of you following the presentation, also
made good progress on our bank facilities and other unsecured lending, especially at ILFC.
Big question was, once we did the sell down, what would happen about regulation and who would be our regulator and
the Federal Reserve has, in fact, begun its supervision of AIG. I'm going to also add that people wondered what would
happen with our capital management program once that happens. While our focus has been on share buyback up until
now, our focus going forward on capital management, working closely with the Fed in terms of what we're able to do.
We're going to now focus on our coverage ratio and that's going to be looking at our debt and our ability to cover the
debt with earnings.
On the Property Casualty side, again, we've seen good progress in terms of our reshaping that business. Peter will give
you more color in just a moment. We are seeing rate increases and we should focus on our accident year, because that's
where we're making progress in terms of the changes we're making. You'll see gradual improvement, which we said
would occur. And we're continuing to focus on making sure that our reserves stay strong and we're working through
making sure any development is dealt with very, very conservatively.
On the AIG Life and Retirement business, we had, again, a good quarter. The markets helped us a little bit. We did
have some adverse impact, and Jay will take you through couple of the items from the past that we dealt with in this
quarter. Our variable annuities sales, and we've talked before about how we designed that product, we think we have a
very good risk manage product just in its design alone, and so our sales continue to grow. And Jay will talk a little bit
about our base yields and what's happening in this low-interest rate environment.
Last but not least, on the Mortgage Guaranty, we continue to see great progress in that business as the market begins to
turn and we're having huge success with the way we're now underwriting mortgages, so that will be an add for us. One
thing that David will talk about is ILFC, in terms of where we are in terms of managing that business, but more
importantly, we still are committed to an IPO of that business once the markets are receptive. So let me turn it over to
David, who will start giving you some more color on the things I've just talked about. David?
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As evident from our results, it's been another busy quarter here at AIG
as we continue to execute, both on the Capital Management and on the operating fronts. As we look towards the
remainder of the year and 2013 and beyond, Capital Management will remain a focus and core competency at AIG. We
remain committed to our goal of $25 billion to $30 billion in Capital Management by 2015, and we're over halfway
there, or roughly halfway there, at this point.
We've described Capital Management to include more than just share buyback, and it's a good time to remind you that
we will consider acquisitions, investment in organic growth, debt capital management, and certainly maintaining strong
capital at our operating companies, all aimed at effectively utilizing our deployable capital, increasing enterprise value,

while also improving our interest coverage ratio that Bob just mentioned. All of the above options would be considered
in the event of a sale of our AIA shares. As Bob said, we do not know what will be required under Fed regulation and
we view this as being – we'll be prudent, given our expectations of becoming a non-bank SIFI.
With respect to AIG's capacity for Capital Management we believe, again, if we were to sell – hypothetically sell our
AIA shares, that we'd have approximately $2.5 billion of deployable capital now and subject, of course, to discussions
with the Federal Reserve, as well as rating agencies, in terms of the actual deployment. But for potential actions in the
fourth quarter, we have about $1.1 billion of hybrids that become callable in December, and we may consider calling
those bonds.
Turning to slide four for the financials, you can see that after-tax operating earnings per share grew to $1 a share from
$1.58 loss a year ago. Growth was driven by increased earnings from both the Property Casualty and Life and
Retirement segments. Book value per share was $68.79 (sic) [$68.87]; excluding AOCI, book value per share was
$61.41 (sic) [$61.49], up 10% sequentially. Share buyback contributed nearly $5 to this quarter's book value growth.
The effective operating tax rate increased during the quarter to just over 35%, due in part to a shift in the investments to
taxable securities in our Property Casualty group and a third quarter, what I'll call catch-up, reflecting higher full-year
income projections, as well as what I would refer to as a return to provision true up in the normal course that added a
couple of points to the tax rate in the quarter.
Going forward, we would expect our tax rate to be in the 30% to 31% range over time. As you know, we will not be
paying – actually be paying any taxes for some time, given the availability of our NOLs.
On slide five provides a breakdown of the segment operating earnings, which reflects the 87% growth in operating
income from our Insurance operations, and Peter and Jay will provide additional insights in a moment. This quarter, the
gains in the direct investment book benefited from credit spread tightening and gains recognized from winding down
positions. As we have said in the past, our strategy has been to maximize the value during the run-off of this book. We
may decide from time to time to terminate trades opportunistically for a variety of reasons, including de-risking. We
expect over half of the direct investment book liabilities to run off by 2017. To date, we have realized significant value
from an orderly and opportunistic wind-down.
ILFC's results for the quarter reflected a $98 million in impairment charges on aircraft, largely from the completion of
our annual detailed portfolio review. While this is a significant decline from the prior two years, it's a good time to
remind you that there were significant industry trends driving those impairments, including the introduction of more
fuel-efficient aircraft like the NEO. Also, as a reminder with respect to ILFC AeroTurbine, [ph] our part of that (9:30)
company gives us another end-of-aircraft life opportunity to optimize value.
Slides six and seven highlight our capital structure and liquidity. We remain well capitalized, with debt to total capital
ratio of 20%. While leverage ratio is appropriate. We, as a management team, as Bob said, are focused on improving
our coverage ratios, the rating agencies have given us indications of expected improvements for an incremental
increase in our coverage ratios over the next 12 to 18 months, and we intend to achieve these improvements through a
combination of liability management and improvements in operating earnings in our core businesses.
Cash flows from our Insurance companies remained strong. We've already received roughly $5.3 billion in dividends
from our insurance operations through the end of October, exceeding our annual target of $4 billion to $5 billion in
dividends. These dividends of $5.3 billion includes $1.3 billion we received post quarter-end.
So at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Peter for a discussion of AIG Property Casualty. Peter?
Peter D. Hancock
Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. First, like to make a brief comment regarding Hurricane Sandy. Right
now, our immediate goals are obviously to safeguard our employees and to assist our customers, but it's too early to
conclude how severe the storm is going to be from an insurance standpoint. So we're reaching out to customers, making
sure our claims reporting information is available to them, and standing by to assist them.

But turning to our results, AIG Property Casualty continued to make progress in the third quarter. While I'd prefer the
pace of change to be quicker, we remain on track with our strategic initiatives. As slide eight of the earnings
presentation indicates, we reported operating income of $786 million in the third quarter, compared to $492 million in
the comparable prior-year period.
The increase was driven by lower catastrophe losses, current accident year underwriting improvements, and higher net
investment income, partially offset by increased expenses. We recorded $261 million in catastrophe losses in the
quarter, largely from crop losses related to the droughts in the U.S. Midwest and Hurricane Isaac. We believe that
losses related to Hurricane Isaac were less severe than our business would have experienced in prior years, due to our
focused efforts to carefully manage exposures to U.S. catastrophes.
Third quarter net prior-year adverse development was $145 million, or 0.2% of our total reserves. The result was
primarily driven by adverse development in Environmental and Primary Casualty, and the impact of changes in New
York State benefit reforms on our workers' compensation business.
The accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 66.5%, nearly a 2 point improvement over the comparable prior-year
period, despite an unusual increase in non-catastrophe property severe losses. We view the improvement in accident
year loss ratio over the past several quarters as a strong indicator that our strategies to optimize business mix, pricing,
and risk selection through enhanced underwriting tools are succeeding.
We continue to balance growth, profitability and risk, measuring the success of our initiatives based on overall
risk-adjusted profitability. However, we maintain the capital and resource flexibility to respond to changes in market
conditions.
Our organizational structure promotes underwriting excellence, as we've consolidated our underwriters into global
teams, versus the silo structure that existed in the past. We've empowered our employees to implement state-of-the-art
underwriting tools and hire new talent to supplement our bench of existing talent.
Partially offsetting the loss ratio improvement was an increase in the expense ratio. As we've communicated in prior
quarters, the expense increase was largely due to higher acquisition costs as we focus on higher value lines, and from
greater investment in direct marketing. General operating expenses also increased from investments in people and
infrastructure. Expenses will continue to remain elevated over the next year as we invest in these priorities. We expect
to start to realize efficiencies and to experience a gradual decline in net expenses beginning in 2014.
Property Casualty's net premiums were up 2.4% compared to prior-year, after adjusting for foreign exchange.
Turning to slide nine, Commercial Insurance net premiums were down slightly, excluding foreign exchange. We
completed the restructuring of our loss-sensitive business in U.S. Casualty, which reduced premiums written by almost
1% in the quarter, but improved capital efficiency. The remainder of the decline reflected risk selection and rate
discipline strategies, particularly in U.S. Casualty.
U.S. Commercial Insurance rates increased 8.4%, while Property and Workers' Compensation rates in the U.S.
increased 12.1% and 8.9%, respectively. We're encouraged by the rate environment overall, but some lines and regions
remain under pressure, and we'd not characterize this as a hard market.
Consumer Insurance continued to experience growth across its major lines of business. As you can see from slide 10,
this attractive segment, which includes the Direct Marketing channel, represents over 40% of net premiums
year-to-date. We also continue to expand in targeted growth economy nations, which contributed over $1 billion in
premiums. Notably, we grew by approximately 14% in Latin America and 10% in Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan,
during the third quarter.
Slide 11 demonstrates our investment portfolio mix. Third quarter net investment income increased 20% as a result of
positive marks on recently acquired structured securities. AIG Property Casualty is tailoring its strategic asset
allocation to optimize profitability in the current low-interest rate environment, while remaining aligned with AIG's
overall risk appetite and tax position. We continue to diversify our portfolio into higher-yielding securities and

reducing our concentration in municipal bonds during the third quarter. Reflecting our emphasis on Capital
Management, we've made $2.4 billion in dividend payments to the holding company year-to-date, which include $75
million in cash paid during the third quarter and an additional $800 million in cash paid in October. The commitment to
capital efficiency places 2012 on track to be our largest dividend-paying year in recent history. Our capital adequacy
levels remain in line with rating agency requirements, and we maintain strong financial strength ratings that carry a
stable outlook with the four major rating agencies.
Our legal entity simplification efforts have enabled greater capital efficiency, particularly in Europe, where the majority
of our operations will be executed through one pan-European insurance company beginning in December, subject to
final UK court approval.
In closing, I'd like to note that we have had several consecutive quarters of positive trends in business performance and
execution of our strategic plans. I'm pleased to continue to make progress, while recognizing that we have much more
work to do. So, let's turn over to Jay.
Jay S. Wintrob
Thanks a lot, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start on slide 12. AIG Life and Retirement delivered
another solid quarter, with pre-tax operating income up 75% over the same quarter last year, reflecting the positive
impact from equity markets this quarter, higher net investment income and increased spread income.
There were three items that we highlighted in the press release that are worth mentioning when analyzing our results
this quarter. One is the previously announced resolution of the multistate examination related to the handling of
unclaimed property and the use of the Social Security Administration's Death Master File. In the quarter, the total
earnings impact was negative $66 million. We also took a $20 million restructuring charge this quarter relating to the
upcoming merger of six of our Life Insurance legal entities into American General Life Insurance Company at the end
of this year, as well as for a project we call One Life that provides for the consolidation of all of our Life Insurance
platforms, operations and systems. We expect these actions to result in an improved service delivery model and,
importantly, to generate significant annual expense savings beginning next year, as we continue to focus on disciplined
expense management. And finally, AIG Life and Retirement's results were negatively impacted by $110 million
interest credited adjustment for a run-off block of guaranteed investment contracts. That adjustment represented the
cumulative impact of increased interest credited getting back to the early 2000s, and therefore the annual earnings
impact of this item was not a material amount over the individual years.
Excluding these three items, our pre-tax operating income was very strong at slightly more than $1 billion in the
quarter. Also, as David mentioned, AIG Life and Retirement has been a significant contributor to capital management,
providing $2.9 billion in dividends and distributions to date. Our risk-based capital ratio, which we currently estimate
to be in excess of 475%, remains well above our capital maintenance agreement threshold of 435%. And stat earnings
remained strong, providing capacity for dividends going forward.
In this quarter, sales results once again reflect the value of our diversified business model. Variable annuity and retail
mutual fund sales were strong in the quarter, while fixed annuity sales declined as expected, given the unprecedented
low-interest rate environment. Total Life Insurance sales were up from the year-ago quarter, although down modestly
sequentially. Variable annuity sales exceeded $1 billion in every quarter this year, and while still a relatively small
percentage of total industry sales, our 39% variable annuity sales growth year-to-date reflects our reestablished position
with core distributors in core distribution channels, and a competitive and appropriately-designed and priced product
for the current market conditions.
Due to the steep decline in fixed annuity sales, net flows, which we define as sales less all surrenders, death benefits,
withdrawal and all other benefit payments, were negative for the first time in seven quarters. We continue to make
progress on implementing our new distribution organization structure, which is designed to fully leverage our
distribution relationships and increase sales of multiple products across all of our distribution channels.

Moving on to slides 13 and 14, we have provided additional information on our asset allocation and on our portfolio
yields. In the quarter, our annualized base investment yield declined sequentially as a result of lower accretion income
on structured securities, lower income on certain equity method investments and lower yields on new purchases in the
quarter due to lower interest rates, credit spread tightening and higher credit quality purchases. It's important to
distinguish between total and base investment yields. And while base investment yield excludes income from
alternative investments, call and tender activity, and other enhancements, total investment yield is based on the total
reported net investment income. And total investment yield did remain strong for the quarter at 5.86% and 6.03%
year-to-date, an increase over both the prior year and the prior quarter.
We do not expect any material changes in our asset allocation in the near future, and we will continue to actively
manage interest and crediting rates. At the end of the quarter, approximately 61% of our account values were at
minimum crediting rates and, consistent with declining market interest rates, we saw a further sequential design –
further sequential decline, excuse me, in our cost of funds this quarter for all of our Retirement Services businesses.
Turning on to slide 15, there we've updated our disclosure regarding the impact of a sustained low interest rate
environment. Assuming the current interest rate and credit spread environment remains static, we do expect pressure on
operating earnings going forward. To-date, redeployment of our cash, including opportunistic investments and
structured securities, and disciplined management of interest crediting rates, have mitigated the impact. At this time, we
do not foresee a significant DAC or stat capital impact as a result of the sustained low-interest rate environment. Our
projections are for a steady decline in base portfolio yields and in new money yields, which we are currently assuming
to be between 3.75% and 4.25%, consistent with our actual base new money yield in the third quarter. We'll continue to
monitor reinvestment activity, credit spreads, and overall new money yields closely, and assess future impacts as
appropriate.
In the quarter, we continued to execute on a program to utilize capital tax loss carry-forwards. Year-to-date, we sold
approximately $5.9 billion of investments at a book yield of 6.3%, and that generated realized gains of about $1.2
billion. With these sales and subsequent reinvestment of proceeds at lower yields, that impacted our operating income,
but we captured real after-tax economic benefits. The program is now substantially complete, and the impact on 2013
pre-tax operating income, compared to this year, will be a reduction of about $33 million from the program.
In closing, we've positioned ourselves very well for the challenges of the low-interest rate environment, and our
earnings capacity remains solid. Continued focus on product innovation, disciplined product pricing, expense
management, and fully leveraging our resources and distribution relationships, remain core to our strategy.
So at this time, I want to turn it back over to David.
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Jay. And turning to slide 16 for just a quick summary of United Guaranty. UGC continues to see growth in
its new business volumes, and it's continuing its leadership position in the Mortgage Insurance industry, and UGC is
generating returns in excess of 20% on new business and we continue to experience declines in delinquency.
At this point, I'd like to turn it back to Liz to tee up the Q&A. Thanks.

Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Josh Stirling, Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Hi, good morning. So – listen, I think we all appreciate the – the substantial clarity, I'd
say, on your near-term plans for Capital Management and how debt is going to fit in. I'm wondering, David, if you
could give us a sense of – in the near-term, what sort of coverage ratios you might be trying to target? How much more,
beyond the hybrids you've identified, you would sort of see as tools to get there?
And as we – when you think about the firm's total capital generation, obviously I think people have a handle, it seems
like, operating earnings and tax benefits monetizing. I'm wondering if you can give us some of the color around what
the impact of the things you've been doing, restructuring your Life Insurance companies, consolidating legal entities in
Europe, and then prospectively moving assets from the DIB, or liabilities from FP, into the regulated entities, that we
should be thinking about as a future capital impact?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: David, why don't you go ahead? That was a mouthful.
<A - David L. Herzog>: I'll start on the capital management and then kick it over to Jay for commentary on the Life
legal entity restructuring, and then maybe Peter can comment further on the Property Casualty legal entity, and then
we'll circle back to Brian for maybe a word or two on the – some color on the direct investment book.
With respect to the coverage ratio improvement, I think the agencies have been pretty clear that, while our leverage is
in a very strong position, they'd like to see a couple of turns improvement over that period of time, the 12 to 18 months.
So, again, there's lots of ways to accomplish that. One is with a reduction in the interest expense, again, targeting
financial leverage or the securities that count towards financial leverage. That includes senior debt, includes some of
the hybrids. So, I think, again, that's one way, and obviously the continued improvement in the operating earnings of
our core insurance operations is clearly the other lever, and that's consistent with our plans and expectations with
respect to, again, the continued improvement.
So, those are the general direction that we're going. We haven't specifically identified any specific transactions. Again,
that is under consideration. So Jay, why don't you maybe comment on the Life and Retirement legal entity structure?
<A - Jay S. Wintrob>: Sure, David. Thanks. Good morning, Josh. Let me put it in context. In terms of – directly
answering your question, in terms of increased capital efficiency, we see that as modest, probably somewhere between
$150 million and $250 million of less – lower capital with the same amount of liabilities, principally due to the
covariance of risk. But more importantly, the legal entity consolidation is going to diversify our risks to a greater
extent. That's going to allow us, both on an economic basis and also, under all of our stress testing, to withstand far
greater stresses within our largest Life entity, American General Life Insurance Company.
Also, there will be some modest, but not unimportant, expense savings from the consolidation. And as importantly,
from the standpoint of our distribution partners and others that we do business with, it will make doing business with us
easier, as we'll be more of a single Life company with whom agents and financial advisors can be licensed to access a
much broader range of our products. So there's several different benefits, and capital efficiency is one of many.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Peter?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: In our Pan-European – similar story in our Pan-European legal entity consolidation. We're
talking about going from four legal entities operating in 26 countries into one starting the 1st of December and that has
benefits, both in terms of stat capital, as well as operating cost efficiencies and better controls. The stat capital benefit,
right off the bat, is about $300 million, but will be greater over time, but dependent on a number of factors, including
how we organize our internal reinsurance, our pooling arrangements, and the extent to which we use Europe versus
North America as a hub for internal reinsurance, as well as how we optimize our holdings in the investment portfolio.
Because right now, our European investment portfolio has very, very high quality assets relative to our North American
one. So, there's room to optimize where we hold what types of securities to increase our capital efficiency. So, I think
that, taken as a whole, very substantial efficiency benefits, both in terms of OpEx as well as capital usage.

profitability over time while maintaining adequate capital and liquidity to cover any risks. The DIB over time has
generated several billion dollars of income and gains. As David said, we expect it to reach its half-life by about 2017.
And again, the significant NAV in that business will free up over time. As you heard in prior quarters, we have been
able to move excess capital out of the DIB, so we do have some flexibility there, and we'll continue to operate it
prudently. I don't know if there's a whole lot more to say on that at the moment.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Okay. Thank you – Josh, just keep in mind that buying back debt would be just one of
the options; in Capital Management, David went through a whole list. And I think it's important that we focus on the
operating earnings within the Insurance companies and where we can do more of that, as well as deal with the actual
interest expense. Next question.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Yes. That's very comprehensive. Thank you. The one other big question related to
capital, and then I'll pass the floor, is – when you think about the Fed and the prospects for you guys to be sort of held
to a CCAR type process. The rules on – either for the savings and loans holding companies, which you are, but where
the rules are not yet established. And then, the fact that you're not yet a SIFI – both of those lead one to say that it
doesn't feel as though you'd be required, at the moment, to participate in 2013 CCAR. Is that the right read, or should
we be expecting [indiscernible] (33:52) CCAR this year?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I think that's true, what you said. However, we are working with the Fed because we're
in a hurry. We want to make sure that we know where we stand, and so we're doing our best to understand the
requirements, run those requirements through our risk models, and see what we can do to determine just where we
stand. So while there's no requirements, we're still working informally to see if we can't do something to assess where
we are as we go forward. So, we just have to wait and see how the Federal Reserve works with us and how they want to
proceed with various tests. We're open to it and welcoming it, because we think it makes sense to get clarity now rather
than later.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: And you don't think that the Fed would feel as – they would prefer to have clarity sooner
rather than...?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I can't speak for the Fed. I can only tell you they're in. They're just starting to work with
us. We're a big company and they're working it through, and as soon as they're able to make some assessment, I'm sure
they'll work with us. And I think everybody wants to get clarity, it's just a matter of time and working through a
schedule that makes sense for them.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Okay, thank you. And thank you, and good luck.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Thank you.
Operator
Moving on, we'll take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Thank you. My question mostly relates to Peter on the P&C side. I want to touch upon some
detail about how much these one-off large non-catastrophe losses impacted the various International and U.S. segments
in former Chartis? And two, talked about the persistency of prior-year unfavorable reserve development. I realize a lot
of your competitors also take rather – semi-frequent charges for environmental losses, but given the size of your book,
sometimes you should be adjusting up, sometimes you should be adjusting down. It seems like reserves are always
being adjusted upward.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Let me – before I turn it over to Peter, I think what – maybe Peter should respond to the
first part of your question second, but I'd like maybe Peter and Charlie, because you raised a very important point on
environmental and the way we're doing it, and quite frankly, we at AIG are working really hard to do a bottoms-up
analysis of all of our reserves, starting with the claims themselves. And so maybe, Peter, if you could pick this up and

then pass it to Charlie and go through that. It's a little bit more detail than some of you may want, but I think you need
to understand the thoroughness of what we're doing here, and it's not just the pattern of actuarial assumptions. Peter?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes, well let's start with the first part of the question, which is just that the steady
improvement in accident year loss ratio has been somewhat slowed in this quarter by some unusual non-cat, but large
losses, in the International property side. And so, we view those as an outlier. There – a number of them were named
losses, where we were just below the threshold that we use to designate it as a cat. So definitely some – what we
believe to be one-off anomalies. But on the reserves, let me just talk about that.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Well, can you give – put a percent on that, by the way? What percent do you think that
impacted your loss ratio there?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Josh, it's John Doyle. It was about – a little less than two points, so about 1.8 points. So, as Peter
mentioned, we had three storms in Asia that were named events that – but didn't meet our $20 million threshold to call
it a cat. And then we had a number of larger losses, about two times our average number of [indiscernible] (37:30) in
the quarter, big fire losses in the quarter that impacted it as well, and we had a failed satellite launch at – as another
example. So, it was double-digit severe losses, again, about two times an average number. Obviously, there's going to
be some lumpiness to two large losses in Property, but it was a bit of an unusual quarter for us. And, as I said, it had
close to a two point impact on the current accident year loss ratio.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Two points on International Commercial.
<A - Jeffrey Hayman>: Yes. And this is...
<A - John Q. Doyle>: 1.8 points overall, globally; most of it was on the International side. Jeff...
<A - Jeffrey Hayman>: This is Jeff. Yes. Jeff Hayman jumping in for Consumer. There's about $24 million in losses
for Consumer, exactly as John described, and Peter. Named storms that were under our threshold; Typhoon Jelawat,
some torrential rains in the Kinki region of Japan, and that's about 0.7% on our accident year loss ratio.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Thank you very much.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Can we go to Charlie now on the environmental?
<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: So, a few things on environmental. We've now concluded a very detailed study of the
environmental impairment liability portfolio, and that's the portfolio made up of five distinct fairly heterogeneous
books that we describe in the 10-Q, and we viewed, claim by claim, 2,150-odd files on the most complex claims that
are – we focused on those with the highest policy limits. Many of these were written in the period prior to 2004. And
we did not do this prompted by any actuarial indications and in fact, the actuarial third-party reviews we had would
have suggested the environmental portfolio was redundant. We did it more because we think that the characteristics of
those claims are such that you really need other experts, engineering firms, toxicologists, and litigation experts. And in
this quarter, roughly $60 million of the $77 million that you see, that we've posted as prior-year development, came
from a very detailed analysis that we did on mass tort claims, and we felt that the characteristics of those claims was
efficiently different to warrant a more conservative stance on their severity in particular.
And the only part, I would say, about persistency of prior-year development, in the quarter, we had $114 million of
large Commercial losses. Of that, $70 million, roughly, related to loss and legal on a few construction defect claims.
And we also had large losses in the healthcare division this quarter and also last quarter, and that's shown as Primary
Casualty in the All Other component of the 10-Q. And I would say the healthcare ones are unusual. The healthcare
division has actually posted very favorable development over many years, and the industry as a whole has witnessed
that. But these two claims are very peculiar. And they really are – have unique characteristics that we don't think are
indicative of a trend.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Thanks, Charlie. So I think, as you can see, even on environmental, it's been a year of
going through this. And so we're probably in the $500 million to $600 million addition to reserve. But we think it's
completely behind us now and we're continuing to do these reviews to continually build confidence in this reserve and

make sure we have it right. So a lot of work has gone on to it, but I don't think the trend is something that's just a trend,
but it's actually our cleaning up to make sure everything is right.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: So, Bob, the initiative is complete on toxic waste?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Well, we've gone through the whole – we're going through the whole reserve. This is
one area that was very complex and one that we really had to put a lot more time on.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Okay. Well, I appreciate the color. Thank you very much.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Next question?
Operator
Moving on, we'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Sure. Just to follow up on Josh's question on International Commercial. So if it's two points
of unusual large losses total, that would be – if my math is right, that would be like 10 points on International
Commercial. If it's two points on International, it'd be five points. Just trying to get an understanding of what – when
you back out these lumpy losses, how did that segment perform and if there's anything outside of those large losses that
were abnormal, can you talk about what those trends were?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I'm going to turn it to Peter and John then, if you would.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Yes, it was close to – Michael, it was close to two points globally, it was 1.8 points globally.
James, do you have the number for the International side? I'm not sure what the number is exactly on the International
side.
<A - James Bracken>: So there was overall a 12 point increase in the accident year loss ratio for International
Consumer – Commercial, sorry. And over half of that impact – or over half of the driver of that change was due to the
severe losses flowing through the P&L in a – to a larger extent than in normal quarters.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay. And then the rest – and the rest of it is just...
<A - James Bracken>: The rest of it is, there's a variety of events that flowed through the P&L this quarter, which I
think that the – if you look at the historic trend in the Q1 and Q2, that would be more indicative of our go-forward run
rate within International Commercial. So we just had a number of unusual things popping up this quarter, the largest
driver of which was these severe losses within International.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay, great. And then, maybe switching gears a little bit. At other operating expenses, it
looks like you had a reversal of an accrual. If you include that, it looks like expenses at the – the other expenses were
up a bit compared to where you were last quarter and over the past couple of quarters. Just trying to get an
understanding, what is that and how should we think about that line relative to the $1 billion in expense reduction that
you've been talking about?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Sure. Let me turn this over to David, who will take you through some of that. But we
are feeling very confident in the direction of 2015, our aspirational goals. But you're going to see some ups and down in
any given quarter. But David?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes. Thanks, Bob. With respect to the guidepost that we had set out in terms of what the –
from quarter-to-quarter, the general range of $200 million to $250 million of operating expenses at the holding
company that are not allocated out to the OpCos, I think that's still a reasonable set of guideposts. This particular
quarter, there were a number of what I'll call infrastructure and transformation activities going on across the parent, the
corporate center, including things like our data center, consolidation, et cetera, and it's investments like that that help us
deal effectively with catastrophes like the one we've just incurred. Over time, I would expect, Michael, for the
corporate expense not to – a glide path down towards the low end of that range, and then certainly below that, as the $1

billion expense target is realized over the period up to 2015.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. And then last one, just U.S. Commercial, clearly, the underlying loss ratio has
improved. If my model is right, this is the lowest underlying loss ratio we've seen at U.S. Commercial since the back
half of 2010. Can you talk about how that is occurring, what actions you're taking and where do you expect that to get
to, in order to reach your overall goals by 2015 and [indiscernible] (46:16)?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: John, do you want to pick that up?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Sure. We've talked about the various levers, right, being mix of business, tools, claim initiatives
and expenses, as David just covered and Peter talked about in his prepared remarks. Expenses are on the come, if you
will. But we've made a lot of progress in terms of the mix of business. You've seen pretty aggressive action we've
taken. In fact, in the presentation, there's a breakdown of U.S. Casualty and the aggressive actions we've taken there.
We've, obviously, have been pressing on the rate side and I would say that the rate environment continues to improve.
That flows through more quickly, obviously, in our Property results. We've not been aggressive about changing current
accident year loss fix. We're in a process – a bridging exercise with Charlie as we look about our lost fix as we go
forward, but – and we expect continued current accident year improvement in various lines – really, in all lines in the
United States.
On the underwriting tool side, with our science team and our underwriting resources, we've made some really exciting
progress on some risk selection models that we're excited about as well. And then lastly, I would say, we're about
halfway through a multi-year program on the Claim side, and we've seen some improvement in the United States, and
we've got, actually, some exciting results we've seen in Europe, as Eric Martinez and his team are executing on our
Global Claims initiative. So we expect to see continued current accident year improvement in the U.S. Commercial loss
ratios.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Moving on, we'll take our next question from Brian Meredith, UBS.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yeah, good morning. I was wondering, could you give us some perspective just – I know
it's quite early – on potential exposures here to Hurricane Sandy? How should we think about it with respect to AIG's
exposure? And then maybe as a part of that, is it possible to get what your retention is on your domestic property cat
reinsurance program?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I'll let John answer the second part. And then, as far as color, Peter, you might want to
add to it – not that there's much to add. We're just going through this on a claim-by-claim basis. We're working with
clients right now, and it's hard for me to give you a scope of it, because some of the flooding and water damage that
was done, especially in the New York area, in Manhattan, so. But I can only say that we don't see this as being any kind
of a huge issue for us financially, other than just dealing with the issues at hand. So I don't know that I could give you
any more color at this point, but let me turn it over to Peter.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes. I think that usually, we get about 80% of our claims notices within about 90 days. So
we're obviously at the very beginning of that whole process. And I think, to comment beyond the fact that the property
damage comes in quicker than the business interruption, and that we're looking at a broad range of Commercial
properties across sectors in the affected areas. It's a big, broad area and we're getting new information every day. So it's
just way too early to comment intelligently about it. So we'd rather not.
But on the retention policies and, more generally, our approach to deductibles and flood sub-limits, we've made
changes over the last three years, which we think helped us with Isaac last year and will also help us here, relative to
the exposures we've had previously. And we've made some pretty major changes in our global reinsurance strategy in
terms of risk appetite internationally. And so, John, maybe you want to just elaborate on the retention?

<A - John Q. Doyle>: Well, I don't think we've disclosed where our cat reinsurance attaches. But non-cat, we're in the
middle and there's been some press about our non-cat per risk, if you will, reinsurance program. And as Peter said,
really a by-product of our new global view. Previously, we had structured reinsurance around legal entities around the
world and a regional view. And so we're taking a more consistent risk appetite around the world. So it's an opportunity
for us, primarily on the Property side to, again, take more risk back net. Simultaneously though, we have actually just
commenced a deal on the Excess Casualty side in the U.S. to actually seed out some of our U.S. Excess Casualty
business. So we've got a global restructuring, if you will, of our overall reinsurance program. Pretty significant
changes, but again, to drive a more consistent risk appetite and shift the mix of business to a better balance, really,
around the world.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Great. And Bob, just quickly, you mentioned M&A as a possible use of capital here. I'm
just curious, what areas would be intriguing to you?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Anything that enhances what we already have, anywhere in the world, so it's hard to
say. I could give you some names, but I'm not sure that that would be a good idea.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Thank you.
Operator
Moving on, we'll take our next question from Lee Cooperman from Omega Advisors.
<Q - Leon G. Cooperman>: Thank you. I appreciate this call, particularly given the conditions we're all operating
under. All of us own the stock for a bunch of reasons, one of which is we see a big book value and we expect that the
company to achieve a reasonable return on that book over time. So my first question is, what do you guys think is a
reasonable return given the regulatory environment that now exists post-2008, and what's a reasonable time period for
that return to be achieved? And secondly, if you had to hazard a guess about 2013, is 2013 going to be a year with cash
dividends or additional significant buybacks, if you had to guess? Thank you very much.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: One is, I think we're absolutely on target from everything we feel right now to the 2015
getting to an ROE of north of 10%. So we feel that that's achievable. We have a lot of wood to chop to get there and a
lot of things we're building today, and that's the investments of infrastructure and so on that we're building within AIG.
So we feel that that's still attainable. There are still questions about what would be the capital required over time.
There's a bias in the regulatory environment to want to put more and more capital restrictions on financial services
companies. But I think that, sooner or later, people are going to realize that you could just go too far with all of that.
But from what we know and see, we still think it's realistic to shoot for north of – 10% or north.
And as far as 2013, we are working very closely with the Federal Reserve. We feel we're in excellent shape. We've run
what we believe to be our understanding of a CCAR and so we're looking at binding constraints. And if I were to think
about 2013, we're focused on the coverage ratio, which is important, because our credit ratings are important because
we want to show not only stable, but positive or even an uptick is important because we make guarantees and our
companies look forward to having strong guarantees behind AIG. They stuck with us during the crisis, but we want to
give them better assurances going forward.
And I would think that a dividend on the stock probably would be something that if, in fact, we're able to do that, I
would see that as something we'd like to do in 2013, if our capital position is strong enough that we can do that. And
we won't know that until the Fed has more time to review where we are.
<Q - Leon G. Cooperman>: Thank you and all the best.

We'll take our next question from Adam Klauber from William Blair.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks, good morning. You've done a lot of work in the last two years on the U.S. Commercial
P&C segment. As we go into next year, I guess two questions. One, do you think that business still needs more rate?
And two, do you think you'll start growing that business?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Let me turn it over to Peter, and then you and John can work that through.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Adam, the second part of that question was – I'm sorry?
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Do you think you'll start growing that business going forward?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Okay. So there are – obviously, we have a broad range of products in the U.S. Commercial
space and so – all not created equal. We've highlighted how we've reduced our overall exposure to U.S. Casualty. So
broadly, I think the greatest rate need, if you think about it on a major line basis, we think is in the Casualty space. Our
Property book in the U.S., our specialty lines, including financial lines, are performing better on a risk-adjusted basis
than our view of the U.S. Casualty market. Obviously, the interest rate environment there creates more pressure on that
segment of the book than other segments. So, in terms of rate need, I would say it's there. That's where we're getting the
largest rate improvement at the moment. And it's where we have a lot of our science resources focused on improving
our risk selection. So, I mentioned earlier that we do expect current accident year improvement in those lines of
business.
So, in terms of growth, we have modest mid single-digit growth for Commercial overall, planned during the – now
through 2015 performance period. We'll see more aggressive growth outside of the U.S., but we do expect some low
single-digit growth in our U.S. portfolio over the next couple of years.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Great, that's very helpful.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Next question?
<A - Elizabeth A. Werner>: I think we only have time for one more but operator, could you send us one more
question?
Operator
Certainly. We'll take our final question then from Mark Finkelstein from Evercore Partners.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Good morning. I wanted to go back to the coverage ratio calculations. I think you
mentioned that the intent is to get to two turns of improvement over the next 12 to 18 months. I guess that's a little bit
faster than I would have expected, and maybe a little bit more dramatic than I would have expected. I think that kind of
– if my numbers are right – would probably put you at about five times coverage, correct me if I'm wrong on that. But I
guess, can you just clarify that that's the correct interpretation of what the aim is? And then, when I look at the
maturities, obviously, you have some hybrids that are coming or callable. Maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the
strategy of getting there, if that is the, in fact, objective?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: David, do you want to pick that up?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes. Thanks, Bob. I'll start and then I'll ask Brian to elaborate a little bit further. Again, one
times to two times, closer to two times, but somewhere in the one times to two times coverage improvement is what
we're aiming at and, again, the exact calculation that each of the agencies performs is not precisely the same, so there's
not a simple formula to plug into. But it's – your – I think you're generally – you've got it about right. We think it's
around – existing as around four times, or a little less than four times. But, again, it just depends on the particular
agency.
And again, I think the – it's a combination of the two levers. One is on interest expense, certainly, and, again, that the
monetization of our non-core assets and further capital generation at the – both at the Insurance companies, which gives

us the deployable capital up at the holding company, and Brian can talk a little bit more about that, in terms of what our
plans and expectations are along those lines. But I think those are the two levers. It really gets back to improving the
operating earnings. And you've heard from Peter and Jay on their core businesses and the trajectory that they're on. And
then a focus on selected and targeted debt reduction and interest reduction. Brian, you want to jump in here?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Thanks, David. No, I think you've nailed all the salient points, it will be a combination of
interest expense reduction as well as improvement in operating earnings, and we – as you noted, we do have some
bonds that are callable that I think make a lot of sense for us to go after. And when you think about our flexibility on an
ongoing basis to go after this, as we've said in the past, we expect $4 billion to $5 billion of subsidiary dividends
coming up to parent every year. This year, we're already ahead of $5 billion as of today, and expect a bit more in the
fourth quarter. You take out the parent expenses in interest, and you're in a situation where we're going to have around
$2 billion a year, give or take a little for things like Liability Management and dealing with opportunistically reducing
our outstanding expensive debt. And that excludes the additional excess capital that will be generated from sales of
non-core assets, as well as capital freed up over time from the DIB.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. Maybe just one quick question on the DIB. I guess I've been a little surprised at
how strong the DIB earnings have been over the last few quarters. I think Brian, you talked about this concept of
pulling to intrinsic quite a bit on the last quarter call. I'm just curious if you have a view on a comparison of where the
assets are currently marked, versus your own view of what that intrinsic value is.
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: What we said in the past, and where we still feel pretty strongly about, is that there is
probably close to $5 billion, $4 billion to $5 billion I think we said in the past, of pull to intrinsic over the life of the
portfolio. And what you're seeing now, in a quarter like this, is, again, the combination of net investment income as
well as the CVA, or the impact of spread tightening, on the assets, slightly offset by our own spread tightening.
Because most of the assets and liabilities in the DIB, or a substantial portion of which, have been swapped, really what
you're going to see coming through the P&L, at what we think about pull to intrinsic, is effectively CVA. And it will
not be consistent over time. It's going to be – it's all market-driven, but we still feel pretty strongly about – what we've
indicated in the past is what the potential of this portfolio is.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. Thank you.
Robert H. Benmosche
Okay. I thank you all for – I think – any other issues, please let us know. Talk to Liz. But I thank you all, and good luck
for those of you in the New York area. We've got a lot of work to just get back to normal. So I thank you all very much
this morning.
Operator
Thank you. That will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.
