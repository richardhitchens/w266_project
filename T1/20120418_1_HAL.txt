Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2012 Earning Release Conference. At this
time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be
given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly Youngblood Senior Director, Investor Relations.
Please begin.
Kelly Youngblood, Senior Director Investor Relations
Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton's first quarter 2012 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a
replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Press release announcing the first quarter results is
available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum CFO and Tim Probert
President Strategy Corporate Development.
I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting
Halliburton's view about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and
uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our
forward-looking statements.
These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and recent current reports
on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures as included in the press release announcing the first quarter results which as I have
mentioned can be found on our website.

During the quarter we recorded a $300 million charge which amounts to $190 million after tax or $0.20 per diluted
share for estimated loss contingencies related to the Macondo well incident. In our discussion today we will be
excluding the impact of this charge on our financial results. As always we will welcome questions after we complete
our prepared remarks. Dave?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you Kelly and good morning to everyone. I'm very pleased to report the following results that were achieved in
the first quarter.
Total revenue of $6.9 billion and operating income of 1.3 billion represents growth over the first quarter of 2011 up
30% and 63% respectively which I believe demonstrates how well we have executed against our targeted investment
strategies. These are very strong results especially considering the industry disruptions in North America related to rig
movements and the harsh whether we experienced in the eastern hemisphere in Q1.
Despite these challenges, we achieved record revenue during the first quarter in our North America region. Globally
both our cementingand Baroid product lines achieved record revenues in the first quarter, with -- also setting a record
for operating income.
Looking at the North America results for the first quarter our revenue grew sequentially by 1%, compared to U.S. rig
count decline of 1%. Now, while 1% seems small it's actually the net impact of a significant rig shift that is taking
place in the U.S. between natural gas and oil. And operating income was down sequentially by 5% driven by the
inefficiencies associated with equipment relocation, cost inflation and certain pricing pressures in certain basins.
Last quarter we spoke in detail about the disruptions resulting from rig movements between basins. Depressed natural
gas prices have accelerated the shift from natural gas to oil plays during the quarter. In the U.S. the natural gas rig
count declined 151 rigs or 19% just since the beginning of the year and that's slightly outpaced the oil directed rig count
increase of an 125 rigs or 10% over the same period. So while the total rig can only declined 1%, the shift from natural
gas to oil was dramatic and disruptive to operations.
In our fourth quarter call we talked about eight frac fleets moving from primarily natural gas plays to liquids plays. We
now have an additional five fleets that have moved or are in the process of moving this quarter. Due to the stability of
oil prices, oils and liquids-rich plays are generating high returns for our customers. This shift is very positive for us as
completing these wells requires higher levels of service intensity due to the advanced fluid and completion technology,
which creates an additional opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves from our competition.
While these moves are beneficial to us in long run they do not come without a short-term impact on our margins. With
spot natural gas prices down approximately 50% from this time last year, due to the resiliency of natural gas production
and a very mild winter, so at the current prices we expect to see further declines in the natural gas rig count until we
begin to see a meaningful decrease in production level. Over time we believe any future weakness in natural gas rig
count will be offset by an increased in oil and liquids-rich activity resulting in an overall yearly percentage increase in
the U.S. rig count in the mid single digit.
Also on our last call we provided our outlook for North America margins for the first quarter. Our revenue was strong
this quarter due to better than expected activity levels, but our margins were just below our expectations given that the
drop off the natural gas rig count was more pronounced than we anticipated. Continued significant cost inflation also
negatively impacted our margins.
As a reminder, there is often a delay between vendor price increases and when we are able to pass these increases to
our customers. In the natural gas basins in particular, this is becoming more difficult and we are working with our
vendors for price relief. However, this will take time and may continue to impact margins throughout the remainder of
2012.

As we renew contracts and win new work, we expect to see frac pricing become more challenging, but the impact will
vary by basin. The dry natural gas basins will be the most challenged followed by those more easily accessible oily
basins that are located close to natural gas basins such as the Eagle Ford. We expect pricing pressure in some of these
markets in a near-term. But believe that these pressures will decline over the remainder of the year. On the other hand,
or other product service lines continue to have relatively stable pricing.
I would like to review some of the key differentiators that I believe make us unique and should continue to enable us to
outperform our competition in North America. First, I want to recognize our supply chain organization, whose efforts
over the past few years have positioned us well for the current industry challenges.
In the 2009 downturn, when the many of peers halted new investment, we recognized the structural changes that we're
incurring in the North American market. We continued to manufacture new equipment, build logistical infrastructure
and develop strong relationships with key suppliers and locking and critical supply agreements. In some cases, we
actually provided funding to assist our suppliers with their own internal expansion needs, so they could meet our supply
requirements.
Our leading market position and long-term commitment to North America has helped us secure supplies for key
commodities in a very tight market, which has enabled us to minimize supply and logistical disruptions to our
customers.
The shift of rigs from natural gas to oil has amplified supply chain issues for the industry. We recognized that we are
not immune to these challenges. However, we believe our supply chain organization gives us a distinct advantage that
should allow us to effectively outperform our competition for 2012.
To make our logistics process more efficient we have been constructing transloading facilities in key basin that transfer
materials directly from rail cars to truck or storage. This reduces our overall transportation merge cost and improves
our efficiencies and allows us to better serve our customers.
We strongly believe we will continue to be able to provide our customers with the guar and other materials they require
to be successful as they expand in their activities toward. I do not believe that many of our competitors can make this
statement.
In particular guar which is a thickening agent used in certain fracturing treatment is expected to be in scarce supply this
year. And although we believe we have secured enough supply for our customers there have been significant cost
increases in guar which are negatively impacting our margins.
We are currently working to recover this increased guar cost from our customers. To give you some idea of the
magnitude of this increase the guar jell system cost alone can now represent more than 30% of the total frac price to our
customer in certain basins. Additionally we expect to see some vendor price relief in the second half of the year on our
cost.
Also customer relationships and mix are very important differentiators. Over the past few years, we have carefully
aligned ourselves with operators that are running large scale operations and whose focus is on reliability and value and
not just price. We believe we are successfully proven that our superior service quality, reliability and efficiency make
us the preferred service company.
Price competition today is most pronounced in the transactional market which we have and will continue to generally
avoid. We acknowledge that we are not immune to pricing pressures either but as contracts renew, we believe we will
continue to get superior margins due to our customer mix. In addition, a high percentage of cruise our provide 24/7
operations. This is a win-win scenario for us and our customers.
Our customers recognize our ability to provide them with a manufacturing type efficiency model which ultimately
reduces the overall completion cost. This generally enables us to obtain superior margins compared to our peers. Due
this efficiency and incremental capacity, we are now able to provide services to customers that we could not get to in
the past. And I believe we'll actually result in a market share increase without us having to discount price on a relative
basis.

And lastly we continue to expand our capabilities and drive efficiency through technology and redesign of our
operations. Our frac-of-the-future initiative is a perfect example of how we are staying one step ahead of the
competition. We have just rolled out our first series of Q10 pumps which we believe are the most efficient and lowest
maintenance pumps in the industry. We are also deploying Smartphone technology to automate many of the tests that
now performed manually in the industry today which we believe will improve efficiency, reduce our operating cost and
reduce working capital requirements.
We are also working to optimize crew size, to centralize functions to be more cost efficient. As we have highlighted in
the past and will continue to highlight these and other strategic costs have an immediate negative impact on our
earnings. However they are future investments in continuing to differentiate ourselves in the market.
Turning to the Gulf of Mexico, we remain optimistic about the recovery of activity and believe that margins will
continue to increase as our customers adapt to new regulations and industry efficiency improves. The increase in permit
approval should lead to additional deepwater rigs arriving throughout 2012. Our first quarter margins in the Gulf were
lower than the prior quarter due to a different mix between drilling and completion related revenue activities, mainly
driven by customer delays of certain completions, an area where we hold the highest market share.
We are very optimistic about the future work we see in the Gulf and we have secured additional directional drilling,
drilling fluids, wireline and completion work on a number of new deepwater rigs coming into the Gulf and some of the
rigs that are going back to work in the next few quarters.
So to summarize North America we believe increased activity of our customers, due to the strong liquids prices, access
to capital and increase in service intensity are supportive of the healthy market for us in 2012. However, we expect
continued short-term inefficiencies and therefore downward pressure on margins in the near term due to the shift in our
equipment, commodity price mix and pricing pressure and the spring breakup in Canada. We currently expect these
trends -- disruptions to decrease in the second half of 2012.
Also to be noted I believe the growing scope of our Canadian business is under estimated due to the size of our U.S.
business. I am pleased to say that Canada is expected to deliver a $1 billion revenue stream for us this year and is a
good contributor to our North American profitability. Therefore we expect to be impacted b the spring breakup in this
year's second quarter in Canada more than we have been in the past. So although 2012 will be challenging for North
America, I believe it will be just another opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves from our peers and continue to
drive our strategy of superior growth, margins and returns.
Now turning to our international results. They were basically in line with our previously stated expectations. We are
very optimistic about our Latin America business this year. Latin America posted solid results for the first quarter
taking into consideration the typical first quarter impact of lower consulting and software sales as compared to the
fourth quarter.
We continue to see shale development opportunities evolving, and we are excited about leveraging our expertise in
unconventional resources to help our customers unlock the potential of these plays. We delivered great production
results and on Rondolino our field lab in Mexico and Tim will cover that in a few minutes. Based on tender prices that
we have seen, we also believe that we are well-positioned to win significant incremental work on the recent bids for
Brazil in wireline, directional drilling and testing.
As a result, we expect to incur a mobilization cost in the second half of 2012 that will temporarily impact Latin
American profitability. Brazil was the largest contributor to our operating income increase over that first quarter of
2012 in Latin America, and we expected it to continue to grow rapidly. Our strategy in the Eastern Hemisphere is also
playing out as expected, as is evident by our revenue growth in excess of the rig count growth.
Eastern Hemisphere revenue was up 14% from the first quarter of 2011. We continue to make progress in markets that
have been negatively impacting our results and are optimistic about activity levels expanding into the second half of
2012. For instance, in East Africa, we continue to see activity levels increase. While start up costs had a negative
impact on margins in 2011, we are now seeing our deep water investment strategy begin to payoff in this important

growth market.
We also took action in the last few quarters to improve our profitability and our operations in the UK. Our efforts are
now paying off there. Despite weather related seasonality, we saw stronger operational results and are now generating
healthy margins in that market.
In Iraq, we continue to run five rigs and expect to add additional rigs and work over rigs in 2012 enabling us to improve
our profitability as activity levels increase. Overall, we remained enthusiastic about the future of our Iraq operations
and are pleased to be getting the past issues behind us.
And Libya's production is also coming back online. However we are still awaiting well defined operational plans from
our customers. We do not expect to approach pre-2011 activity levels in Libya until late 2012 to 2013. so our view of
international markets has not changed at all. We anticipate international pricing will continue to remain competitive,
particular in regard to larger projects being tendered.
We continue to expect our margin improvement through 2012 as new projects ramp up, we introduce new technology
and continue to improve our results in those markets where we have made strategic investments and secured key wins
over the past few years.
To give you more granularity on the financial results I turn it over to Mark.
Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dave. And good morning everyone.
Our revenue in the first quarter was $6.9 billion, down 3% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Total operating income
for the first quarter was $1.3 billion, down 7% sequentially. North America revenue grew 1% while operating income
declined 5% compared to the previous quarter. As Dave mentioned inefficiencies associated with equipment
re-locations, continuing cost inflation and pricing pressures in certain basins impacted our margins during the first
quarter.
We expect disruptions related to rig movements to impact us in the near term and perhaps with the exception of war we
anticipate some relief from suppliers in the second half of the year related to high cost of process and other materials.
Due to these challenges and the negative impact of the seasonal Canadian spring break up we expect to see lower
revenues and margins dropping by 200 to 250 basis points in the second quarter.
We also now anticipate margins could drift towards the low 20 range by the end of 2012. The market is understandably
very dynamic right now. These margin expectations depend on, among other things our success in recovering
inflationary cost increases from our customers, and how soon the natural gas rig count level off. We should have a
better feel for this after the second quarter.
Internationally revenue and operating income declined comparative to the previous quarter driven by the traditional
seasonal reduction of our international business. In the first quarter we also usually see weather related weakness in the
North Sea and Eurasia and this year was no different. As we look ahead we anticipate our Eastern hemisphere margins
will reach the mid upper teens in the second half of 2012 and average in the mid teens for the full year.
Now looking at our first quarter results sequentially by division completion and production revenue declined $38
million or 1% primarily due to seasonally lower completion tool sales in first quarter weather disruptions in the North
Sea, Eurasia and Australia. Completion and production operating income declined 5% primarily due to North America
inefficiencies associated with the equipment relocations and other factors that Dave mentioned earlier.
Looking in completion and production on a geographic basis North America revenue increased by 1% driven by
increased activity in the U.S. oil and liquid rich basins in Canada. This was partially offset by activity decreases in the
U.S. Dry Gas basins and the Gulf of Mexico. Operating income declined 7% due to equipment relocations, cost
inflation and stimulation pricing.

Latin America completion and production posted a 2% sequentially decrease in revenue due to reduced cementing
activities in Columbia and Mexico and lower completion tool sales in Brazil and Trinidad.
Operating income grew by 8% as a result of increased Boots & Coots activity in Mexico and Venezuela. In
Europe/Africa/CIS completion and production revenue decreased 8% primarily related to lower activity in the North
Sea and Eurasia due to the normal first quarter seasonal weather impact.
Operating income increased 30%. due to increased Boots & Coots profitability throughout almost all of Africa along
with higher cementing activity in Mozambique. Also contributing to the profit increase was higher production
enhancement in cementing activity in Libya along with the collection of some of the receivables that were written off
there in early 2011. This was partially offset by seasonally lower activity in the North Sea in Russia and lower
cementing and production enhancement profitability in Angola.
In Middle East/Asia completion and production revenue decreased by 7% primarily due to seasonally lower completion
tool sales across the region and seasonal weather issues in Australia. Operating income increased 2% due to increased
cementing and production enhancement activity in -- an additional Boots & Coots activity in Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
Thailand and Indonesia.
In our drilling and evaluation division revenue and operating income decreased primarily due to seasonally lower
software and direct product sales in the first quarter as well as seasonal weather disruptions in the North Sea, Eurasia
and Australia. In North America, drilling and evaluations revenue and operating income were up 2% and 7%
respectively due to higher activity in drill influence, directional drilling and increased drill bit sales in U.S. land as well
as higher wireline activity in Canada.
These increases were partially offset by lower software sales and decreased drilling activity in the Mexico Gulf of
Mexico due to scheduling delays that we expect make up next quarter. Drilling and evaluations Latin American
revenue and operating income decreased primarily due to seasonally lower software sales and a normal first quarter
delay in obtaining contract approvals for consulting services and software sales in Mexico, as well as lower directional
drilling activity in the first quarter in Mexico.
In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, drilling and evaluation revenue and operating income were down due to the
seasonally lower software sales, seasonal weather impacts in the North Sea in Asia and lower drilling activity and
Algeria and Angola. This decrease was partially offset by increased drilling activity in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Drilling and evaluations Middle-East Asia revenue and operating income decreased due primarily to lower first quarter
product sales in Asia that were partially offset by increased drilling activity in Saudi Arabia and higher project
management activity in Iraq.
Our results for the first quarter reflect a $300 million accrual in corporate and other expense for estimated loss
contingencies related to Macondo. At a request of the court, in late February we participated in series of discussions
with the magistrate judge relating to whether the multi-district litigation or MDL to be settled. Although those
discussions did not result in a settlement. We have accrued $300 million reflecting our current estimate of loss
contingencies that are probable relating to the MDL.
Our decision to take an accrual now and the amount that we have recognized are based on our assessment. But all other
factors and circumstances were regarding the litigation at this point in time. Although we continue to believe that we
have substantial legal arguments and defenses against any liability, and that VP is required to indemnify us for any
losses we may ultimately incur.
We've determined that we could no longer conclude that a probable loss associated with the MDL was zero. There are
other contingencies related to Macondo well incident that are reasonably possibly and for which a reasonable estimate
cannot currently be made. We're constantly monitoring and evaluating developments relating to MDL and the other
related law suites and investigations. And it's possible that we may adjust our estimate of these loss contingencies in the
future as new information becomes known.

Apart from Macondo related charge, our corporate another expenses came in lower than expected in the first quarter
due in large parts of the timing of expenses related to our continued investment in our initiative to reinvent our service
delivery platform in North America and to reposition our supply chain, manufacturing and technology infrastructure to
better support our projected international growth.
The expense related to these initiatives during the quarter totaled approximately $23 million, which was slightly less
then we expected. However the activities behind the costs are on schedule and we continue to ramp up through 2012.
We would anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximate $0.02 to $0.03 per share after tax in the
second quarter. In total we anticipate the corporate expenses will range between $110 million and $115 million for
quarter for the remainder of 2012, which for the total year is inline with our previous guidance.
We anticipate that our CapEx for the year will still be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion, though we have decided
to defer some of the North America pressure pumping equipment deliveries in to 2013, that were originally planned for
2012. In addition, more capital will be allocated to international projects that we recently secured or expect to win in
the next couple of quarters. We are also allocating a significant amount of capital for infrastructure needs to ramp the
growth and in support of growth of our recent acquisitions.
And finally our effective tax rate was 32.3% for the first quarter but the average rate was helped by the higher U.S. tax
rate that was applied in Macondo-related charge. We currently expect the full year 2010 effective tax rate will be
approximately 33% to 34%, inline with the normalized rate we saw in the first quarter. Tim?
Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development
Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone.
As Dave outlined on the call we've been very consistent in our outlook for our international markets, where we
continue to expect gradual activity improvement based on meaningful increments in customer spending patterns and
corresponding new rig arrivals. Growth drivers for us in the international markets revolve around the execution of our
strategy in deepwater, mature assets and unconventionals.
In deepwater we continue to be pleased with our positioning. And globally the deepwater services market is expected to
grow by approximately 20% a year through 2015 with exploration spending growing 4% annually and developments
growing by 35% annually. And as this shift gets underway we feel that Halliburton is well positioned to participate in
all established and emerging markets. In East Africa for example there are now five deepwater rigs running, compared
to just one this time last year. And our now bases in Mozambique and Tanzania are now well established as a platform
for long term development there. Establishing a stronger position in deep water for our wireline and testing services has
been a priority for us, both in terms of technology developments and market positioning.
In addition to wins in East Africa, the logging package fee win for Petrobras in Brazil is a positive indication of our
credibility in this market. We also believe as Dave mentioned, we are well-positioned for the deep water drilling and
testing tenders in Brazil.
In mature assets, our customers continue to look for assistance in evaluating, planning and executing redevelopment
programs. In Mexico for example, our customer Pemex took a thoughtful approach to redevelopment in counter packs.
Our Remolino generated an improved understanding of the subsurface and combined with new technology applications
and joint teamwork is delivering outstanding results.
The PA-1565 drill had an initial production of about 3,800 barrels a day and delivered cumulative production
equivalent to over 20 average wells in the region. This is a model which is being applied in other mature assets in Latin
America, Africa, the Middle-East and Asia. And one which we expect to have a positive business impact in latter half
of this year and into 2013.
Halliburton's EquiFlow autonomous inflow control device is a key technology to facilitate material asset development
and has been introduced in several wells in Latin America and Middle-East. It's 2012 offshore technology conference

spot light on new technology award winner and is simple reliable device developed to address problems of unwanted
water or gas production and so is the problems of inefficiency in current inflow device designs.
International unconventional development continues to provide increasing levels of encouragement to us. Halliburton
has active frac spreads in Poland, Argentina, Mexico, Australia, Saudi and elsewhere, which is allowing us to build a
requisite basin and subsurface expertise necessary for successful execution, and is building a strong foundation in the
future growth.
We're also pleased with a recently signed a framework agreement between PETRONAS, Carigali and Halliburton for
the evaluation and development of global shale resources. This collaboration is expected to leverage our technology
and expertise to enable PETRONAS quickly gain experience in shale development. We plan to work with them to
setup a Shale Technical Centre of Excellence in Kuala Lumpur. Dave?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Thanks, Tim. Let me just quickly summarize and then we'll go to questions. We're proud of the results that we
delivered in the first quarter with double-digit percentage growth in the first quarter of 2011 in all geographies and
most product lines. In North America the impact of inefficiencies from rigs moving from natural gas to oily basins, the
pricing pressure and cost inflation will impact our profitability in 2012. We plan to mitigate these impacts to continue
to focus on execution, efficient supply chain management and cost recovery from our customers.
We remain very optimistic about our Latin America business and believe recent operational success and contract wins
position us well for the future. And we continue to be optimistic about Eastern hemisphere, where we expect our
margins will continue to improve throughout the remainder of 2012.
So let's open it up for that questions.
Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions].Our first question from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Anderson
Well, I'm sure you get a lot of questions about our pressure pumping pricing. So I guess my angle on this is I am
curious about where spot prices are now relative to the pricing on your exciting term contracts. Just wondering are spot
prices now inline with term, and how would you expect those contracts to get re-priced. I mean would it be a material
change, down 10%? And I guess as a follow-up to that, are you starting to see E&Ps sign up any term contracts now or
is it too early?
Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development
Okay, this is Tim. We have still 80% to 85% long term contracts. And so our exposure to the stock market is really
quite limited. And clearly there is as Dave pointed out a more aggressive stance in those stock markets but it's one
which this company is not exposed to that much.

Let me also -- Dave, this is Mark. I'll also add it definitely varies by spot, basin and terms of that. We are still signing
up term contracts. We have customers in certain of the liquids basins that are only re-signing up for term contracts, that
are extending the contracts that they have, and are still continuing to be at fairly good prices.
David Anderson
But are they lower than they were before, I guess is my question and how much lower, is it kind of 10%, is it material?
Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
In some of the oil basins the answer is no, they are not lower.
David Anderson
And I would assume the Eagle Ford is probably the most vulnerable at above those?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I mean, clearly it's proximately to the Haynesville makes it a much more vulnerable basin.
David Anderson
Okay. And as already questioned you term on your CapEx, looks like you are trying to spend less, but Mark or
somebody just kind of reiterated your $3.5 billion to $4 billion. Just wondering if the North America market doesn't
show any signs of tightening you are saying you think your second half looks little bit better. But if that doesn't happen
would you expect spending -- to cut spending and maybe be below that range and now you got Macondo just on the
rear-view mirror just wondering what the thoughts are? I mean is there a potential for a buyback here or the consumer
stock is trading now if you cut CapEx or maybe buyback here 32 bucks here?
Corporate Participant
Let me take the questions in order. I think with regard to CapEx, I still feel very confident that we are going to spend in
that range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. What I was trying to reiterate that even though we may be slowing down some
of the equipment deliveries in North America, there is still quite a bit of infrastructure that we are building out related
to our facilities, the transloading facilities from sand and other activities here in the U.S., as well as we are winning
quite a bit of international tenders that are requiring incremental capital to what we had built into our original plan.
And so there is a shift of CapEx fairly immediately for mobilization and due some additional international work that we
are pretty excited about. So in total, I don't see a big shift and it's difficult for me to see based on the outlook right now
that we would step down meaning from the CapEx number.
Now towards your second question, we've accrued something on Macondo. It's one of those that based on our valuation
of balance credit transferred through the course of the quarter, we felt the need to do that under U.S. GAAP. However,
I'd say that we are a long way from having Macondo behind us. But right now, we are still in litigation mode. There is
still a fairly uncertain calendar as to when events around Macondo will take place. And so until such time as Macondo
has dealt with it, in its entirety, I think it's going to be difficult for us to strategize on what are the kind of corporate and
initiatives we might do with regard to any excess cash that we might have.

Our next question comes from James West Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
James West
Hey, good morning gentlemen. First Mark, a quick question for you on North American margins, so we got another
decline in the second quarter of 200, 250 basis points, and then you alluded to margins perhaps dropping in the low
20% range I think in the second half, correct me if I am wrong on that?
Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, sort of the trend toward to the end of the year as well I am alluding to.
James West
Okay. So would that represent the bottom given what you see currently in North America? I mean some of that just a
mismatch between your vendors and some of the pricing declines some pressure pumping. And then is this, are you
backing off earlier statements that you guys have made that normalized margins would be more or like in the mid 20 or
is that still achievable after we kind of shake out 2012?
Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, to the first question that you asked, I think based on what we can see today, yes that low 20s feels like that's the
bottom. But again as I mentioned, there is still a lot of movement out there, it's a very dynamic market and so we'll
continue to try to just as we see.
I think towards your second question, our comments last quarter about normalizing in the mid 20s related really to our
outlook for the year of 2012, it's difficult at this juncture given the dramatic decrease in the gas rig count and the
current outlook for gas to say that we would normalize at that point there, I mean that's what I am -- we're kind of
coming out of that earlier guidance at least with regard to 2012. I am not going to try to crystal ball where we see things
going in 2013.
But I do think structurally in our business, when you look long-term through the cycles themselves that mid 20s range
is essentially where our business tends to operate and we are driving initiatives inside the company to reduce our cost
structure in the way that can give us a buying chance even if the market begins to flatten now towards the end of the
year that we can find our way back to those in mid-20s range, if we execute well against our cost initiatives.
James West
Okay. That's very helpful. And just one question on the international side of the business. Is there a real spare capacity
internationally right now? And if not, what point do you think would you start to see real pricing traction or would just
kind of let the offshore drillers -- of one year?

Corporate Participant
James this is -- Just really following on from one the remarks that Mark just made now that the shift of capital for the
international markets. I think that's, if you like the proof point really, if there was significant excess capacity then
wouldn't be needing to move assets to rest of the international markets. So no, I would say that our general view is that
obviously, market-to-market is going to be slightly different, but in general terms, no there is not a significant overhang
of assets in the international markets today.
James West
Okay. Great. Thank guys.

Our next question comes from Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Waqar Syed
Yeah. My question relates also to deepwater. You had mentioned a target of growing at a rate above market growth in
deepwater. I just want to see as we stand today where you are versus that growth plan and where do you see, could be a
year from now?
Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development
This is Tim again. Obviously we selected deepwater as an important growth market for us in which to invest because of
the significant above market growth rate of the segment itself. And then we set ourselves a target of growing at above
the market growth rate ourselves as a company. So I think point number one is the market is really unfolding as we
hoped it would. It's going to be very strong growth segment.
Secondly we are very pleased with our positioning and I think we are able to support our thesis that we are growing at a
plus to the market rate.
Waqar Syed
Okay. And then in terms of international shale growth, what's your view right now. We have heard some mixed views
out of Poland recently. There have been some upheavals in Argentina recently. What's your current view on that? Are
you seeing positive non international shale development or less could you comment on that?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
So I think we continue to be very encouraged. I think we have always said that the best thing is for us to have interest in
multiple markets. It is not all markets will be successful and we know that. But having a position in all major markets
around the globe allows us to make sure that we are going to participate in those markets that are successful. We
continue to feel very good about shale.
I think that the truth is relative to your question we're probably shifting our emphasis a little there. Argentina doesn't
feel as positive as it probably was six months ago but Saudi Arabia feels a lot more positive then it was six months ago.
So I think we are starting to see if you like, the three key factors of shale, the combination of the geology, the

infrastructure and the pricing and regulatory environment sort of start to come to the fore and those that have all three
in the right measure will be the ones that will move forward the fastest.
Waqar Syed
So beyond Saudi Arabia how would you rank, like Poland and Australia and some other markets?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, certainly Australia is looking extremely positive. China is looking extremely positive and I wouldn't count
Poland out yet. I mean now there is a relatively small number of wells -- primarily vertical wells. I would call the sort
of the frac process there to be very modest in terms of trying to establish what potential productivity would be. So I
think we still have a long way to go yet in that particular market.
Waqar Syed
Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead with your question.
Jim Crandell
Good morning. My first question is in provinces, in fracing where you have seen significant pressure on pricing, is
there any pressure by companies that you have long term contracts in to renegotiate the terms of your contracts at lower
prices even if you have longer term contract and have you done so in any instances?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Jim. This is Dave. Let me answer that one. The answer is in those oily based areas the answer is no. In fact we
have gone generally back in because of -- prices or copper prices to get price increases but we for the most part we
wrote those contracts to be pretty tight. So I suspect that the pressure will come when they start to roll over and we've
got to look at what we can do. But again we're selling efficiencies. We're selling lowest unit cost because of the
efficiency and I think we are having a different kind of conversation with those customers then maybe some of our
competitors would have to have.
Jim Crandell
And that's in oil provinces, Dave in the Haynesville, if a long-term contract customer is asking for a price relief, have
you done so?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, you know what Jim, there is hardly anybody left in the Haynesville but Halliburton. So you can read into that
comment what you will.

Jim Crandell
But, David your comments would be like to any, to all instances of long-term contracts across the country that their --
and you're not lowering prices on any?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
No I thing, are we rolling pricing back on existing contracts, the answer is no. That contracts that have the term left out
on them. Those that are coming up for tender, we are having discussions about where the market pricing or long term
types of contracts are. We are not going to the spot market by any stretch of the imagination.
Jim Crandell
Okay. Dave and my second question. Sources of mine are still saying that on international tenders particularly
information evaluation and particularly in deep water there continues to be fierce competition in pricing. Would you
concur with that or what color what you offer on that statement?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
No. As we said in the prepared remarks, any large tenders, deep water related that have a big formation evaluation
component to them are extraordinarily competitive for a couple of reasons, one they tend to be big dollars and they tend
to be of long duration. And so they are being fiercely fought over. And I would -- I guess I would make an editorial
comment that all of the big players are equally competitive in their pricing. But as Tim indicated, I think we're winning
more than our fair share of them, which is a strategy we would put in front of our shareholders in our Analyst Day a
couple of years ago. That was a key part of our strategy. I think it's paying off in places like East Africa where we did
have to make infrastructure and mobilization investments. But if you look at the margins, we are making there today, I
am very happy with them. And I expect that, that will continue to play out as we get these projects up and going. So
bottom-line is I am very happy with our market penetration in FE and in deepwater and in places where we have not
operated before and then we will continue that strategy.
Jim Crandell
Okay, thank you Dave.

Scott Gruber
I am curious as to how the activity transition in North America is impacting operational up time looking beyond the
mobilization issue. When you look out six months from now will you experience an increase in operational uptime.
You have more operations on 24 hours, or the things will be about the same from here?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah I think, this is Dave again. Again if go back to what we said we are primarily a 24x7 operation, view our frac
position in the U.S. as being more wanting to -- to a manufacturing operation. And absence the dislocation of crews,
which obviously have any impact on up time and down time. We don't move a crew unless we know where it's going,
we know what customer it's working for and we know the price that it's going to work at.
So we don't incur a cost to basic rates pick them up and move them somewhere without knowing what the financial
impact is going to be. I would say that's not true with a lot of our competitions who are being chased out of some of
these basins like the Haynesville, and those crews are going basically looking around for work and that's why the
transactional market pricing is so disruptive today, but as we said that's not a market that we generally play in. So when
we say we're moving a fleet, it's not going looking for work. It's knows where it's going, it's knows who it's working for
and knows the price that it's work at.
Scott Gruber
Got it. And if the 24 hour up time extended in the Permian as well?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
It's just starting to go there and that's actually a great question, because typically the Permian basin has not been a
market where the operators saw the need to have 24 hour operations, but we are actually gone to 24 hour operation with
some of the bigger player out there and have demonstrated to them the efficiency of it. Now that's cause some
disruption with any operators, because they have a change. There were practices, their completion practices, but as it's
gotten more competitor out there they have seen the benefits of it, but even in the market that's traditionally not 24
hours it's starting to basically embrace it.
Scott Gruber
Great, it's very encouraging. Last question on Canada, I appreciate the color in terms of gross CapEx in North America
I assume Canada is going to continue to be a focus as you roll out that position?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
No, absolutely, Scott. We not only there some infrastructure capital that we're deploying there, we are focused on the
extension of the Bakken into Southern Canada there and building out there but also helping our infrastructure around
sand logistics and things like that. We tend to view Canada, I mean even though it's a separate country we tend to view
capital deployed for rolling stock and things like that as a bit fungible between the U.S. and Canada to --. So during
break up often times we move things back and forth to make sure that we maintain very high efficiency levels for those
crews.

Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Bill Herbert
Thanks, good morning. Question on the cost inflation, on the cost inflation, Dave for a couple of quarters here we have
been talking about the late lag here between incurring cost from vendors and being able to pass them through to the
customer and with increasing difficultly I guess in dry gas space. But you of course you seem to foreshadow an ability
to do that. I am curious as to actually with regard to the cost of the raw materials, --, what have you at point do these
headwinds with regard to our margins become tailwind with regard to the raw material itself becoming less expensive
with more supply?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think certainly in -- we have not reached that point and yeah, we clearly are able to, on things like guara, with some
lag get that cost pass through to our customer. The problem with guara it is probably, it's probably the fastest moving
commodity price that I have ever seen. I mean basically, we might get a quote today that's 10% higher than a quote we
would got last week on it. So it is such a dynamic that and we don't like and don't want to go back to our customers,
multiple times and get price increases.
So we try to get it stabilized within a certain area and then go back to a customer and basically put it through as a past
through item, but that is the one, because of the scarcity, at this moment in time and we do believe that it's actually a bit
of a spot price scarcity due to sort of the growing season for guara, which is primarily grown in India.
And when the new crop will become available which should be in the fall and then we see may be some of the scarcity
going away. And also obviously we like the rest of the industry are looking for alternatives to guara and we are having
some customers accept either lower grade guara or alternatives to guara that well maybe not getting the well response
they want. At least they are getting something at a cheaper price.
Bill Herbert
Got you. And do you think -- I mean I know it's just go to sort of foreshadow at this juncture but do you thing it's a
reasonable expectation to expect that, the guara cost in 2013 will probably be less then what they are today?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Based on everything we know right now that's a reasonable expectation.
Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think also the fact of the matter is that Guara substitutes become attractive at a certain Guara price. We are at
that price right now. So Guara substitutes whether or not that's Haliburton's clean stem technology for example which is
certainly a substitute which has been used effectively in a number of basins including Eagle Ford or other substitutes

will become effective and more essentially create some sort of ceiling on the price of Guara.
Bill Herbert
Got you. Second question, I mean everybody I guess, just the -- seems to be focused on what's going wrong as opposed
to what can go right in the category -- all right. With regard to the likely uplift in activity at the -- activity plus a step
change increase in services intensity coupled with the ongoing evolution of the Utica and other plays, how do you think
the industry is positioned today from a capacity standpoint to meet that demand or two or three years down the road?
David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I think a couple of points that I think, number one, clearly the industry has a history of responding to need. I don't
particularly see that as being a primary concern. And so I think that, if you take a look at where we are today as we
outlined, what we are planning on is a modest single-digit increase in activity through the year. Now that's the basis for
the guidance that we provided. And clearly there is a scenario where we had a significantly increased volume of
activity in oil based plays. If that takes place, then clearly we have a much more robust outlook than we currently have.
We provide U.S. scenario based on how that...
Bill Herbert
Got it. And then last one, you touched on this, but I didn't get a sense as to the order of magnitude. Frac of the future
initiatives. One, are they tracking as expected and targeted? And two, when do you expect us to begin to exert a
significant impact with regard to your North America profitability?
Corporate Participant
So there are a number of key elements to frac in the with future. All lines, there are a variety of elements around
reduced personnel, reduced capital deployment, et cetera and improved efficiency. The probably the largest single
element of that is the low led of that of Q10 pump which is now rolling off the line, and we will make that together
with our new blending and storage capacities. And we have a deployment plan which will give us the ability to
compare very effectively between existing fleets and new frac of the future fleets, so we can get a real good handle on
both capital deployment and people deployment.
We will see those roll out during the course of this year Bill. And towards the end of this year, we'll have a very -- start
to see an impact in key basins where they are deployed. Also we offset the back office initiatives, the mobility plans are
all designed to roll out late Q2, up in Q3 which really means that you are going to see the meaningful part of the impact
in 2013.
Bill Herbert
And the leaning out of the frac crews, we still expect to see an overall sort of reduction of about 25% on average with
regard to the employees attributable to frac rigs?
Corporate Participant
Yes Bill, that's still the target. Part of that will be achieved. We're going to roll out of these new pumps and the
blending units, those are the things that allow us to do less maintenance out on location. The other thing will also be the
mobility plan helps us in achieving more of our remote operations initiative, which will again will be in later 2013.

David J. Lesar, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sean, we'll do one more question.
Operator
Okay. Our final question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Doug Becker
Okay, thanks. I'll hit the international side a little bit, but it seems like results are off to a good start. What do you think
the greatest risk to meeting a margin expectation in the high teams by the end of the year? Is it more mobilization? Is it
just more pricing never picking up? How would you characterize that?
Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development
I would say that, this is Tim. I would say that, one of the things that we have collectively been disappointed with is
essentially the growth of rig count and growth of activity during the course of the last 12 months. Year-on-year, we are
only up about 2% in terms of rig count. So I would say the biggest single risk probably is more around ensuring, or I'd
say not that we can ensure it, is more around the continued expected profession of rig count through the balance of the
year than any other factor. And we just right now, it looks good right now, but we have been disappointed before by the
amount of growth.
Doug Becker
And it looks like we saw relatively modest decline in revenue and margin in Europe/Africa/CIA. Is the first quarter a
good base for us to be thinking about a bit of a recovery, seasonal recovery in the second quarter?
Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development
Well, there clearly will be seasonal recovery. You have to recall that the weather in the Northern Europe of the North
Sea was incredibly bad this year probably worse than it's been in a long time. The exact total offset from what we
experienced to North America. So I think that the season impacts were larger than we had seen in some prior years,
which probably is part of what you've seen, maybe it's missing. Your potential, your particular expectation, but I think
all in that regard and we should see a better seasonal recovery from some of those areas as we go into Q2 and Q3.
