Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward looking,
including statements regarding: our expected level of capital expenditures; Google's future and investments in our
long-term growth and innovation; and the expected performance of our business. These statements involve a number of
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking
statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or
publicly release the results of any revision to the forward-looking statements in light of new information or future
events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.
Please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are also
expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We
have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as
free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings
press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you very much, Jane.
And thanks everybody for getting on our call. Your time is very valuable, and I'm really glad that you all could join us
for our quarterly call as originally scheduled. We've jumped on the call to talk about the other announcement of this
afternoon, which I think everybody is getting a chance to read.
We've had a very strong quarter and a very strong year. And I think as our results show today, our outlook is very, very
bright.
Larry, Sergey, and I spent a lot of time talking about how to run everything. The last decade, of course, has been
fantastic, and we anticipate this will continue. How can we run the company even better? And just after a long series of
conversations, we decided to make some changes in the way we are structuring – the way we actually operate things.
Historically, we've always been running the decisions together. And ultimately it adds delay and so forth in the way we
make decisions. It's actually better to clarify it.
So the proposal, which we've ultimately now – the Board has completely approved, is by elevating me and by having
Larry running things day to day, Sergey focusing on the areas that he's going to talk about, we think this is going to
produce even better success for the corporation. And of course, we're going to do all of this by April.
So, Larry, do you want to introduce a little bit about your thoughts?
Larry Page, Co-Founder and President, Products
First, I want to really congratulate Eric. He has done an outstanding job leading Google for the last decade. I don't
think, when Sergey and I started the company, we would have imagined – we could have possibly imagined we'd have
a better leader for the company. And we're all in great debt to Eric. And I think the results really speak for themselves.
There's no debate about that at all. And there's really no one else in the universe that could have accomplished what
Eric has done.
And Eric is really a tremendous leader, and I've learned a ton from him over the years. And I think his advice and
efforts going forward as Executive Chairman will be invaluable to me and to the company as I start this new role.
Google, I want to say, is just an incredible opportunity. And when we started Google, people actually thought we were
coming in too late, that there were already a lot of other search engines. And the Internet really – people's computing
life is really still at the very early stages. And I could not be more excited about moving us forward. And we're really

only at the beginning. I just can't wait to get us started.
Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Larry.
Sergey, do you want to talk a little bit about what you would like to get done in this new structure?
Sergey Brin, Co-Founder and President, Technology
I'd like to first at the outset mention that I've had a great time working together with Larry now for about 15 years and
with Eric for about a decade. And both of them have really inspired me and moved me, and I'm looking forward to
many more decades of work together.
Now as we have tried to make – or to clarify our respective roles now, I would like to work more on my personal
passions, which corresponds with several significant new products that I hope to tell you about in the future. I'm not
going to – I know we've been accused of vaporware just recently in the press and whatnot, so I don't want to repeat that
error. And I hope to tell you about it in the future, when I'm ready to show you something.
But nonetheless, it's really a privilege to work with these two gentlemen, to continue to work with them, and at this
company that I've been really proud to be a part of all this time.
Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you very much.
And as for myself, I'm going to get a chance to work on the things that I'm most interested in, taking a more strategic
view of things. And I'm going to focus on customers, partners, various government, communications, external issues –
more than the internal issues that I've historically been focusing on. So that's a significant I think improvement in the
kinds of things I can do with my time.
And I want to say very clearly that I believe Larry is ready. He has been working on this area for a long time. His ideas
are very interesting and clever. And it's time for him to have a shot at running this and doing it, and I'm sure he'll do a
fantastic job.
It's interesting that a decade goes by very fast when you work in a partnership as wonderful as this has been. And I'm
quite sure that this partnership will continue. We're friends. We're coworkers. We're computer scientists. We have a
common vision. I don't anticipate any material change in any of our strategies or anything. We tend to agree on pretty
much everything. But I do believe that as a result of this, we'll operate and execute the business even better.
So with that, I thought maybe what we should do is have a few questions before we rush off. And Patrick, thank you so
much for accommodating us on your call.
Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It's our pleasure.
Jay, if you don't mind, what we'll do is we'll accept two sets of questions for this afternoon. We'll just take a few
questions now because we have Larry, Sergey, and Eric. And so we'll take a few questions. And then after that, we'll
close that section of the call, let them run back – go back to work, guys. And then we'll take the regular call as we
usually proceed.

So Jay, if I can ask you to give us the instructions to take a couple questions for Eric, Larry, and Sergey.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to James Mitchell of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Great, thank you very much. Congratulations on the movements and congratulations on the
results. I guess one question I had stemming from the results rather than from the movements, perhaps, is when I look
at the investment in 111 Eighth Avenue in New York City, do you feel that Google is now at a point where in order to
continue facilitating the growth of the Internet that there will be a land grab of desirable physical locations?
<A - Larry Page, Co-Founder and President, Products>: I think our primary reason for purchasing the building
there was not the Internet infrastructure there, but rather the office space that we really enjoy using. The Internet
tenants are great, well paying tenants. We appreciate having them there, but that's not the primary reason why we
purchased the building.
<A - Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Let's have our next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Spencer Wang>: Thanks. Good afternoon, just a big picture question for Eric. You mentioned that one of your
areas of focus will be on government outreach. And it seems like Google has maybe come under a little bit more
regulatory scrutiny over the past several years. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about your strategy
with regulators to just ensure that Google can continue to expand as necessary. Thank you.
<A - Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The simple answer is that we're talking to them. An
awful lot of the problems that we've been having are people don't actually understand what we really do and what we
don't do, and some of our competitors are assisting in that misinformation. And so part of our core strategy is literally
to communicate; this is what we're doing. We're trying to be as transparent and collaborative as possible.
I will tell you very clearly that the regulators have a proper job to do. They're there for a reason and we respect that.
And so far, we've been quite successful by just taking the time to get people to understand. And we're sensitive to the
close lines; that is where we get too close to something and we try to stay away from that. So we try to stay well within
the safety zone of the way we're operating with respect to the legal issues and the competitive issues. We also argue
very strongly that the things that we're doing are very pro-competitive. And I genuinely believe that, and I'll be telling
people a lot of that for a long time I suspect.
<Q - Spencer Wang>: Great, thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question will come from Imran Khan with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Imran Khan>: Yes, hi. Thank you so much for taking my questions and congratulations to everybody, a quick
question. Larry, as we've come to see, I think it's a very interesting juncture of Google's lifecycle. And I think there are
a lot of questions that we get from investors that the proliferation of social networking and how more and more
trafficked the social network platforms are becoming. So as Google gets to the next level, how do you think about the
real-time search in the social networking platforms beginning and the web applications and the mobile apps? How do
you think Google becomes the point or place that you can send traffic to other places?

<A - Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Sergey, you've been driving most of this. And maybe,
Larry, you could comment as well.
<A - Sergey Brin, Co-Founder and President, Technology>: Yes, I think that you point out two important trends I
think. One is the notion of real time, and the other s the broad notion of social in terms of identity, relationships, and so
forth. And I think both of those are very important to search. In fact, you've seen over the past year or so us roll out
functionality along those lines. First of all, of course, we have the Realtime Updates now built into our search, which
includes Twitter and other sources. You've also seen us deploy Social Search, which allows you to find search results
that are related to people who you know and friends of their friends and so forth, and you see those right in the main
search results of the web.
But I think that this is really just the tip of the iceberg, and I think there's far more opportunity. We've touched just 1%
of the capabilities that could be deployed in that realm, and I think you should expect us to continue to developing – to
develop those kinds of capabilities.
<A - Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Larry, did you want to add anything to that?
<A - Larry Page, Co-Founder and President, Products>: Let me add that the last part of what Sergey said really
resonates with me. I think that if you think about the next five years of what your life will be like online and socially
and what kind of things the tools will be able to do, we're only at the very, very early stages of that, and I'm incredibly
excited about the possibilities.
<A - Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think we have time for one more question, and I'll
just have a final comment.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. We've noticed a lot of changes on the site moving you farther down the purchasing
funnel, and we've heard some regulatory push backs. So maybe this is a question for you, Eric, but also potential some
advertiser complaints. So just wondering how the changes in your search ad results are really – are they really driving
your revenues and helping drive the strong growth? And how are you dealing with the advertisers in the regulatory
environment on some of those changes that might be replacing some of the functionality of other websites? Thank you.
<A - Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: There's no question that our extraordinary results are
partly coming from algorithmic improvements that we do all the time. Our basic strategy, of course, is to have the right
ad in the right spot done exactly right every time, and we do literally billions of these every day. And so that's the great
magic of Google, if you will.
We've looked very, very carefully at how we make the decisions as to which ads go where and so forth, and we're
pretty happy with the choice that we make in terms of ranking ads and so forth. There have been some competitor
complaints and so forth of that, and we've done a pretty thorough review. But so far, we're pretty happy with it, and we
think it will pass the necessary complaints and so forth that people are hearing.
Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
So I think with that, I think we've run – Patrick is saying we've really run over our time. I really appreciate everybody
letting us come in and do this. I wanted to say to you that it has been a great privilege to be the CEO for ten years,
literally a decade, and a decade is a long time to be CEO. So I'm very much looking forward to this new role, a more
strategic role on something where I can work on some new things, which I'm excited about. And I'm even more looking
forward to working with my literally best friends and partners, Larry and Sergey. And I hope you all understand how
powerful this triumvirate has been and how for us personally and how much it means to us as individuals.

So thank you all and, Patrick, do you want to just take over?
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Absolutely, thank you so much, Larry, Sergey, Eric, to take the time to join us this afternoon. So with that, what we'll
do is if you don't muting your buttons, perfect, we're going to jump right into it, and we'll go through our more regular
conversations. So I will start with my opening remarks on the financials. Jonathan is going to give us his read of the
year, and then we'll be joined by Nikesh for our Q&A section.
So how else to talk about 2010 and Q4 as a phenomenal ending to a very good year at Google? Our incredibly strong
performance in Q4 and 2010 overall is really a testimonial to the fundamental trends in the digital economy. Those
trends, they're fueling huge opportunities for innovation, for growth, both at Google but also in the entire ecosystem.
One of these profound trends is the shift from advertising offline to online, and it continues at quite a rapid clip. And
you've seen it fueling growth both in our core Search business but across the board as well.
A case in point is revenue growth has in our core accelerated strongly in the second half of 2010, which is really
particularly impressive if you think about it given that Q4 2009 was itself a very strong quarter. So in addition,
investments in our newer businesses, the usual suspects of display, mobile, enterprise, they are also in parallel creating
a second powerful growth engine for Google. Jonathan will give you more details on that in a minute.
But at a high level, I just want to make it clear that how can we not be happy with the overall performance and
trajectories of 2010; and on that basis, be excited about our prospects for 2011 and beyond.
So let me turn toward the specifics of the performance of the quarter now. Let's go through the results. Gross revenue,
we grew 26% year over year to $8.4 billion. Our Google Websites revenue was up 28% year over year to $5.7 billion.
And we saw strength across most major geographies and verticals. Our AdSense revenue was up 22% year over year to
$2.5 billion, again with continued strength in our Google Display Network. Our other revenue was up 31% to $273
million. Our global aggregate paid click growth was very strong, up 18% year over year and up 11% quarter over
quarter. This is really reflecting, as I mentioned, the accelerating shift of offline to online. Without a doubt, as each
year shows, there is more and more holiday shopping happening online.
Our aggregate cost per click [CPC] growth also was pretty healthy, up 5% year over year and 4% quarter over quarter.
And note that FX had a negative impact on CPC growth year over year, although a positive impact quarter over quarter.
Remember too that this is an aggregate number and that includes the dot-com and AdSense properties.
If I turn towards our geographic performance, the U.S. and the rest of the world are both growing at a very healthy
pace, and our results clearly show that. While the UK continued to lag a little bit in the global economic recovery,
revenue from the U.S. was up just shy of 30% at 29% to $4.1 billion. And in our earnings slides that you can find on
our Investor website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., UK, and rest of world to show the impact
of FX and the benefits of our hedging programs. So I encourage you to go to these slides for exact calculations.
The international revenue accounted for 52% of our revenue, or $4.4 billion, and up 25% year over year. And it
includes $25 million of benefits from our hedging program, so a relatively small number. Using fixed exchange rates
though, our international revenue would have been roughly $132 million higher year over year. As I said, the UK was a
little slower and it was up 14% year over year to $878 million.
If I turn to expenses, traffic acquisition costs at $2.1 billion were 25% of advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue
was $877 million, including stock-based compensation of $45 million.
And finally, all operating expenses totaled $2.5 billion, including approximately $351 million in stock-based
compensation, SBC compensation. The increase year over year in OpEx was primarily due to our increases in payroll,
advertising and promotion spend, and professional services.

Page 7 of 18
As a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes our stock-based compensation, increased to $3.4
billion in Q4, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 40%.
Our head count was up approximately 1,000 for the quarter, and we ended the year roughly at 24,400 full-time
employees.
Our effective tax rate, you should note, was 19% in Q4. And this reflects the R&D tax credit legislation that passed in
December in the U.S. and for which we recognized the full benefit in Q4.
Now let me turn to cash management. OI&E was at $160 million for Q4, which reflects the continued good portfolio
management performance, offset a little bit by our FAS-133 expenses. For more detail, again, on OI&E, I'd just
encourage you to refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR site.
Our operating cash flow was very strong at $3.5 billion for the quarter.
CapEx for the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, obviously significantly above the last quarter. But remember that the
majority of this increase was from the purchase of the New York building. The remaining balance was, as usual,
primarily related to our data center and operations.
As a reminder, we'll continue to make significant CapEx investments. And yet, you have another data point to show
that they do tend to be lumpy from quarter to quarter, depending on when we're available to make these investments.
We're very pleased with our free cash flow, despite having purchased the office building in New York, right, just shy of
$1 billion, and the office building is obviously a one-time event.
So with all this being said, Google is in excellent financial performance for 2010, with incremental revenue for the year
of $5.7 billion and operating cash flow around $11 billion. That is a phenomenal performance, plus a digital economy
that's clearly on high gear. So in that context, you can understand why we're so optimistic. And it's with confidence that
we're pursuing an aggressive growth agenda.
We talk about growth agenda means investing. And so here are a couple of places where we have decided to invest and
we'll continue to invest. First, we talked about the intense competition, if you remember on our last call, for labor. So as
part of this strategy to answer this challenge, we have announced a compensation change in Q4, which will affect all of
our employees. We've made two changes to attract and retain the best talent. First, we raised all base salaries by 10%
across the board. In addition to that, we shifted some compensation from bonus into base salary for non-execs; and I
repeat, for non-execs, which will result for them in more stable income for our employees. And please note that all
those changes are really becoming effective on January 1st of this year, so they're not included into our Q4 results.
Remember also that with salary increases come ripple effects, such as 401(k)s or employee taxes or other that will
actually flow through as well.
So if that's for compensation, we've also made and continue to make strategic investments in sales and marketing for
both new products, but also advertising and acquisition. Product areas like Chrome and Chrome OS, which are a central
part of our future, follow a core philosophy of building these open platforms with big optionality and creating
infrastructure where everybody on the web can succeed. We'll continue to push on those. But also acquiring advertisers
will, and continues to remain, a top priority.
We're also investing in our long-term infrastructure, including both facilities and our core computing network. As
you've seen in Q4, the purchase of the New York City office was not only a wise investment, but a clear commitment
to our New York City site, and frankly a reflection of our optimism about our growth prospects.
Investing in innovation is also about making tough choices, and we've made them throughout 2010 as well by choosing
to close products or initiatives that weren't working as well as we would have liked or just that have run their courses.
So for example, we did shut down the Wave product. And we've also shut down our consumer channel for Nexus in
2010 and also many other smaller projects that we wouldn't talk usually on the call, but things like GOOG-411.

And yes, we're investing aggressively, but with discipline; really, as we mentioned in the last call, pouring a lot of
resources on what we call our hockey sticks, with a clear focus on long term ROI. And yes, we'll continue to invest
heavily but with the same proven discipline and results that you've witnessed from us over the last few years.
So in summary, we're incredibly pleased with our performance of 2010, optimistic of our trajectory for '11 and beyond.
Accordingly, we continue to invest aggressively in a bold innovation agenda.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan to speak about the product milestones in Q4 and 2010, and then we'll take it
over to Q&A. Jonathan, all yours.
Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, Product Management
Okay. Thanks, Patrick. So we certainly did have a great year at Google. And I'd really like to think some of it stems
from the unique way that we manage our product and engineering machine.
When we hire product managers, they often come in and ask me. They say, so how do we measure success at Google?
And I always tell them it's simple. At the end of the year, we make a list of all of your successes and your failures.
You're then measured on the sum of your successes and by how much you learn from your failures.
So at the beginning of 2010, one of our concerns was that as we scaled, this approach might lead to our being spread
too thin. Instead, we thought maybe we needed to put more wood behind fewer arrows. So we made some changes, and
I think they addressed this concern without actually affecting the basic philosophy of how we've always run product
and engineering at Google.
So let's talk about what we changed. At the beginning of the year, we decided to double down on the core, so that's
search and search ads. And I think the financial numbers that you guys are seeing today reflect the fact that that was a
successful bet. But behind those numbers is a really relentless stream of new features and product innovations. For
example, we made a big effort this year to make search more interactive, and you can see that with Google Instant. And
then more recently, we made the previews instant as well. And earlier in the year, we launched new user interfaces for
both Web Search and Image Search to make it easier and to make it more intuitive to work with the results after you
run a search.
And we're also making search more intelligent. We made several changes to results, so now you can see things like a
concert schedule or the answers to the questions highlighted right in the snippet. And we're also now starting to roll out
Place Search. So when we know that you're looking for something that's in the neighborhood like an ice cream shop or
something, we'll pull reviews, web pages, the address, and the photo all together for you.
We also doubled down on the ad side of the house. In the past year, we've launched several new ad formats which
we've told you about: Sitelinks, accelerating ads. Recently, we just added product listing ads with photos and prices. It
makes sense that if I'm shopping for something like a coffee maker, it's helpful to see more information in the ads.
But the biggest boost of all came from good old-fashioned ads quality improvements. Q4 was our best quarter in years
from a quality standpoint. We launched over 20 updates, which led to gains that were nearly double those that we
would normally see in a strong quarter. So although we've been at this for years, we're still finding lots and lots of ways
to make ads better.
The other change in 2010 was that several of our new businesses started to achieve escape velocity. And our
philosophy is to encourage lots of innovation, and then we feed the winners and starve the losers. And this creates kind
of a Darwinian, but sort of Googley environment in which new businesses emerge and grow. And in 2010, it's really
clear that some new winners have started to emerge, like Display. We now have over 2 million publisher partners. The
number of transactions on the DoubleClick Ad Exchange tripled. And publishers who sell their ad space via the
Exchange are nearly tripling their revenue when the Exchange wins the auction.
YouTube revenue more than doubled. We began adding features like live streaming to help partners deliver and
ultimately, of course, to monetize content in new ways. Enterprise added impressive customers like the U.S.

Government's General Services Administration. And we expanded distribution with partnerships like the deal with
SoftBank in Japan. Android now activating over 300,000 phones per day, it has helped drive a 10x year-over-year
increase in the volume of searches from Android devices.
And finally in 2010, I think we were more structured in our approach to our business. The product and sales teams are
working together more closely than ever, thanks in a large part to my buddy here, Nikesh. Patrick's rigor helped us
dynamically reallocate resources; and as he mentioned, cancel a few projects like Wave and Nexus One
direct-to-consumer that weren't achieving their goals.
So what does all this mean for 2011? I think you can expect more of the same. We're going to double down again on
the core of search and search ads. We're going to feed the 2010 winners: Display, YouTube, Enterprise, and Android;
and we're going to do it all with even greater financial rigor and cross-functional coordination all over the world.
But I'm also excited about the prospect for a couple of our newest businesses, Local and Commerce. In Local, over 5
million businesses have claimed their Google Place pages. And we recently started testing a new ad product, which we
call Boost. And that gives businesses a really easy and fast way to promote themselves online and to connect with the
people who are searching for them.
In Commerce, we're investing a lot to close the loop from online to offline shopping. I think I've mentioned on four
different earnings calls in the past couple of years, the key to unlocking mobile commerce was to make it easier for
people to both search and then to consummate their transaction from their mobile device. Someone on my team
actually counted back on the calls, and it was four times. I think as smartphones become ubiquitous and local
businesses put their inventory online, I think this is the year where phones will play the big role in commerce that I've
long predicted.
There will be some important differences in 2011. We will invest in hiring even more product managers and engineers.
We're going to give them greater autonomy, and we're going to push them to work faster. In fact, we're asking everyone
here to do more and to do it faster. Through the year, we'll tally our successes. I'm sure you all will probably remind us
of any failures
so we can keep learning from them.
I hope you all now better understand our sense of optimism from a product perspective for 2011. I'm confident you
guys will help us keep track of how this year's product efforts play out on the important scorecard of financial progress.
Thanks a lot, and back to Patrick.

<Q - Ben Schachter>: Hi, guys. Congratulations on the quarter and the year. Jonathan, I wanted to ask you a question
about mobile, and specifically how Google thinks about the differences between tablet users and smartphone users and
how those differences are really influencing the high level view of how you're viewing the overall evolving mobile
market.

And then, Patrick, if you could just address the sales and marketing line, which I think was somewhat unexpectedly
high. Thanks.
<A - Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, Product Management>: Sure, Ben, we can take that in order. I'll
go with the first question. I think it's probably easier to talk about initially how tablets and smartphones are similar.
Both of them are growing at a terrific pace. As is the case with mobile, what we see on these devices is that search
usage on the tablets tends to peak on the weekends, and it dips on the weekdays. So it's generally complementary to
desktop, which we've talked about before. What does that suggest? Maybe that people are using them more for personal
usage as opposed to business. We do see on tablets the weekend peak is a little bit more pronounced than it is on
phones. I think that's probably the case because people pretty much always carry their smartphone during the week.
Some of the bigger differences, the tablet users tend to search more for things like news, and they tend to do more
shopping related topics when you compare them to smartphone users. I think there is some anecdotal data that they may
convert better, but I haven't actually been through all of that in detail. I tend to think that the tablets behave a little bit
more like desktop devices than do smartphones because it's a little easier to input information into them like a credit
card.
I think the other major difference is the UI approaches are different. Apps like the Gmail app for the tablet is more
designed for the big screen. So I think they're both taking off, and the revenue from tablets as well as smartphones
reflects that. Patrick?
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: All right, I'll take the second question.
If there's a good proof that we don't streamline our lines in terms of expenses, but we grow opportunistically and in a
smart move, I think sales and marketing is a great example of that. And if you think of the last 12 months, what we've
clearly shown is how much in high gear is the digital economy. And when that opportunity shows up, we just needed to
jump on it and decide to fuel it.
And on the marketing side and even on sales, I'll actually ask Nikesh to give you a bit of color on the sales side. But on
the marketing side, when you have big platforms like Chrome and Chrome OS that can and will be incredibly
successful if promoted, why wouldn't you do it now? I hear from the financial community the other side, which is what
are you doing with your money? We have great opportunities. Why wouldn't we jump on it with this kind of market?
And on the sales side, Nikesh, you could probably give color commentary as well.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thank you, Patrick. Hi, guys. I think one of the important things you have to understand, we
decided to put our foot to the pedal in later this year. And there was an area of our customer, the advertiser, that we
decided to continue to put more focus on, which is the small to medium size advertisers because that's where a lot of
our growth engine is going to come from in the future. And effectively, a lot of the sales costs there are advertiser
acquisition costs because once we bring them into our system, they stay there for a while, and they continue to work
with us and continue to generate more revenues. And some of the revenue performance you're seeing has been across
the small channels or the mid-tier channels, and that investment is already beginning to bear fruit.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you, Nikesh. Let's go to our next

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
<Q - Mark Mahaney>: If I can ask a question on the local advertising play, and it sounds like you've got a couple of
products you've been working on, rolling out for a while. I think you also may have attempted an acquisition
intra-quarter. Could you maybe quantify the opportunity for us? Is this something that has always been part of the
buildup plan? Is there something you saw in the last 12 months that really indicated that this was the time to accelerate
the efforts against local advertising? And then do you already feel like you've got all the assets now in place, or are you

still going to look for more assets to have that play viable? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Let me just as a preamble, we do not
talk about M&A. Local has always been part of our strategy. Nikesh can talk about the initiatives or just about the
initiatives we're doing there in terms of Boost and the products that you have, or maybe Jonathan the Boost product. It's
one more of the initiatives we have in Local. But Local is, just to give a sense of framework, one out of every five
searches have some form of local tendency or factor, so it's not a side event for us. Jonathan?
<A - Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, Product Management>: Sure, Mark. I think we've been very
focused on Local since – wow, going all the way back to maybe my second year when we acquired Keyhole here with
the Google, which was basically the original company that built Google Earth. And really the idea was that ultimately
the web should be this virtual mirror of the world at all times. And that mirror of the world becomes much more useful,
and it's more relevant to the users when you get everything organized around places in the physical world.
And I think the other thing which has come into play more recently is that technology has made it possible through the
use of GPS and smartphones for us to understand where you are. And so I think what we've recognized more recently is
that because smartphones have become deployed more aggressively that we can supply you with relevant information
about the places that you're near with the appropriate contextual oriented search. So if you're at a restaurant and you
want to pull up a menu, you don't want just the menu that the waiter handed you. You want the one in there that has the
reviews and the picks from your friends.
So I think what has basically changed over the course of the last year is it has become easier for local businesses to
identify themselves in context on Google, and it has become easier for us to find out where you are. And then, of
course, we've mapped that with Nikesh's team, which is working on selling Boost and Tags and some of the other ad
formats that we've developed specifically for Local.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you, Mark. Thank you for your
question. We'll go to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Douglas Anmuth>: Great, thanks for taking the questions. Patrick, can you talk a little bit more about your
philosophy just around the New York headquarters? I think it's the first time where you've actually really come out and
confirmed the purchase. Why do you need to own the New York headquarters rather than getting access to it in some
other way, and why is this a good use of capital?
And then secondly, can you just talk? Just following up on Local, discuss whether you really are building out more of a
local sales force in addition to obviously the Local products themselves. Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'll take the first, and then I'll let Nikesh
talk about the initiatives we're doing on the Local side. We have 2,000 employees onsite today in New York in our
business and our engineering center. It's a big engineering center, by the way. It's not only a big sales center, but it's a
big engineering center. So if you think of the Eastern hub being that place, with 2,000 and growing at the pace at which
we're growing, it's actually very difficult to find in New York a place that would accommodate that number of
employees in an environment that fits Google's standards and Google's needs.
We do not, I mean we actually believe that living in a tower where there's a very small footprint on a floor to floor is
terrible for the Google culture. So there are very few buildings in New York that actually can accommodate our needs.
Replacing that building for us or moving out of there would actually be probably very difficult to find another place
and then be prohibitively expensive. And then finally, it gives us a lot of control over growing into that space. So all
this to say on top of what we believe will be – is a very good investment. So for all these reasons, coming back to the
previous, it's not about carrier hotel owning. It really is about the Googleyness. So for all these reasons I think it did

make sense, and we called it a one-time item because it just fitted so well our strategy.
For the Local sales force, I'll turn it to Nikesh to give you a bit more details on our strategy there.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: I think it's important to understand that Local, the way you defined it, actually ends up in three
different interpretations. One is we always had Local features to our AdWords product. You can always localize to
your advertising towards you who are in certain areas and certain territories. So you've always had the ability to
localize.
The other thing we've done in Local is the way – I think Local is sometimes synonymous with smaller advertisers and
smaller territories. And towards that end, we have created a more simplistic set of products around Tags and Boost,
which is more amenable to those advertisers. They don't have to do a lot of work. Sometimes they don't even have their
own websites, and that allows them to still participate in the online economy.
And third, we have for the longest of times had partnerships with other companies who have been selling advertising on
our behalf to smaller advertisers, be it in small local areas, or we've been using other partners who will use their sales
forces to call on smaller advertisers for us. So we are going to use a combination of all these three efforts to continue to
pursue our Local strategy going forward.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you for your question, Douglas.
Let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with UBS.
<Q - Brian Pitz>: Great, thanks. Patrick, would you give us a rough organic revenue growth rate excluding
acquisitions? And then secondly, a question on ads; are you guys seeing any competitive share shifts in dollars from
search or display towards other social platforms or applications? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So on the second one, I'll let Nikesh
give you a sense. On the first one, I don't have the breakdown, and we don't provide the breakdown. But I can tell you
that all of our core properties are growing very well; and not only our core properties, but also our new growth
businesses as well. When you look at the numbers for just the Google.com growing year over year 28%, how can you
not be happy with that kind of performance? And so overall, we're very pleased with our growth rate of revenue. I'll let
Nikesh talk about the second piece.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: I think it's important to understand that search for the longest of times has been performance
advertising, and so has a large chunk of display in performance advertising. Some of the newer players you're talking
about are playing the brand display space. So overall if you look at it, the stronger trend is shift of brand dollars from
the offline world into the online world, and the immediate shift of some of those dollars, of sales and marketing dollars,
into performance based advertising. So we're seeing that shift both on our search side. We're seeing that shift both on
our display side. We're also seeing some brand dollars on the search side and some brand dollars on the display side.
So I think it's more than fair to say that right now, the bigger trend is the shift from offline to online. And there has
been less of an allocation shift within the online world because you have all of these measures. All these means are
measurable, and you're seeing better ROI for these measurable events in both performance display and performance
search. So that's where the trend is.
<Q - Brian Pitz>: Great, thanks.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: Great. Thanks, guys, two questions; first, Patrick, a question on the display business. If you look
out and analyze the financial statements for just about any publicly traded ad network out there, these businesses seem
to peak out in the – the operating margins seem to peak out in the 20% to 25% range. Do you think there's anything
structurally different about Google's approach in the display business that could allow Google to achieve higher
operating margins? Or is that just the peak for that kind of business model?
And then, Nikesh, just a quick question on the ROW acceleration, so 31% year over year; can you talk a little bit about
which region that's coming from, or is it across the board? And is there any acceleration from new revenue areas like
display, or is it just the core search business? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think on the first one, let me answer
the display, and then I'll let Nikesh can talk about the performance worldwide. I think in display, the most fundamental
issue is if you're on your own network or if you're optimizing for others' network and participating in others' network.
So if you think of YouTube, it's our own property. And therefore, you have a completely different set of economics.
And so you've just got to make sure you don't compare apples and oranges; so one obviously has a much higher margin
than the other. And the question then is the mix. So if you think of us in display where we have the whole suite of
services from what used to be Teracent and all the other pieces, then you have the mix of properties. And that's how
you have to think about it.
In terms of geographic split and performance, it's a fantastic story. So why don't I let Nikesh give you the color
commentary on it?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Just before this, adding to what Patrick said on the display stuff, I think it's also important to
understand the contribution of the Ad Exchange. It basically allows you to bring buyers and sellers together. And we
are seeing a sales uplift for people who are participating in the Ad Exchange in terms of revenues.
So while in your traditional display business, you might be seeing margin profiles that are different. And I can't predict
future margin profiles. But clearly there is an uplift and a benefit to advertisers who participate in the Exchange, or
publishers who participate in the Exchange. So that's also beneficial.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We have three sources, Nikesh, because
you have to add the Ad Exchange on top of it.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yes. So in terms of the rest of the world performance, I think there are some things that are
notable this quarter, in addition to our usual stalwarts where the U.S. continues to be strong, and the rest of the world is
strong.
Germany has maintained its strength because of its economic development, which has been different from the rest of
Europe, so that has showed up in our results as well.
I am very particularly excited about the some of the turnaround we have achieved in Japan because we've been putting
in a concerted effort over the last many months to try and put an aggressive foot out in the marketplace, in terms of
bringing in more partners, more advertisers, and generally upgrading the entire effort in Japan from our side. So we are
seeing the results of that.
In addition to that, some of the commodity markets – markets where commodities are strong – Brazil, Australia. Some
of those have been strong in general.
The UK continues to be weak, as you noticed, but that is still a very strong market for us. It's a big market for us as
well.

<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: In closing on that topic, I think it's
worth noting, if you do your financial math, and you move rest of world into constant FX – so if you take out the fact
that we had crosswinds over year over year – in fact, our growth rate for rest of world is over 30%. It's 31%. So again,

Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Scott Devitt>: Hi, thank you. Paid click growth on a percentage basis was the highest rate in two years. And you
mentioned a few things on the call: better ads, better targeting, even Local monetization. And I was just wondering to
what extent some other factors came into play as well, particularly Google Instant and the rollout of that product, as
well as the incremental nature of smartphone and tablet queries. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay, so I think that for paid click
growth, you really have to look at a couple of factors. I just want to start by debunking a myth on Google Instant.
Everybody seems to have – there's a buzz out there that Google Instant is the driver for a lot of the revenue growth.
And in fact, Google Instant is neutral. It is not making any significant contribution to our revenue growth.
What's really making the contribution is that there's really – our growth is driven by three interdependent drivers that
are all acting and fueling together. One is clearly the strength of the economic recovery and the consumer shift online.
And you can look – ever since Thanksgiving, and you've seen it from external sources as well, people have moved
online. They are spending a lot of time shopping online, looking for coupons. So the behavior is – strong economic
recovery, which brings a lot more participants into the auctions because they want to be where the users are.
In addition to that, you have a second compounding factor pounding on it, which is platforms are changing. The use of
mobile phones, iPads. Instant Search, too, but also Geo. The fact that you get each instant location. You can get
coupons. All these things, from a platform perspective, are driving it on top of it.
And then finally, it is true that Jonathan's team does a fantastic job at making great ads, tuning, and monetization like
the VizURL. And Jonathan, you may want to take a second to talk about VizURL. It's those factors that are really
driving the CPC growth and click-through rate growth rather than Instant Search.
I just want to be clear, because I know there's a rumor on the Street running that it's all about Instant Search. And
Instant Search is about the user. It's people spending 10% faster. That is a huge number, 10%. And that's why we did
Instant Search.
So maybe VizURL is a good example that you want to talk about, Jonathan.
<A - Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, Product Management>: Yes, sure. I guess other than the ads'
quality improvements, which I can cover in a second, I think the only other area that Patrick didn't cover would
basically just be the new ad formats, all of which are boosting click-through rates.
And I mentioned those in my prepared remarks. The product listing ads. More recently, offer ads. Coupon based ads.
The seller ratings, which we've also launched, have a significant impact in click-through rates, as well as does Sitelinks.
But I think that probably the most significant thing in terms of what impacted the whole ads area this quarter was this
concept that we call Visible URL. And basically, what we did was, on the top ads, we moved the advertiser's URL
down to its own separate line below the creative, rather than having it be part of the creative. And that obviously makes
it easier for people to see where they will go if they click.
It's actually a little bit of an interesting story. I'll give you some of the background, because I think this is by far the
most significant change that we've had from an ads quality perspective in a very long time.

It turned out early in the quarter, some of the engineers in Japan noticed that it was really hard to read the creative,
because we actually had the ad's URL, which was in Latin characters, mixed in with the ad creative, which was in
Kanji. And it didn't really take brilliant research to figure out that human perception gets really confused when
characters switch like that in the middle of a sentence. People just skipped the whole sentence. And if they skip
something, that's really bad when that sentence is a text ad.
So we ran this experiment in Japan, and we moved the URL down to its own line, and click-through rates went up
dramatically. So we launched that feature pretty expeditiously in, I think, Japan, China, Korea, and Russia.
And then what happened is the engineers said hey, just for fun, let's try that in the rest of the world. And we actually
didn't expect so much because we didn't have the same dynamic of Latin characters versus Kanji, but it turned out that
people skipped sentences with long, unusual words in it. So people were tuning out that line.
And we quickly launched this feature globally. It was one of the fastest things that we ever launched. After the ad
testing. I believe we launched it right around Thanksgiving. And that had a very significant change in the clicks that we
saw in the course of the quarter.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So just to close on that, just to say it is –
and I know that Jonathan has used that trumpet a number of times in the past. But this continues to illustrate how much
more innovation there is left in both formats and in just all the things we do in terms of innovation in the ad space.
Thank you for your question, though. Let's go to our next question.

Our next question comes from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jeetil Patel>: Great. If we look at your revenue line from a customer-base standpoint, whether it's Fortune 500 or
AdAge 100 versus Internet pure play, endemics. And then the small to medium sized business category. I guess the
SMB category was weaker post and during the credit crisis, and it had a hard time coming back. I'm curious as to your
thoughts as to how it's coming back today.
And do you think there's a different way of approaching the SMB market as you look ahead into this year and going
forward in terms of products or maybe ways to help drive leads or sales for that segment of the market?
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'll let Nikesh answer the question. Just
one point of clarification on your statement, though. During the recession, a couple years ago, I think you mentioned
that we thought SMBs were going down. And in fact, Nikesh will clarify that. They were going the other way. So
Nikesh, I'll leave it to you to answer the question.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thank you for the question, Jeetil. I think the important thing to understand is that we are seeing,
I'd say, a disproportionate amount of strength from the very large advertisers across the board.
Because effectively, what has happened over the years is that they've gone out and really strengthened their
e-commerce offerings. They've gotten their act together. They've got all the logistics in place. And given that this was
the quarter of Christmas and Thanksgiving, you saw tremendous amounts of strength from large advertisers wanting to
play against the pure-play Internet players.
Now in addition to that, what has also happened is we've put in efforts over the last six months on the SMB and
mid-market side. On the mid-market side, we've basically gone ahead and adopted a higher-touch strategy; i.e., we
spend more time on the phone with our customers. We even go and visit some of our mid-tier customers because we've
said over the years, they've grown to be larger mid-tier customers than they used to be in the past. So we have put in a
conscious, higher-touch strategy.

And last but not least, for the smaller advertisers, we are working very closely with our product team and Jonathan and
his team to try and look at various systemic and algorithmic improvements we can make, working with them in large
direct marketing campaigns. And we can continue to reduce churn in that area and continue to acquire more, which is
related to the earlier comment on slightly higher sales spending on trying to acquire smaller advertisers.
So we have efforts across the board, across all three categories. We don't think that effort is done and fully over with.
<Q - Jeetil Patel>: Do you think the business model or pricing model has to be different there, whether it's percentage
of sale or some other approach to going after the spend in that segment?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: No. I think to be fair, if you look at some of the simplification we've done on the advert size in
our Local products, which is another way of thinking about smaller advertisers, that is a way to create a simpler product
for them, where they don't have to put in a lot more effort. Or we have things like keywordless ads, where they don't
have to go ahead and work towards creating keywords or [inaudible]. On the display side, we've got contextual
targeting where we can create ad groups very, very quickly.
So we continue to make product improvements, which allow things to become more and more simple so our advertisers
can go out and do their daily business, as opposed to spend time understanding more complicated stuff on our side.
So yes, you're right. There are different, simpler products we create for them, which have slightly different pricing so
that they can continue to participate in the online economy.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you for your questions. We have
time probably for a couple more questions. One or two more questions. So let's go to the next one, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Jason Maynard>: Hi, guys. I had a question just on the Mobile business. Last quarter, obviously saw some
increased momentum. I'm curious, just from a pricing perspective, what you're starting to see from advertisers. And
what kind of progress did you see over the last 90 days?
And maybe more importantly, as NFC [Near-Field Communications] starts to become more prevalent in smartphones,
how do you think that changes the dynamic in terms of what type of effective monetization you're going to see from the
local commerce side?
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So let me give you just a few stats to
continue to keep the context right. Mobile search grew four times on mobile devices with full web browsers in the last
year. So there is no doubt that this market is just absolutely cranking. And there's a lot of work, and I'll let Jonathan talk
about it, about how ad formats are still nascent and building, both on the display side and on the regular side. And we
see a lot of upside.
Jonathan, you probably want to cover those.
<A - Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, Product Management>: Yes. We don't really actually break out
the details in terms of the exact differences. Certainly the click-to-call ads are generating millions of calls every month.
A lot of advertisers are running these campaigns. I think one you can see, if you tried, is DIRECTV.
We did launch a call-only option where the only clickable link in the ad is actually a phone number, which not
surprisingly substantially increases the click-through rates on mobile devices. And we've extended some of the desktop
formats pretty successfully to mobile. Sitelinks is one. If you try a query on Oakley, you'll see one. If you try seller
ratings on something like running shoes.
So I think there's a lot more to learn there, but the advertisers are very excited and engaged.

At the moment, I don't have any specific comments on NFC, other than to go back to the statements that I've made in
previous calls, which is when people are completing transactions with these devices, it becomes much more trackable
and obviously significantly more valuable.
<Q - Jason Maynard>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you for your question. We`ll take
the last question.
Operator
Our last question comes from Steve Weinstein with Pacific Crest.
<Q - Steve Weinstein>: Great, thanks for taking my questions. First, you had commented that you were going to be
shifting more compensation to base pay from bonus. I was wondering if you could let us know what the ratio had been
historically as far as those two components of comp.
And then finally, obviously the acceleration in all the metrics is pretty exciting and pretty positive for the outlook. I was
wondering if you could help us understand, though, how much acceleration is happening within the core business and
how much of the acceleration is maybe some of the newer businesses really starting to get some scale and maybe
tipping the overall momentum in the business?
<A - Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. So thank you for your question on
compensation first.
As I said, we raised all salaries. So if you think of financial modeling for a second, all salaries have been raised 10%
across the board January 1st. And that has a ripple effect on – the ripple effect of employee taxes, 401(k)s, and all the
rest of the benefits.
It will also impact obviously everybody that we bring on this year as well. So as we bring in new people, they are
costing us now slightly more.
In addition to that, what we've done is, part of the bonus is calculated. Without giving you the exact number, we had
two components to our annual bonus, one which is a company multiplier and one which is an individual multiplier.
And what we've done for the non-execs – because we want execs to actually continue to be treated differently – the
non-execs are treated in that what used to be the company multiplier, which they didn't really have a lot of influence on,
we shifted over to base pay. And their individual multiplier component of the bonus continues to be very directly
involved into their calculation into their personal bonus.
So by shifting that company multiplier, which they didn't have a lot of influence on, it just moves it into more
predictable cash flows for them, all through the year, rather than waiting for the end of the year. And that was the
rationale for doing it.
In terms of revenue growth, last quarter, we gave two indication points on display, on mobile. We've talked about the
fact that our core – if you look at our Enterprise business, 30 million users, 3 million businesses on apps. The
magnitude of numbers we're talking about in each of our growth areas, whether it be mobile, whether it be Android,
whether it be YouTube where we continue to have YouTube. To give you a snippet, YouTube's revenue more than
doubled in 2010.
So that's why we're optimistic across the board, and that's why we're very open about the fact when you have such a
digital economy running in high gear, why don't you take the opportunity to invest at the time when it is actually
transforming itself, and that's what we're doing. And we're delighted, in fact, to continue to push hard on that. That's
what you see also in sales and marketing. So thanks for your question.
<Q - Steve Weinstein>: Thanks.

With that, let me reiterate. So hopefully I got your attention back because the front end of this conversation got totally
sideswiped by the big three, you guys showing up and taking over our seats and phones, but phenomenal year end to
what has been a terrific year. I have to thank all of our Googlers. They do an amazing job every day. It looks easy when
I show up with Jonathan and Nikesh and talk about these fantastic results. But our Googlers do an amazing job all
around the world and so do our partners. And so to them, thank you so much for your fantastic efforts in 2010; and
we're just set up for a fantastic 2011 again.
With that, I'll let Jay close the call.
