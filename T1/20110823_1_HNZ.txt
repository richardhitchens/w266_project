So with the formalities out of the way, let me turn the call over to Art Winkleblack. Art?
Arthur B. Winkleblack
Thanks, Meg, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to take you through our first-quarter performance where we
posted solid results in a very difficult environment. This morning, we'll be presenting our P&L excluding special items,
which you'll recall from our Analyst Day are the one-time charges for productivity initiatives planned for this fiscal
year.
Overall, the quarter slightly exceeded our expectations despite the tough economy in developed markets and a more
challenged U.S. consumer, all of which has been headline news in July and August. For the quarter, we grew revenue at
a double-digit pace, posted solid organic sales growth driven by our trio of growth engines: the top 15 brands, emerging
markets, and global ketchup.
We achieved excellent growth from our newest acquisitions, Foodstar in China and Quero in Brazil; increased
marketing and stepped-up investment in the business, including project Keystone, our European supply chain hub, and
other capability-building initiatives. And we weathered a very tough commodity cost comparison. In short, we're off to
a solid start to the year while continuing to adapt our strategies and tactics to meet the changing consumer dynamic.
In terms of key P&L metrics, sales grew nearly 15%. Operating income increased by a point, and EPS rose 4%. We'll
take you through the detail behind the numbers, but these results included solid base business performance, the benefit
of favorable currency, and the impact of the acquisitions we made late last fiscal year, which are off to a very strong
start.
Now before getting into the specifics, I wanted to profile some of the key themes running through the first-quarter
results. These include strong top line growth from emerging markets, global ketchup, top 15 brands, acquisitions, and
currency; price increases across our portfolio which still lag very high commodity inflation; increased SG&A,
reflecting our aggressive investments in marketing and business-building capabilities; a slightly lower tax rate, driven
by a decrease in the UK corporate tax rate; approximately 3 million more shares outstanding; and a foreign currency
tailwind in our key markets. All of this combined to generate solid EPS growth on an ex-items basis.
Turning to organic sales, our emerging markets once again drove the majority of the organic sales increase, posting
13% growth for the quarter. And on a constant currency basis, sales in emerging markets were up nearly 40% including
recent acquisitions. Developed markets generated organic growth as well, led by Europe, Japan, and Canada. Europe
delivered positive volume and net price growth with organic sales up almost 5%, led by the UK and Continental
Europe.

Australia continued to be a difficult market for us. And in the U.S. Foodservice business we saw a weakening trend in
restaurant traffic, particularly in July. Excluding these two businesses, organic sales growth in developed markets was a
healthy 3% and total company organic growth would have been nearly 5%.
Importantly, this quarter marks our 25th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, which speaks to the strength of
our brands and the adaptability of our business in these challenging times.
And speaking of our brands, you'll notice that Quero, our recent acquisition in Brazil, and Master, which is part of the
Foodstar acquisition in China, are now included in our top 15 brands. Collectively, our top 15 now make up nearly
three-quarters of our portfolio and posted what we are calling internal growth of 6.5% for the quarter. For
comparability, this metric includes an estimate of prior-year sales for the acquired businesses from the time before we
owned them. Note also that five of our top 15 brands are now emerging market brands.
Turning to our three core categories, on a constant currency basis, Ketchup & Sauces set the pace in the quarter with
nearly 14% growth, driven by global Ketchup and boosted by the addition of Foodstar and Quero. The category also
delivered strong growth in Asian sauces in Indonesia and in pasta sauce in North America. Organically, sales for our
Ketchup & Sauces category were up 7%.
Meals & Snacks grew by more than 3%, driven by the Quero acquisition and strong growth in Soup & Beans in the
UK. This was partially offset by weakness in our U.S. Frozen Potato business, reflecting the volume impact of recent
pricing actions. And infant nutrition grew by 5%, virtually all in emerging markets, which grew at a rate of 15% in the
quarter. This growth was led by Venezuela, China, India, and Russia.
Our emerging markets continue to grow in importance to Heinz, both organically and through acquisitions, and
accounted for around 23% of sales in this quarter. We're delighted with our newest acquisitions, Quero and Foodstar,
which together accounted for about 4% of total company sales.
Quero had a big impact on our Rest of World region in hoping to double sales in that segment. Since we closed the
Quero acquisition on April 1, we've been busy integrating the business and positioning it for growth. Previously, top
line growth had been limited by production capacity, which prevented geographic expansion and a greater push into the
modern trade. We've made some real progress against these opportunities while also implementing a small-company
version of SAP. This month we began distributing Heinz products through Quero's sales and distribution network and
are planning on producing these products locally over time. So the team in Brazil has been very busy.
As you know, this is the first quarter in which Quero has been included in our results. And although new acquisitions
are not part of organic growth, using our internal sales growth metric, the team drove 8% sales growth, including more
than 20% growth in our core tomato product business while doing all the integration activities and implementing SAP;
so we're very pleased with their start.
We're also delighted with Foodstar, which we expect to help us reach almost $350 million in sales in China this year.
We've owned Foodstar for nine months now, and it has grown more than 20% versus the comparable period in the prior
year. We've added more soy manufacturing capacity and are expanding the Master brand into a third province. As a
result, Master now serves a total market population of 175 million people, leaving only another 1 billion or so
consumers in China to go.
We're also launching Foodstar's first new products in more than two years, giving us a premium presence in all three of
the largest soy sauce segments in China. Those are light, dark, and weijixian soy sauce.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the growth in our Infant Nutrition category has been driven by emerging markets. We've
been winning in these markets with trusted brands, functional innovations like Qingdao in China and Complan Memory
in India, increased marketing investments, and a relentless focus on quality and taste.
Turning now to global ketchup, we're very pleased with 8% organic growth in ketchup for the quarter while lapping the
well known $1 ketchup promotion that ran at our largest customer in the U.S. throughout most of the first quarter last
year. Growth was driven around the globe, led by Venezuela, U.S. Foodservice, North American Consumer Products,
and Europe, with a notable contribution from China as well.

Now let's take a quick spin around the world of Heinz. We'll start with North American Consumer Products. Q1
brought fresh economic uncertainty and more challenges for the U.S. consumer. Debt ceiling debates, the downgrade of
U.S. Treasury obligations, weak employment and housing markets, and wild volatility in the stock market all served to
make consumers here very nervous.
In this context, constant currency sales were flat for the quarter, as favorable pricing offset an equal volume loss. This
also reflects the lapping of last year's $1 ketchup promotion and the phase-out of Boston Market in the quarter, which
on a combined basis reduced the sales growth rate by about two points.
During the quarter, we completed our planned price increases and reduced promotional spending across the U.S.
business. These actions in addition to our aggressive productivity initiatives helped us cover the dollar impact of very
high commodity inflation and kept gross margin nearly flat. Operating income was down slightly for the quarter,
reflecting the increased commodity costs and also higher fuel costs for the delivery of our products.
U.S. consumer confidence hit a new low in August. This result was even lower than in the depths of the Great
Recession of the first quarter of 2009; and in fact, is at the lowest level since 1980. As a result, U.S. consumers are
reacting by cutting back on discretionary spending. Shoppers are using coupons more often, cutting back on waste, and
paying closer attention to what they buy. We're closely monitoring our pricing and product mix to optimize volume and
profitability in this environment and working to reach both sides of today's bifurcated consumer group.
As you know, we've built a track record of successful innovation in North America. We've introduced products that
have expanded our sales and market share while building and bringing interest to our categories. We are continuing to
build on this foundation and are driving for even greater efficiency in the production of these products, some of which
are now being produced in our new state-of-the-art frozen product factory in Florence, South Carolina, which opened
earlier this month.
In FY 2012, we have another strong pipeline of innovation. We're moving further into the nutritional dinner day part
with our Smart Ones bag meals and extending the T.G.I. Friday's brand in the restaurant quality single-serve entrees.
Both of these launches are going as planned with new T.G.I.F. commercials on air as of mid-July.
In Ketchup, the 10-pack of Dip & Squeeze is starting to show up on retail shelves this month. And we've launched the
more sustainable plant bottle, part of our partnership with the Coca-Cola Company. We're also extending our Classico
line with Mexican and Italian inspired white sauces as well as a new pizza sauce. And we're launching two new
versions of our very successful category leading sweet potato fries.
And turning to Foodservice in the U.S., sales in the quarter tracked to the underlying environment with a 1% sales
decrease, as favorable pricing did not quite offset the impact of lower volume. With the recent economic news and
higher gas prices, we saw restaurant traffic trends change in the quarter from flat to down within our existing customer
base.
During the quarter, we implemented a second set of price increases to offset commodity inflation. But due to the timing
of national account contracts, these price increases will take effect gradually over the coming months. As a result,
pricing has not yet caught up with significant commodity inflation, and gross margin was down by 50 basis points.
Higher fuel costs and S&D also impacted operating income for the quarter.
Importantly, ketchup sales were up 5% in U.S. Foodservice this quarter despite the declines in customer traffic. Here
our innovation is working to offset the environment, attracting customers to buy and consumers to use more of our
ketchup. Dip & Squeeze has been a key element in this equation, and to date has replaced about 10% of our sachet
volume. We continue to build distribution of the product in Foodservice; and as mentioned are providing more usage
opportunities for Dip & Squeeze through U.S. retail, and are now introducing the product into Canada.
The PlantBottle has also been a popular item with restaurants and now represents about 70% of our restaurant tabletop
ketchup business. We've had over 1 million visits to our website, much of it driven by mobile marketing from our
tabletop bottle in the four short weeks since introduction.

Now crossing the pond, we posted strong sales and profit growth in Europe despite the tough environment there, which
includes sovereign debt concerns, austerity programs, civil unrest, and very high unemployment in some countries.
Organic sales grew almost 5%, including volume growth of more than 2% and pricing of almost 3%. These results
were led by an outstanding performance in the UK, where the team is selling more products off the shelf at full price.
Our meals and value shares are growing across most of our UK business, showing that premium brands can still thrive
in a difficult economy.
We're also pleased with the sales results across much of Continental Europe and Russia, reflecting increased pricing,
innovation, and the impact of additional marketing investment.
We're also driving a very aggressive change agenda in Europe, where we're investing in significant capabilities to drive
further growth and efficiency, most notably, Project Keystone and the European supply chain hub. Both
implementations continue to progress and are going well. In sum, we're very pleased with our performance in Europe
for the quarter.
There's no shortage of innovation in Europe these days either. We recently launched an exciting better tasting new line
of aseptic baby food in Italy and continue to extend our Fridge Pack line of beans in the UK.
Also in the UK, we're just launching two new great tasting, unique innovations: Squeeze & Stir, which combines with
hot water to make soup in a cup; and Heinz Pasta Pouches, a premium pasta meal that is portable. It's early days, but
we'll keep you posted on these exciting new products.
Moving to Asia-Pacific, we have a tale of two cities. Results in the Asian emerging markets were very strong. But
results from the developed Pacific markets were unfavorably impacted by poor performance in Australia. For the
segment, constant currency sales grew 7%, largely driven by the Foodstar acquisition and a modest increase in overall
organic sales.
Operating income before the benefits or foreign exchange was down about 20% reflecting a 210 basis point decline in
gross margin and increased investments in marketing and talent in emerging markets. For perspective, much of the
decline in gross margin came from Australia, where we have appointed a new managing director and are attacking the
cost structure to stabilize performance in what has become an inhospitable grocery market.
For additional perspective on constant currency sales performance in the segment, you can see that emerging markets
drove better than 20% growth, driven primarily by infant nutrition in China, Complan in India, sweet soy and chili
sauces in Indonesia, and our acquisition of Foodstar. And the developed markets of New Zealand, Japan, and Singapore
posted solid aggregate growth, up 4% on a combined basis, led primarily by Japan. But Australia is the clear challenge
for us in this segment, with constant currency sales down 8% for the quarter. Again, we're taking strong action to
address our issues there.
Within the emerging markets, we continue to drive strong results through an aggressive innovation agenda. Most
recently, we've just launched a pouch baby food in China, where we are the first company in that market with a pouch
package. And our Infant Formula business continues to build share in key retailers as we methodically progress the
rollout and support it with strong marketing investments to drive awareness and trial across our entire infant nutrition
product line.
In India, our Complan brand gained share this quarter, driven by the new product innovation including Complan
Memory, as well as Complan Nutri-Gro, our line of toddler milks which is now being sold nationally, and the new Pista
Badam flavor of Complan that recently entered lead markets, building on the success of Kesar Badam.
Turning to the rest of the world, the addition of Quero and a return to labor stability and strong growth in Venezuela
enabled this segment to double in size this quarter. In fact, operating income in the rest of world caught up with U.S.
Foodservice in the quarter as we continue to push the mix of our business to high growth markets. We're also pleased to
see double-digit organic sales and operating income growth in the Middle East and in South Africa.
Given the worsening economic uncertainty in developed markets, we continue to focus on maintaining strong operating
discipline. We're taking the price increases necessary to offset inflation, cutting out on profitable trade promotions,

increasing advertising support for our brands, cutting costs, and carefully allocating capital. These choices will likely to
continue to have an effect on short-term volume, but are intended to preserve and expand margins for sustainable profit
growth.
Before I turn it over to Ed, I'd like to update you on the progress we've made on Project Keystone since we last met in
May. Most recently, we completed the baseline work in the Netherlands and the Nordics; very successfully
implemented the global solution in Belgium, which is our first platform for transaction processing through the
important European supply chain hub; and implemented a global e-sourcing solution through SAP to help drive savings
across the company.
Looking forward, we are continuing the European rollout moving into North America, starting with Canada, evaluating
our options for accelerating progress in Asia-Pacific, and developing an SAP solution for smaller markets. Overall,
we're pleased with our progress and are on track with our plans for fiscal 2012.
With that, let me turn it over to Ed. Ed?
Edward J. McMenamin
Thanks, Art, and good morning everyone.
I'll take you through our Q1 results, which reflects strong top line performance and incremental investments to sustain
that growth. Let's look first at EPS. As we announced in May, we're investing in productivity initiatives this year,
which we expect will make the company stronger and accelerating productivity on a global scale.
We anticipate that for fiscal 2012, we will invest at least $160 million of pre-tax income or $0.35 a share on these
initiatives. As a result, we will be reporting our results in fiscal 2012 adjusting for these special charges.
Summarized for Q1, EPS excluding these charges was $0.78, up 4%. This includes almost $0.02 of incremental costs
for Project Keystone. As a reminder, we expect $0.08 of incremental cost for Project Keystone this fiscal year, which is
not treated as a special item. Stripping out the $0.05 favorable impact from foreign currency this quarter, EPS
excluding special items is $0.73, down $0.02 from last year.
Finally, reported EPS was $0.70, which includes a charge of approximately $0.09 due to the productivity initiatives we
incurred in Q1.
Here you can see the makeup of the productivity charges we incurred so far and where they're reflected in the P&L.
Included in reported operating income is $15 million for severance and employee benefit costs relating to the reduction
of the global workforce; $17 million related to asset write-offs for the closure of four factories. We're expecting to exit
at least one more factory this year and are evaluating several additional opportunities to reduce costs. $9 million of
other implementation expenses, primarily professional fees and relocation costs related to the establishment of the
European supply chain hub. Overall, we recorded charges of $41 million pre-tax, $31 million of which was recorded in
cost of goods sold and $9 million in SG&A.
The after-tax impact of these charges was $28 million or $0.09 per share, and the entire amount was reported in the
non-operating segment. We believe that our results excluding these special charges provide the most useful perspective
for evaluating our performance, and we will use this benchmark for the rest of the financial discussion.
Now let me focus on our P&L scorecard. With the benefit of a tailwind from currency, we were able to increase our
investment in the long-term health of our business while delivering operating income and EPS growth despite a
challenging global economy.
Net sales grew by almost 15%, aided by the recent acquisitions as well as currency. Organically, sales grew 3.1%,
driven by pricing. Gross margin was 35.7%, with higher pricing and our productivity improvements offsetting much of
the commodity inflation. As we progress through the year, we expect pricing and productivity to offset commodity cost
increases, but this will build throughout the year and primarily in our second half.

We continued to increase our investment in consumer marketing, particularly in our emerging markets and the UK.
Overall, marketing increased by almost 15% and 8% on a constant currency basis. Operating income was up 1%, but on
a constant currency basis down 4.5%. Our incremental investments in marketing and Project Keystone alone were the
equivalent of over six points of potential profit growth that we chose to invest for the future.
At $0.78, EPS was up 4% but down 2.7% on a constant currency basis as a result of our incremental investments. As
you can see, both the pound and the euro are up substantially versus last year, which has a significant benefit to our
European operations, which account for nearly 30% of global sales. To varying degrees, most of the markets we
compete in have shown similar trends.
Here you can see what those currency movements have meant to our P&L. With the currencies of almost all the
countries we operate in showing substantial strength versus the U.S. dollar, both revenue and EPS show around a 7%
lift from exchange. Since our foreign operations tend to have lower gross margins than our domestic businesses, the
translation benefit to the overall P&L does cause a 20 basis point reduction in average gross margin.
Continuing with a more detailed look at the P&L, I'll touch on some of the items not on the scorecard. Gross profit
dollars were up 12% and 6% on a constant currency basis, with about two-thirds of the growth from acquisitions.
Although these acquisitions contributed to gross profit dollars, they did reduce company-wide gross margins by 40
basis points.
SG&A was up 15% on a constant currency basis, reflecting increases from acquisitions, investments in Project
Keystone, as well as higher distribution costs due to fuel prices. Other SG&A costs in our developed markets were
virtually flat, reflecting our focus on tight cost controls while we continued to add resources in our emerging markets.
Operating income was up slightly from last year while investing nearly $25 million in incremental marketing and
Keystone spending to drive growth.
Net interest and other expense improved by $10 million, primarily due to decreased currency losses while we continued
to benefit from low interest rates.
The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 24% compared to 25.3% last year, primarily due to a statutory tax rate
reduction in the UK. This year will likely show quarter-to-quarter volatility in the tax rate. We currently anticipate a
rate in the low 20%s for Q2 and an overall rate for the year roughly in line with last year's tax rate.
Finally, shares outstanding are up in the first quarter by about 1%, but we expect the full-year impact of shares
outstanding to be neutral.
Looking at the key components of sales growth, as I mentioned, we delivered organic sales growth of 3.1%. Price
improvements, particularly in Venezuela, the U.S. and the UK drove overall price by 3.8%; while volume declined
0.7%, as increased volume in the emerging markets as well as the UK, Continental Europe, Canada, and Japan were
more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Australia.
Overall, the emerging markets led the sales growth, driving 13% organically and representing 23% of total company
sales. The acquisitions of Foodstar and Quero contributed 4.6% to overall sales growth. And finally, foreign exchange
added 7.2% to our top line.
As I noted earlier, our gross margin declined 90 basis points to 35.7%. In isolation, market prices for commodities
would have cost us over 350 basis points for the quarter, but strong contributions from pricing and productivity offset
much of this inflation. The impact of the acquisitions accounted for about one-half of the gross margin decline versus
last year.
Looking specifically at commodities, we've seen inflation in almost all of our significant inputs, particularly
sweeteners, oils, dairy, and resin. The overall result has been a market inflation for the quarter of around 8%.
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard. Capital expenditures were 2.6% of sales, up 40 basis points from the
prior year, with a higher spending rate expected for the balance of this year. Operating free cash flow of $97 million

was down $120 million from last year, largely due to the timing of payables. Net debt to EBITDA improved 0.1 times,
driven by lower net debt. And I'm pleased to say that S&P recently raised the company's debt rating to BBB+.
ROIC was 18.8%, down 20 basis points from this time last year. However, the base business continues to improve as
the recent Brazilian acquisition reduced the company's overall ROIC by 60 basis points, which we should recover over
time as profits in Quero continue to build.
As I mentioned earlier, operating free cash flow was down $120 million versus last year. This reflects lower earnings as
a result of the productivity initiatives and increased QOWC requirements, particularly in parables. Included in our
results was $10 million of outflow for the productivity initiatives.
I touched on the $75 million of capital expenditures earlier, and dividends reflect the 6.7% increase we announced in
May.
Finally, net treasury stock purchases of $44 million reflect the acquisition of 1.6 million shares of stock at a total cost
of $87 million.
In summary, our performance for this quarter was slightly better than our expectations and reflects the planned
incremental investments back into our business to help support future growth.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update you on our full year outlook.
Arthur B. Winkleblack
Great; thanks, Ed, and just a couple of remarks before I open it up to your questions.
Importantly, we are reaffirming our FY 2012 outlook. This reflects our confidence in a number of actions that we've
taken and are planning to take to yield a stronger second half. These actions include more flow-through of pricing,
continuing innovation, productivity initiatives, cost containment actions, and tax planning. All of these are expected to
allow us to continue our aggressive investment programs while delivering our bottom line target. While currency is
tracking positively on a year-over-year basis, it's too early to adjust our full-year ForEx outlook.
Just a quick comment on the shape of the profit curve for the year; we expect it to be a bit atypical, with a stronger
second half benefited by the timing of pricing and prior year ketchup promotions in the U.S., improving productivity,
and less onerous commodity cost comparisons.
And for Q2, we expect EPS to be in line with or just slightly higher than prior year due to the timing of pricing, the
phase-out of Boston Market, a difficult commodity cost overlap, and continued tough conditions in U.S. Foodservice in
Australia, offset by a favorable tax rate. Beyond the second quarter, EPS is expected to build sequentially.
So to sum up, our Q1 reflects continued solid performance in a challenging environment. Our key growth drivers,
emerging markets, top-15 brands, and global ketchup are producing strong and consistent growth. We have strong
operating discipline which will keep us focused on making the right volume profit tradeoffs and to address our
challenges in Australia.
Overall, it's still early in what's shaping up to be another interesting year, but we are confident in our brands, people,
skills, and ability to respond to the consumer as she reacts to world events.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Meg for Q&A. Meg?

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Terry Bivens with JPMorgan.
<Q>: Hi, this is [ph] Jessica (32:05) on for Terry. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering if there's anything
you've seen so far with either Foodstar in China or Quero in Brazil that surprised you. And then net of investment, how
quickly do you think these businesses can contribute to the overall profitability?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, we're thrilled with the start that we're seeing in both Foodstar and Quero. We're
making great progress in terms of the integration. We've got the right people in place. The organization is coming
together nicely. You can see the gains we've made in the top line in over 20% in Foodstar and a very solid 8% in the
early going in Quero, 8% or 9% there despite the fact that we're doing a lot integration work, rolling out SAP, doing all
those things. So everything we're seeing there makes us much more bullish even than we were before, and we've had
positive expectations coming in.
And from a profit standpoint, they're doing well. They're slightly accretive for the quarter, which is a little better than
we had originally anticipated. We don't expect a lot of profit from them this year. But net-net, we're off to a real good
start and slightly helpful to EPS.
<Q>: Great. Thanks; I'll pass it along.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Good morning.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Can I ask about Australia? First of all, how large is that business for you overall and did we see
a marked deterioration this quarter? It feels as though that story's been around for a little while. Has it got a lot worse
recently? When do the comparables get easier?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, Australia a sizable portion of our Asia-Pacific group, but a bit less than $1 billion
roughly in sales.
I wouldn't say it has precipitously gotten worse or anything like that. As many of our peers have talked about, it is a
very difficult environment. The reality is with two key customers there, it has become, as I mentioned, an inhospitable
environment for grocery manufacturers. Very difficult market. And so with it being such a difficult market, we're going
to take the measures that we need to do to address that. And so we've seen our margins squeezed as the pressure comes
on, and so what that means is we're continuing to upgrade talent. As I mentioned, we've just now appointed a new
managing director there. We've done a lot to strengthen the talent in that organization.
We're taking some very aggressive actions in terms of structuring the business and in terms of the cost structure.
Because in an environment where the two customers are going to squeeze it that hard, I think being very, very cost
competitive is going to be critical. And so that is going to be forcing our hand to do the right things from that angle. But
we've got good plans in place. We expect a much stronger back half than first half, but it will take us some time and

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.
<Q - William Sawyer>: Good morning. This is Will Sawyer in for Rob.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: How are you, Will?
<Q - William Sawyer>: Hi. I wanted, Art, to ask a little bit about Europe. Obviously, that's a challenging
macroenvironment. But like you said, your performance was very good during the quarter. If you just give us some
more detail on how you're winning there.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. I think Dave and the team are working hard selling more products off the shelf at
full price. They've done the job in terms of taking pricing. They're also reducing their trade spending by cutting off the
unprofitable promotions, but we're trying to do that smart. We're continuing to ramp up the innovation in that market. I
mentioned a bunch of the innovations there. The UK had a particularly stellar quarter in clearly a tough market there.
So that will continue to be a challenge, but the guys are doing all the right things. We're very pleased with the team
there and what they're doing.
And in the continent, we're seeing some pretty good results as well. Some of the things, local jewels as the guys would
call it, sprinkles in Continental Europe, some of the soup products all doing well. Really the thing that is going so well
across the entire company, but particularly in Europe, is ketchup. Roel van Neerbos has been driving not only the
global ketchup initiative across the globe but obviously there in Europe, and we're seeing some great results there. And
we continue to think that we've had great opportunity to drive the ketchup business. And as you know, that has very
nice margins to it, so that has value to our benefit both at the top line and bottom line.
So the team's banging away at it. Also we've got a very busy agenda there. As you know, we're putting in a supply
chain hub. We're driving Keystone. We're building out the new Innovation Center which will ramp up innovation even
further in that business over the coming years. So lots going on. We're pleased with the results. But again, to your
point, a very challenging environment, so we don't take that lightly and we're going to have to keep hammering away.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Clearly, the benefit of very strong brands in Europe, particularly the UK.

<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Morning.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: You mentioned it's a bit too early to adjust your currency forecast or your EPS including currency
impact forecast. But if I remember correctly, you were looking for something like $0.05 to $0.07 on the year, and you
did about $0.05 in the quarter from currency. Just wondering, based on current spot rates or forward rates, whatever –

whichever you would feel more instructive, what would the benefit for currency be for the year?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Now, Eric, keep in mind that currency last year ramped up through the year, so really
our easiest overlap is in Q1. If currency stayed exactly where they are right now, it would give us a bit more benefit
than we had originally planned. But I've got to tell you, with the volatility we're seeing and the sovereign debt issues
and the list goes on and on, I'm really not going to speculate right now as to where that could go. We've got volatility
not only in those European currencies but some of the Latin American currencies. So we're just going to keep an eye on
it. And as and if we get upside from currency, we'll let you know how and if we would use it.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay; I'll follow the rules and pass it on. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Thanks; good morning.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: So I guess this is shaping up to be an unusually back-half weighted year, I think especially
when you take into consideration the quarterly cash flow dynamics. And I guess I'm struggling a little bit to get
comfortable with that because you actually got a decent amount of pricing through in the first quarter, and I was hoping
you could maybe help me understand that by perhaps giving a little bit more color on the quarterly flow of the cost
inflation that you expect to run through the P&L this year.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, if you think about it, the cost numbers or the inflation numbers were up around
8% for the first quarter. We expect that to continue to be a tough overlap in the second quarter. That will start to ease
off through the back half of the year; at least that's our expectation. Again, who knows? But that is certainly what we
are expecting. So that becomes easier.
The other piece of it is, and we mentioned this when we talked to you guys in May, that the pricing would lag a bit.
And in fact, that is proving to be the case, particularly in places like Foodservice, where you've got national account
contracts in place that slowly roll over time. And so I think you'll see through the back half the pricing become more
robust and the commodity inflation become less. That's the way our plan has always rolled out, so we're tracking to the
plan that we had laid forth.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: And the other thing is that value engineering projects and that sort of thing ramp out
through the year, as you start with a group of them, and implement them throughout the year, so that has much greater
benefit in the back half of the year than it does initially.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Thanks.

<Q - David C. Driscoll CFA>: Art, you waited – I liked in your presentation the consumer confidence item. You
talked about sovereign issues, debt issues, and so forth. But your constant currency sales growth guidance is
unchanged. So I feel like there's perhaps a little bit of a disconnect here in terms of – one of the biggest questions I
think is out there is how do we feel all these kinds of pressures and then not see companies update their sales guidance
by perhaps lowering it on expectations of consumer pressures.
Now this is a fairly large encompassing question. But as best you can, can you give us some thoughts as to why you
would be as confident today in the constant currency sales growth guidance as you would have three months ago given
the fact that we've seen some very significant changes in the market since that point?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Right, good question, David. I think as you look at it, we gave constant currency sales
growth guidance of 7% to 8%. Q1 we're right at the top of that, the end of that range. And so as we look forward -- and
nobody's got a perfect crystal ball -- but as we look forward, we fully expect that our sales growth will continue to be at
the top end of that range. Where I think this changing economic environment will really impact is potentially in the
gross margin area, where it will be tougher from a net price standpoint. Commodities are certainly as high as we
expected or maybe even a little higher.
And so as we look forward, I think the real – where it will impact is more on the gross margin. So if you think about it,
the way we're looking at the forward projection, we're not changing anything official yet. But I think hopefully we'll be
toward the upper end of the range on sales and maybe towards the lower end of the range on gross margin. But it's early
in the year. We're only three months in, so we'll see how things play.
<Q - David C. Driscoll CFA>: And maybe calling – go ahead, Meg.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: I was just going to say, the teams – we've learned a lot over the last few years with the
consumer. And so there's a lot of innovation that is being brought forward different from what we would have planned
three months ago; so really looking at sharp price point entries, getting to the bifurcated consumer, and making sure
that we've got product offerings for both. So we've got great innovation at the top line, new flavors, dinner formats, et
cetera. And now we're looking also to drive that top line with some other product opportunities maybe at the lower end
of that scale. And to Art's point, that could drive mix shift for us. But we do feel good that we can grow even in this
environment.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: But I think Meg makes the right point on the sharp entry price points and sizes that
allow people to play because you're seeing folks that are living paycheck to paycheck. And so it's less about the price
per ounce and more about the entry price point, and so we're looking hard at that.
<Q - David C. Driscoll CFA>: One follow-up then pursuant to the foreign exchange question, would you agree then
that if – given all this macroeconomic news and how difficult the environment appears to be getting, the foreign
currency issue maybe provides some level of cushion. So I think if I read between the lines, you don't raise any
guidance today even though foreign currencies look to be considerably better than the $0.05 to $0.07 guidance
provided three months ago. However, because of the macro side of it, it's too early to raise guidance because you might
see more gross margin pressure. Is that a fair way to characterize things?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: I guess who knows where the foreign currency goes? It has been awfully volatile. And
so again, I'd be hesitant to try to peg anything going forward. But the other piece of it is you know that this is a big
investment year for us, and we see some great investment opportunities that will do the right thing for the long term of
this business. And so that's the other thing we continue to look at. And so there are lots of levers and lots of things that
we'll consider. But again, it's early in the year. We're three months in. There are nine months ago, and we'll see how it
plays and we'll keep you posted as we go.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: I think if you look at currencies, and they ran up through last year. But as you look at
the first quarter of this year, you can get pretty excited from day to day and then pretty unexcited from day to day, so
there's not a strong pattern. We saw a pretty big pickup during the latter half of last year. But during the first quarter of
this year, it's volatile, so I think it is too early to make a call for the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney of Janney Capital Markets.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: I wanted to – actually, I was going to ask a question, but you brought up a much better
issue than what I was going to ask, so I'll just forget that. Meg, you talked about that bifurcated consumer. Both Meg
and Art, I'd love to actually delve into that low end consumer that I would guess is driving a lot of, say, the trade down
behavior in the face of pricing or elasticity, however you want to look at it. We know they're eating something. We
know they're just spending less as they do it. I would guess that's the low end consumer, and I would guess that it
positions your portfolio in a certain way that may be good for some brands, bad for others, I guess what data do you
have to explain that? Do you think that the low end consumer is driving a lot of this pressure, particularly in the U.S.
and Europe? And do you think – what areas of your portfolio are benefited and hurt by that if it's the case?
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Sure, and I'll start off with that. What we're seeing is really, there's a portion of the
population that has a very limited amount of funds; and we estimate somewhere between $40 and $50 a week to feed a
family of four, which is really stark when you go to the grocery store and realize how tight that is. Value to that
particular consumer is something completely different than mainstream or affluent. And value to that consumer is a
price point. It doesn't matter what the cost per ounce is. It matters. Can I afford to buy even a small portion of that this
week? And having small sizes, convenient sizes, convenient channels, convenience stores, pharmacies, dollar stores,
quick small trips that are close to home as opposed to going out for the big loads at the supercenters. So there's very
different behavior that's occurring. In fact, we were almost saying it's almost a trifurcation, if you will, because we're
seeing a consumer that is truly struggling and value means something different.
Our core portfolio in the U.S. tends to skew towards to the more affluent. So you see Heinz products doing very well
across mainstream, across the affluent, in the club stores, et cetera. There is a huge opportunity for us, and we see it.
We originally anticipated more of a recovery scenario. And now that we're seeing things get tightening again, we're
looking very hard. We had a lot of plans that we were looking at before, a lot of ideas, so these are things that are very
close and ready to go that we want to execute quickly. But we're going to make sure we hit it right by getting into the
right channels, getting into the right size and format for a different consumer. And we want to make sure that we're
appealing abroad.
In Europe, across our other developed markets, a very similar story; and so our brands across Europe are very strong
and particularly in the UK. And it's something we've been working on a master branded campaign across the UK to let
the consumer know that we're there for them and have worked very hard, though, to shore up brand equity, but to make
sure that we've got right serving sizes. We've gone more towards value sizes, larger sizes there. But of course, we have
smaller sizes. We've got more of a tiered approach across Europe.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: The other thing we're trying to do is keep top of mind. So we're continuing to invest on
the marketing side of this and the advertising message to make sure that we're the thing that's top of mind as people
head toward the stores.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Just, Meg, to follow up on your description, which was very helpful, can all of that be
accomplished? You mentioned price point, sizes, value. Can all of that be accomplished in the context of flat operating
margin, flat operating profit for Heinz as a whole, at least as it relates to the North American and European businesses?

<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: You don't necessarily have to be trading off margin with smaller pack sizes and more
competitive entry price points. You have to engineer it smartly with the cost structure and with the size related to the
price. So it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to trade down margin.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: This is somewhat new in the developed markets. But we discussed this several years
ago in relation to the emerging markets where we found out that people were not buying on a price per ounce but
buying per usage. So I think this is one of those times where we're able to leverage some of the experience we gained
from the emerging market, bring it back here for something that's not necessarily intuitive to the average American.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Good morning.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just in looking at the comments you made about earnings expectations for the second
quarter, if the tax rate is going to be that low, I guess that implies that you expect operating profits to be down again
year on year. Is that correct?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, I think operating income will be a bit challenged in the quarter, largely again
because of the gross margin dynamic, because the timing of the pricing and the timing of the commodity impact and
the timing of some of the investment spend. So if you think about it, you've got all those things going on. And so over
the year, I think even the investment spend overlap becomes easier as opposed to harder.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: Last year we ramped up Keystone as we went through the year. We've reached that
peak, and so now the overlap is much more challenging in Q1 and Q2.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So then the implied operating profit growth in the second half, which I guess just rough
math has got to be somewhere close to 15% for the second half to get to flat for the year.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: You'll have Foodservice probably come in below the plan that you originally – I think you're
at 8% to 10% profit growth for the Foodservice for the year. But the upside is going to be, I guess, from Europe and
then also the productivity savings coming through in the back half of the year and the Keystone spending moderating.
Is that the right way to think about the second half?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Those are some of the key elements. Acquisitions should be gaining momentum
through the year as well, so we would expect that to occur. And last year, if you recall, we had a very heavy investment
spend in the fourth quarter that really it is a much different flow this year, much more front weighted than back
weighted. So lots of different dynamics; but yes, it's a much stronger OI outlook in the second half than first half.

<Q - Karen Ann Lamark>: Good morning. I just want to follow up on the UK, and maybe you answered it when you
talked about the bifurcation to consumer. But I'm trying to reconcile the macro pressures in that market with your
results and the confidence in your outlook. Was there something incremental, promotions, distribution? How were you
sustaining the pricing and the volumes?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Good innovation for sure and I think very disciplined effort on the part the guys to do
the homework around trade spending. We brought in an outside firm to help us pull that apart and figure out where we
were making money and where we weren't. We've implemented the recommendations coming out of that study. And I
think that is being very helpful to where we can be good partners to our trade customers and help them and help us. So
there's no reason to be doing these promotions that don't make anybody any money. And I think we've gotten much
more effective at that; so a combination of innovation, pricing, good management of trade spending.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: And I think last year, if I recall, in the early part of last year, we had taken some
pricing. The price gaps versus competition broadened. And, you know, our expectation eventually that they would see
the same costs we did. And I think as time passes, those gaps have somewhat narrowed in the first part of this year that
helped us.

<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, guys. Good morning. I had just a quick question for you regarding the emerging
markets. I guess if you look at the underlying sales growth of 13% in the quarter, in rough terms, I'm sure you can't get
the exact number, but with profitability on the bottom line with sales -- I guess what I'm trying to understand is the
degree of investment behind the emerging markets. Is that marketing, people, infrastructure, is that all happening pretty
early in the year and ease as you move throughout the year?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, the reality is we've got better growth at the bottom line than on the top line.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: We're investing heavily in the business. But when you've got that kind of strong
top-line growth, it allows you to do some things within the P&L and still deliver a darn good bottom line. So we feel
very, very good about the emerging market top line, bottom line, and the investments we're making.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then just somewhat related to that, I guess if you look at these acquisitions
initially, Quero and Foodstar, were going to be dilutive to earnings. Think you're talking about maybe a slight bit of
accretion now. Is that just better profitability, or is there something changed in the market -the idea was to market
pretty heavily behind those businesses out of the gate. Is that still something you're planning to do?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, I think once we're ready, we will certainly get after the marketing side of it. Now
in Quero for instance, we've not yet turned on the marketing because from a capacity standpoint, we're not quite there
yet; tomato processing we've improved capacity, but we haven't done it yet on the corn side of things and some of the
vegetables. So once we're ready with the capacity and things like that, we'll turn on the marketing. So in answer to your
question, the improved outlook profitability-wise is not by spending less marketing. It is about good strong top line and
good efficiency as we go in, and the integration process is working well so far.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay; that's great. Thanks for the time.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Dickerson of Consumer Edge Research.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Hey, Rob; good morning.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Hey, how are you?
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Just a quick question, really it's just around pricing. Obviously, you've had – you've made a lot
of comments just around gross margin and what's happening in COGS. And I think it seems as if that's actually fairly
standard at this point for most food companies heading into Q2. So with that said, if your guidance – I'm pretty sure
your guidance originally was for total company pricing for the year to be around 2.5% to 3%. If that's the case, should
we be modeling now in a higher level like we saw in Q1? And I guess two, are you finished pricing in Europe? And
then three, the 4% to 4.5% commodity outlook that you had earlier in the year -- has that gone up?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Well, I'm not sure we ever broke out price from volume. Our expectation that we laid
out was 3% or 4% in organic growth.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: I think actually it was at your Analyst Day when you did the bridge. I think you did a bridge
between – the bridge from fiscal 2011 gross margin to fiscal 2012. You said pricing 2.5% to 3%. The deflation was
down --
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: From a margin standpoint.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: From a margin standpoint, yes, yes, yes. I got it.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Right, right, right. Yes?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, how much pricing we get I think is yet to be determined. I think if commodities
continue to be high or in fact increase further from here, we're likely to take more pricing in certain markets on certain
brands. On the other hand, if commodities slow, then we'll feel a bit less pressure to do that. So I think we're going to
retain our flexibility on that and just see what makes sense over time. Again, we're early in the year, and we'll see what
transpires both from a commodity standpoint and a somewhat related item, where currency goes from there as well.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay; fair enough. So then at this point, the 4% to 4.5% stands?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, I think what we talked about from a market inflation standpoint for the year was
around 7%. We're running higher than that on a year-to-date basis, and we'll see where we go from here.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks a lot.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: All right, I think we have time for one more.

Sure. Your final question comes from David Palmer of UBS.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Hi.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Hey, David.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Hey, David.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: I just had a quick question on Ore-Ida. I understand that that business has been hit a little bit
by private label share losses, and that might be partly due to the retailer brands being slow to follow price increases.
We haven't really seen private label then a big problem for all the U.S. packaged goods this year. Are you surprised by

the level of trade-down hit to that brand this year? What is the prognosis of that brand perhaps getting some
stabilization in market share? My hope, of course, is that this brand can be a source of improvement as we go through
fiscal 2012.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, yes. I think if you recall, we took some pretty aggressive pricing early on, on that
and got out ahead of the market, so we have had a pretty sizable price gap in that arena. That's not really surprising
given the private label contracts. And again, private label is our key competitor there. Private label contracts are on
discrete timeframes. So over time, you may see those contracts roll off, and potentially prices of private label go up
overtime and that gap closing. We'll see. But at the end of the day, we did what we think is right for the category and
right for us, and so we took price.
The good news is we're back on air now. We were really off air for a while in Q1, so we're back on air. And some of
our comments earlier about entry price points and pack sizes and things like that are certainly things we're looking at
with regard to Ore-Ida. And we're continuing to drive the innovation, particularly on sweet potatoes. So I think we've
got a lot of things going there, but a pretty sizeable price gap and we'll monitor that and do what we need to do to make
sure that the business remains healthy.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks, Art.
Margaret R. Nollen
All right. Okay, so just looking forward, of course, we've got the Barclays Back-to-School Conference. We'll be
presenting the morning of Thursday, September 8. That will be Art Winkleblack and Mike Milone. And then
September 21 and 22, Bill Johnson, Art Winkleblack, and myself will go across the pond over to the BofA Merrill
Lynch Global Consumer and Retail Conference, one-on-one conference there. And of course, we'll be around all day,
Mary Ann and I in Investor Relations, to answer all of your questions. Thank you.
Arthur B. Winkleblack
Thanks, everyone.
