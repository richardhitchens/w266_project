we'll open it up for your questions. Assisting us in the Q&A session will be Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer;
Joe Lacher, President of Allstate Protection; Sam Pilch, Controller; and Matt Winter, President of Allstate Financial.
During the Q&A session we ask that you limit yourself to a question and a follow up so that we can hear from as many
of you as time allows.
After the market closed yesterday we provided our earnings press release, investor supplement and filed our 10-Q for
the second quarter 2010. This morning we also posted a presentation that we will be using today. All of these
documents can be found on our Web site. As noted on Slide One of the presentation, this discussion may contain

release and on our Web site. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available shortly following the completion
of the call. Christine Leuter and I will be available to answer any additional questions you may have after this call ends.
Now let's get underway with Tom Wilson. Tom?
Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning. We appreciate your continuing interest in Allstate. I'll begin with an overview of our results for the
quarter. Bob will then discuss the details of the business unit results, and Don will cover our investment performance
and balance sheet position. Then we'll get to your questions.
Our results for the second quarter are a continuation of the positive momentum we established over the last
year-and-a-half, despite the ever-present volatility of weather in the financial markets. We generated $441 million of
operating income or $0.81 per share, a sizeable increase over last year's results, reflecting lower catastrophe losses as
you can see on Slide Two. You'll remember that last year we had record second quarter catastrophe losses. In Allstate
protection the combined ratio was 96.8, 3.2 points below the second quarter of 2009. The underlying combined ratio of
88.1 remains in line with our annual guidance of 88 to 90.
Allstate Financial continued to take positive steps towards its goal of raising returns while repositioning the business.
Operating income was $125 million for the quarter. Investments generated strong returns reflecting our risk mitigation
and return optimization strategies. Net investment income flattened sequentially as portfolio yields stabilized.
Valuations improved as declining interest rates more than offset wider credit spreads.
We produced $145 million of net income, a decline from last year's second quarter results, due primarily to realized
capital losses from our risk mitigation programs, which were more than offset with unrealized gains in the portfolio.
We ended the quarter with a $400 million net unrealized gain on the investment portfolio versus unrealized losses of
$849 million three months ago and a $7.3 billion unrealized loss one year ago. As a result of all of our efforts this
quarter, our book value per share increased 3% from March 2010, almost 8% from the beginning of the year and 19%
from Q2 2009. We remain focused on our priorities for 2010 and our operating results show continued progress in
executing our strategies.
Our Auto business continues to generate excellent returns. While many of our standard Auto growth initiatives are
working, they are not generating enough volume yet to increase overall policies in force. Our new business trends are
improving as we continue to refine our product and price offerings to our targeted customer segments. We feel
particularly good about our cross-line sales efforts, as Bob will discuss. Offsetting these positives is a reduction in the
size of Encompass and our California Auto business, as well as lower growth in Florida.
Homeowners' profitability remains a challenge as catastrophe losses remained above average this quarter though not as
high as last year. We have made progress and remain focused on improving returns in this line of business.
Consequently we will continue to see price increases, tighten underwriting standards and work to build more
sophisticated risk management tools.
As you know our strategies to improve the returns in Allstate Financial include reducing the Spread-based business by
exiting some distribution channels, focusing on the Allstate customer base and expanding our Workplace business. We
made good progress in all of these areas.
Looking forward, we must stay focused on our goal to generate long-term profitable growth. We will achieve this by
retaining more of our existing customers while continuing to increase new business. Our focus on improving customer
loyalty is designed to do that which is to drive improvements in retention and referrals. Our customer loyalty index
results however slipped slightly this quarter, as did those in the entire industry. Focusing on the customer however
remains a key strategy in our efforts to grow profitably; therefore, we will continue to introduce new products, new
prices and new marketing support to help us win at the local level.
With that, let me turn it back over to Bob for a more in-depth look at the operating results.

Robert L. Block, Investor Relations
Thanks, Tom. On Slide 3 we show the Premium and Underwriting income trends for property liability. For the quarter
we experienced modest top line growth while maintaining our underlying margins within the range of our annual
outlook. Total net premium written increased slightly to 6.64 billion from the second quarter 2009. Increases in Allstate
brand Auto and Homeowners net Premium written were partly offset by declines in our Encompass brand.
Allstate brand standard Auto net premium written grew 1.9% in the quarter. Increases in the average premium driven
by rate actions taken over the last few quarters more than offset a decline in overall unit volume. New business volume
increased 0.4% quarter over quarter and was up 14.3% if you exclude Florida and California, as profit improvement
actions in those two markets masked the positive results of growth initiatives targeted at our customer segments which
are gaining traction in the local market level. For example, our effort to cross-sell auto to our mono-line property
customers is progressing nicely. Both the close rate and the quality of the business is better than average. We are
exploring more ways to improve the effectiveness of our cross-sell processes.
Auto retention remained level at 89% after increasing slightly in the first quarter. So while new business volume
increased, it was not enough of an increase to overcome the business lost at renewal. Thus policies in force fell 1.7%
from June 2009 levels and 0.3% from March 2010.
Allstate brand homeowners net written premium of 1.565 billion grew 2.2% quarter over quarter. This was driven
primarily by an increase in average premium of 6.1% as rate actions work into the book of business. We expect to
continue to seek rate changes where necessary to improve the returns over time.
The combined ratio for the quarter was 96.8 all-in, an improvement from the second quarter of 2009 of 3.2 points. The
underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior year reserve re-estimates remains within the
range we established for the year at 88.1.
Just a few words on catastrophe losses for the quarter. In the second quarter we experienced 30 events estimated at
$758 million or 11.6 points, almost matching the record quarter we had last year. Partially offsetting the current
quarter's losses were favorable reserve re-estimates of 83 million for prior years and $39 million for catastrophe losses
that occurred in the first quarter of 2010. So in total we had $636 million or 9.8 points of catastrophe losses in the
quarter, an improvement of 2.7 points from the second quarter of 2009.
In addition to the 83 million of prior year reserve re-estimates for catastrophe losses, we had another 67 million of
favorable reserve re-estimates. These adjustments were primarily due to favorable severity trends in auto physical
damage.
On Slide 4 we get a look at auto loss cost trends, which in total were within our expectations. Both bodily injury and
property damage reported frequencies increased over the second quarter of 2009, 4.2% and 1.9% respectively as shown
on the charts on the left side of the page.
Offsetting these increases were decreases in paid severities for both coverages of 1.0 to 1.5% displayed in the upper
right-hand corner. These results when coupled with the loss cost results of the other auto coverages and an increase in
earned premium from rate increases taken over the last several quarters produced a combined ratio slightly better than
the prior year's quarter and one that is consistent with our experience over the last year-and-a-half.
Slide 5 has similar loss cost information for homeowners where profit improvement actions continue as catastrophe
loss activity remains above average, offsetting a moderation in non-catastrophe loss cost trends.
In the top two charts we show our frequency and paid severity results excluding catastrophe losses. Frequency
continues to run ahead of prior year while paid severity trends remain in negative territory relative to 2009.
In the lower left hand corner we show homeowners' catastrophe losses as a percentage of homeowners' earned
premium. Catastrophe losses in the second quarter 2010 equate to about 35 points of homeowners' earned premium
versus an average since 1992 of around 29 points. And finally, in the lower right the combined ratio came in at 104.4
for the Allstate brand, an improvement of almost 12 points from last year's second quarter. The loss ratio, excluding

catastrophe losses, was 47.9 compared to 49.3 for the second quarter 2009, 1.4 points better. Bringing this line of
business to acceptable levels of profitability remains a priority.
Shifting to Allstate Financial, Slide 6 provides a snapshot of the second quarter's results, which indicates solid progress
being made. Premium and deposits totaling just over $1 billion declined substantially from the second quarter 2009 as
we shift the focus to underwritten products and away from spread-based business. Underwritten products,
inter-sensitive life, traditional life, and accident and health, grew 12% over prior year while annuities fell about 60%.
Operating income for the quarter was $125 million or $60 million better than prior year. This increase was driven
primarily by lower DAC amortization and improved investment spread offset somewhat by lower benefit spread.
There were some one-off items included in these results but they netted out to a favorable after-tax effect on operating
income of about 10 to $15 million. For the quarter, Allstate Financial had a net loss of $107 million, as we had $226
million of after-tax and DAC realized capital losses or 353 million on a pre-tax basis. Taking a closer look at those
pre-tax realized losses, $179 million related to derivatives primarily designed to protect against rising interest rates, so
there was an offsetting economic benefit with higher portfolio valuations.
The $200 million of impairment and a change in intent write-downs were $29 million less than the second quarter of
2009. And sales at a gain of $18 million were $145 million less than last year.
Now I'll turn it over to Don.
Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Allstate
Insurance Company
Thanks, Bob. First I will cover our investment performance for the quarter, and I'll finish with a quick recap on our
capital position. As we have in recent quarters, we remain focused on continuing to effectively manage risk and return
in the portfolio and our proactive approach served us well again this quarter.
On Slide 7 you can see the allocation by asset class for the investment portfolio, which totaled $99.9 billion. Fixed
income securities remained the largest portion of the portfolio at 82%. We remain long corporate credit as we have in
previous quarters. Consistent with our outlook, we reduced our allocation to municipal bonds by $1.6 billion and
commercial real estate by $966 million in the quarter. And we benefited by lowering the allocation to equities in the
first quarter as the market declined and maintained that underweight position throughout the second quarter.
Slide 8 provides trends for investment income and realized capital gains and losses for the last six quarters. Focusing on
the top section of the slide, in total, net investment income fell 5.3% from prior year but was almost level with Q1
2010.
We remain in a defensive position relative to the interest rate outlook, with reinvestment proceeds being placed in
shorter duration instruments and derivatives being used to manage the overall duration of the portfolio.
Shifting to the bottom of the slide, realized capital losses in the quarter amounted to $451 million pre-tax compared to a
$328 million gain in Q2 2009. Total write downs from other than temporary impairments were comparable to prior
year at $306 million, with credit related impairments trending down by $52 million compared to Q2 2009.
The gain from sales was $118 million less, at $145 million. The big swing category this quarter was in derivatives,
instruments used primarily to protect the portfolio valuation from the negative effects of rising interest rates and equity
market declines. For this quarter, we had $310 million in losses versus a gain of $419 million in last year's second
quarter. While we recorded a loss this quarter, the economic offset of these transactions was positive as the valuation of
the portfolio improved as interest rates declined.
This improvement in valuation is shown on Slide 9. We moved from an unrealized loss position at March 31 of $849
million to a gain of $400 million at the end of the second quarter. In total, fixed income securities improved by $1.7

billion. With credit spreads widening during the quarter, this increased valuation is attributable to declining interest
rates, which more than offset our realized losses on derivatives.
Equities fell $483 million from March 2010. After-tax and DAC, our unrealized position improved from a small loss to
a gain position of $328 million.
Finally on Slide 10, the combined impact of our income and the improvement in unrealized capital gains resulted in an
improvement in capital to $18 billion, driving book value per share up 3% from March 2010 and 19% from June 2009.
Assets at the holding company remained at $3.1 billion and while our estimated statutory surplus declined slightly to
$14.9 billion, we did take a dividend of $200 million from the insurance company up to the holding company. All and
all, it was a solid quarter. We continue to proactively manage our portfolio and are focused on executing on our
strategic priorities.
With that I'll turn it back to Tom.
Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Let me do a quick recap before we go to questions. We delivered another profitable quarter despite the weather and
volatile investment markets, the result being that we built capital and increased book value per share. Our underlying
combined ratio outlook for 2010 remains at 88 to 90. Auto continues to produce strong returns. Both homeowners and
Allstate Financial showed continuing improvement this quarter. Investments posted solid returns as we continue to
proactively manage our portfolio and we continue to take actions designed to grow our business profitably.
So let's open it up for questions, Matt.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Keith Walsh from Citi. Your question, please?
<Q - Keith Walsh>: Hey good morning, everybody. First question around auto, you know, we're seeing a few carriers
out there offering one-year policies to boost retention. Maybe if you can just talk about the impact, if any, this is having
on the market and then I've got a follow up. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: All right, Keith, this is Tom. I'll give
you my view and then Joe may have a view. I don't see it really having any impact on the market right now.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Yeah, a similar thought, Keith. You know it's an opportunity – it's the same trade off we all
deal with all the time and we're not seeing it drive enormous shifts.
<Q - Keith Walsh>: Okay. Great. And then the second question on the homeowners' side, how far along are you guys
in optimizing your geographic risk? And I guess I have a personal interest in this as you guys dropped me last year in
Queens, New York. Your agent told me there was hurricane risk there, so thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well as you know we've gotten a lot –
I'll give you a longer-term perspective, Keith, on where we have gone from, and Joe might want to talk about where we
are headed to, because your question is both a macro question and then obviously a regional and local question on
geographic concentration of risk. As you know, we have been working hard to reduce our catastrophe losses, in
particular since 2006. We are down a million policies in homeowners as we have exited things like earthquake
insurance high-risk zones, including New York. Of course there was the 1938 hurricane that went across Long Island,
which if happened again could lead to dramatic flooding in New York and lots of severe damage. We are getting
smaller around the coasts, and we'll continue to get smaller around the coasts until such time as somebody comes up

with a way to predict and price for hurricane risk.
Joe might want to talk about the work he's doing on improving homeowners at a more micro level than the macro
answer I just gave you.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Keith, it's a good question and one we're working on. I think there's several fronts we have
got to deal with on this issue. One Tom was talking about was clearly peak risk on big cats, hurricane and earthquake.
Another layer is just the returns we have got in those areas. The third is how do we deal with what a lot of times we'll
call non-model cats, meaning things other than hurricanes and earthquakes. Returns, they are -- sometimes that's a
function of adjusting the coverage, or sometimes that's a function of rates, and then just profitability in the underlying
book overall.
We have got big pockets of the country where we feel terrific about things right now. We've got other pockets that are
one or two renewal cycles away from where we need them to be, and we've got other pockets that are further away.
We're banging away at all of those items and making significant progress.
I think you can see improvements in the underlying combined ratio in homeowners. You can see impacts on the written
rate that we are taking relative to lost-cost trends. And we're going to keep pounding away at it. We believe this is a
business where you can make an appropriate return on the core piece of it. We've got more angst about the aggregate
cat exposures, but we think that that there are ways to improve that position, and we're going to keep pounding away at
those. It's a slower and more arduous process than we or I think anybody in the industry would like, but it's an
achievable one.
<Q - Keith Walsh>: Thank you.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: And by the way, if you want to talk about your auto policy, I'm available afterwards.
<Q - Keith Walsh>: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel from Langen McAlenney. Your question, please.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Good morning. Just a question on your comment in your Press Release, actions to improve
Encompass profitability negatively impacted results. Were you talking about top line or bottom line? Maybe you could
bring us up to speed on what the actions at Encompass that you're taking are?
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Bob, we had some programs inside of Encompass over the last couple of years. We have
been working on remediating them, which broaden Encompass's appetite out of its core area of bundled or packaged
Auto and Home for a higher-end segment of the market. And we went into a much more standard and near-standard
mono-line segment of the Auto marketplace. We expanded distribution there. And we got ourselves a little out ahead of
our skis and got some profitability problems there. As we have been working on that to fix it, a lot of what you are
seeing is an impact, and our comments were around top line. We've have had to roll some of that business off, or
remediate it or move it from a pricing perspective. We have had to take some actions with some of those more auto,
mono-line auto distributors, and that's got top-line pressure on that business.
We are trying to be as laser focused as we can on that, but sometimes as we're shooting at those problem areas, it's
rippling a little bit into what I would say is our core wheelhouse, and we're trying to mitigate that issue, but it's very
much an issue around the profitability that we've got to deal with before we can get the core healthy and growing again.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Okay. If I could follow up, you made a reference about cat risk management actions paying
off, I think. What are the metrics that you're looking at in the quarter that made you happy that you made some
progress?

<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Bob, let me maybe, -- I don't think we
meant to imply we thought we had Homeowners fixed and that on a non-model cat basis we're making money, because
you look at a combined ratio that's above 100, that doesn't even give you a return at all, much less an adequate return on
your capital. And this business, given that -- that business, given its volatility requires a lot of capital. So we have a lot
of work to do. I think Joe was just pointing out, if you look at the trends and the delta, the combined ratio is down from
where it was last year. Not where we want it to be, but it's down. I think that's the progress he's talking about.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Yeah. The ex-cat loss ratio had over a point of improvement. We obviously have
improvement in total, but that's some difference in aggregate cat volume. And I think as we look at the P&L stats that
we'll track, we're seeing continued improvement there. So yeah, it wasn't an attempt to suggest that we were at victory.
I think, Bob, your question was what are we seeing in the quarter that was showing improvement as opposed to...
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Yes.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: ...we achieved victory.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Right. Thank you. I think you answered my question, and gave me another one too, as a
bonus. Thank you.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: We're here to help.
Operator
Our next question is from Vinay Misquith from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Hi. Good morning. Two questions. The first question is, could you provide an update on the
actions you're taking to improve retention and sales? And what impact that that you see they may have on profitability?
Would higher discounts negatively impact profitability? And then associated with that, we've seen two competitors
growing share, of course one quite significantly. If you could help us understand their growth versus your growth? And
is it just a question of price in the end?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me maybe take a little shot at it
and then we'll just tag team it here. In terms of retention, as we said, retention was flat this quarter. Customer loyalty,
whether it's statistically significant or not, was down a couple of tenths the way we measure it. So the things we are --
but it bounces around from quarter to quarter. The things we try to do to drive retention and referrals up are obviously
treating people well, having good level of interaction. The way, when we measure our interaction, we're actually doing
better now than we've done in the past. The way we are, Vinay, making that real is if people do not do a good job for
our customers and we have the measure down to individual agencies and individual claim adjusters, then they no longer
have the opportunity to be part of our team.
So in addition to that we have a number of positive things we've done like put it into the 401(k) so that our 36,000
employees, their retirement is based on getting, part of their retirement is based on getting customer loyalty up. And
then we have a number of other, I'll call them operational programs in terms of how do you explain a premium change
to everybody, all the things we do every day and the millions of calls we get to make sure we do a better job there.
The high discounts that you're referencing really aren't driven as much towards retention. We don't have a
retention-based pricing model as you would see State Farm does. Those are around the cross-line sales. And so Joe may
want to make a comment about how that is a two-for in terms of driving retention.
And then I don't think we can comment on other people's growth. I think you can look at what we have. We're up
14%-plus if you exclude a couple of places. That said, you can't exclude a couple places in total because we're
supposed to grow in total. We think we're making conscious decisions to do what's right overall, but I can't speak for
why other people are growing.
Joe, maybe you want to talk some about the discounts and the other things you're doing.

<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Yeah. A couple of different points on it, Vinay. Your overriding question at the end was, is
it just about price? I don't think, and our data suggests, and a lot of customer insight suggests, that price is important,
but people don't make buying decisions solely on price. If you're fundamentally out of whack on pricing, that's an issue.
But if you're in the game, there's other things that folks think about.
So we're focusing on a full breadth of those. Sometimes that's product breadth, sometimes that's ease of access,
sometimes it's the customer service that Tom was talking about. It's a lot of things. And we do well and are working on
improving a lot of those, the strength in Your Choice Auto, the ability to have a more effective homeowners product
and be able to bundle that, the ability to let discounts for multi-line customers interact drives increased retention, it
drives increased customer satisfaction and in some cases there's some interplay that we find in loss ratio, relative to
those items.
As you take -- your question on discounts, if you look at one individual item, sure if we sell the same customer and we
didn't have a discount before and we do have a discount now, that obviously reduces profitability. The issue is isolating
that one item without looking at everything else that sort of works underneath it. And I guess the best I can give you
without providing competitive intel, is we are not moving off of our combined ratio guidance or excuse me, our
combined ratio outlook, the 88 to 90. So what we are doing fits inside of that range. So that may help you get a sense of
what that's worth.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Vinay, there's one other comment you
might want on growth. You didn't ask about advertising, but I think when you look at growth, you also need to look at
advertising. And often times the Street looks at distribution channels and relates that to growth as opposed to the entire
way you go to market, which includes your distribution channel, but also includes the amount of advertising you do.
Obviously some channels, like direct require more advertising and can support more advertising because of their
economic structure. But also larger sizes can support a fair amount of advertising. So you see us continue to do more
advertising. We have changed our advertising in this quarter. It is – I won't say a war, but it's pretty close to escalating.
We have continued to step up. And you will see our advertising last year, we did a lot of price, so shop and save. We
did that because we felt we were being viewed as too high priced relative to others because of our silence, not because
of where we actually were.
So last year we did a lot of shop and save, and you save $500 or $350 by switching to Allstate. This year, you will see
us shifting more to value, which is the new component we've added to our advertising program with the mayhem ads, is
dollar for dollar, nobody protects you
better than Allstate. That has a price message embedded in it, but it's really to Joe's point, it's about price and the value
you get from it. You'll see our ads also target – this set of ads targets a younger group, where the continuation of our
Dennis Haysbert initiative is targeted to the broader brand positioning.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: That's great. My second question was on the capital. This was the first quarter result or
dividend being paid up to the holding company. Does that indicate that management is more comfortable with the
capital at the operating subsidiaries? And in looking at the capital versus the past, would premium to surplus be a fair
metric and would you be holding more capital now versus the past, since we've gone through a rough period over the
last couple of years?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Don will tell you that, but I'm
not sure, Vinay, if that's really one question or three.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: I'm sorry.
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Allstate Insurance Company>: Vinay, first
of all, I think the fact that we took a dividend from the insurance company up to the holding company of 200 million is
an indication that we are getting more comfortable. So I would never say never, but it's nice to return back to kind of
this tradition of the insurance companies providing capital to the parent company. So yes, I think it does indicate an
increasing level of comfort.

As it relates to the level of capital we want to hold, I think we are still comfortable, very comfortable with the level we
have at the parent. I would still argue that this is an environment where having a dollar too much is less painful than
having a dollar too little. So we'll continue to reassess that number over time, but we are quite comfortable with the
level today.

Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann from J.P. Morgan. Your question, please?
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: Hi, good morning, everybody. A couple of questions. First, could you just expand on
the conversation or just expand on your comments with respect to California and Florida versus the rest of the country?
And in particular, I would be curious if maybe you can talk about differences in PIF trend, as well as maybe differences
in the rate filings between the rest of the world and those two states?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I'll do that and I'm going to sort
of balance trying to help you with that and competitive intel. So I'm not going to give you everything you're looking
for. I'll apologize on the front end. California and Florida had some pretty high new business levels for us last year and
have lower new business levels this year for slightly different reasons.
California – we have backed off somewhat just because that's historically a market place that can be challenging from a
profitability perspective. We feel okay about where our numbers are there now. And we are trying not to let it get into
an overheated spot. So some of the growth there has slowed somewhat, the new business has slowed.
Florida, we've got a little bit of a different spot. We are seeing some profitability challenges there. We are responding
to those challenges. They are driven with some underlying PIF and BI trends that we think are heavily environmental.
And we are working on combating those trends, but it is a spot where it causes us some profitability angst, and we are
responding to that, which also causes perhaps a bigger decrease in new business, and it's more substantive.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: And then with respect, I mean, are the retentions dropping in those states too?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The retentions are holding all right in
those spots. I'm going to try not to give you too much precision on them. It's a bigger issue around new business. I'd
expect in Florida, where we're going to take more aggressive actions we may see that move a little bit.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: Okay. And then if we just wanted to think about, and I don't know what stat you're
comfortable giving on this, but I would just be curious if you look at the country, how many states are you seeing
positive PIF growth versus states where maybe it's more the status quo and then states where it's dropping. I know the
size of the state will vary, but I'd just be curious about that number.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me try to give you this picture
which is a little bit different than what you're asking for. Ex-Florida and California, I think we saw our new business up
over 10% across the rest of the country, so when you track the relative levels of new business, you can see that those
are driving the new business trends we are see seeing. Other than California and Florida, the aggregate's up 10%.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: Okay, is it fair to – is the retention for the rest of the country higher than Florida and
California?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm trying to think through it. I don't
believe it's meaningfully different, no.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: And then if I could speak just two numbers questions hopefully that are quick. One is
just underwriting tax rate in the quarter looked, the tax rate under P&C underwriting looked high, and then also I'm just
curious with the underfunded pension whether you have any cash contribution requirements in 2010 and 2011.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Maybe you can follow-up with Bob
on the underwriting tax rate you are talking about. I don't understand.
<A - Robert L. Block, Investor Relations>: It's the investment tax.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: More taxable income than investment.
<A - Robert L. Block, Investor Relations>: Yeah, the investment portfolio.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: As you know, we've been shifting --
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: Oh, no, I was looking at the underwriting only. But I'll follow up that's fine.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We'll get back to you on that one.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: And then the pension?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The pension fund, we continue to put
cash into the pension fund whenever we need it to keep it properly funded. We put cash in last year. I'm sure we will
definitely put in cash this year just to make sure, but part of it depends on the investment results. But it's not a major
driver of operating income one way or the other in terms of how much cash we put in.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from Stifel Nicolaus. You question please.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Thanks. I want to start with a question on the Allstate financials. You had a good quarter, but as
I understand it, two of the core strategic initiatives are to increase sales through the Allstate channel and to focus much
more on underwriting spread or benefit spread than investment spread, and neither of those seems to be showing up in
the quarterly results. So I was hoping that I could get Matt to talk about that a little?
<A - Matthew Winter>: This is Matt, Meyer. Well, actually I think it did show up in the quarterly results. The
underwritten products, which is as Bob said, Interest Sensitive life, Traditional life and Accident and Health actually
grew 12% over prior year. The drop that you saw in premium and deposits was on the annuity side, which fell about
60%. So I think we did see the exact growth that we referred to. Our strategic prong, our two primarily strategic prongs
are, as you said, to increase underwritten products and de-emphasize spread based products, number one. And from a
distribution channel perspective, to focus on the Allstate agencies and the work site division. And both of those are
areas we saw growth in.
And the de-emphasis of the spread-based products, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, as you know, we reported last
quarter that we exited with the outside bank and broker dealer channel, which was almost exclusively a spread-based
product channel for us. That had the result of immediately decreasing the amount of spread based business that was
being put on the books. So maybe tell me if there is something else that you are looking at that would imply something
differently?
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Yeah. I guess what I was looking at in terms of the distribution is that premiums and deposits
were down almost 10% in Allstate agencies, but flat in independent agents and the profit in the quarter seems to come
more from interest spreads than benefit spreads.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The second piece is going to be a
transition, right. I mean, the second piece is we had a large portion of our profitability has always been generated from
a spread base so just by the fact that we're reducing the size of the balance sheet there, it will take a while to come
down, Meyer. You can look at the size of the balance sheet, and that should come down. I don't think you should
expect – the accounting in that business is a lot like Mr. Coffee. You pour it all in at the top and it comes out really

slowly. So changing the mix of business takes a while for it to come out a different way. Matt, I don't know if you have
any other insights into the...
<A - Matthew Winter>: No. I think I now see what you're looking at, you're looking at the part of the breakdown on
premium deposit by a distribution channel where you show the drop in Allstate agencies from 542 last quarter to 523.
But that is a conglomerate that includes spread-based products and so the drop there was in the spread-based products
and the pickup was in the underwritten products.
<A - Matthew Winter>: And if I remember correctly, I think we had a big bank promotion last year. So I think we did
a lot through the bank and the agency channels.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That's true but the comparison I just
talked about was from prior quarters, from first quarter this year. So it continues to show the decline in the
spread-based products.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: And if I can throw one to Joe, do you have a sense in terms of why you've had consistent
success in the Allstate distribution channel for Auto, why that information hasn't been as helpful with Encompass as we
might otherwise expect?
<A – Joseph Lacher, Jr.>:I think we made a miscalculation a couple of years ago on how we used some of that data and
in the differences in the behavior within the independent agency channel. When you're dealing with an independent
agency channel, you can get subjected much more quickly to adverse selection because you're getting a CSR, customer
service rep inside of the independent agency, effectively sometimes spread sheeting you, and you don't see that the
same way in a captive or exclusive agency channel. We put some products and some pricing programs in and then we
expanded our distribution to a lot of auto specialists that got closer to being bucket shops which were outside of our
Encompass staff's normal agency management expertise, and that group tends to exploit that weakness more rapidly
than other folks. The combination of those two things put pressure on us, and we just didn't see it as quick as we should
have.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.

Our next question is from Ian Gutterman from Adage Capital. Your question, please.
<Q - Ian Gutterman>: Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the capital position. I guess first the stat capital is lower than
it was at the start of the year. Can you talk about why you're comfortable with that because your leverage ratios are still
higher on a stat basis than they were pre-crisis? And then related to that, can you just walk through the changes in the
quarter, why, even after the dividend, it looks like we were down about 300 million even though you had positive
earnings in both segments?
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Allstate Insurance Company>: I think the
answer to the question on the – first of all you answered to some extent the first question with the second, which is the
dividend coming up. We've been continually building capital in Allstate Insurance Company for the last couple of
years. And so the fact that it was a little bit higher doesn't particularly concern me. We'd let it get a little bit high. I
think we're comfortable with the levels of that and felt it was appropriate to get back to the point of taking dividends
out on a more regular basis. That's why we took the $200 million out. We still remain fully capitalized at the Allstate
Insurance Company level.
<Q - Ian Gutterman>: Okay, but just to follow up, Don, you were down 500 million in capital sequentially and only
200 was the dividend. So that's what I was trying to clarify, why did the other 300 go down?

looking at the piece including Allstate Life. That 14.9 is inclusive of what's down at Allstate Life.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And there was a loss there.
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Allstate Insurance Company>: Yeah. So
that's not just Allstate Insurance, that's not just Protection's results.
<Q - Ian Gutterman>: Okay. So basic Protection, the pure Protection was flattish and Allstate Life was down?
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Allstate Insurance Company>: That's
probably about right, yeah.
<Q - Ian Gutterman>: Okay, and that was because the realized loss – that essentially most of the realizes losses were
at the Life company center, net basis, Life didn't make money. Is that right?

Our next question comes from Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America. Your question, please.
<Q - Alison Jacobowitz>: Hi. Thanks. To the extent you can, given all the detailed comments you gave, I was
wondering if you could talk some about how you're feeling about the total company premium growth, Property
Casualty, obviously, for the second half of the year given where you are in the Florida, California cycle and the fact
that we saw some growth this quarter? And then also, I also, to the extent that you can comment, how you're thinking
about, or have your thoughts changed at all about share repurchase and where you are in that process?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Alison, this is Tom. In terms of the
overall growth in premiums in the second half, you know we don't give forecasts. We don't do the detailed guidance.
All we give is the combined ration ex-cats and reserve releases. So I think I would give you just the generic answer,
which is, we expect to grow the business. We're working hard to grow the business. We don't want to grow the business
and throw profitability out the door, and so it's a balancing act and it changes from quarter to quarter. Our long-term
goal, though, is obviously to grow market share in the Property Casualty business, and we've talked about all the ways
in which we are trying to do that.
In terms of share repurchase, Don said it well, which is we're comfortable where we're at. We're longer capital today
than we were at the beginning of the year, which has been one of our objectives for the year. We've always had a track
record of giving that money back to shareholders when we think the company no longer needs it. So I think over the
last 10 or 12 years we've generated about $28 billion of capital, about 24 billion of that has gone back to the
shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We have no reason to change our stripes on that one. If we
have a good use for the money, we'll put it to use. If we don't, we'll give it back. But at this point in the economic
climate where we are this year, we feel like it's better to be long capital than to be right at the edge given that no one's
really yet certain where this whole economy will move.

<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Great. Thank you very much. Just a basic question on the investment portfolio. Can you talk a
little bit about what we're seeing in new money yields on the, let's just focus on the P&C portfolio? And sort of what
sort of instruments are we investing in? And how is duration changing for new investments relative to the average,
please?
<A - Judy Greffin>: Dan, it's Judy Greffin. In terms of what we're investing in. So as you know, we have reduced our
exposure in munis, commercial real estate and to some extent in equities. And the reinvest has largely been in
corporates and government securities. And the yields on the reinvests are generally lower because of the rate
environment we're in, generally lower than the overall yield on the portfolio, yet not significantly lower at this point.
And I guess the second part of your question was – or the third part of your question, so the yields were generally
lower. And then...
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Where we're putting the money.
<A - Judy Greffin>: Oh. We're putting the money in corporates and [inaudible].
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The duration question.
<A - Judy Greffin>: Oh, the duration on the portfolio, on the Property and Casualty side we're trying to keep it right
around four years.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: And so when you say the new money yields aren't much lower, I want to say off the top of my
head, the fixed income average was around, was that around 3.5% after tax?
<A - Judy Greffin>: On the reinvest?
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: No, the average portfolio yield. I'm just pulling up the supplement again.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Pretty close.
<A - Judy Greffin>: It's around there, yes.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: And are we able to put new money to work at the four-year duration above 3%.
<A - Judy Greffin>: No, not generally above three percent, at four duration, but it's around there.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Great, thank you very much.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Dan, we've also been putting some
more money in high yield and stuff, so I mean you've got to look at it. It's not all govies right? I mean obviously that
would easy to do. I think when you look at investment income as well, you have to look at the mix and you would see
that we've gotten more fully invested as we've moved out of the period last year where we stated – with liquidity
improving in the overall portfolio such that we now have of the 100 billion about 35 billion is available on a quarter. So
still it's highly liquid and it's gotten more liquid as the markets have opened up. And as that's happened we've taken
some other investments, which were highly liquid and moved those into higher yielding securities. So there's a lot of
stuff going on under the hood there.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Is the cash balance included in the taxable fixed income yield or is that excluded?
<A - Judy Greffin>: Cash balance would be excluded from the taxable fixed income yield as I understand it.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Got it. Great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks. Just a question on the portfolio. So your sales during the quarter, did you sell mostly
GO's, revenue bonds or both?
<A - Judy Greffin>: So you're asking about the muni portfolio?
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Correct.
<A - Judy Greffin>: And within the muni portfolio we are targeting certain areas to sell. But we have sold some
general obligation bonds. But generally what we're looking at is selling out of things like appropriation debt,
healthcare, more along the revenue bonds, non-essential service revenues.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: So those are the bonds you are selling currently?
<A - Judy Greffin>: Those are the bonds that we're selling in the muni portfolio.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got you.
<A - Judy Greffin>: For the most part – I mean we're selling quite a bit so you're going to get a broad pass at the
portfolio as well, but the things that we're focused on where we'd like to reduce are those.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Are those, okay. And how do you think about your ideal exposure to this asset class? Is it as
a percentage of the portfolio, is it relative to GAAP equity, and how much weight do you give the tax advantage from
these bonds?
<A - Judy Greffin>: I think it's a little bit of all of the above relative to the asset base as well as relative to GAAP
equity, and that's the way we look at pretty much the whole portfolio. So munis wouldn't be any different than the rest
of the portfolio. Yet as I think Tom said and I've said in the past, when we decided that we were going to reduce the
balance in the muni portfolio it was largely because we felt that it was just too large a component of the Property &
Casualty lead portfolio.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great, thanks. And can you talk a little bit about the Good for Life program, I know there's
been a few announcements recently and just kind of give us an update on how that's progressing relative to your plan
and how we should think about that program?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Sure, Michael. It's Matt Winter.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks.
<A - Matthew Winter>: First, as you recall we just launched a pilot program for Good for Life in July, so we're in the
initial stages of testing the product, testing our distribution. As you know, it's a brand new product. It's a bundled
product. It's completely electronic application. It's simplified issue. It's done on the signature pad and so it's a pretty
new process and a pretty new product and a pretty new technology. We're actually using an Allstate workplace division
admin platform for it. So we have a very deliberate phased in rollout process and so we're still in the pilot program. We
don't even go to the next regions until September and then we begin the rest of the national roll out between September
and January of next year.
So far though we've worked out some of the kinks in the process and the kinks in the technology. The feedback from
both the customers and from the distributors has been very good, so we're pleased with the initial feedback, and we're
adopting some of the process changes that we learned during the pilot program to make the national launch better. So
this is not a short-term quick hit. This is part of a fairly long-term multi-pronged effort to demystify our insurance
offerings for the middle class consumer and to further engage our agency owners in the sale of Allstate Financial
products. So I wouldn't expect any dramatic quick hit. I would expect this to be part of a sustained effort to transform
Allstate Financial within the greater enterprise.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: How does it – on the commission side, can you talk about how that works relative to your
other life products or your current exclusive agency personalized products?

a 10% levelized commission for the life of the product, 10% of premiums as paid. So unlike the traditional commission,
this looks and feels more like the auto and helps them build value in their agencies.
So one of the things that we wanted to help them understand is that Allstate financial can truly help them build the
value of their book in the same way their auto insurance helps them build that sustainable value.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And Michael, let me use it as an
example, how the customer focus makes a difference in terms of what you're doing. This is about thinking about
customers as cash flow managers, rather than risk managers. If you look at most middle income people, they don't think
about how much money should I put to life, how much to disability, how much to critical care, how much I should save
for retirement and how do balance all of those things off. The product that Matt and his team have designed does it for
them. So it says, look, how much money do they have a month? It's got some simple packages, so the demystification
that you talked about. So, if you don't die, then you get half of your money back at 65. It's not a complicated formula,
it's not here's what the investment portfolio does, here's the asset selection you have to make. It's really simple. It's
really fast. It reflects the fact that they don't want to spend a ton of time on something where they're not putting that
much money to work.
So this is about really designing it from the customer back, as opposed to from our risk perspective forward. I think it's
an – and you will see that in other things we do, other new products. That's a little bit what Your Choice Auto is about,
some other products we have coming up in Allstate Protection will be similar kinds of things, which is just make it
simple, base it on how they think about the world, not how we think about the world.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: And you referenced the economy in your opening comments, Tom, how does that factor into
the roll out? And have you seen the impact of that in the test area of this new product? Thank you for answering my
questions.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't really think it impacts the
rollout much. The rollout is going to be when Matt's ready to hit the accelerator and we're ready to go. And he and Joe
feel like this system will put a lot of that product through it. But the economy has made people much more risk averse,
much more willing to save money and think about their future as opposed to just current consumption.
So we think, from an overall macro perspective, this focusing on their needs, their focus on cash, and to think longer
term will be in the sweet spot, but it doesn't really impact the roll out. The roll out will be based on doing it right.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks again.
<A - Robert L. Block, Investor Relations>: Matt, we'll take one more question.

Our final question is from Cliff Gallant of KBW [Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods]. Your question, please.
<Q - Clifford Gallant>: Thank you, a question on just loss trends. In the Auto/Physical side, you saw some favorable
developments this quarter and the pay severity trends also look negative. I'm just curious as to what is driving the
deflationary trends do you think at this point? And to what degree are you pricing that into your products?
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: I missed part of your question, which specific ones were you asking about, Cliff?
<Q - Clifford Gallant>: Just Auto/Physical damage.
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: Auto/Physical damage, we continue to drive our claim processes to be as effective as we
can around that. I think we are finding that those processes are working effectively. We had some roll out of some new
claim processes over the course of the last 18 months. For a little while, as we brought that new claims system online,

that may have slowed us down a shade. And now we are back into our stride. So you may see a piece of that running
through there. There may be a little bit of it that is economy related in terms of what we are seeing in underlying costs
that may be reversing some inflationary trends we saw last year.
It's modest numbers overall. So we are watching them. Generally, the aggregate loss trends, when you combine
frequency and severity, are in line with what we were expecting, so they're in line with what our pricing had
anticipated. So I don't see a lot of change as a result of those.
<Q - Clifford Gallant>: Is that, in terms of relating that to your pricing though, when I look at your slide show, or
your financial supplement on Page 16, where you talk about the historical rate of impact of rates, and the Allstate
brand, standard auto, it looks like under a state-specific percent change, the trend has been that you're – seems like
you're seeing less change over each of the last four quarters. Is that an indication that you're just relatively happy with
the level of pricing right now for your Allstate brand standard auto?
<A - Joseph Lacher, Jr.>: That would be a reasonable way to look at it. You know we also, when we look at what we
did over the last 15 months and we talked about this a little before, if you dial back to the early part of last year, there
were big challenges in the economy. We'd seen even more challenges in Homeowners than we had right now. There
was a lot of pressure from a lot of different functions. The capital conversations, as a company, we were having with
you were ones where you were concerned that we -- did we have enough, not did we have too much? So we took a
conservative view of our pricing there and said, you know what, we're going to make sure our Auto business is
performing. We anticipated some adverse loss trends potentially coming around the economy, so we made sure we
were quick on that.
I think we're seeing some other competitors catch up with some of those observations and trailing where we were a
little bit, but our goal was to make sure that business performed well in the environment with all that other uncertainty.
And it's done that. The loss trends weren't perhaps as pessimistic as we anticipated. And when you look at it over the
course of maybe a total view of two years, we're in line with where we'd expect to be but we may have timing that may
have been a little accelerated.
<Q - Clifford Gallant>: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you all for your questions. Let me just close here. Second quarter just reflected continued progress on the
strategies we've undertaken to drive shareholder value. So we've achieved this performance by being good at what we
do and taking decisive action. Our plan is to continue to improve shareholder value by raising returns, lowering
volatility and growing our business. So thank you all for investing in Allstate, and we'll see you next quarter.
