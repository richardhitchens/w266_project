MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Stephanie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background
noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my
pleasure to turn the call over to Ms. JaCee Burnes, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your
conference.
JaCee M. Burnes
Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference
Call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the
release is available on the Exelon website.

The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates
that are subject to various risks and uncertainties as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings.
Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from
management's projections, forecasts and expectations, and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings.
Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's, President and CEO; and Jack Thayer, Exelon Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by many other members of Exelon's executive management
team who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call.
I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher M. Crane
Thank you, JaCee, and good morning to everybody. We'll start off on slide two. As you saw in our release this
morning, Exelon has delivered solid performance for the quarter. Our operating earnings per share were $0.61 for the
second quarter, in line with our expectations.
Our nuclear organization continued to run the fleet well, turning in a capacity factor of 93.4% for the second quarter, a
period that included 51 planned refueling outage days at two units. The first six months of the year, the capacity factor
was 93.5%.
The performance of the entire generation fleet was very good. Our commercial operations also performed well in
actively managing the portfolio. In the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, our decision to be ahead of ratable and prior
quarters allowed us the opportunity to slow down our hedging volume in this quarter.
In Texas, as prices moved up during the second quarter, we accelerated our hedging activity to lock in the upside of
2012 and 2013. In addition, our retail sales channels are meeting expectations for added margins and volumes.
As you can see in the hedge disclosure, the second quarter had a dip in the market. But we believe in July we've made
up over half of that on the open gross margin. And Ken and Jack can address those questions as we get to the Q&A.
At our utilities, this summer has brought extreme heat along with some violent storms. Our utility system weathered the
heat extremely well, when we experienced eight to 12 consecutive days of temperatures above 90 degrees across the
three service territories.
The storm brought more of a challenge, particularly in the BGE service territory, which experienced one of the most
damaging storms in BGE's nearly 200-year history. Both Maryland and Illinois were hit by significant storms. In total,
the utilities restored power to approximately 1.2 million customers during the first week of July. I would really like to
thank our utility crews at BGE, ComEd and PECO for their tireless efforts to restore the service to our customers, also
– or often through intense heat periods.
We spoke to you at length at our Analyst Day in June and provided you with a significant amount of information. We
remain on track with what we told you. Not much has changed. Therefore, our presentation – our prepared remarks and
presentation today are short, leaving additional time for questions. Additionally, in the spirit of continued transparency,
we have provided additional information in our appendix, which should assist you in financial modeling efforts.
I do continue to be extremely pleased with our merger. The operations has been seamless, due in a large part to a very
effective integration planning and how well we are working together. We remain on track to achieve $170 million of
merger related O&M synergies for 2012. Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our 2012 full-year
earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share, and we expect to be comfortably within that range.
Jack will cover our financial performance in greater detail in a few moments. But let me first give you an update on
regulatory developments at ComEd and BGE, and our expectations for growth capital at Exelon Generation over the
next three years. Turning to slide three, on June 22, the Illinois Commerce Commission agreed to rehear key elements

of the ComEd's 2011 formula rate filing, including the treatment of the pension asset. We view the ICC's decision as a
step in the right direction.
ComEd's goal is to provide customers with better service, more choices, and greater control over their electric bills. We
are committed to working with the regulators to make sure we can make the investments necessary to fulfill these
promises to our customers. We also believe our positions are solidly supported by the existing legislation. The ICC's
timeline for rehearing calls for an order by September 19 of this year with hearings beginning later this week. Reversal
of the original ICC decision on the rehearing items could improve ComEd earnings by as much as $0.10 per share in
2012.
Turning to BGE, on July 27, BGE filed a combined electric and gas rate case with the Maryland Public Service
Commission. The rate case reflects a $204 million increase in revenue requirements for both electric and gas, with a
requested ROE of 10.5%. BGE needs to make investments in assets and systems to maintain and improve electric
reliability, ensure gas safety, and meet increasing compliance obligations.
In order for BGE to continue to make these needed investments to serve the customers, it requires the opportunity to
earn a fair return. We expect an order from the Maryland PSC by February of 2013, with hearings to be set for later in
the fourth quarter.
Now I want to spend a few moments on our growth capital expectations for Exelon Generation for the next three years.
At our Analyst Day in June, we presented our CapEx expectations through 2014. In those numbers, we included $800
million of undesignated spend in our renewable business for 2013 and 2014. This is a conservative planning view
which affords us flexibility if we find the right opportunities. We continue to assess the viability of the spend. Our
decision to move forward with projects will be driven by value creation for our shareholders, which will largely be
determined by the extension of the federal investment tax credits and balance sheet flexibility.
Antelope Valley Solar Ranch 1 in California, is an example of this type of renewable project we find attractive. The
230-megawatt solar facility is progressing according to plan. The first portion of the project is expected to be online in
October of 2012, and we expect commercial operations in late in 2013. Antelope Valley will be free cash flow
accretive in 2013. And due to the project financing, we have minimal impact on our credit metrics as calculated by
S&P. We expect to fully recover our investment by 2015. If we find similar growth opportunities, we will pursue them.
We have created flexibility in our balance sheet by incorporating this undesignated spend.
Before I turn over to Jack to review our financial results, there are a few things I want to reiterate. First, this quarter, we
demonstrated our commitment to operational and financial results. I remain extremely pleased with the merger. It is
working. We're already seeing benefits. As I said at our Analyst Day, we have the right strategy, the right platform, the
right set of assets, and the right leadership to manage through the market downturn and deliver unparalleled upside
when the markets recover. In the meantime, we remain committed to our investment-grade balance sheet and our
dividend. Exelon is the best-positioned company in the industry.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack to cover more details on the finances.
Jonathan W. Thayer
Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will supplement the earnings press release issued this
morning, which includes a substantial level of detail about Exelon's financial results. Let's begin with a summary of this
quarter's financial results by operating company, on slide four. Due to the merger, the composition of current-quarter
earnings for ExGen, BGE and Exelon are not comparable to last year. Thus, I'll highlight a few key results for the
quarter in lieu of stepping through a comparison to last year.
We're pleased to have delivered non-GAAP operating results of $0.61 per share this quarter. Our earnings are tracking
well within our full-year guidance range as a result of excellent operational performance. ExGen's $0.47 non-GAAP
earnings per share contribution is in line with what we expected for the quarter. At the utilities, ComEd recorded $0.05
non-GAAP operating earnings per share this quarter, about $0.10 lower than it would have been if not for the impacts

of the ICC order in their formula rate case. Given that the Commission agreed to revisit their ruling in ComEd's
formula rate case, we're hopeful for a favorable outcome. The final decision will not be known until September 19.
Thus, ComEd's financial results reflect the year-to-date impacts of the May order.
PECO and BGE rounded out earnings this quarter with contributions of $0.10 and $0.02 per share, respectively. With
respect to weather, ComEd's quarter results include a $0.01 benefit due to June's above average heat, while the financial
impact from weather at PECO and BGE is negligible this quarter. At PECO, the above-average heat experienced in the
quarter was offset by fewer than normal heating degree days. And BGE's decoupling mechanism largely offset the net
impact of load variances.
Updated load trend slides for ComEd and PECO are in the appendix of today's presentation for you to review at your
convenience. You'll notice that PECO's load outlook has improved since our Analyst Day presentation. As a result of
positive developments surrounding the acquisition of the ConocoPhillips and Sunoco's Pennsylvania oil refineries,
PECO now expects a year-over-year weather normal decline of 2% versus the 3.3% decline in load previously
projected.
Turning to slide five. The commercial team continued to execute on the portfolio management and load serving
strategies outlined by Ken at Analyst Day. We've made progress on our growth objectives in the brief time since
disclosing our targets, and have locked in an additional $150 million of gross margin towards our new business targets
for the year.
In our Midwest to Mid-Atlantic baseload regions, we were able to slow the pace of our hedging activity this quarter in a
flatter market price environment. In 2013 and 2014, our hedge percentages increased 3% to 5% this quarter, versus a
typically ratable 8%. This opportunity was created due to our efforts to be ahead of ratable in the previous several
quarters when market conditions were more favorable.
In the ERCOT region, we captured value from the length we carried into the quarter and timed our sales to capture the
higher pricing prevalent earlier in the quarter. This execution led to $1 per megawatt hour increase in the effective
ERCOT realized energy prices for 2013 and 2014. We remain well-positioned to meet our load serving sales targets.
Our sales teams remain active in all competitive markets, renewing existing customers and attracting new customers
from all customer classes. We'll provide a more comprehensive status check and update of our load serving business
growth at EEI.
An update of Exelon's sources and uses of cash is on slide six. We've had some movement in our planned CapEx spend
for the year. However, the changes are primarily minor timing-related shifts and all 2012 projects are still on track,
including the $2 billion we're investing in attractive NPV-positive growth projects. The more significant changes in our
cash flow projections relate to tax settlements and debt financings.
Regarding tax settlements, the majority of the $550 million decline in cash from operations is associated with a shift in
the timing of refunds associated with settlements of our 2002 to 2006 tax filings with the IRS. The refunds, which have
been agreed to by the IRS appeals, are now expected to be delayed until some time in 2013 or 2014, due to a procedural
change in the handling of partial settlements.
Given the anticipated timing of the tax settlement, ComEd is pulling forward a previously planned 2013 issuance to
fund needs in the interim. At PECO, given the attractive interest rate environment, we are refinancing an incremental
$100 million of the planned debt retirements, bringing total issuance to $350 million. This will also help reduce
expected future financing needs.
In June, ExGen completed its planned $775 million debt issuance with solid pricing that compared well to its 2010 debt
offering. The 10-year and 30-year priced at 4.25% and 5.6%, respectively; compared to the 4.0% and 5.75% coupon
achieved for the 10-year and 30-year offerings in September of 2010. These funds will be used for general purposes of
the company, including investment in growth. ExGen also announced they completed a private exchange offer for all
the outstanding 7.6% senior notes due in 2032. Of the $700 million principal outstanding, more than 63% were
tendered in exchange for cash and notes that will expire in 2022 and 2042.

Going forward, this debt exchange will lower our annual pre-tax cash interest expense by approximately $7 million.
And I'm pleased to announce that we are executing on an amended expense strategy for $7 billion in credit facilities,
which will enable three key benefits. First, we'll extend the tenor by one year on Exelon Corp's, Exelon Generation's,
and PECO's facility; and by two years on BGE's credit facility, resulting in a 2017 maturity for all our facilities.
Second, we'll be able to realign the bank group for the combined company, bringing in new banks and ensuring all
banks lend to each operating company within the Exelon family. Third, we'll capture current market pricing, consistent
with what we pay on ComEd's $1 billion credit facility refinanced earlier this year. We expect to close on the amended
facilities in August.
Before I open up the call for questions, I want to look ahead to next quarter's earnings. We expect Q3 non-GAAP
operating earnings in the range $0.65 to $0.75 per share. And we remain confident that we will achieve our full-year
earnings target of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. Our earnings guidance range adequately accounts for the impact of weather
and incremental storms incurred in July. Most notably, it reflects $0.03 of incremental storm costs at BGE for the
derecho storm.
We are confident about achieving our financial targets this year and there are several factors that give us line of sight
on this goal, including our ability to hit synergy targets. To-date, we've initiated and completed several milestones that
will position us to achieve our $500 million run rate O&M savings, starting in 2014. Staffing and selection was
finalized at the end of June, contract negotiations are in progress to incorporate our increased scale and scope in vendor
contract pricing, and we eliminated an additional portion of our surplus credit facility.
And with that, we're ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from ISI Group.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Hi, good afternoon, guys.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: How you're doing?
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I'm good. I noticed that the open gross margin numbers and the hedge gross margin numbers are
down from the Analyst Day because you used a June 30 deck. But can you give us a sense of what pricing has done
since then?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yeah, Ken, you want to...
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Yes, Greg, June 30 was a relative low point from a pricing perspective. And prices were
largely down from $1.50 to $2.00. As of the end of July, here, the prices have rebounded about halfway. So $1.00 of
that price is back in energy prices; so commensurate with that, as Chris commented on, we would expect to see our
open gross margin calculation make its way halfway back up to where it was on April 30.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. And can you comment on whether there's been any sort of a public discussion about the
pension issue as it pertains to your rehearing in front of the ICC, amongst the commissioners or any other relevant
parties?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: There hasn't – make sure I understand the question, you're asking has there been any
public statement by the Commission on the rehearing?
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Or any other relevant interveners.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: No, the rehearing process will start, I guess, the end of this weekend?

<A - JaCee M. Burnes>: Yeah, we've got hearings start at the end of this week. The date for the Commission's order is
September 19. That's the drop dead date for it. The one thing that is of recent vintage that you may not be aware of, is
that there was a hearing held before the House Public Utilities Committee on July 10.
And we basically passed the resolution that we had filed on June 18th, passed it through the House Public Utilities
Committee, 22 yes, 1 no, on that date. So that was – basically, what that resolution does is points out the three big
issues that the Commission is taking upon rehearing and expresses the General Assembly's view that the three issues
were not decided in accordance with the legislation that they had passed.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: No, that's basically what I was asking. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning. Wanted to focus – just building on Greg's question on the power price
dynamics and the change, we saw some interesting dynamics in the sense of the power price falling at the same time
that gas – for gas rose. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the dynamics that you saw underlying sort of the
disconnect between the movement in gas and power?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: It's going to be driven off of load. But, Ken, you want to...?
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Stephen, you did see a decline in heat rate in the last couple of months. Obviously, some
of that is driven by increases in natural gas prices. We've noticed a tendency for power prices to be sluggish in how
they move relative to gas. And, really, as we got into the summer period and you started to see summer heat rates, spot
heat rates, increase, that has created a rebound somewhat in the power price dynamic, and you've seen power prices
come back up.
Again, it's a market that has a lot of different dynamics to it that are driven by future expectations of price. But as you
see reality in the spot market, it tends to have an influence on longer-term prices as well. And I think higher spot heat
rates have driven power prices up.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: That's very helpful. And then, just shifting over to Illinois briefly, if the hearing goes well in
Illinois, do you expect next year, you'd be in the range of your allowed ROEs, or would you expect a modest lag at that
time, if the rehearing goes well, on – sort of on the positive end of the range of outcomes?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yeah. If the hearing goes well, it resolves the issues that are causing us to under-earn.
As you remember, the rate, the formula rate is based off of 580 basis points above the composite treasury. So we would
get back to what we think the legislative package had allowed us to earn. Anne, is there anything...
<A - Anne R. Pramaggiore>: Yes, so, the three issues really takes care of the bulk of it. There's a few issues that the
commission did not take up on rehearing that will carry over. We will take them up on appeal. So there's a little bit of
cleanup on that, but we get very close.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great, thanks so much.

<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Yes, hi, good morning, everyone. Couple questions – first, just there's been some commentary
by other PJM generators that there's more maybe openness by PJM to review the MOPR rule in time for next year's
auction, could you comment at all on what your hearing on that topic?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yes, we are engaged in a dialogue with the Generators and PJM. I'll ask Joe
Dominguez to cover where we're at in process now.
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: We've had several discussions with PJM and other stakeholders. We remain cautiously
optimistic that were going to get revisions to the MOPR process in advance of next year's auction. Obviously, our
discussions are confidential, but I think there is widespread understanding of our concerns regarding the MOPR
exemption process. And I think, as time goes on, there is going to be an effort to change that process. That's about as
much as I can say about those discussions.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: We definitely want to do this in a cohesive manner, and go under the filing to FERC on
– I think it's the 205 – it's more of an uncontested, unified voice from PJM; but don't plan on stopping. We'll continue
to push the issue.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. Secondly, just should we still assume your asset sale related to the merger is closing
and will be announced sometime in August?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yes, we expect to have everything wrapped up within the timeframe allowed. I think
we have a 30-day extension that allows everything to be cleaned up by September 9. But it's well underway and don't
expect any bumps in the road.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And one last question. Just on the tax cash flow item that you mentioned and the like, I
hadn't recalled that being kind of delineated out as a special cash flow item. I just want to make sure that the, let's say,
the fixed income/rating agency community knew that there was a one-time tax cash flow item in this year?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Steve, this is Jack. We hadn't delineated out, within the cash from operations, the tax
item. But certainly in our conversations with, and our updates to, the rating agencies, we're updating them on the
expected timing of when those cash flows recover.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Good morning, guys. My questions have been mostly answered. But I just – on this cash
flow question, I just wanted to clarify that the difference between the $1.425 ComEd OCF in the Analyst Day and the
$975 million, is that pretty much all this tax item?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: It's taxes, as well as the recovery on the pension and other items related to the ICC order.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: So those were not x-ed out when you did the analyst meeting deck, then?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: The ICC rate order would have been x-ed out; but some of the assumptions around
working capital and timing, we did not build into our operating cash flow assumptions at that time, given the timing of
the announcement relative to our Analyst Day. So that's an incremental, roughly $75 million hit to working capital and
cash flow, relative to what we showed at Analyst Day.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: So the significant portion of it is the timing of tax cash.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: That's correct.

Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin from UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Good morning.
<A - JaCee M. Burnes>: Hi, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So first, with regards to BGE, I noticed you guys filed this rate case late last week. I'd
be curious to what extent do you expect, status quo, your ability to earn your ROE next year under these new rates, just
kind of from a rate lag perspective?
And then secondly, is there any chance, given some of the reliability standards in the state, to pursue any kind of
quasi-trackers? Is there any outlook for that at all?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: We – the filing is based off of our desire for that ROE. And I think we've done a good
job on stating the basis for that in the filing. So we'll proceed on that front. BGE has some room to make up – to catch
up on earnings. As you know, when we announced the intention for our merger, we had to hold BGE out of their rate
case.
So that's caused some damage, and there is – with the timing of the recovery. But we fully expect to state our case and
obtain those numbers. Ken, you want to talk about the Commission's philosophy on riders in Maryland, and the
potential of that?
<A - Kenneth W. DeFontes>: Sure. There's no question that the Maryland Commission has not been particularly
amenable to forward-looking adjustments. They didn't agree to support any of those in the recent cases. However, we
do think we have a compelling reason for proposing some of those. And then, in parallel with that, we are still looking
at opportunities to work with the Maryland legislature.
We had some success in what was called the STRIDE bill, looking at gas safety-related investments, which we almost
got across the finish line and we're going to be reintroducing that again. So we're going to be working both sides, both
the legislative and the regulatory process.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And then on the ExGen side, just be curious, we've seen some shifts in power
basis, AD-Hub, NI-Hub, and, perhaps more interestingly, towards the East. How structural are some of these changes,
as we're thinking about it? Or are they due to more temporary type item?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yes, Julien, clearly spot basis figures have dropped significantly and it really was
explained, in my mind, by coal-to-gas competition. So a significant amount of basis in the past has been driven by
cheaper power prices in the Midwest, cheaper plants and higher cost and higher heat rate units in the East. As gas and
coal competition occur, those basis numbers drop. I think that's the main reason we've seen a squeeze in basis; I don't
think there are major structural changes that are driving spot basis and forward basis right now. Obviously, with coal
retirements coming in 2015 and some reinforcement of the grid, there are going to be some changes.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you for the time.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of [ph] Jay Dobson.(31:12)
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Hi, [ph] Jay.
<Q>: Good morning.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Good morning.
<Q>: Chris, I wanted to follow up on your CapEx comments in your prepared remarks, particularly around renewables.
If the PTC is not extended, how much of that $800 million in 2013, 2014 would go away?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: You know we don't have an exact number. There are some projects that are still under
construction right now. We have Antelope Valley that will go into 2013. We'll still look at other opportunities. I would
say that the wind growth would be significantly reduced with the PTC going away. There probably will be some solar
opportunities left, and we'll continue to focus on those.
<Q>: And could you put sort of a number around what the wind going away would -- just as we all sort of stare at
CapEx and the like?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: If you look at the numbers, we have slated for 2014 and in that rounded-up CapEx
spend of about $425 million. We would look at other uses of that, if they created value. We just don't see the wind
being there to use that to – the market being there to need that expenditure. We'll continue to look at other areas.
<Q>: Okay. So we shouldn't assume the $425 million goes away. It might just be reallocated. So, if we're staring at the
bottom line of CapEx, don't assume PTCs go away; CapEx goes down; but maybe it gets reallocated. Is that the right
way to think about it?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: It has the potential to be reallocated, based off of the value of the investments that we
can find at the time. What we're trying to do in this period – we've talked about it as sustainable growth, is really
focused on the flexibility that we have on the balance sheet, look at what our potential investment opportunities could
be. They meet their hurdle rates, they help drive the out-year earnings, so it's not that we would – if wind is not there,
we're not investing any more. We go to different areas, and see if there's a good value proposition. And if not, we don't
spend the money.
<Q>: Perfect. And, Chris, do you all, as a corporation, have a view on PTCs?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: We do have a very strong view on PTCs. And, publicly, we're asking them to be
stopped. We do have a wind business. We think wind should be in the portfolio. But what's happening – I think there's
unintended consequences with all the fundamental shifts in the generating stack right now between coal retirements,
natural gas coming down; trying to subsidize a single source can create some market distortions.
And we're asking for a break period. Let's let the market stabilize. That PTC has been in place since 1992, I believe.
And I think that's enough time to jumpstart an industry, 20 years. So we've made it known, even as a wind company,
that it should be stopped. And let's stabilize the fundamentals so we all know where we can make our investments.
<Q>: Okay, perfect. Just two more questions, then. A quick one for Joe, I think. On the PJM MOPR – understanding
it's all confidential discussions – but assuming you've got to something that was somewhat unanimous and uncontested,
would it be your view that that's something FERC is willing to consider and approve?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: It is my view. I think if the stakeholders come together with proposed revisions that address
some of the defects in the exemption process and there's sufficient support for that, I think it would get through FERC
fairly easily. Obviously, the premise being that we get to that solution and we have some work to do to get there.
Again, we're cautiously optimistic we will.

<Q>: Awesome. And then, last question, I guess, to Ken. Just give a little granularity on what you're seeing on retail
margins in the Northeast.
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Yes, as I stated on Analyst Day, we expect margins in the $2 to $4 area. And we don't see
any reason to change that perspective.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Citigroup.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Just a quick clarification on slide 15, which is a helpful slide. In the footnotes, you guys talk
about how the CENG going in as D&A is not included in the stub estimate. Should that mean that it is included in the
full-year estimate? Or should we think of it that the accounting treatment for both the stub and the full-year are
comparable, so we can really compare those?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Do you want to cover that, Duane?
<A - Duane M. DesParte>: Yeah, no, the – you can think of that as comparable, the full-year earnings estimate on
only reflects BGE's contribution.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: CENG's.
<A - Duane M. DesParte>: CENG's, I'm sorry. I misunderstood the question.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: We're only recognizing the net profits from the JV, not trying to fold in the operating
expense. So, from an accounting perspective, it's comparable?
<A - Duane M. DesParte>: Yes.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Understood. And just to clarify...
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Brian, just the rationale for giving you this is in our generation statistics, we show the
megawatt hours under purchased power for CENG; and we wanted comparability, to the extent that you wanted to
model this on a P times Q basis, so you could model in the full impact of CENG's P&L.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Understood, understood. And then, also, the reason why the stub estimate and the full-year
estimate – like for taxes other than income, why they're similar? That's just due to rounding. Really, there's probably –
the full-year estimate is probably a little bit higher than the stub estimate, just pro rata-ing it up, right?
<A - Duane M. DesParte>: That's right. It's rounded to the nearest $50 million. And it's just – it's the nature of the
numbers that the spread is really within that $50 million band.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Appreciate it, thank you.

<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Thank you very much. I guess, yesterday, we heard for the first time that Midwest Gen may
find its way into bankruptcy at some point. If they were to reject contracts including, I guess, their obligation to deliver
capacity under RPM, what would happen to – would they have to re-run the auctions, basically? Or what would happen
with respect to sort of filling in that capacity that's already been sold in auctions?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yeah. I don't think we're prepared to address the Midwest Gen. And I hadn't heard
about that, but the commitments – the commitment in the auction, I don't – they would not re-run the auction. Joe or
Ken, you want to jump in? The default provisions are...
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Yeah, there are obviously default provisions and incremental auctions for people to buy
replacement capacity, if capacity drops out for any reason. We're not going to comment on, as Chris said, this Midwest
Gen's particular situation.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: And if you were to take Midwest Gen out of the equation, I mean can you give us a sense of
what reserve margins might be in Chicago because, as I understand it, that is a bottleneck?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: I don't think we know what Midwest Gen units cleared in any particular auction. We can't
know that. So we definitionally can't do that calculation.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: And then the last question for me is, it looks as if gas prices since the ones that you are using
as reference prices are up like $0.10. So how much of the July improvement is due to higher gas, and how much of the
July improvement in absolute price of power is due to market heat rate?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: I would say, Paul, it's due almost entirely to higher gas prices. There has been higher spot
heat rates in the mid-Atlantic and Midwest region; lower spot heat rates in the ERCOT region, so it depends on what
we're talking about here. But mostly, the increase in gas has driven a commensurate increase in power prices. But it's
not really a fundamental shift, from a forward sense, in heat rates at all. Heat rates are very flat from a 2013 to 2016
timeframe.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: So, I guess – so what would've caused the deterioration in the forward market heat rates?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Heat rates are typically inversely correlated to natural gas, so they will fall. Heat rates are
higher, relatively, then the year's historical heat rates have been. They reached a high point, with the low point in
natural gas a couple months ago, and have fallen. As we've indicated before, we believe that, from a forward sense,
these heat rates should be increasing fundamentally as coal plants retire. They are not doing so. Again, it's a sluggish,
illiquid market, where in the 2015, 2016 timeframe we don't see a lot of buying interest and buying activity.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Just talk a little bit about some of the feedback you've gotten from the rating agencies,
maybe even the fixed income community more broadly. And post the Analyst Day, in terms of not having plans for
either doing equity or convertible securities in the next year or so, in your base case?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yeah, we typically don't go into a lot of detail about the discussions with the agencies,
but we haven't had any conversations around it. We continue to look at our models. We continue to look at our growth
opportunities. We're very comfortable with cash from operations covering our operations requirements, including the
dividend. And so, if there is an equity, it would be off of a growth opportunity that we want to pursue, and it would
cover the upside of that, would cover the dilution of the equity issuance. But there hasn't been any real dialogue beyond
what we had with you at the Analyst Day.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And a question on the New York power market – there's obviously a very important
docket still open at the FERC regarding Zone J capacity pricing, but it will have a ripple effect throughout all of New
York. Can you just give your point of view about the regulatory structure of the New York market, whether you have
any concerns about the regulatory viability of how that capacity market is working and just insights into the ongoing
FERC docket?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: We think the New York ISO is looking outward to try to find ways to improve that
forward capacity market. And we do want to support that dialogue into how to stimulate the right kind of investment
into the market. I think they've had that discussion, looking forward, too. As far as the FERC filing issue...
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Yes, Chris, I think I'd just echo your comments. What we see in New York is really no
different than what we've seen in New England and PJM. There are MOPR issues in New York; there are issues
regarding questions about the state subsidizing generation. And I think we're working through those in the FERC cases
that have been ongoing. We saw the Astoria case that we were involved in get decided last month.
And I think there are continuing stakeholder discussions about how to handle capacity needs. The governor, obviously,
has a plan that is a combination of transmission and new generation. And we're taking a look at that. I don't see any
imminent problems there. I think they're the same issues that we confront in other RTOs. And I think we're going to
work through them.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Good morning.
<Q - Ali Agha>: One thing, just clarifying on the ComEd, assuming you do get the reversal and the rehearing, as I
recall that $0.10 pickup that you talk about, that would be an annual impact, right? That would also flow into 2013,
2014 looking forward as well? Is that the way to think about that?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: There's a catch-up period. Anne, you want to cover that?
<A - Anne R. Pramaggiore>: Yes, so the three issues that are on re-hearing at the Commission being – stands about
$0.10 in 2012. They are $0.05 and $0.06 in 2013 and 2014, respectively. So that's basically how it works out. And then
you just have a little bit of cleanup, that we've got some issues that we'll take to appeal that didn't get picked up on the
re-hearing, to get us all the way back.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I see. Okay. And second question, Chris, I mean looking a little longer-term, obviously, you have the
vagaries of the commodity cycle, but your capacity prices are pretty much set through mid 2016. And you look at the
forward curves, your cost production, et cetera, when do you think you are in a position to be close to the earnings base
that you earned back in 2011, the north of $4 earnings base? When does this company have that kind of earnings
power, in your mind, looking at this combined company?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: There are so many variables in and around that. We have to see the effects in the
market of how gas stabilizes out. We have to look at what the effects are with the retirements. It would be pretty
premature to pick that date right now. We continue to really focus on high reliability, solid investments, keeping a
discipline on the expense, working hard to build the right rate base within the utilities and get the right return, focusing
on a higher contribution on the dividend and the earnings from the utilities.

So there's a lot of things in play. I couldn't pick 2016, we're back there. But there is work that we can do, and we are
doing it and then there is the market fundamentals that will drive a significant portion of that.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Fair enough. But standing where we are today, looking forward, it's not – the next three years, most
likely, won't get you there. Is that a fair way to think about it?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: I wouldn't go there. I wouldn't go one way or the other. We don't project earnings in the
out-years, and there's a lot of fundamentals around that. We do have a ratable hedging that secures us, slowly blends in
wild perturbations of market adjustments, but there's – I don't know if I'd hit that point yet.

Your next question is from the line of Nathan Judge of Atlantic.
<Q - Nathan A. Judge>: Hi. I just wanted to ask about page five, the kind of middle of the page, it says Midwest,
mid-Atlantic wholesale was pared down in a low-price environment. Can you just elaborate on what you were going
for in that bullet point?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Sorry, Nathan, I'm just...
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: I got it. Nathan, it's Ken, you're referring to the bullet point on slowing down our
hedging, pare down our hedging, in the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic?
<Q - Nathan A. Judge>: Yes, I guess more thematically, are you revisiting your overall decision on whether to ratably
hedge or not?
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: No, we're remaining disciplined, and we will stay within a relative band around ratable
hedging. We got ahead of our ratable plan starting in the third and fourth quarter of last year, seeing the potential for
gas price roll down. So we got ahead of our ratable plan, and this statement just points to the fact that we slowed down
our hedging in the second quarter; hedged at a slower than ratable pace to fall back to a ratable position at this point.
<Q - Nathan A. Judge>: Thanks. Could you just update us as to what kind of options are being deployed now as a
percentage of the overall?
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: About 5% in 2013, 7% to 8% in 2014.
<Q - Nathan A. Judge>: And are those electricity? Are those gas measures or how does that...?

<Q - Kit Konolige>: Most of my questions have been answered also. Just one related to – potentially to the discussion
of the MOPR issues. There was a hearing in Federal Court on the LCAP appeal that Public Service and others are
conducting. A, do you guys have a view on how that might turn out? And B, does – in your view, does it matter how
that turns out ultimately? If, say, LCAP were to be overturned and seen as unconstitutional, would that have a
retroactive effect in any sense or an immediate impact? Or would that, potentially, just be a kind of signal to states in
the future not to subsidize power plants?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: I think I'll let Bill answer the details. I think it would clearly message to states what is –
what are the fundamental principles around the market design and the laws and the rules around the market design. We
don't think if people had won, we know people have won capacity bids within the specific year, and they can't comply,
there's ways to get out. There wouldn't be a restructuring of the auction. But you want to talk about our view, overall?
<A - William A. von Hoene>: Yes. Kit, this is Bill Von Hoene. As you know, the court – as you referenced, the court
heard argument yesterday for about three hours. The court did not render a decision, nor indicate when it would. The
results that are possible are summary judgment, one way or another; or have the matter go to trial. And we don't have
an opinion at this point, a projection, as to what the court is going to do. But, as Chris referenced, the results, if they
were favorable to us, would be largely prospective. And we do think they would be material to what will happen in
other states that may otherwise have an inclination to do this subsidized generation.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: There's many participants in the market today that are willing to invest for new
generation. We're doing so in our nuclear operates. There's others that are doing so with new iron in the ground. We
continue to model and had been modeling wind when that would be a good opportunity for us, for those type of
developments. And what we are messaging with the other market participants, the more that's done to subsidize
generation, the uncertainty in the market is created and we have to pull back on investing capital. So that's good
infrastructure not being built, it's jobs not really coming in. And that's the company's view, and that's why we're taking
the position we are.
<A - JaCee M. Burnes>: Stephanie, we'll take one more question, and then we'll turn it over to Chris to close out the
call.

Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Good morning Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just a follow up, quickly, on [ph] Jay's MOPR question. It sounded like – and maybe I heard it
wrong – that there might be a stakeholder consensus among the stakeholders with respect to this MOPR issue? A little
unusual for stakeholders – I'm just wondering, did I hear that correctly?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: I think actually, [ph] Jay's question was, if there is a stakeholder consensus, do we expect it
to get through FERC? And my answer was yes. But I also said that there was a good bit of work to do to get a sufficient
number of stakeholders onboard with MOPR revisions. We are in process with that. I don't think anything we will
come to will have universal support. We're going to try to get majority support for some changes. We're cautiously
optimistic we're going to get there. And that's as much as we can say about the process at this point in time.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, fine, great. The second thing is, hot weather in the third quarter here, little bit in the
second quarter; really hot weather in PJM. And we didn't see any peaks, any new peaks. And I was wondering if you
could comment on that. Is that a demand-response issue? Is that because there were some storms? Or were there peaks
that I just don't know about at ComEd or PECO, or what have you, in PJM?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: No. There were no new peaks. There was some curtailments in, I think, at least one day
if not two in [ph] Eastern MAC or (54:58) West Virginia. But it showed that the transmission investments are working.

There is adequate generation, and that the system was able to cover the load. Denis, anything else?
<A - Denis P. O'Brien>: Yes, we'd have to do the math on it. But I think if you looked at the demand-side response
programs and added them to the peaks that each of the companies had, they would have had a new peak relative to past
performance. So I think demand response is playing a role in eliminating the higher peaks.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Do you think that might have something to do with the energy tariffs now with demand
response that was recently implemented at PJM? You know what I'm talking about. In other words, as opposed to the
capacity market, there's this – the new pricing mechanism for real-time for the energy market that demand response can
now get.
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Paul, it's Ken. The demand response was called for emergency situations and on July 17
and 18, really, that full LMP concept was not in place at the time this demand response committed to the capacity
market. So the demand response was called for reliability reasons in the East, as Chris indicated.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just finally, great disclosure, it was very useful. But I did notice that the BGE
load slide, you had it for PECO, you had it for ComEd and you had the BGE one for the analyst meeting. But I didn't
see it in this one. Is there any update, in terms of what your weather adjusted demand growth looks like in that?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: You know, we hadn't put that in, since BGE is decoupled. It really, it's just a pass
through. I don't know if you want to discuss your load anymore, Ken, but...
<A - Kenneth W. DeFontes>: The forecast for the end of the year is weather adjusted down 0.6%, about in line with
what PECO and ComEd are showing.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, and that's just basically what you've seen – the reason why they've decreased from last
time is because of just what the results have been? Is that pretty much what you're extrapolating? The second quarter
came in, and that's why?
<A - Kenneth W. DeFontes>: Yes, I think that's correct. It's just an update based on the earlier parts of the year.
