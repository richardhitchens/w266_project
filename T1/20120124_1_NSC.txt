Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, President and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2011
earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team including Don Seale, our Chief
Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; Jim Squires, our CFO and Deb Butler, our Chief
Information Officer.
As we typically do in January, Deb will be presenting our 2012 capital budget and in order to allow enough time for
that presentation, I will include a brief operations update in my remarks on Mark's behalf. Mark will be available to
answer any questions later.
I am very pleased to announce another record-breaking quarter for Norfolk Southern. We achieved fourth quarter highs
in revenues, net income and earnings per share. As you know, these fourth quarter results capped an already
outstanding 2011 performance and led to across the board record results for the full year, which include all-time highs
for revenues, income from operations, net income and earnings per share.
Looking at our top line, revenues for the fourth quarter increased 17%, volumes rose 6% led by double-digit growth in
intermodal, automotive and metals and construction. Revenue per unit rose 11% led by our coal franchise. For the full
year, revenues reached $11.2 billion, 17% more than 2010 on 5% higher volume. Don will provide you with all of the
revenue details in a couple of minutes.
Net income for the quarter of $480 million was up 19% and diluted earnings per share rose 30% to $1.42. For the full
year, net income and earnings per share rose 28% and 36% respectively, and Jim will provide you with all of the
financial details. These record results resulted in strong operating cash flow, which, for the first time in Norfolk
Southern's history, exceeded $3 billion. In recognition of this performance as well as their confidence in Norfolk
Southern's strategic direction, our board this morning increased the quarterly dividend by $0.04 or 9%. And this return
to shareholders follows the $2.6 billion in share repurchases and dividends paid out during 2011.
These outstanding results were driven by a solid operating performance, which improved as the quarter progressed.
While handling an additional 6% in volumes, we improved terminal dwell and maintained our average network
velocity. Moreover, the increased volumes were handled with only a 5% rise in crew starts. Our operating performance
improvement is continuing into the first quarter, and we're seeing significant improvements year-over-year in network
velocity and terminal dwell. The fourth quarter also saw improvements in our fuel efficiency driven by milder weather
conditions and the turn back of less fuel-efficient leased locomotive.
I would be remiss if I also didn't say something about our safety performance for the year. We finished 2011 with a
projected safety ratio of 0.73, which is an absolutely remarkable number and a full 18% below our previous best. We
have a great team at Norfolk Southern and they are doing a terrific job on safety and service.
In 2012 we'll continue to focus on improving service delivery and operating efficiency while positioning our franchise
for continued volume growth. Part of that plan is continued strong capital investment, and Deb will give you some

details of our planned $2.4 billion capital program for this year.
I'll have more to say about our 2012 outlook in a few minutes but now I'll turn the program over to Don.
Donald W. Seale
Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone. For today's call, I'll recap our fourth quarter and year-end
performance including the key drivers of our results and then I'll conclude with our outlook going forward.
The environment during the fourth quarter was marked by overall economic improvement and tightening truck
capacity. These factors, combined with our ongoing business development activity, produced the strongest fourth
quarter revenue on record. In total, revenue for the quarter reached $2.8 billion, up $405 million or 17% over fourth
quarter 2010.
Yield improvement across the board, up 11%, and volumes grew by 6% led by gains of 21% in automotive, 12% in
metals and construction, 11% in intermodal and 3% up in coal. Of the $405 million in revenue growth during the
quarter, approximately two-thirds came as a result of higher revenue per unit including pricing gains and fuel surcharge
revenue. Higher volume accounted for the remainder of the revenue increase.
Slide three summarizes our full year performance, which was our best revenue year ever at $11.2 billion, up $1.66
billion or 17% versus last year. Coal, intermodal, agriculture and chemicals posted revenue records for the full year.
Higher revenue per unit contributed $1.16 billion or 70% of the revenue gain while volume growth of 5% accounted for
the remaining $493 million.
With respect to yield as shown on the next slide, revenue per unit reached a record $1,548 for the quarter and $1,570
for the year, with increases of 11% and 12% respectively. We posted across-the-board gains for both the quarter and
the year as a result of market-based pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue. We remain committed to
market-based pricing that equals or exceeds rail inflation, and we will maintain this focus going forward. The demand
for rail transportation remains high and truck and barge capacity remain tight, both of which point to a favorable
pricing environment for 2012.
As I mentioned previously, volume for the quarter was up 6%. Turning our discussion to the full year as shown on slide
five, volume was up a solid 5% over 2010. A 15% improvement in domestic intermodal coupled with a 5% gain in
international volumes led to a 10% year-over-year growth with intermodal. In our coal markets, significant gains in
export volume, up 24% versus 2010, and a 1% increase in utility volume, despite mild weather and low gas prices,
helped drive our coal volumes up 4% for the full year. In our merchandise sector, volume was relatively flat for the
year. Solid increases in automotive and metals and construction traffic offset declines in chemicals, agriculture and
paper. As I've mentioned in previous calls, negative comps from 2010 within the chemical and agriculture groups
contributed significantly to the declines in both businesses.
Now turning to our major business sectors in the fourth quarter starting with coal, revenue of $850 million was up $165
million, or 24%, due to a 21% improvement in revenue per unit and a 3% gain in volume. As depicted on the next slide,
the overall 3% volume increase in coal came from a 27% increase in export. Fourth quarter volume at Lamberts Point
was up over 37% and volume through Baltimore was up 6%, driven by increased global demand for steel production,
which was up 3% during the first two months of the fourth quarter. These gains more than offset lower utility volume,
which was down 3% versus fourth quarter 2010 but up 1% sequentially over the third quarter of 2011. Reduced
demand for electricity due to mild weather as well as competition from gas impacted coal burn across our network. We
also saw improvement in the quarter within our domestic metallurgical coal network, which was up 8% in response to
greater coking demand associated with domestic steel production.
And on a more recent note, as shown on slide eight, we completed our largest single coal loading ever at Pier 6 two
weeks ago. The M/V Cape Dover shown here on the left was loaded with nearly 160,000 tons of metallurgical coal
destined for China. The coal, which arrived in over 1,500 rail cars to our terminal, was loaded on the Cape Dover in
less than 48 hours. This event truly highlights the service and capacity that have become the hallmark of Lamberts

Point.
Now, let's turn to our intermodal network. Revenue in the intermodal network in the quarter reached $554 million, up
$83 million or 18% over fourth quarter 2010, driven by 11% higher volume and a 6% increase in revenue per unit.
Slide 10 shows that the volume gains in intermodal came mainly from our domestic market, up 15% or 54,000 loads,
for the quarter, due primarily to highway conversion.
Our international segment also posted a gain for the quarter, up 9% due to improved retail demand. In the fourth
quarter, we completed clearance work between Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, which was the last remaining link in
our intermodal network to realizing a fully double stacked capable network and four or five terminals are scheduled for
completion this year ranging from Memphis and Birmingham in the South to Greencastle, Pennsylvania, and
Mechanicville, New York, in the Northeast. In fact I'll point out that we ran our first intermodal train through the new
Mechanicville terminal just last week as we begin to ramp up operations there.
Now turning to our merchandise markets, revenue for the quarter of $1.4 billion was up $157 million or 13%, due
primarily to an 11% gain in revenue per unit. Volume of 566,000 units was up 1%. As you know, our merchandise
network includes a large base of manufacturing companies and we see positive signs in this sector. The ISM
Manufacturing Index hit a six-month high in December of 53.9, marking the 29th consecutive month of expansion, and
we're seeing improved demand for manufactured products both domestically and for export.
As we drill down on the next slide into the five groups that comprise merchandise, you will note strong quarterly
volume gains in metals and construction and automotive at 12% and 21% respectively. Miscellaneous construction
materials which includes frac sand was the primary driver in the metals and construction volume growth, which was up
24% for the quarter due to increasing demand for products related to natural gas drilling.
New business opportunities within this market have been leading the way for growth throughout the year and we expect
that to continue. Steel and automotive manufacturing both saw increased activity levels for the quarter, which was
favorable for our metals and automotive businesses. Steel volume for the quarter was up 13%, as we saw domestic raw
steel production grow by 12% during the quarter. And North American vehicle production for the quarter was up nearly
400,000 units or 13%.
Three of our merchandise sectors experienced volume declines for the quarter. Agriculture was down 7% due to the
negative comp within fertilizer and lower corn shipments to short haul Midwest destinations while chemicals volume
was down 10%, due primarily to the comp affect resulting from the completion of the Tennessee Valley Authority Fly
Ash project we handled in 2010. We cleared this negative comp on December 1, 2011.
Now, before concluding with our business outlook, I want to highlight our industrial development results in 2011,
which certainly reflect the resurgence of U.S. manufacturing that I mentioned a moment ago. 2011 was a record year as
we brought on new and expanded projects worth $335 million of revenue and more than a 152,000 new carloads of
business for our system.
As you may have seen in our announcement this month, NS facilitated $9.5 billion of investment by our customers in
2011. These new plants and expansions are expected to create 6,800 jobs across our service region. And nearly half of
the revenues secured in 2011 through our industrial development activity included foreign direct investment in such
projects as steel and automobile manufacturing.
The energy sector was also a major contributor to these results, accounting for 27 locations and expansions across 15
states. The gains included new coal business as well as projects related to Marcellus Shale gas exploration, which we
see as an area for continued growth. Obviously, these new projects will support further growth in 2012, but more
importantly, growth for years to come.
Now concluding with our outlook, we see a variety of new business opportunities ahead in a gradually recovering
economy. For our coal business, port capacity improvements, new metallurgical coal production coming online and
new steam coal business support opportunities for growth in the export market. With respect to our utility network, we
see new opportunities for Illinois Basin coal which will partially mitigate the effects of a mild winter and competition

from natural gas.
On the intermodal front, we anticipate continued opportunities for highway conversions as tightening truck capacity
and favorable international trade patterns continue. And finally with merchandise, merchandise volumes are expected
to improve in the crude oil and waste products sectors, along with continued growth in ethanol at new and existing
terminals. Also increased demand for materials associated with natural gas drilling along with higher projections for
North American vehicle production bode well for both our steel and automotive businesses.
In summary, we expect our volumes ahead to continue to exceed both low tech industrial production as well as GDP
and market-based pricing of the rate of rail inflation will remain a cornerstone of our plan going forward.
Thank you for your time this afternoon and will now turn it over to Jim for our financial report. Jim?
James A. Squires
Thank you, Don. I'll now review our fourth quarter financial results which round out a year of record performance. I'll
close with an overview of our financial highlights for the year.
Let's start with our fourth quarter operating results. As Don described, railway operating revenues were a fourth quarter
record of $2.8 billion, up $405 million or 17% compared to 2010. Fuel revenues increased $100 million and this
quarter's lag effect was $46 million unfavorable. The following slide displays our total operating expenses which
increased by $247 million or 14% for the quarter.
Income generated from railway operations was $800 million, up 25%, reflecting the sizable increase in revenues. The
resulting operating ratio was 71.4%, a 2% improvement compared to 73.2% in the fourth quarter 2010. Both measures
reflect fourth quarter post Conrail results exceeded only by fourth quarter 2008.
Removing the $46 million unfavorable fuel revenue lag, our operating ratio would have been 70.2%. This translates to
a 3% improvement compared to 2010's 72.3% operating ratio, adjusted for a $29 million unfavorable fuel lag.
Turning to our expenses, the next slide shows the major components of the $247 million increase; fuel and
compensation and benefits expenses accounted for over two-thirds of the variance. As displayed on the following slide,
nearly all of the $95 million increase in fuel expense was due to higher prices. Our average diesel fuel price per gallon
was $3.11, a 27% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Consumption increased 4% relative to a 6%
increase in gross ton miles, a reflection of a milder 2011 weather and returning many older leased locomotives.
Next, compensation and benefits increased by $75 million or 11%. Looking at the major components of this increase on
the following slide, first, higher incentive compensation reflects our strong year-over-year results of $37 million.
Second, higher health and welfare benefits added $13 million, a little over half of which related to increased premiums.
Third, activity levels due to increased volumes added $9 million primarily for train and engine employees. Fourth,
wage rates drove expenses up $5 million. Pension expenses and payroll taxes increased $5 million and $4 million
respectively.
Materials and other expenses presented next increased $35 million or 19%, reflecting higher volume-related equipment
maintenance activities, reliability initiatives for our locomotive fleet and increased environmental remediation expense.
Purchased services and rents increased $28 million or 7%, primarily reflecting volume-related operating activities.
Turning to our non-operating items, increases in corporate-owned life insurance and coal royalties were partly offset by
the absence of favorable interest on uncertain tax positions that benefited 2010. As illustrated in this comparison,
income before income taxes increased $161 million or 29% due to higher operating income. Income taxes totaled $243
million and the effective tax rate was 33.6%.
The lower than expected effective tax rate reflects $11 million in deferred tax benefits resulting from state tax law
changes. Income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $160 million with an effective rate of 28.5% and were

favorably impacted by a change in estimate for deferred taxes that resulted in a nonrecurring reduction of $34 million.
Net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on the following slide, both measures set fourth quarter records. Net
income was $480 million, an increase of $78 million or 19% compared to 2010. Diluted earnings per share were $1.42,
exceeding fourth quarter 2010 results by $0.33 per share or 30%.
Turning our focus to the full year, record revenues of $11.2 billion, up 17% versus 2010, contributed to record income
from railway operations of $3.2 billion, up 20% compared to $2.7 billion in 2010. These results generated a 70 basis
point improvement in our operating ratio which was 71.2% for the year, a close second to our 71.1% post Conrail
record set in 2008.
Net income for the year reached $1.9 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2010 and diluted earnings per share increased
from $4 to $5.45 per share. These results reflect a 28% increase in net income and a 36% increase in diluted earnings
per share; both measures set new records.
As shown on slide 16, strong 2011 net income drove a 19% increase in cash from operations, which covered most of
the increase in our capital spending and produced $1.1 billion in free cash flow. In addition to increased capital
spending, the lower 2011 free cash flow reflects accelerated accounts payable activity in late December planned as part
of our January 1 ERP implementation.
This temporary decline in our year-end cash balance has since rebuilt to normal levels. From free cash flow we
distributed over $0.5 billion in dividends, the remainder combined with net proceeds from borrowings and
cash-on-hand supported over $2 billion of share repurchases.
As we move forward, we expect continued capacity to generate free cash flow coupled with reliable access to debt
markets that will position us to support future capital deployment initiatives as evidenced by our board's action earlier
today increasing our quarterly dividend by $0.04 to $0.47 a share.
Debt repayments in 2012 are relatively low at about $150 million. And dividends, as always, will remain a core means
for distributions. Next, Deb Butler will share our 2012 capital investment plans. Thank you for your attention.
Deborah H. Butler
Thank you, Jim. As Wick noted, we plan another strong capital investment program in 2012. Slide two depicts our
2012 capital program compared with prior year's programs. At $2.4 billion, our 2012 plan is budgeted to be 12% higher
than 2011 capital expenditures and reflects our continuing confidence in and commitment to the growth and
productivity of our franchise.
As in prior years, the majority of our capital spending is targeted toward strengthening the franchise. Replacement and
core spending represent about $1.6 billion, or 67%, of our total capital budget. If we include in the core spending
category $247 million budgeted for the continued implementation of Positive Train Control, the total is in line with our
historical average of about 75% core and 25% growth spending. The growth portion of the budget shown here in green
and totaling $545 million is for track internal expansions and for projects to improve asset utilization, work force
productivity and fuel efficiency.
As always, the largest percentage of our spending is targeted at keeping our right-of-way in the condition needed to
move our customers' business safely and efficiently. Roadway spending in 2012 is budgeted to be $840 million, or 35%
of the total budget. Our roadway budget funds the replacements of rail, ties and ballast as well as the improvement or
replacement of bridges and culverts.
Investments in infrastructure are budgeted to be $134 million, or 6% of capital expenditures. Our infrastructure
investments are specifically designed to relieve congested lines and improve capacity and velocity on a line of road.
New projects for 2012 will focus on the Birmingham-Atlanta corridor and our North-South line between Chattanooga
and Cincinnati. As in prior years, we will also continue to invest in public/private partnerships such as those associated
with Crescent Corridor and CREATE.

On slide eight, investments in facilities and terminals throughout our network will total $322 million or 13% of our
planned 2012 capital expenditures. About half of the spending in this category is associated with investments in
intermodal facilities, including continued work at three Crescent Corridor terminals in Tennessee, Alabama, and
Pennsylvania, each of which also has a public funding component.
The photo on the slide is an aerial view of the massive intermodal terminal project at Rossville, Tennessee, near
Memphis. The remaining funding in the facilities and terminals category will be used to support new business
opportunities as well as to continue a multi-year initiative to expand and update our locomotive servicing facilities.
And speaking of locomotives, spending in this category will total $242 million in 2012 or 10% of total budget.
Locomotives spending plan for 2012 includes the purchase of 35 new units as well as continued investments in
alternative power programs. Also included in this category is funding to rebuild and upgrade existing locomotives and
for the installation of emissions kits to meet government requirements.
Freight car spending in 2012 will total $346 million, or 14% of the total 2012 capital budget. We're continuing a
multi-year investment in new coal cars as our existing fleet ages out and, in addition, we're ramping up the coal car
re-body program in 2012. Freight car funding will also be used to purchase equipment to support our intermodal,
automotive, metals and scrubber stone businesses.
Not including Positive Train Control, investments in system technology will total $92 million or 4% of total
investments in 2012. We've broken out spending on Positive Train Control into a separate technology category totaling
$247 million or 10% of total spending in 2012. This compares with a budget of $146 million in 2011 and is in line with
our plans to ramp up spending as the 2015 deadline approaches.
Our investments in technology were highlighted at last year's Investors Day and include a comprehensive suite of
projects that enhance safety, improve operational efficiency and equipment utilization and provide our workforce the
tools to better plan and manage our network and processes. Included in this spending are projects such as LEADER, an
Energy Management System that improves fuel efficiency, and UTCS movement plan, a system designed to optimize
train dispatching and increase network velocity.
And as noted, we're facing a significant increase in spending in 2012 to comply with the federally mandated Positive
Train Control project. Funding will be used to upgrade communications and signals, to purchase and install onboard
network devices on locomotives, and to continue the complex process of integrating PTC with our other operating
systems. Even with recent changes in the regulations, we still anticipate that total spending on PTC will exceed $1
billion.
I'll close with another shot at Crescent Corridor Construction at Riverton junction. As our capital spending plan for
2012 clearly demonstrates, we remain committed to investing in the safety, growth, and productivity of our franchise.
And now I'll turn the program back over to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thanks, Deb. Well, as you've heard, our fourth quarter capped an outstanding year for Norfolk Southern and a year in
which our results were matched by the returns to our shareholders. Looking forward, we share in what seems to be the
consensus view that the economy will continue to grow, albeit at a fairly slow pace, assuming that the global economic
climate remains reasonably stable. We remain optimistic, as you've heard, that Norfolk Southern can continue to grow
overall volumes at a pace faster than the economy as we have done for the past couple of years.
As Don mentioned, the fact that many people in our service area have enjoyed an unusual amount of shirtsleeve
weather so far this winter, coupled with low natural gas prices, may pressure our first quarter utility coal volumes to
some extent but we remain confident in the longer term strength of our coal franchise. 2012 will also see us continue to
focus on our service product and the efficiency of our operations. In addition to the strengthening of our operations,
2012 will also, as you've heard, include the completion of several new major intermodal terminals which will result in

additional capacity and service improvements.
As I've said many times before, increasing asset velocity on our property improves both our customer service and our
operating cost structure, and we have a number of initiatives and investments underway that are focused on velocity. As
I said earlier, we're off to a good start so far this year and looking to build on that momentum. I'm confident that we can
and that the end result will be continued high-quality, high-value service for our customers and superior returns for our
shareholders.
Thanks and we'll now open the mic up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you. Good evening, guys. First, going to concentrate on coal. You sound fairly optimistic
on the export market, if we just put utility aside for the moment. Can you give us some more color? What gives you the
optimism on met exports and also thermal exports for you guys?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Jason, good afternoon. With respect to the metallurgical coal, which is the
predominant share of our business, as you know, going into Europe, Asia, and South America, we're fortunate that we
have a lot of very high quality lowball metallurgical coal that's in great demand around the world. And we're confident
that that demand will continue. We're supplementing that metallurgical flow, I will tell you that we have executed a
couple of deals for steam coal and we see an increased opportunity ahead for higher steam coal exports. And so, you
put those two together and we still feel optimistic about the export market.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay, fantastic. My follow-up question is going to be on the intermodal side. You guys have
been creating a network where you should be able to increase your productivity yet in the same sense you also lost a
contract beginning of this year, so you're going to lap that. Can you talk to us about what's left in the network in terms
of how much excess capacity your intermodal network is currently running at?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we have capacity – it's to some extent lane specific but we still have a fair
amount of capacity on a lot of our train starts. There are terminals where we're very, very busy right now and part of
our terminal expansion strategy is to give us additional growth headroom in those locations, Pennsylvania being an
example. Mark, anything else you'd like to add?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: The only other thing I'd add to that is our average train length for intermodal is still under
6,000 feet and, of course, that's an average. We've got some trains that are smaller than that and a lot of trains that are
larger than that, but suffice to say that for the most part our intermodal trains can operate at 8,000 feet, sometimes more
than that. So a lot of room to grow there.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay, gentlemen, I appreciate the color as always.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you, Jason.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, guys, appreciate you taking my call. I guess the first question is on coal mix on the
utility side. It looks like RPU was down sequentially. I'm assuming that's with the preponderance of Northern utility
contracts that you guys could have a little bit of unfavorable mix hitting you? Maybe if you could just talk a little bit

about how we should expect that to look as we head into 2012? And then, obviously, there are a bit of secular
headwinds facing that sector, what do you guys think volumes will look like on the utility side if we could see things
positive or if flat's kind of a best case scenario in 2012? Thanks.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, Justin, as I mentioned, our utility volume for the full year 2011 was up 1% and
it was also up 1% sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So those are pretty good numbers in the
current environment with historically low natural gas prices and a very mild winter. But in terms of the mix effect, we
are constantly seeing some changes in the flow of our coal going to Northern utilities versus Southern utilities. I will
tell you that our Southern utilities now are generally on target with respect to stockpiles, while we have couple of
Northern plants that are still below target, that are taking coal that they're catching up on.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay, that's helpful. And then wanted to follow up on a comment that I think is a big
accomplishment that you guys kind of talked about quickly in the prepared remarks, which is the 100% double stack
ability in your intermodal network. How does that change the way you go to market now, if it does it all?
And does it open up new capabilities in terms of getting into shippers that haven't been willing to look at you guys?
How does that change the way you think about your intermodal network and the kind of – does it affect the domestic
growth rate that we should be expecting at all?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, certainly, we've had the plans to clear the entire network. The last link with
Cincinnati to Columbus, we completed that in the fourth quarter, in early December. And just to put a little more color
to that, that saves almost two days between the Port of Virginia Hampton Roads and Detroit, for example. So, it
shortens the route. It makes it more efficient and we have been getting the word out to our domestic and international
customers about that improvement for quite some time. So, it does not change our posture on our plans to go to market,
but it certainly offers another arrow in the quiver for quality efficient service over our intermodal network.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Congratulations on it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Great, good afternoon. Can we just talk on the – you talked on the export coal side, maybe
on the utility domestic side, you were down just a touch – a couple of percentage points. Your peer in the region was
down double digits. Why do we see such a difference? And then maybe within that same conversation, you can talk
about your expectations for – with CSAPR and MACT rules coming in, what your expectations are for continued
reduction on the utility coal side?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, our outlook for utility, as Wick mentioned, we're optimistic about our utility network.
Certainly we have crosswinds and some headwinds with environmental issues. The weather is probably the biggest
concern we have right now and then, of course, natural gas at $2.50 per million BTU is another concern. We don't think
that gas will stay at that level over the long run. We think coal generation will be fine.
With respect to Boiler MACT as well as CSAPR, as you know, both of those EPA proposals are being delayed due to
court challenge and I will tell you that with respect to CSAPR and the older smaller, coal-fired plants in our universe
we don't expect a significant impact anyway with CSAPR. A 50-year-old plant that is a 300 megawatt plant, a
reinvestment is not going to take place there to install scrubbers and we expect those plants to fade away anyway.
So looking ahead, we still feel good about the utility network. I can only comment about our network. I can't really
comment about the others but we've got slightly over 100 plants, utility plants, in our utility fleet. I will tell you that
70% of those already have scrubbers and that number is going up. Our largest single plant that we serve will have
scrubbers installed by the end of 2013 and we will see that plant at that point start to take Illinois Basin coal and
Powder River Basin coal for blending at that plant. It's a whole PRB coal take at that plant today. So a lot of moving
parts but we have a good network and we see opportunities ahead.

<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Sound great, Don. If I can just get the follow-up on a different commodity then, on ag,
obviously we had the weather impact last year with the floods and inability to get a fertilizer down. When do you start
to see that anniversaried and maybe easier comps from a new planting season?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We will clear a comp in our fertilizer sector March 1 in our ag business, as we cleared a
negative comp for TVA December 1 in our chemicals business. And I think you're making a very good point in your
question. We are expecting to see fertilizer usage increase in the 2012 crop year to enhance yield. So we see further
opportunities in terms of phosphate fertilizers as well as potash.
And also we had some very unusual weather patterns this past year with the corn crop. We saw regions get rain in
Illinois that had good yield and then we saw other regions in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana that didn't get rain and the
yields were not quite so good. So that impacted our overall business. But when we look at our ag business in terms of
the ethanol business, as well as the poultry and animal feed mill plants and the cycling trains that we have in place, we
think 2012 is going to be good year for ag.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Wonderful. Thanks for the time, Don. Appreciate it.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You bet.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi. Good evening. You know, Don, in your experience in the past when you look at kind of the
volatility that we see in the export coal markets or even over time maybe some volatility in the domestic markets, do
you think pricing changes can stimulate coal demand in any way, or is it just there's bigger forces beyond what rails can
do on price?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Bill, my view is that, obviously, we're part of the supply chain, but there are much larger
factors that determine world markets for coal usage and coal demand. We constantly monitor that, and right now we
see ongoing opportunity in the export market for growth. I will tell you that we will have some additional metallurgical
coal coming online in 2012, expansions in Southwest Virginia as well as West Virginia. And as I mentioned, these are
high-quality met coals that can compete anywhere in the world and they will continue to be in demand. So, I think,
obviously, we're attuned to the fact that we're part of an overall supply chain, and we're always going to be sensitive to
that. But we're not the driving factor in worldwide demand for coal.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: And how do we reconcile these comments that are pretty bullish on export coal with what seem
to be production cuts from a number of coal companies out there? Is it just because of these unique attributes of the
coal, is that really possible?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, Bill, I think it could come down to cost of production and unique attributes of the coal
being mined at those given locations. You've probably seen that one of our major suppliers in their capital budget that
they have announced, they are actually expanding their capability of producing high-quality low-vol metallurgical coal
in Southwest Virginia. So, while you have some folks pulling back, you have others that are planning to move ahead
and it all depends on cost of production and the quality of the coal.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: And if the volatility exists, is there a way that you can reduce resources in coal or is it such a
high, if you will, fixed cost sort of unit train business that you do get decremental margins or you don't get them
because of the way the cost structure works? How does that work? Thank you for the time.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, Bill, certainly we can manage crew starts and the number of crews, but I will tell you,
we don't expect a cutback in our coal.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: All right. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Actually first question for Deb here, when I look at the CapEx plan that you have and I sort
of cross it with what you and your peers, I guess, have told us about a general sort of run rate of 16% to 18%, call it,
revenue, I nevertheless note that all of the rails seem to be bumping up above their 20% of revenue. And just curious, is
that purely a PTC phenomenon and will we start to see that 2.4 sort of come off even as your revenue grows? Or is this
something that continues to trend higher given the PT spend that goes out to, call it, 2015, 2016?
<A - Deborah H. Butler>: I think a large part of it clearly is PTC spend. That's why we break it out when we talk
about our capital spending. Beyond that, though, and you will recall that we have spoken for a number of years about
the need to replace our coal car fleet. And we talked about it again for 2012 spending. That's another big driver that you
probably didn't see quite as much of in previous years. You're going to see it and for the next couple years as well.
And so we are replacing our coal car fleet and, as we did last year, to the extent that we identify opportunities to replace
leased equipment and replace equipment with equipment that we can purchase, that's also, again, nothing specific
planned, but that's something that we will look at as the opportunities present themselves. So PTC is by far the biggest
driver, but for us the freight car replacement is also another big driver.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay, so it sounds like it's long enough tail here that we should continue to model in this
kind of magnitude of CapEx for you over the next few years?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I think that's fair. One other component that has been out there and we'll continue to
do, as you know, we discussed we're making some major facility investments right now.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Sure.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: So, we have some long tail things, but they will eventually end.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. Second question here, Don, you gave us a pretty good outlook I guess. Can you talk to
us about sort of the areas where you are a little concerned where we might see some weakness and what areas do you
really get excited about and sort of stand alone among the top of your business segments in terms of growth?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, not surprisingly the recovery in housing and the implications for the larger economy
that we have, that continues to be a concern. We've seen recently some – at least some indications of hope and
optimism that housing is getting a little better. We're seeing our business start to pick up in lumber, for example. But
that area, paper, forest products, continues to be one that is not robust for us.
On the very plus side, as I mentioned, the crude oil coming from Bakken as well as the tar sands crude oil opportunity
in addition to all of the materials that we are transporting into the Marcellus Shale region to support the activity there,
that business has ramped up significantly. I will tell you that it was north of 40,000 car loads for 2011 and our plans
call for a significant increase over and above that in 2012. So that area is very positive and encouraging.
And of course the automotive market I have to say has made a remarkable recovery with respect to sales and
production to support sales. And I'm sure you've seen the recent reports that the age of the U.S. fleet of automobiles on
the highway is now approaching 11 years, 10.8 years. I was in Detroit a couple weeks ago and the sense of optimism
was very high with respect to continued auto sales growth and production. So that's another sector which feeds steel
and domestic coke and coal demand, which they're all encouraging.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. And just a housekeeping, if I might, for you, Jim. Low tax rate I think you mentioned
was it $11 million in deferred tax benefit was the main driver. And I put in $11 million, I'm still getting a fairly low tax
rate that brings it up to a 35% but still trending below what you typically get?
<A - James A. Squires>: Right, fair enough. We did have other benefits in income taxes in the quarter but not benefits
that we view as unusual or non-recurring. And so match the $11 million up against $34 million of favorability in

income taxes and a 28.5% effective rate in the fourth quarter of last year, for example.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Right.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold with Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Good evening. Did I miss it or did you say what core pricing was for the quarter?
<A - James A. Squires>: You didn't miss it. We don't reveal that. We talk about revenue per unit.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Got you, okay. Comp and benefit as a percent of revenue, look like it improved about 130
basis points year-over-year in the quarter. That was actually the narrowest improvement that we've seen since third
quarter 2010. And I'm just curious, are there staffing actions that are being taken there, is there something that might
explain the tightening there via the margin improvement year-over-year? Thanks.
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, you did see the hiring rate taper off some in the fourth quarter relative to volumes, and
I think that provided some benefit in comp and benefits relative to overall results. But nothing beyond that we can
really point to. The incentive comp was the significant component of the increase. And then on down the line from
there, they're all familiar components of increases from quarters past.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Got you. Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Yeah, thank you. I know that the coal year on the export side rolls every spring, but I was just
wondering as we all grasp, or try and grasp, what the export coal outlook will look like, what is the process in terms of
negotiations? When do they begin, when do you get a sense of a minimum committed tonnage? If you could just help
us provide kind of the window on the front and back end of that, that late spring date when the contracts get rolled out,
that would be helpful.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Matt, between now and April 1 will be the period where most of the detailed
negotiation and discussion takes place. Obviously, we've been having discussions leading up to this time, but that will
intensify between now and April 1 and we'll have most of that done by April 1.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Pricing included in those discussions?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Correct.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Okay. The second question just more on the domestic side, the 15% growth in containers is
industry-leading. I'm wondering if you could point to – and I'm afraid the answer is going to be a lot of little things –
but are there one or two things that are driving your domestic share performance in intermodal? It is so far ahead of
what we're seeing elsewhere competitively in the region but just across the industry. Is it one or two of the projects in
the last couple quarters? If you could just help maybe separate into buckets, what's driving that higher? Thank you.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Matt, as you'll recall in the third quarter and I did not show the stats for the fourth
quarter, we are showing double-digit increases in our corridors as we work on speed enhancements, as we roll out
features of those corridors, Crescent Corridor, Heartland Corridor, the Pan Am Southern, the Heartland Corridor and so

that certainly helping us in that regard. And I will also say that we've got some very strong partners in the domestic
intermodal market that are working closely with us to convert highway freight in the east which has been untapped in
the past. So it's a target rich environment east of the Mississippi in terms of truck flows and it is a combination of the
network and partners working with us to market that.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Okay, proof of concept. Thank you.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah, good afternoon. Wanted to ask on the intermodal side, you mentioned, I think,
four new terminals coming online in 2012. Can you give us a sense of what that increasing terminal capacity is perhaps
in terms of lift relative to the total intermodal network?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Tom, in terms of the increased leased lift capacity in Memphis, Birmingham,
Greencastle, and Mechanicville right at a half million lifts, so an incremental capacity.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: So what is that relative to the prior intermodal terminal network capacity?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: In terms of a percentage improvement or increase?
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah, if you just have total lifts of the network prior to that, capacity or percent
increase?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: It's in the range of 15% to 18%.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. And how long – I'm sure you've got Mike McClellan out there working hard to
market this and drive volume growth and so forth. I'm confident you'll have success over time. How long does it take
your partners to ramp that up, some of these would probably be new markets that they could access/ Is that something
that you can pretty quickly see volumes come in to those new terminals or is it something where you kind of have a
fairly gradual ramp up period in terms of actually getting tracks where the new capacity is in the new markets?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Tom, to answer that question I'm going to use a horse analogy. They're chomping at
the bit. They're ready to go when we are. And seriously, the capacity at some of these terminals we've grown so quickly
that our partners and ourselves, we know where that the next tranche of growth is. And it will be turned on fairly
quickly once we open the new terminals.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, yeah, that's good. If I can have one, I guess one additional one on the coal. I know
you've talked a lot about coal, but given that we haven't seen apparent switching or impact from the low natural gas on
your utility coal business in 2011, is it – do you think maybe some of that happened a couple of years ago? I guess
there was a step down in your utility volumes probably two or three years ago.
So, is it partly that your older capacity that would've been affected by low natural gas already was affected a couple of
years ago? Or – I guess it still seems kind of perplexing why you're not seeing an impact from that whereas CSX is
seeing a pretty big impact?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Tom, I will tell you that we did see an impact from low natural gas prices in our
network in 2011. And we think that most of that impact has been realized at this point in terms of the plants that can
actually burn gas and compete with coal. But we did see an impact in 2011.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. All right. Great, well, thank you for the time.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Great, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe sticking on coal, just kind of revisiting the
discussion on coal yields, I'm just trying to get a sense of the volatility in the average revenue per car relative to the
Northern versus Southern utilities. Was there any other moving parts in there? I mean is there anything that we can
tease out from the export perspective? Was price volatile at all on the quarter and how should we think about that as we
roll forward into kind of this April 1 renewals just given the outlook that you guys have for export coal?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No volatility in the export coal price but you will notice in the charts that I provided
that our domestic metallurgical coal market was up 8% in the quarter and sequentially from the third quarter to the
fourth quarter we were flat on domestic metallurgical coal in the third quarter. It's profitable business but it's a
shorter-haul business for us with revenue lower per unit. So as domestic metallurgical coal goes higher, as domestic
steel production goes higher, we will have some impact on RPU but don't read anything into that other than mix.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay, so nothing from a profitability perspective, only, simply from a mix perspective?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Correct.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay, and then if I could just switch gears with the follow-up over to the head count for
2012. Jim, maybe if you could give us a sense of kind of what your thoughts are as far as growth in the force as we look
at 2012 and then maybe what the cost inflation kind of aspect might look like?
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure, well I'll take a shot at it and then I'll let Mark or Wick chime in as well, but I think we
are at a point where we think we've leveled off in terms of T&E hiring and we are at or close to where we want to be in
terms of our T&E workforce. We do expect, however, to see increased hiring in engineering and mechanical ranks in
2012. And there we are in a sense paralleling what we have done with our T&E work force in 2011 and the latter part
of 2010 where we took it up in expectation of reaching a level that we think is sustainable. And we are going to repeat
something like that pattern in 2012 for our mechanical and engineering workforces.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yes, that's our plan right now. We tied some of that to even further service
improvement initiatives. We'll clearly watch the head count carefully. Another thing that we will be doing is making
sure that we are hiring ahead of attrition. We have some demographics in the workforce, those two workforces in
particular, that we need to manage through. So you look at all of that. We would expect some additional head count
growth as Jim said, on the operating craft side. T&E looks pretty good right now. We think we're well-positioned for
volume growth this year and for actually – for a ways beyond this year in T&E. And then everything else should be
about what it is today.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay and cost inflation kind of exclusive of any stock-based compensation?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Go ahead, Jim.
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure, in the health and welfare costs arena, we are expecting a significant increase again for
the full year. Now, the premium is sort of up in the air but we'll have an activity-based component increase in health
and welfare costs, probably around $30 million or so for the full year. Pay rates are going to add – that's the agreement
component by the way. Pay rates are going to add something on the order of $50 million or so to comp and benefits
expense for the full year. Now pension cost increases and other post-employment benefit cost increases are going to be
much more modest we think this year than they have been in the last few years.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay, that's great color. I appreciate the time, guys. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gary Chase with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Good afternoon, guys. Wondered if I could just ask Don a couple of quick ones here. First on
the utility mix on this – on the Northern utilities versus the Southern utilities it sounded like the way you were
describing things, you hadn't really seen a material change yet? I'm wondering if you think we should expect or could
see during the course of 2012 a more substantial mix shift – that would sort of alter these the revenue dynamics and
maybe revert back to where we were, say, in 2010, before you had that big change in the first quarter or last year?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Gary, I would say that it's all dependent on the weather. What really happens with the
rest of the winter, the shoulder months, and then, of course, the cooling degree days that we have throughout the
summer. And we just don't know how that's going to work out. As I mentioned earlier, we have reached close to target
for most of our utilities in the south and most in the north with the exception of two locations.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Give a sense of why this just seems to have been more volatile in the last, let's say, 12 to 18
months than at least I remember?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Gary, volatility in what sense, between...
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: It feels like these – the mix is shifting to a greater extent than at least I recall, maybe that's not
accurate?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We have a large utility network that's 70% of our coal business. Then we have a large
domestic metallurgical coal franchise that goes to domestic coking and that's directly related to steel manufacturing
and, of course, we've seen economic dislocations over the last two to three years that's impacted steel production,
automotive manufacturing, et cetera. So I don't think there is any fundamental shifts in the network itself. It's just the
market dynamics that created different supply-chain requirements at different times.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: It sounds like we should expect that to continue, given the backdrop outlook most people
have, right?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, certainly we think the economy in North America, in the U.S., is recovering
slowly. We're seeing very encouraging signs across the board, even with housing as I mentioned earlier, some glint of
improvement there. And everything considered, we think the economy looks better for 2012.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: But I think one answer to your question is, yes, there's going to always be some volatility and
unfortunately it's not volatility that we can predict the timing of or the magnitude of, it's just part of our service
franchise and so we'll see the swings from time to time. We're confident over the long-term in the strength of the entire
franchise.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Thanks. Good evening, guys. So obviously been a bunch of questions on coal and they have
kind of been separate on export and utility. When you add it all together and you take export, the domestic utility, and
the domestic met, it sounds like the expectation is for positive volumes in 2012? And assuming that I'm reading that
correctly, when you add all the moving parts, how do you think about the overall mix impact within coal for 2012?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, again, we can't predict the weather. So on utility we can't really give you any
additional insight on that. The export market looks good based on world demand for high quality coal and, as I
mentioned, we are adding some steam coal to our mix for 2012 that will help with that overall volume number.

And then steel production in the U.S. looks better; it's tracking improved automobile production. So we think that that
will be better. So all three of those areas. And I'll also mention that in terms of the new coal production that is ramping
up in 2012 across our network, in total that could amount to as much as 6 million tons of additional production that's
coming online. We don't know if all of that will come online or not, but it has the potential for that.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: And is the new Illinois Basin coal, is that longer haul than the traditional App coal?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: When we take Illinois Basin coal to the Southeast for utility, it is longer haul than
Central App.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay, great. And then just lastly, just a higher level question for you, Don or for Wick, it feels
like entering 2011 there is an opportunity to price the overall business a bit more aggressively to catch up with the
market and wondering where you think you stand today relative to the market? Is there another year or so of, if you
want to call it catch-up, where you can price aggressively or do you think you're now more in line with the market and
overall pricing increases maybe moderate a bit?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We price to the market and the truckload market based on some of the forecasts for
2012, projects that that industry will be running at 98% of capacity. If that projection is true, and we think it is, we have
every reason to believe that pricing as a result of the marketplace with truck will be robust, continuing to be a good
opportunity for us. Barge capacity is also very tight and we think that between those two modes, if both are tight,
transportation demand is such that the capability of pricing above the rate of our rail inflation will be there.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. Thanks for your time, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Thanks. Good afternoon. A couple of items, it seems like the change in your operating ratio
from Q3 to Q4, it increased a little bit more than it typically does and I know that there's a lot of noise in any given
year, but do you recognize the things were a little bit weaker than typical? Was it the incentive comp that you
mentioned, was it a change in mix, was there some slowdown in your pricing growth, anything that we should note?
<A - James A. Squires>: I think, Chris, the headwind in the operating ratio, to the extent there was one in the fourth
quarter, was really more fuel driven. We mentioned the negative fuel surcharge lag effect. That held back operating
ratio improvement to a meaningful degree. But you look at incremental margin in the quarter on a reported basis, 39%
versus third quarter's 44%, again thinking about the negative lag effect in the fourth quarter and a positive lag effect in
the third quarter, pretty comparable really. So...
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Is that something that should get back towards 50% as we go forward?
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, it will be affected to some degree by the trend in fuel and fuel – WTI has moved up. So
we've got a higher basis at least thus far into the first quarter. That will be a factor. And we'll just have to see as far as
other elements of the results are concerned.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. And then just a quick one you mentioned an increase in export thermal coal, what's the
profit profile of that compared to export met?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We really, as you know, we just don't get into the profitability of any particular
component of our traffic.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Is it longer haul, shorter haul?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It would be comparable in terms length of haul.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yes, thanks. I think these are questions for Deb. At this point, there's it looks like about
$240 million or so of PTC spend. I'm just wondering what is that purchasing at this point?
<A - Deborah H. Butler>: It's actually purchasing a lot of communications and signals work. We're getting out on the
roadway and installing some of the equipment that we need. We are purchasing and installing equipment for our
locomotives and we are working not only internally and with vendors, but with the rest of the rail industry on a very,
very complex technological project and that is to ensure the interoperability and to ensure that we have the technology
and the communications in place to make PTC work. That is a time consuming and expensive proposition. So really it's
a line of road, it's systems, and it's locomotives for this year.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Let me add, one of the host of disturbing things about this whole initiative is that because we
have the 2015 mandate and it is an absolutely enormous project and just in terms of infrastructure we have to build out,
we have started to build out PTC infrastructure today that we won't turn on for several years, but we have no
alternative.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: I see. And secondly, I guess can you speak to the deployment and maybe performance
year-to-date compared to your expectations of the throttle position selection guidance software that you've shown us in
the past?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: LEADER has been rolled out most heavily during 2011 on our northern region between
Chicago and New York, New Jersey and we've got an increasing number of our operations. We have implemented
most heavily on the intermodal side but now we've also gotten into merchandise trains in that sector as well as
beginning to run unit trains loaded and empty. And we'll continue rolling out in that area and then about midway this
year, we'll also start rolling that technology out toward Atlanta through our Crescent Corridor. So we're looking
forward to that.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: And has the performance met your expectations?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: It really has and the thing that – one of the things we've been concentrating on is getting our
locomotive engineers comfortable with the technology and, as we go forward, we're seeing better and better utilization
of that LEADER equipment.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Good evening, everybody. I had a question on the labor situation. It's been kind of a complex
negotiation, I guess, with 13 total units, is that right? And I understand that at least 10 units of them have ratified the
new contracts and a couple of others are putting their contracts out to vote but the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way
workers is still in negotiation. Is there any reason to believe that that negotiation won't be wrapped up here before the
end of the so-called cooling-off period?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we have – first, your numbers are correct in terms of numbers of organization
ratification. Each property has separate negotiations going on with BMWE on issues that are specific to those
properties that wrapped around the BMWE's wish to have additional compensation in the form of travel expenses. I
know that the negotiations are underway on every property. They are certainly underway on ours.
As to the likelihood that all of the carriers will reach agreements with BMWE prior to February 8, I really don't know
that that can happen. If it doesn't, then we will clearly be back in a position of having to decide what further action is

and probably even talking with Congress about what might be done to avoid a work stoppage.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then your board approved another increase in the
dividend, which was very nice, 9%, I think you said. It looks to me like your yield is somewhere around 2.5% at the
current level of the stock price which leads the rail industry. Is it your strategy to continue to more or less be the
dividend yield leader in the rail industry? Does that give you an advantage in some way in the capital markets, what's
the general thinking there?
<A - James A. Squires>: You know, John, we really don't think about the objective in terms of the yield, it's more a
target payout ratio of about one-third. That's really been our guiding light as far as dividend policy is concerned.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - James A. Squires>: Yield will be what it will be.

Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Yes, thank you. A question for Jim and then a clarification for Jim as well. Question,
materials expense, if I look at it on a gross ton mile basis, it's continued to move higher over the last couple of years,
particularly in 2011. Could you speak to that, please? Am I looking at it correctly?
<A - James A. Squires>: Yes, just addressing the materials and other expense increase as a category in the fourth
quarter, as I mentioned, that increase was $35 million or 19%. Now, the increase did reflect higher equipment
maintenance activities and that was really one of the main drivers of the increase and we have been working hard to get
our equipment fleet up to a point that we think will sustain higher volumes going forward and better service going
forward. So that's been an emphasis this year, and we'll be continuing with that next year.
And we're still coming up off a base that was pretty low in 2009 when we reduced expenses significantly. So through
the course of 2010 and 2011, we were ramping up materials and related spending at a faster than activity based rate.
We had some other things going on in materials and other expenses in the quarter, environmental remediation costs
were five unfavorable in the comparison and a lot of little things going on there as well that made up the remainder of
the 19% increase.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: So, I'm sorry, is that some of the neat stuff you showed us at Altoona and, if so, does that
mean that there's less spend elsewhere down the road?
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, certainly I think some of that material spending will be productivity-generating down
the road for sure. So we are investing with some of that and some of it is catch-up off the 2009 low base, as I
mentioned.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Okay. And then, if I can, clarification on the Chris Wetherbee question about wage and
benefit inflation. I think the two numbers combined you gave was about $80 million, throw some additional on top of
that, is it right to think that wage and benefit growth year-over-year will be less than $100 million?
<A - James A. Squires>: I mentioned that the health and welfare cost number I cited was the activity component only
and does not include a premium increase, which we do believe we will sustain, but at this point we're not quite sure
what it's going to be.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Okay. Okay, fair enough. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thanks, guys. Appreciate you taking this, and I will make it quick and painless here.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Jim, let me – it's been a long call. Jim, just quickly, you guys bought back a lot of stock this
year, good purchase prices, but debt is up. You've got increased spend on CapEx, you got increased spend on the
dividend. When I think about share repurchase plans going forward, is there a certain level of debt, whether you think
about it in terms of debt-to-EBITDA or however you think about it, that you just really don't want to go beyond right
now even if the share price were opportunistically attractive?
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure, sure. And it's true that debt is up, but our debt-to-total capitalization ratio has been very
stable and similarly other credit metrics, which actually improved some in 2011, notwithstanding a pretty high volume
of shareholder distributions.
And our strategy with respect to buybacks going forward will be similar to what we've done in past years, and that is to
dedicate incremental free cash flow, excess cash on hand, and incremental borrowing capacity within our target credit
profile. So we will borrow to fund distributions as well as other uses of cash if appropriate but keeping in mind our
target credit metrics, which are similar to what we have today, in summary of a strong BAA1, BBB+ credit profile.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay, congratulations, terrific quarter. Thanks, guys.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks.

Thank you. Your next question is from David Vernon with Alliance Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hi. If I could refocus the conversation a little bit on CapEx, I think you said we were
going to be expecting sort of bumping around that 20% of revenue number for the next couple of years, is that correct?
<A - Deborah H. Butler>: Well, we didn't specify a percent of revenue. It's just that the question had to do with the
continued spending on PTC and some other things that had driven it up in the last couple of years. And we do expect to
continue to spend on freight cars, on facilities, on PTC, but we aren't predicting or calibrating those expenses against a
percentage of revenue at this point.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: >: Well, I mean, do you think the number will be coming down materially anytime in
the next couple of years?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No.
<A - Deborah H. Butler>: No.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Is there some amount of, I guess, I don't know, clarity or expectations you can set
around what type of margin gains we could get off of that higher level of CapEx?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, as Deb outlined, we don't expect any margin enhancement on PTC.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Yes.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We are really in the process of replacing our coal car fleet. Now, we will see
productivity improvements as a result because the new cars are higher capacity than our existing fleet, so you will see
some productivity enhancement there as we continue to invest in new intermodal terminals, as Don has outlined. That
creates more market opportunity for us, which we're comfortable we'll realize. And then as we make other investments
in things like technology and infrastructure, we would expect to see that lead to increased network velocity and service
improvements.

<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: I mean to the extent that there's some expectations around what that margin gain could
be, I'm just trying to, like if I step back and I look at the numbers over the last five years or so, CapEx is up about 85%,
volumes off by 10% and the margins have gained by about 170 bps. So to the extent that the CapEx number keeps
going up a lot every year, would you see some point where you will see an inflection in the margin improvement
relative to the capital spend or ...
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I don't think we have analyzed it in quite that way. We do expect to drive additional
efficiencies and some margin improvement, but as to quantifying it, I don't think we can do that.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: David, we wouldn't be investing the money if we didn't think we could generate higher profits
and better margin from it. PTC is a bit of an exception to that statement. But otherwise, the capital spending is going
toward projects which we think will generate higher profits and better margins.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Right.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next is from the line of Neal Deaton with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - E. Neal Deaton>: Okay, I'll be quick since it's been a very long call. Just really quick, going back to the health
and welfare inflation figures, Jim, I know you mentioned a $30 million figure and then a $50 million figure, and I think
that's where Jeff was getting the $80 million earlier. But I wanted just to see, would you mind just clarifying again, if
you would, what those two components were?
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure. The $30 million I mentioned is the activity component or the employment, the
additional employment, component of the health and welfare benefit costs increase we're expecting, and that's for
agreement workforce, which is the preponderance of our additional workforce that we are expecting in 2012. And then
there's another component of that which is the premium that we pay, and that's somewhat uncertain right now. The
second figure I mentioned was pay rates, a total of $50 million approximately year-over-year increase, the majority of
which would be for agreement pursuant to the collective bargaining agreements we've negotiated.
<Q - E. Neal Deaton>: Okay, that's perfect. Thanks so much.
