MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 MasterCard Earnings Conference Call. My
name is Chantela and I will be your facilitator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is
being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms.
Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Barbara L. Gasper
Thank you, Chantela. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, either by phone or Web cast, for a
discussion about our third quarter 2011 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and
Chief Executive officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and
Martina, we will open up the call for your questions.
This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor
Relations section of our Web site, mastercard.com. The earnings release and slide deck have also been attached to an
8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A dial-in replay of this call will be available for one week, through
November 9. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call
may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ
materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future
performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our most recent SEC filings.

Ajaypal S. Banga
Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, before Martina gets into the details of our results, let me start
with some comments. In the third quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 27% or 24% on a constant currency basis.
This helped fuel operating income growth of 31% and EPS growth of 43%. We're obviously pleased with our results
this quarter, including our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit volume growth, as well as the highest growth rate
in processed transactions since the IPO in 2006. Each region posted healthy volume growth, with the strongest growth
in Latin America and Asia-Pacific/Middle East/Africa.
Volume growth in the U.S. up almost 14% was led by strong Debit results aided by the roll-on of business wins and
double digit increases in our Commercial Credit business. Despite persistently high unemployment rates and a weak
housing market that have resulted in the low levels of consumer sentiment that we all read about, we are still seeing the
consumer spend. Our U.S. Consumer Credit volume grew 4% and Debit volume grew about 22%. This is consistent, by
the way, with our SpendingPulse data that shows retail sales growth, ex-auto, has remained, for the most part, between
8% to 9% year-over-year in the recent months.
Certainly, some of this increase is due to inflationary pressures, such as higher gas prices and food inflation, but it's still
money that consumers are spending. However, the comparison will become more difficult starting in November, as
U.S. retail sales, ex-auto, were up by over 5% in November and December of 2010 versus last year's spring, summer
period when the comparable number was only about 1%.
Moving onto Europe, our performance there is driven by healthy cross-border volume growth and new domestic
processing businesses in the Netherlands. Given the sovereign and banking debt concerns in Europe, we're not
surprised that consumer sentiment is low and we will continue to watch it, as Europe tries to get closer to a plan that
should go some way towards alleviating these issues. But in spite of the economic headlines, we're still seeing a
significant opportunity from the secular shift to electronic payments in Europe.
In Latin America and APMEA, we continue to benefit from strong cross-border volume growth, which is above 20% in
each of these regions. Additionally, new business with Itaú is driving growth in Brazil. While both regions are still
performing strongly, the issues faced by some of the world's largest economies could begin to impact sentiment and
confidence in these emerging markets. Given our growth this quarter, it is clear that this economic uncertainty is not yet
showing up in our business results. However, we will continue to keep a watchful eye, given that the signals remain
mixed. At the same time, we are very much focused on what we can influence and control and that is winning deals and
market share. We also continue to see growth opportunity in the ongoing migration of cash to electronic commerce, and
this is what we're dedicating our resources to.
Before I get to our business highlights, I'd like to give you a brief update on the regulatory and litigation fronts. So first
of all, although changes to debit interchange became effective on October 1, there are still a lot of moving pieces in the
U.S. debit landscape. All issuers continue to work through their internal decisions as to how to make their debit cards
compliant from a PIN mark perspective. Merchants, issuers and acquirers continue to seek incentives for routing
preferences. Our perspective remains unchanged from what you heard Chris McWilton and me say on last quarter's
earnings call and at our September investor meeting. We are in a completely different competitive situation from others
in the debit space and do not have the need to defend a large incumbent position.
We are focused on four objectives within our U.S. Debit business: first, to retain our existing placement on the minority
of our debit portfolios that are exclusive MasterCard debit portfolios. It's important to remember most MasterCard debit
portfolios are already Durbin rule compliant; second, to get Maestro as the PIN debit brand on the back of competitive
debit cards; third, to continue to convert competitive portfolios to MasterCard, as we have done with SunTrust,
Sovereign, and the recently announces Huntington Bank; fourth, to win routing preference with selected merchants and
acquirers.
And with this in mind, we remain focused on strategic and surgical opportunities that make sense for us. A
deal-specific approach is what we believe is needed to give us the flexibility to navigate the complexities around PIN
enablement and routing that exist in the market right now. Remember that revenue yield on PIN volume was thin, even

before Durbin, and will become even thinner after paying routing incentives. As a result, debit volume growth rates
will exceed revenue growth rates, as this space unfolds. But recall also that lower revenue yield does not necessarily
equate to lower operating margin. Given the scalability of our network, we are able to process these additional
transactions at a very low incremental cost and therefore, we will be strategic and selective when considering situations
where we are willing to pay enhanced economics for routing.
So now let me take a few moments to provide you an update on litigation. You will recall that last February, we
announced a judgment and settlement sharing agreement in the MDL case, which capped our percentage of financial
exposure at 12% of the monetary portion of a judgment or settlement that would involve Visa, MasterCard, and the
bank defendants. We have also been involved in court-recommended mediations. And while we have made substantial
process with the individual merchant plaintiffs, there has not been similar progress with the class plaintiffs. And based
on developments in the mediation process, MasterCard has extrapolated an estimate of a reasonably possible loss of at
least $500 million if there is a negotiated settlement with all plaintiffs.
At this time, it is not possible to put an upper limit on this loss, due to the significantly higher demand by the class
plaintiffs, which are unacceptable to MasterCard. You will see our updated disclosure on this matter in the 10-Q, which
will we shall file later today.
In the meantime, we continue to execute our strategy and I have several business highlights to share with you. First
with prepaid, in the U.S., MasterCard has been awarded 60% of all competitive public sector programs measured by
volume during the last 18 months. These represent $16 billion in GDV [Gross Dollar Volume]. One of the most recent
of these, which has been launched in the state of South Carolina, Department of Social Services for child support
benefits. And this is in addition to the state of Illinois Unemployment Benefits program that we previously announced
that is now launched and others that are coming in this area.
But prepaid is not only a tool for financial inclusion and benefits distribution. There is a value proposition here for
various segments of bank customers, as well. So I'll give you an example in Italy, where we have two prepaid programs
recently introduced to talk about. The first is a youth-focused product that is it designed in partnership with Intesa
Sanpaolo and is based on opening branches called SuperFlash, which, by the way, is also the name of a popular credit
card they launched. Three branches already opened. The focus is on simplicity and convenience, young staff, by the
way, non-cash handling branches, although they do have some ATMs, and several more branches are being opened in
eight cities in Italy.
The product involves other young or appeal brands for youth, such as Nike, Sony, and Vespa, 500,000 cards have
already been issued. The second is a PayPass-enabled prepaid card co-branded with Vodafone as an extension of its
loyalty program and actually an introduction of NFC technology to their customers. And we continue to have success
with IPS, our processing platform and Access Prepaid, the program management business of Travelex that we bought,
two extensions of our prepaid capabilities.
We have launched an Australian-issued multi-currency prepaid MasterCard running on the IPS and Access Prepaid
platforms. This card is capable of holding up to seven currencies at the same time. It's distributed through Flight
Centre, a major travel agent chain in Australia. Thomas Cook, the largest travel-related financial services company in
India, will be issuing MasterCard prepaid cards. This is actually the first time that the Reserve Bank of India has
allowed a non-bank institution to issue foreign exchange prepaid cards.
So now let's turn to Debit. Just a few moments ago, I mentioned about Huntington converting its debit portfolio to
MasterCard. That started in early October. Old cards will be deactivated no later than the end of November. In Italy, on
the domestic processing front, this is actually interesting, we have signed a multi-year agreement with the first major
Italian bank to migrate cards that are currently co-branded with the domestic scheme to Maestro only. The conversion
is expected to ramp up in the first quarter of 2012.
And in India, we are collaborating with the Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies for the government of Punjab to
establish an electronic procurement and payment system, which will improve the efficiency and actually help to
decrease the cost of their current manual system, which involves an annual outlay of $6.5 billion.

Also on the government front, we've launched two commercial credit programs in partnership with the Mexican
government and Banamex, Citigroup's bank in Mexico, to migrate their P&E expenditure to MasterCard from
non-electronic forms of payment. And while on credit, let me mention during the quarter, we renewed our consumer
and commercial credit agreement with InterCard, a leading credit card player in the Nordics. This builds on our recent
success in debit with Swedbank that we all talked about last quarter. In Latin America, we are making really good
progress with [ph] Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, (13:36) known as BBVA, with whom we'd previously signed a
multi-year relationship covering nine markets. BBVA is issuing MasterCard black cards in each of its nine South
American markets. This product will displace a competitive product over time. And in Argentina just last month,
MasterCard has begun to switch all of BBVA's credit transactions, the first bank actually among the leading
international banks in the country to shift its domestic switching to our network.
In the U.S. we've signed a multi-year renewal of our Consumer Credit business with RBS Citizens, continuing an
already strong relationship. Working in partnership with Citizens, we've actually delivered a lot of innovation to their
consumers, including a recent launch of inControl functionality for small business clients in their commercial portfolio
and the use of MasterCard advisors to improve the performance of other card product portfolios. And while in the U.S.,
Citi, American Airlines and MasterCard have launched a Citi Executive AAdvantage World Elite MasterCard, its
highest level offering in this co-brand relationship. This is actually a chip-enabled card with benefits such as Admirals
Club membership, priority check-in, waived baggage charges.
So now let's get to Mobile. We continue to build our partnership with Telefónica, including a strategic alliance to
launch co-brand credit products in 11 countries around Latin America and the Caribbean. And in fact, we just launched
a Movistar co-brand card in Mexico, the first in this market to target mobile phone users with enhanced mobile
benefits. We are working with Etisalat, the leading telecommunication provider in the United Arab Emirates, on a
contactless mobile payment solution that will launch in the first quarter of 2012.
And while on the topic of contactless payments, let me take a minute and discuss some PayPass highlights from around
the world. PayPass has been implemented in over 37 countries and now is accepted at over 341,000 merchant locations
and growing. This is a product that started out in the card form sector. It's increasingly being deployed as part of mobile
handset, and at our recent Investor Day, those of you who were there, saw it as part of a mobile solution and
experienced the benefits it can deliver to consumers. For merchants, it speeds check-out. For issuers, it adds
functionality to help drive [ph] top-of-order (16:11) behavior and retention.
In Canada, virtually all, greater than 90%, of MasterCard cards are PayPass-enabled and roughly 10% of total
MasterCard transactions are contactless. In July, we added acceptance at McDonald's, adding another 1,400 locations in
Canada. In Australia, the majority of banks that issue MasterCard are also issuing PayPass-enabled MasterCards. There
is acceptance at major retailers, including JB Hi-Fi, Buntings, 7-Eleven, [ph] Caltech, Dime Mart (16:47) and
McDonald's. Acceptance continues to grow in transit categories, in cinemas, in stadiums and there are additional large
chains that will add terminals. We just can't announce their names yet, but watch this space. There's more to come.
In our largest [indiscernible] (17:00) Australia, Commonwealth Bank has just launched an iPhone app called Kaching
that works in conjunction with a special iPhone case to enable PayPass transactions.
In the UK, not only is the Transport for London implementing open payments, but the nation's largest bus and rail
operator, FirstGroup, has also announced nationwide roll-out of contactless acceptance in buses. These are cash-heavy
channels that will be replaced with electronic payments. In Poland, we just reached 1 million PayPass transactions per
month. The PayPass acceptance locations in Poland are counted in the tens of thousands and include IKEA, as an
example, who is also a partner in a PayPass enabled co-brand credit card. And in the U.S., we continue to see merchant
interest in contactless as a result of the next wave of innovation that's happening with contactless mobile devices. Just
recently, several merchants have signed on to add PayPass acceptance, including Walgreens, Macy's, Subway,
OfficeMax, The Container Store, Toys'R' Us, Jamba Juice, Peet's Coffee, American Eagle, Foot Locker, GUESS, and
there's more to come.
Now let me turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?

Martina Hund-Mejean
Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on page 3 of the deck, which shows our reported results
versus last year's third quarter. As you just heard, we had a terrific quarter. Net revenue grew over 27%, driven by very
strong volume and transaction growth across our base business, as well as the addition of new deals.
Acquisitions contributed about 4 percentage points to this growth, resulting in a very robust top-line growth rate of
almost 24%, excluding acquisitions. Total operating expenses were up 23.1%, which included about 9 percentage
points of expenses related to acquisitions. Therefore, expense growth, excluding acquisitions, was just under 15%.
Foreign exchange contributed less than 4 percentage points to net revenue growth and just over 2 percentage points to
operating expense growth. The FX impact is the same for growth rates with and without acquisitions. Operating income
was up 30.9%. This resulted in an operating margin for the quarter of 55.1%, up from 53.6% in last year's third quarter.
Bottom line, we delivered net income of $717 million, up over 38%, and diluted earnings per share of $5.63, up almost
43%.
Now on the next couple of slides, representing the operational metrics for the third quarter of 2011 compared to the
same quarter a year ago. So if you go to page 4, you can see that worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up
18.1% on a local currency basis, or 23.4% on a U.S. dollar converted basis. This is the highest quarterly growth rate we
have seen in more than four years. U.S. volume growth was 13.6%. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 20.4%
on a local currency basis, including about 25% growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific/Middle East/Africa.
Worldwide Credit volume grew 14.9% on a local currency basis, which breaks into 7.1% growth for the United States
and 18% for the rest of the world. Worldwide Debit volume grew 24.2% on a local currency basis. In the U.S., Debit
growth was 21.6%. And outside of the U.S., Debit growth was 26.3%. Cross-border volume growth on a local currency
basis was up 19.3%. And that's actually the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And in fact, we had
double-digit growth in every region.
Turning now to slide 5, Processed Transactions were up 20.5% compared with the year-ago quarter to $7 billion. This
was the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and the highest quarterly growth rate for Processed
Transactions since we went public in 2006. All regions contributed to this growth. But let me point out some specific
examples that are related to new deals that have now started to lap.
In the U.S., we continue to benefit from the new debit business, such as SunTrust, which converted to MasterCard
starting in the fourth quarter of 2010. In Europe, processed transactions are still increasing as a result of new business
in the Netherlands that we began to see earlier this year. And in Latin America, we're seeing more transactions from
our expanded processing relationship with Itaú in Brazil, which began to lap in September. Now global card growth
was 7.8% to 1.7 billion MasterCard and Maestro Cards.
So now let's turn to page 6 to discuss revenue growth versus last year's third quarter in a bit more detail. So net revenue
generated outside of the United States represents about 62% of total revenue compared with 59% last year. This shift
was driven by revenues growing at a higher rate outside of the United States, about 33%, compared with 19% growth
for U.S. revenue.
Let me turn to the components of net revenue. Domestic assessments increased 25.5%, primarily due to strong volume
growth. Cross-border volume fees increased 7.4%, but if you exclude the impact of the October 2010 cross-border
pricing structure change, these fees actually increased about 23%, driven by double digit cross-border volume growth
in all regions. Transaction processing fees grew 26.1%, driven largely by growth in processed transactions due to new
business in Latin America, Europe, and in the U.S. Other revenues grew 41.3%, driven mainly by the inclusion of
revenues from the acquisition of Access Prepaid Worldwide. In total, gross revenue increased by $432 million or
22.2%.
Now rebates and incentives were $564 million, up $42 million or 8.1%. However, the increase was about $110 million,
or roughly 25%, when adjusted for the cross-border pricing change that I referenced just earlier. This increase was due
to stronger volume performance and the impact of new and renewed deals. Remember that going forward, this pricing

structure will largely be in the base as we made the change in October of last year.
Overall, third quarter revenue came in higher than we expected, primarily due to stronger Brazilian processing and
cross-border inbound travel to the U.S.; however, please note that, at this point, we do not expect these two factors to
contribute at this level to fourth quarter revenue growth. And I will speak more about this in my thoughts for 2011,
which comes a bit later.
Now moving to page 7, let's go through some detail on expenses. So within total operating expenses, general and
administrative expenses increased 27.3%, or 25.2% on a constant currency basis. Now this growth was primarily due to
higher personnel and other expenses related to strategic growth initiatives, such as Mobile, e-commerce, and
Information Services and the inclusion of acquisitions. In total, acquisitions contributed about ten percentage points to
G&A growth.
Advertising and marketing expense was up 9.8% or 6.8% on an FX-adjusted basis. Sponsorships such as the Rugby
World Cup held a couple of weeks ago in New Zealand, as well as promotional activity in support of strategic
initiatives, accounted for most of the increase. Depreciation and amortization increased 38.9%, primarily due to the
amortization of intangible assets from our recent acquisitions.
As a result, we posted operating income growth of 30.9%, or 26.3% on a constant currency basis. Below the line, there
are a couple of items to highlight. We recorded other income of $28 million, primarily due to the realized gains on the
sale of investment and an adjustment to the earn-out related to the Access Prepaid acquisition. We consider most of
these items to be more of a one-time nature. We saw additional benefit from a decrease in interest accretion now that
we made the last AmEx litigation payment in the second quarter of 2011.
Also, our tax rate declined to 30.5% in the third quarter from 32.3% in the year-ago period. While there were some puts
and takes in terms of discrete tax items, the year-over-year decline was primarily due to a more favorable geographic
mix of earnings, which resulted from the expansion of our operations in APMEA.
The cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights are summarized on page 8. We generated $1 billion in cash from
operations in the third quarter and ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of $4.4
billion. We repurchased about 250,000 shares of Class A stock during the third quarter at a cost of approximately $77
million. Year-to-date through October 27, we have repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of Class A common
stock at a cost of approximately $257 per share. This leaves $879 million remaining of the $2 billion in total share
repurchase authorizations. We will continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.
So with that, let me turn to slide 9 and let's discuss 2011 starting with an update of what we have seen from MasterCard
processed volumes for the fourth quarter through October 28. Our cross-border volumes grew 17% globally and that's
slightly below the 18%, 19% growth we have seen over the last four quarters. This was driven by somewhat tougher
comparisons, particular in the U.S., as well as in Latin America.
Although not a perfect proxy for GDV, total U.S. process volume grew 13%, similar to the level that we saw in the
third quarter. Recall that U.S. processed volume was flat in October of 2010 as a result of deconversions. Total
processed volume growth outside of the United States was 18% versus the 22% pace we have seen in the recent
quarters, due in part to the Itaú volume beginning to lap in September. And globally, processed transaction growth of
about 20% is in line with what we have seen in the third quarter. And this was driven by slightly higher growth in
Europe, slightly lower growth in Latin America and continued and double digit growth in the United States and
APMEA.
So let me outline our current view for 2011, which remains fairly consistent with what we talked about on September
15, at our Investor Day. While we expect revenue growth in the second half to be higher than the first half of the year
on a constant currency basis, we believe the majority of that impact came in the third quarter. This is because a number
of deals are coming to their one year anniversary, such as: SunTrust, which began to convert in the fourth quarter of
last year; Itaú processing, which began late in the third quarter of 2010; as well as the lapping of the DataCash
acquisition, which you might recall closed at the end of October last year.

Additionally, the year-over-year growth rate for cross-border travel into the United States could be slightly lower in the
fourth quarter than the level we saw in the third quarter because of tougher comps in the fourth quarter this year. As a
result of all of these factors, revenue growth comparisons become a bit tougher in the fourth quarter.
Regarding foreign exchange rates, if you assume the euro trades at an average of $1.36 per euro, we should see
minimal FX impact to fourth quarter revenue growth. So we continue to expect a full-year tailwind of roughly two
percentage points to net revenue growth.
We remain committed to our target of a minimum 50% annual operating margin, and continue to expect only a small
operating margin expansion in 2011 relative to 2010. Operating expenses continue to include strategic investments, as
well as the expenses of both DataCash and Access Prepaid Worldwide, which mostly impact G&A. As a result, G&A
will be up significantly for the full year, though not as much as we saw in the third quarter, since the DataCash
acquisition will lap in late October.
Turning to depreciation and amortization, it will be about approximately $200 million for the full year. We continue to
expect the proportion of annual A&M spend by quarter to be very similar to the patterns we saw in both 2009, as well
as 2010. And when thinking about other income for the full year, remember that a number of the items that we saw in
the third quarter were one-time in nature and do not reflect the normal run rate of this line item. For modeling purposes,
we now expect the 2011 full-year tax rate will be just about 32%, due to the earlier than anticipated impact of some of
our tax planning initiatives.
Now let's quickly review our long-term financial objectives, which remain unchanged from what we said at our
Investor Day back in September. For the 2011 to 2013 period, these objectives are: a net revenue compounded annual
growth rate of 12% to 14%; a minimum annual operating margin of 50%; and an earnings per share compounded
annual growth rate of at least 20%. As a reminder, these objectives are all on a constant currency basis and exclude
acquisitions, except for DataCash and Access Prepaid Worldwide.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please proceed.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you. Good morning. The – I'd like a little update on Europe, if I could. I mean, it's a third
of your spend and your slowdown – your performance there, in light of the circumstances, is pretty – pretty impressive.
And I'd like a little more color on what you're seeing there on a real-time basis and would imagine it's some of these
processing deals that you've won that's made the numbers look better than the market itself.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Bob, let me take this first. First of all, yes. We are seeing actually extremely good
performance in Europe. When you look at our total GDV numbers, GDV growth numbers in Europe, it's over 17%. I –
you see both from a credit, as well as from a debit perspective, a double digit growth there. You see double digit
growth, almost 18%, from a cross-border point of view. And then we're benefited, in particular in the Netherlands, by
the deals that we did there on the transaction processing, which was 30% growth.

So we have really not seen any significant impact in Europe, given what's going on there from an economic point of
view. In part, it is because all of the good work that our people are doing on the local ground in terms of winning
agreements and implementing things. It's, in part, the secular trend going from cash and check to electronic – electronic
forms of payments. And we'll be watching this situation very carefully going forward. But despite the turmoil, our
business is performing well.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler of Stifel, Nicolaus. Please proceed.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Martina, the domestic assessments strength you pointed to,
obviously – I'm sorry, not assessments – processing revenues were up, I think, 26% and transactions were up 20%. Is
there any – was there any pricing in there that drove the out-performance or is there – is it currency?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Can you repeat that question, please, because I didn't get everything?
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: The domestic processing increase this quarter, revenues, I think were up 26% but process
transactions were up 20%. Was there any pricing in there? Or was it just currency that drove the out -
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: What you have to look – yeah, domestic assessment processing had a little bit pricing
in there for sure, okay? Just a tiny little bit. It was about two to three percentage points. But what you have to compare
is you have to compare the 25% increase on revenues to what we did from a U.S. dollar-converted GDV number. And
when you look at this, the numbers, except for that small price change, actually line up perfectly.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Okay. And – just secondly, on PIN debit in the U.S., do you have any plans to try to use
your signature rails to process PIN debit transactions? Thanks.
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: Well, this is Ajay. And I'm not going to tell you what plans we have. But I'll tell you this. We
can obviously do that. In fact, Maestro processing in Europe right now is done off those rails and so we actually have
real experience on that. But I'm not going to talk anymore about our PIN debit plans, other than what I talked about in
my opening comments on what we are trying to do.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Great, Ajay. Can you just go back and rehash the strategy here on PIN debit? I mean, you
outlined the four things that I think make a ton of sense in terms of how you're going about this. Maybe as opposed to
re-hashing all four of them, just focus specifically, if you can, on the routing opportunity with both merchants and
merchant acquirers, if you will.
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: Julio, I'm not going add much more. We are working through the routing opportunities with
selected merchants and acquirers. We've actually been signing a few deals with them. I'm just doing all of this in a
surgical, strategic way for those opportunities that make sense to us. I don't feel it's in my competitive interest to be
publicly talking about which ones I've signed and what my plans for the next quarter are. So I just don't want to go any
further down that path.
But you should just know, all four of those things I talked about, that is: retain our existing placement on the minority
of our debit portfolios that are exclusive to us; second, get Maestro as the PIN debit brand on the back of competitor
cards; third, keep converting competitive sig portfolios to MasterCard like we've been doing. And finally, work on the

routing preference.
We're working on all those four ideas with strategic, surgical opportunities, because the space is still complex and
there's many moving parts and there's still a lot of negotiations going on and the issuers are looking for incentives. The
merchants are looking for incentives. The acquirers are looking for incentives in a business that has thin revenue yields
to start with. And so we want to make sure we do it well and smartly.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore Partners. Please proceed.
<Q - David Togut>: Thank you. I apologize if you already addressed this since I was cutting over for another – from
another earnings call, but did you quantify any changes in U.S. debit volume growth since the new interchange
regulations went into effect on October 1? At least, can you quantify any that might be specifically tied to that?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: David, it's really far too early to be looking at any different change in trends. In fact,
when I was talking earlier in my script, in my prepared remarks about process volume, we really have not seen much of
a change whatsoever in the United States, not on the debit volume, as well not on the credit volume, but very similar to
the third quarter. So I'd just suggest to you this is far too early to be figuring out where that might go.
<Q - David Togut>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Glenn T. Fodor>: Good morning, and congratulations on another good quarter. Martina, you had your goal out
there for operating margin of at least 50%. But I just wanted to get a sense of your appetite to flex around that target
level over the near term. And secondly, looking out over the next 12 months or so, how would you characterize it from
an internal investment standpoint? Are we looking at a heavier than normal amount of investments on the docket, about
average, less than average?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, Glenn, I'd be happy to talk about this. First of all, we put out the 50% plus
operating margin out there for a reason. And we put it out there because we are doing fairly significant investments in
our strategic priorities, which we quote, e-commerce, mobile information services, what we do in the debit space, and
what we do in the prepaid space, as well as in the commercial credit space. In addition to that, the numbers that you are
seeing here, we have the acquisition expenses included, which will anniversary at one point in time, latest in the first in
– at the end of the first quarter, actually at the beginning of the second quarter of 2012.
So you will see a couple more quarters of this coming through. We are keeping flexibility from an operating margin
point of view, primarily because we're looking into the future and what the economies, the world economies, might
bring in the future. So, of course, let me put our plans together, and this is, by the way, no different for 2012 than what
we would have done for 2011, as well as 2010. We are putting certain plans together to make sure that we can flexibly
react if we were to see some changes in the economic environment, doesn't matter in which part of the region of the
world. So you should expect us to have that kind of flexibility built into future plans, too, as we did this year and last
year.
<Q - Glenn T. Fodor>: Very nice to hear.
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: The only thing I'd add is that, as you heard Martina in her prepared comments, the fact that
we're sticking to the concept of a minimum 50%, even for 2011, when clearly for the first three quarters, we have done
somewhat beyond that, is because she's indicated that there's still expenses to come in the fourth quarter, maybe at a

lower rate than what you saw in the third quarter, but probably at a higher rate than would otherwise have been thought
about.
And I think those are the kind of indications we're trying to put our money back into our strategic initiatives. We've
actually – from little, little things. We've hired this year close to 700 people into our company, and that's in addition to
those we got through the acquisitions of Access Prepaid and DataCash. And, by the way, of those 700, close to 350 are
in the Unites States, where people think that hiring is not going on. And so we're actually adding. And I think that's part
of what we're trying to do with our business is to invest sensibly.
But like Martina just said, we are very cognizant of the mixed signals that we're getting in the world economic system.
Whether the signals are coming from confusion between macroeconomics and microeconomics, I don't know. But I just
know that I'm getting these. It's not showing up in the business yet. And so every month, she and I are very conscious
of the need to keep some flexibility in the way we are constructing our expenses so we can react if we begin to see an
impact on our top line.
<Q - Glenn T. Fodor>: That sounds good. Thank you very much.
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: And remember that our – even for our top line, we're trying to indicate that the third quarter
did have certain aspects to it that may not get repeated in the fourth quarter, but we'll remain in the perspective that says
the second half is going to be higher than the first half. That part has not changed.
<Q - Glenn T. Fodor>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Thanks. On the rebates for Q4, I guess, historically, Q4 is the highest quarter for that
line. Do you expect that that will be the case again this year, and any quantification you could provide around that?
And then, we'd just love any thoughts from you guys on, do you think we'll see any new issuers join the Google Wallet
initiative, in addition to Citi, at any point soon? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Jason, I really don't expect much change in the fourth quarter from what you'd see
typically in our fourth quarter. You'll see a very normal fourth quarter from a trajectory, from a contra-revenue
trajectory point of view. So there's really nothing to call out in specific.
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: As far as Google's concerned, Jason, I would say that two things are happening. One, of
course, the bunch of new merchants we talked about in my remarks, but within the next few months, I think Google
Wallet will open up to the other networks, which I believe is the right thing. I believe that open systems are the only
way. And I've been saying this for a while, that mobile payments will begin to acquire traction. I think that'll be
networks, as well as over a period of time, I'm sure they'll open up to other banks as well. I just don't know what the
timing of these specific things is.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche. Please proceed.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Super results, but I did want to dig down on the point four, which, I
think, was on the debit strategy and winning routing preference for merchant acquirers. I think that's the first time I've
heard you talk about that, Ajay. And we obviously know Visa has kind of planned to incentivize merchants and
acquirers. So I guess my question is, is won't that pressure some of your rebates and incentives going forward? And
how do we think about that? And then secondly, are you worried a little bit that you could lose some PIN share if you

don't incentivize some of these merchant acquirers now that Visa's put out this strategy? Thanks so much.
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: Thanks. And actually, it's not the first time I've talked about the routing preference and
incentives. It's just that I'm sticking to my way of thinking about it, which is, I don't plan to go out with a broad-based
approach. I don't need to. I will do these selectively with certain merchants, where I believe it makes a difference to the
kind of volume that we get on our debit business. We are already – been doing some of those, even prior to the changes
in the rule, because we've been having relationships with selected merchants where we feel that they will either make a
difference to reducing the use of cash or they will make a difference to the perception of how debit can be used. And
that's not a new thing. And the difference only is, you aren't seeing as big an impact on our rebates and incentives line
as you may have seen with other competitors. But I – honestly, you've got to ask them that question. I don't know why
that is the case. Mine is what it is.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, in fact, let me just add to it. Of our $110 million of increase in incentives in the
third quarter, the vast majority is really related to volume performance, okay? There's only a small portion related to
signing new agreements or renewing agreements.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. So no additional expense to think about as we head into 2012 as a result of this?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Look, as Ajay said before, things are changing every day. The market has to work
through a dislocation that happened from the legislation. And we are going to have to work through that. So I'm not –
we're not going to talk about 2012 at this point in time. This is only our third quarter results. Typically, we give you on
the February call, with our full-year disclosure, we give you typically a few words about the next year. But the situation
is fluid, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Thanks so much.
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: Bryan, think about what I said earlier. We're going to keep our flexibility going. I think,
among other things like the economic environment, I think similar to that, this whole debit environment is still moving
around. And I don't want to give you thoughts about something I don't have fixed right now directly for next year. It
would be a mistaken guidance to give you. I don't want to do that.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Thanks for the color.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Next question, operator?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of CLSA. Please proceed.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yeah, good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on Brazil. I was curious if the end of
exclusivity and the opening up of those systems down there added anything to your growth rate? And if we should
think about any type of grow-over effect from that? Thanks.
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: Hey, Craig, that's a great question. Actually, when Redecard existed earlier in its original
form and the predecessor to Cielo, which was the Visa-based acquiring scheme, existed in its earlier form, actually the
distribution for the Cielo predecessor was wider than the distribution for Redecard in its predecessor form. And so, in
fact, the opening up of that market effectively expanded the distribution for MasterCard to the same level as that of all
of the other competitors. Now, it did that for others, too. But it actually helped us in that sense.
Mind you, I'm not talking about a 50% expansion. I'm talking about way south of that number. But it did help. Should
you be thinking about that in a lapping sense? It's not a significant amount. I think the bigger issue in Brazil in a
lapping sense is the Itaú processing, which lapped in September. And the second issue, of course, out there is Brazil's
economy and how well it holds up. And I mean, there's constant guidance that comes around Brazil, saying doing well
on commodities, struggling on industrial production, so we keep an eye on that as well. But I would say – I wouldn't
factor a great deal in my mind, at least, of the lapping caused by the removal of exclusivity.

Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks. You process and actually handle the authorization and settlement in about five or six
countries, and I think you highlighted today new processing in Brazil and Netherlands, which I think you may have
discussed before. But that's obviously continued to contribute to growth. And I think these types of transactions really
boost your revenue yield per transaction longer term. So can you just comment on that for a minute? Have there been
any other further changes in the landscape, maybe SEPA [Single Euro Payments Area] or others that really might
incrementally continue to open up the opportunity to process more transactions around the world versus just the brand
transactions?
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: Seeing your transactions and processing them is always useful for a company like ours, not
just for what we get as the revenue directly from it. But for what it gives us as the ability to sell other value-added
products based on what we see in those transactions. And so all the effort we do with an inControl or a fraud
management capability or behavioral scoring through advisors, all that does get enhanced when we see transactions. So
I believe that's what we'd like to do.
Now, we're trying our best to improve our position in that space across the world. And I think SEPA clearly, as we've
talked about, does provide a degree of opportunity there. And in fact, our progress in SEPA over the last, I'd say, few
months and few quarters has actually shown some of that. Our transactions in SEPA have been beyond the ones we're
seeing, are up beyond 100%. In fact, our processing of domestic transactions grew 180% in the third quarter of 2011
and have grown 113% year-to-date. Now, it's on a small base, and Europe takes – it's an evolution, as we can see in the
newspapers right now. Europe is not at revolution, although it feels like in the roads of Greece.
But I'd say to you, that's what we are trying to do. Yes, SEPA and the Payment Systems Directive does provide
opportunities in Europe. Yes, there are opportunities like that in other countries around the world, as domestic schemes
that were created over time begin to find that the economics of staying up-to date with the technology investments
required to be that way, no longer make sense and to start coming to players of scale to say, boy, you've got the scale
across 200 countries. Why am I redoing it in every country? That's the principal way in which we get into these
processing transactions. It's very important to us. It's a constant effort. It's a slow effort.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay, that's helpful. Just one quick follow-up. Conversations progressing with banks
regarding debit pricing, especially given now, with the U.S. banks primarily retracting their debit usage fees that many
had planned to instate, can you comment on the course of action you think these banks might take to take advantage of
– or really just try to replace the debit interchange revenue now?
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: They've been – I would tell you that the amount of noise made in the media about one
particular aspect of what they're trying to do is what the media chooses to do. But they've been doing things with the
taking away of free checking accounts for a while. They've done things with different fees. They've looked at their
rewards on debit cards. They're looking at every line of cost in their system.
If you think about it, it's a fair amount of revenue that is moving from them to some of the retailers over this period of
time. And they're going to try and find ways to make sense. I don't know what they're going to do. I don't know yet. But
I know what they're trying to do is to look at every single line item, from the cost of running a branch, to the cost of
rewards, to checking accounts, and also they had looked recently at debit card fees, and looks like that one's gone away
for the time being.

Your next question comes from the line of David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Please proceed.
<Q - David Hochstim>: Yeah, hi. Thanks. Could you give us an update on what's happening with China and with your
relationship with China UnionPay and how much cross-border volume in China is affecting the APMEA numbers?
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: Well, I'm not going to give you specifics on China's cross-border volume, but it's healthy and
growing. I would say on China UnionPay, our relationship carries on from where it was over the last few quarters.
We're now at the mobile payment gateway trial. We have done that. It's complete. We're actually moving towards
commercial production of that. Eventually, the plan is for us to help them increase their acceptance overseas, while that
would help us increase acceptance for our brand in China. But it's not just about increasing acceptance. It's based on
getting revenue from their acceptance for them and for us. So those are the kind of things we are working through with
them. We continue to work with them on this cross-border outside of China relationship. As you know, domestically,
the market is still a controlled market, with China UnionPay being in a monopoly position, and with us and
competitors, all of ours, not being allowed to play there, and that's an unfortunate situation.
<Q - David Hochstim>: Okay. And, again, I guess I asked earlier, but in Europe, just to be clear, that if you looked at
sort of the same customers over time, there's no change in spending behavior?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: At this point in time, we are really not seeing any significant changes, David.
<Q - David Hochstim>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Operator, I think we have time for one last question.

Yes. Your final question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of GIC. Please proceed.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Hi. Thank you. Martina, just a quick clarification on Europe, what is the growth rate, ex-that
add in Netherlands, and kind of when does it lap into next year? And then, just separately, I was just wondering if you
guys had any thoughts on Durbin's request for an FTC study on the Small-Bank Debit Interchange Exemption? Thank
you.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Okay, let me take the first one. Ajay will take the second one. But really where you see
the Netherlands showing up in a big way is in the transaction processing numbers, which are very, very healthy in
Europe. I think I said 30% plus, at this point in time. In the volume numbers, as well as in the cross-border numbers
that I was quoting for Europe, you're not really seeing a significant impact from the Netherlands. So this is very good
across all of the countries. And, remember, this is not just Western Europe. There's a healthy portion of Eastern Europe
in there.
<A - Ajaypal S. Banga>: And, Sanjay, as far as the second part of it is concerned, I continue to believe that once the
law is the law, we will ensure that we implement it to the best of our capability. And in that law, the banks below $10
billion are entitled to a differential interchange from those above. And I'm determined to implement that with the full
force of what I can do. So whether Senator Durbin wants to investigate it one way or the other is his call. And I think
it's his prerogative. But I'm just determined as a company to do what's right. And now the law is the law and that's what
we're going to do.

So let me leave you with just a few closing thoughts. We've delivered really good results year-to-date, due not only to
strength in our base business across all five of our regions, but also driven by volume and transactions from new deals.
We remain watchful of macroeconomic trends around the world. We are always ready to react, as Martina was saying
in response to a question. If we see those trends going in a direction that begins to impact our business, as we discussed
at our investor meeting, we believe that global [ph] BCE (1:01:07) will continue to grow over time. There'll be ups and
downs by country, ups and downs by year. But in the meantime, we continue to invest and execute at a very local level
to drive acceptance in new categories, displace cash, and bring the benefits of electronic payments to more people and
more institutions. Cash is not free. It costs up to 1.5% of GDP for a central bank to print it, secure it, and distribute it. It
comes at a cost to banks. It comes at a cost to merchants. It comes at a cost to consumers.
We will continue to push innovative products into the market that drive efficiencies and growth for all of these
stakeholders and, in turn, I believe, this will drive MasterCard's share and long-term revenue growth. So once again,
thank you for your support for our company. Thank you for your time today and I look forward to seeing some of you
again over the next few months.
