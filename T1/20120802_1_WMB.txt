MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams Companies Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference
Call. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter
Thank you. Good morning and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams. As you know,
yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com.
These items include the press release of our results with related schedules and our analyst package; a presentation on
our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and
an update to our quarterly data book, which contains detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.
This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments and then we will open the discussion for Q&A. Rory Miller is
here from our Midstream business; Randy Barnard is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel
is also available to respond to any questions.
In yesterday's presentation and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to
forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it.
Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to
generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation

materials.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thanks, John, and good morning. Thanks for joining us and I know it's a busy time right now and so we
appreciate you being able to take the time out for us.
Well, certainly, despite a very disappointing financial performance in the second quarter and significantly lower margin
forecasts for the balance of 2012 and 2013, we're very pleased that despite that we're able to continue to remain
confident in our very well-supported dividend growth, which is still at 55% here in 2012 and 20% both in 2013 and
2014. So a lot of our confidence on that continues to come from a degree of coverage that we've had built in to our
model, as well as the extraordinary maintenance costs or maintenance capital we have built in to PZ right now and as
well a lot of continued strong growth coming from our fee-based business.
Our second quarter performance was certainly impacted by rapid decline in NGL prices, but a few things as well hit us.
One thing I think that doesn't always – isn't always obvious in the way we report is that we also have a pretty
significant amount of product that's in transit that is held in pipelines and of course that gets remarked each quarter
based on the pricing decline. So in fact, in this period, we had about a $22 million impact on that over and above what
you would see in your typical pricing model. So whenever we see prices move down, they get somewhat accelerated
and when we see it move back the other way it comes back to us.
But there certainly were other factors as well beyond pricing. Some growing pains, the Boreal Pipeline line fill, the
high startup O&M costs associated with the Caiman pipe – sorry, the Caiman acquisition that we now refer to as Ohio
Valley and as well quite a bit of depreciation expense going on with that as well. But we also had higher maintenance
costs, which we accelerated some of our work out in a lot of our western plants as we had a third-party fractionator
being out during the second quarter that required us to take some of our plants down. So we took advantage of that and
accelerated things like a lot of turbine overhauls and vessel maintenance during the period.
The good news for the quarter, a 19% increase in our fee-based business within our midstream portion of WPZ and we
had – certainly had great progress on our major project execution going on during the quarter as well. So we remain
very confident in the way our model is growing, particularly on the fee-based business side.
Just commenting quickly on prices. Certainly, the second quarter drop that we had from first to second quarter was over
20% on our NGL margins and the balance for the year is forecasted to be approximately 30% lower than what we
recognized in first quarter of 2012. So we certainly have – in this model we have taken it down to what we're seeing
and certainly we expect for prices, particularly on the light-end products, ethane and propane, to be very choppy as we
see a lot of new infrastructure and supply coming on, on the NGL side but a bit ahead of a lot of the petrochemical
build-out and some of the export build-out on the propane side. The NGL crude ratios are really what drove this. A lot
of folks have thought about this from a crude standpoint and really the crude price had very little to do with this. And
we've got in our forecast we've got NGL to crude ratios running at about 40% here through the balance of the year
versus historical average of 60% and the 50 – almost 57% that we realized in 2011.
So certainly that disconnect that we saw on the ethane and propane side is what really damaged the second quarter from
a pricing standpoint, and we expect that to continue as the market needs to rebalance on the supply side on both ethane
and propane. The good news, of course, for Williams is, with the Geismar facility we – as we're expanding that, we
move away from a lot of the risk on the ethane choppiness. We're not at all bearish long-term on NGLs as much as we
are realizing that there's going to be a lot of infrastructure changes going on as this market tries to build out and we
think there will be quite a bit of volatility associated with that.
Onto project news, a lot of great efforts going on around the company right now in terms of building out our $9 billion
that's in our guidance for CapEx through 2014. The Boreal Pipeline we brought on this certainly in the second quarter
and that was brought on below budget – below our planned budget, excuse me, and as well brought in a little ahead of

schedule. Our ethane extraction project in Canada is also going very well. And that project's being very well executed.
So this would really be the third project, the ethane extraction project, that we've managed up there, the first being the
BB splitter, the Boreal Pipeline and now the ethane extraction project. And our Canadian team continues to do a great
job of executing on those projects.
Likewise, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our Gulfstar project's going ahead very nicely. The Keathley Canyon
project is doing very well. And I'll tell you, we remain very bullish on the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as an oil province
and we really think that we're very well-positioned to provide a lot of the service as the deepwater comes back. The
Caiman or Ohio Valley efforts, a lot of effort going on in the build-out. People from really all over our systems up there
trying to assist with getting that business built-out and a tremendous amount of activity going on, a lot of promise, and
we're very excited about the way things are going so far on that acquisition.
The Laurel Mountain Midstream build-out, we're getting to the point where we're almost, can say that we're not
constraining production there with the infrastructure. We have for some time, a lot of that volumes have been limited
by our infrastructure up there as Chevron continues to drill out that acreage, and we're about to get to the point where
we'll be out in front of them a little bit with the expansion. So we're excited about that. And then of course, the Geismar
expansion continues to go very well and is well contracted at this point.
In the Gas Pipeline space, the Northeast Supply Link project continues ahead and as well, our Rockaway Lateral, we
are hopeful that we can get a positive response that, that is waiting on a bill in front of Congress and so we're looking
forward to that.
In addition, we also have a lot of new projects that have been recently announced, the Canadian propane
dehydrogenation project, which would be there at our Redwater facility. We think we're extremely well-positioned for
that project and is a very nice complement to our propylene production that we have there today in Canada already.
And then the Utica JV that we announced, we're excited about the promise of that, a little early to comment too much
on that today, but that JV is completed. And we're excited about the promises there and you'll see in our capital
guidance you'll see that we've added in capital for that JV in terms of our expectation for that.
And then the just announced Leidy expansion and really excited about the way that's gone. That project winds up being
a very nice project for us in terms of being able to expand along our Leidy system, and we think that'll be both a lower
risk project for us in the immediate term but also provides, we think, a great value to producers and/or markets in
giving them great access to those supplies up there, so very excited about that. And we certainly haven't shut the door
in any way, shape or form on the Atlantic Access. But we're not about to go ahead with a very risky build like that
without very strong support from the producer community and in terms of contract would make sense for the kind of
return that's allowed in the pipeline space.
Finally, the [ph] Dolphin Lateral, (10:41) Mobile Bay South are also projects that are gaining steam here in the second
quarter and into the third quarter. And so our backlog continues to mount as does our confidence in our strategy and our
growth in our dividend.
And so with that, I'll turn it over for questions.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Kevin Smith with Raymond James.
<Q - Kevin C. Smith>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Kevin C. Smith>: Can you all speak on the Boreal Pipeline, how much that lowered your NGL volumes by this
quarter when you started up and to fill it?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Rory, you want to take this?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, that was about $9 million hit to us with the cost to fill.
<Q - Kevin C. Smith>: Got you. No reason that any of that should impact 3Q, right? That's all behind?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: I'm sorry? I didn't catch that. Could you repeat that second question?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: He asked if it would effect third quarter at all.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: I don't think so. The line is full now and so we'll [ph] gear in (12:10) that, but there shouldn't
be any additional hit after that.
<Q - Kevin C. Smith>: Okay, thanks. And then my second question. On the Geismar plant, can you kind of talk a little
bit about how much EBITDA and cash flow that's generating right now? And I guess where you are in your CapEx
plans for it?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: We typically haven't released individual numbers for Geismar. The second part of your
question on the CapEx plans, we've got a couple of capital projects going on there right now. We're upgrading some of
our furnaces. I think we've got – that project's partially completed but it's ongoing. And then of course, we've got our
major expansion is planned to be in service in third quarter 2013. Those are the main CapEx plans for Geismar at this
point.
<Q - Kevin C. Smith>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.
Operator
And Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering has our next question.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Hi, good morning, everyone.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: A couple of questions on the Atlantic Access and the Leidy announcements. I assume it's or – I
assume it's safe to say that given that Leidy is kind of running along the existing lateral, that's going to be a higher
return project than building out the new laterals to Butler and Natrium would have been?
<A - Frank J. Ferazzi>: Alan, is that something you'd like me to take?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, Frank, please.
<A - Frank J. Ferazzi>: Yeah. I think, as Alan said, the fact that we have the existing Leidy Line already there, that
the execution risk associated with the new build would be less than a greenfield project. The economics of each of the
pieces are going to be a function of the kind of shipper commitments that you get. So as Alan also said, we're going to
continue to monitor the interest along that new greenfield build. And we will proceed with that when we get enough
interest from producers to support an economic project. We're just not there for an in-service date of 2015. But based
on the projections that we've seen of production in the area, we think at some time that will make economic sense.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay. And as far as the Natrium lateral that was cancelled, so that moves – that was kind of
designed to move gas out of southwest PA and northern West Virginia. Should we view the cancellation or at least the
delay of Natrium as having any read-throughs for your production forecast in the part of the Marcellus where the Ohio
Valley assets are also operating?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, I'll take that. No, that is not in any way, shape or form the case. We're very confident
in the volumes there and the drilling activity that continues there. I think the producers are fairly confident in the area

and are happy to take the prices that they can get on some of the systems that are further to the east over there. And so,
time will tell if that'll hold up in terms of those net backs. But today, I think they are confident that there's adequate
takeaway there today. Again, that's – that becomes crowded. Once it becomes crowded, the price will decline. But I
think today, as is evidenced by the interest, it's – they're pretty comfortable with the current gas markets coming out of
that space today.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: That's really helpful. Thanks. Another one on Transco operations, looking at – and I understand
that most Transco revenue is firm. But there is a variable component that can move around quarter-to-quarter. And I
know this is a seasonally weaker quarter historically for Transco. But it looks as though there's that revenue, or
EBITDA per Mcf, on Transco this quarter was kind of lower than it had been on a year-over-year and a
quarter-over-quarter basis. Is that just because the nature of the volumes are just increasingly short-haul? And so, on a
kind of per-unit basis, you're seeing revenues decline? Or was there something operationally with Transco this quarter
that made the results a little bit softer there?
<A - Frank J. Ferazzi>: This is Frank Ferazzi. As you indicated, we do have some costs allocated [ph] in eruptible
(16:48) transportation and we tend to – in fact, can be impacted by changes in seasons. Obviously, we're going to do
better in the winter there than we're going to do in the summer. There really were no operational issues that occurred in
the second quarter that would have resulted in lower earnings.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay, great. And then just one last one. I guess, from an accounting perspective, why was it that
the accelerated maintenance that you talked about in the Rockies, why did that show up in higher Midstream OpEx as
opposed to capital? And as a result of that accelerated maintenance, would it be reasonable to expect that maybe the run
rate OpEx for the remainder of 2012 would be lower in the Midstream segment?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, that wasn't maintenance capital. It was just O&M that was accelerated. And mainly,
we were moving forward from what would otherwise be spent in the third and fourth quarter. So we should see some
moderation forward-looking for the rest of the year, based on that work that we did.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great. That's all for me. Thank you.
Operator
Moving next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Hi, guys. Thanks for the call.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: A couple questions here. First, a follow-on to Kevin's Boreal question. Was that $9 million hit
all expected just for packing the new line? Or was that inclusive of some impact from the Suncor plant being down?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, that was just from the line pack.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: And what was the impact from the Suncor plant?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Hang on just a second, let me pull that up.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: While that's being looked for, on the prepared comments, or the recorded comments, I was a
little unclear on what the timeframe was, the duration, for the underwater ethylene supply contracts that kind of halved
margins at Geismar versus what the market opportunities really were in the first half?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Those basically time out pretty well at the end of this year, a little bit of run into
2013. But by the end of 2013, there's not any residual impact from that. So mostly current, mostly by the end of 2012,
most of those contracts run out.

<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And then, if we're still looking up that Boreal question from Suncor, I had one last
follow-up here.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I do have that, if you want me to interject that here.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Sure, go ahead.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah, it looks like it was a little over $4 million for Q2 that was related to that Suncor
outage.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. So the $9 million was naturally expected because you knew you had to finish the
pipeline and fill it. But the $4 million is the unexpected hit. Is that a fair statement?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yes, that is. And part of that lapped into Q1 and then part into Q2.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: And you're talking about the line packing?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I'm talking about the Suncor outage. They had one unit down for about 15 days and
another unit was operating about 75% load. So the $4 million is related just strictly to the Q2 outage. And then the $9
million is isolated to just the effect of the Boreal line backup.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Got you. And the last question. Alan, how do you avoid the issues regarding non-qualified
income at PZ with a potential drop-down of Geismar? Does that seem to be the logical thing all along? Somehow to
either contract or drop down to make a true internal operating hedge, rather than just a consolidated accounting hedge?
But there's always this question of non-qualified income at the MLP. Did you find a way around that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I would just say that – I would say we took it head-on. And I would say that we're
very confident in how we're handling that. And time will tell, in terms of what gets exposed there, about what supports
that confidence.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: As far as details on any drop-down, how imminent do you think that could be?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Craig, I think – this is Don. I think we'd be working through the process with the WPZ
Conflicts Committee and their advisors. But we expect the closing in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Moving on to Carl Kirst with BMO.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And this is actually just a follow-on to Craig's about the
qualifying income and recognizing it was only limited. Maybe you can say, but I guess, regardless of how this is
approached just, since this is somewhat of a precedent, will there be some type of private letter ruling, or some
clarification from the IRS, that sets it in stone?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Again, I would just say we are very confident in how that's going to be treated and that's
really all we want to say about it at this point, so.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: It's Don. I'd just add that again, we think that it's some information that provides a
competitive advantage for us. So that's the reason that we're not more clear, in terms of the basis for our confidence.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay. No, that latter statement's very helpful. So I appreciate that. And maybe just a couple of
follow-ups. One, going back to the accelerated maintenance that was done on the Midstream side, did that actually – in
the third-party fractionator outage, did that have an impact on the equity sales volumes for the quarter and if so, by how
much?

<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yes, it did. We had total production related directly to the Bushton frac outage was about 25
million gallons. And of that, about 15 million was related to our own equity account.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay. Thank you. Then, one other question just on Geismar. This just goes to the utilization. The
74% utilization kind of on par with second quarter last year, but down sequentially. Was that just normal maintenance
for this time of year? Or was something else going on there?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. We did, in Q2, have a turbine issue there that had us down, I believe it was seven days.
One of those days was actually in Q1. And then the remaining six days was in Q2. And we were – I think that was
related to about 28 million pounds total being down about 24 [ph] – that was (24:36) in April.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay, yeah. That would explain the difference. Great. And then last question and this really is
just Caiman, Ohio Valley, I guess. Just trying to set the baseline for where we are today. Is it possible to break out what
the volumes were for the second quarter?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, let me see. I've got a right-hand man looking that up right now. But I will say in
general, Alan mentioned a little bit about what's going on there from a producer interest standpoint. In general, I would
say the volume situation has been very positive. We've got producers waiting on pipeline, waiting on infrastructure.
The results are looking very favorable. I think all of the movement that we've heard on volumes from producers has
been to the upside, if anything. So the area and the quality, the reserves look fantastic.
Let's see. Yeah, so for second quarter, we're right around 182 BBtu and about 20 million gallons of NGL production.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: I apologize. Can you repeat those numbers?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: 182 BBtu per day.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: And 20 – you said 20 million gallons?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: 20 million gallons, yes.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: And that's just two months of production.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thank you, Alan.
Operator
Moving on to Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Just some follow-ups. On the Geismar proposed
drop-down, you mentioned in the release of taking units back. Is the idea that this would potentially be solely WPZ
units going up to WMB to fund this?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Steve, this is Don. Yes, and that's really tax-driven. If we take cash, we'll pay taxes and tax
basis is fairly modest. So we're implying to take units to be tax efficient and have as little value lost to taxes as possible.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Appreciating that you haven't released individual numbers on Geismar's cash
generating ability, but you do put a chart in there that shows ethylene produced and the margin. Is there something else
to it other than that arithmetic for us to figure out?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, that – I would say that's the bulk of it. You also have propylene production and
butadiene production as well. [ph] And so that (27:20) and the operating costs are the other elements you'd have to get
to so [ph] you get to that bit down there (27:24).

<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Final thing on the Geismar. Is there a thought as to what – right now, you're
forecasting 1.03 coverage next year at WPZ. Is there an idea of what this would take PZ's coverage to where you'd like
to see it after this?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Steve, I don't think we want to put any numbers out. We're in discussions with the
Conflicts Committee at this point. So I think as we reach that agreement with the Conflicts Committee, we'll announce
the transaction and provide updated guidance for both WPZ and Williams at that time.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would say, obviously, we recognize that, that business is not a fee-based business. And so
our coverage needs to be higher than – certainly higher than normal in terms of how that would impact them.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. And then you talked about, I think, an ethylene margin rebound as part of the 2014
earnings going up. Can you talk just a little bit about what the thoughts are behind the drivers for that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. We certainly feel like that the U.S. continues to be the advantage and North America
in general and I would say continues to be the advantage place to produce ethylene. And we see the demand continuing
to come up on a global basis through the period and so pretty confident in the general fundamentals around ethylene.
And if you think about somebody trying to build ethylene capacity somewhere else in the face of this very low cost
natural gas, I think that drives our confidence and certainly we have a pretty good picture of what's going on in the
ethylene capacity here in the U.S. Very fortunate to have Geismar on the front-end of any of these capacity expansions.
But there's really not very much other coming on in the near turn – sorry, in the near-term through 2014. So see great
promise coming on, a lot of NGL supplies coming on but it just takes a while to build that cracking capacity to meet
that increased demand that's coming on. And so that builds our confidence.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. thanks. And then finally on the proposed PDH facility, a couple of things. You
talked about, I guess, transporting I think the propylene to the U.S. Gulf Coast. How would that happen? And then is
that going to be funded with – is there enough cash on hand and be able to fund all that?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. That would be rail, is the plan. And I think our belief is that with our current
international funds, offshore accounts and the cash flow from the existing business that is growing along with our
ethylene project that, that should be fairly well self-contained.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: We do rail today a tremendous amount of propylene out of Redwater already today. And so
this would be just additive which is again a nice feature that a lot of the infrastructure in terms of storage of propylene
and railing and loading of propylene, we've already got all that in place. So this is just additive and I think that's why
we feel very confident about us being the right builder of that PDH facility in Canada.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: We've also got the BB splitter up there which is going to help us with co-products. We've also
got a very unique situation with our sale to NOVA of the ethane/ethylene mix. And so those are advantages that we
think we uniquely hold. And so it appears to be an advantaged opportunity for us.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Thanks, everybody.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks.

Moving on to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Yeah, thanks. Sticking with the PDH unit here, have you given any thought to actually
contracting out some of the propylene volumes? Or do you want to kind of keep that price risk on the propylene side as
well?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: We're looking at kind of all of our options right now. I would say right now, our main focus is
on scoping, getting some of the initial engineering work done and we're looking at all of the options. And certainly

disposition of the propylene is one of the big decisions that we'll be making to – before we sanction the project. But
that's an ongoing exercise.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. And then appreciate the slides on the ethylene crack. And it looks like you're forecasting
in 2014 that you won't quite get to the industry benchmark. I'm just wondering what would cause you to be short of that
plus or minus to hit it or to be short of it?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: When you say industry benchmark, are you talking about the spot [ph] with the (32:35) crack
spread?
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Yeah. That ethylene spread that you show in 2014, it looks like you realize margin might be
short of that. I'm just wondering is that – is there something with Geismar that you wouldn't hit the industry margin? Or
is there just a difference in the definition there?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: There are a couple of things at work there. And one is that even though I think we flagged
earlier that in early 2013, we'll have an opportunity to re-contract almost our entire portfolio, we'll still have a legacy
contract out there that won't be fully exposed to the spot market. So that's one piece of the story. I think the other piece
of the story is just a little bit of conservatism that's built into how we're able to execute in terms of putting those spot
contracts into place. And at times there is some give and take between a true spot market deal and a term deal that's tied
to the spot markets.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: But your intention is to pretty much be spot, in other words to not do term deals with Geismar?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yes.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. And then just coming back a little bit to the questions on the ethylene margin. Do you
care to share what your actual ethane price forecasts are that get you to that ethylene margin in 2014?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, $0.55 a gallon.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: $0.55 a gallon of ethane. Okay, that's great. I think everything else has been hit for me. Thanks,
guys.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Thank you.

Moving on to Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Good morning, gentlemen. Lots of questions on Geismar this morning. So just maybe time to tie
the bow there. In the slides, you point out the shift in mix to spot pricing. I know previously we had talked about kind
of a half-based on fee, half-based on exposure to the spread. I'm assuming kind of addressing Craig's question earlier,
by the end of 2012 will be all based on the spread. Is that how to think about it?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes. I think that's accurate. Of course, a lot can happen between now and then. But
certainly our goal there will be to be bound – be balanced against our ethane exposure.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay. And then you kind of give the chart here. Can you just tell us what your margin was that
you realized on the spread in 2Q?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Stand by, Holly. Yeah, $0.20.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Say that again. Sorry?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: $0.20 a pound.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: $0.20? Okay.

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: And that was down from $0.40 in the first quarter of 2012.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: $0.40 in 1Q. That's perfect. And then last...
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: [ph] Maybe a correction – sorry, Holly, we've, if (35:26) thinking about the portfolio mix, I
think Alan was referencing the crack spread out there as opposed to our realized margin, so Q1 was $0.18 and 2Q was
$0.20.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Thanks.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That $0.40, which was first half 2012, that's really what the broad market crack spread was
and so that's basically what we've got built into our 2014 pricing, is at that $0.40 level.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay, perfect. And then, last quarter you gave some nice commentary on kind of the different
rig counts that you were seeing across each of your areas. Has anything on the rig count side changed since last call that
might impact things here, moving throughout the year?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, this is Rory. I think in general, that kind of step-down in activity out west that we
flagged for you is still pretty consistent. I don't think there are any material changes to that level of activity.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay. Okay, great. And then finally, just one kind of follow-up on the macro side of things.
We're hearing commentary that most of those ethylene plants that were down for maintenance in the first half of the
year are back up and running. Is there anything else that's kind of still weighing on that?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. Right now, if you think about ethane supply, and that's always a challenge to measure
that accurately, but about 1 million barrels a day right now on the supply side is where we think it's at. All of the
crackers are up and running now, thank goodness, and that's about 1 million barrels a day of demand. So we see supply
and demand very much in balance. I think in Q4, there are two crackers that are scheduled to go down temporarily. So
that's all we see for the remainder of the year. So the situation should be a little more stable than what we saw in the
first half.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Great. I appreciate the commentary.

Moving on to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi, good morning. It looks like for your MC&O business, the guidance refers to a coverage of 1.3
times. [ph] When you've got (37:57) – I guess Geismar is dropped down to WPZ level. Do you think that type of
coverage on those cash flows is still appropriate? Or are you comfortable with something a bit lower given the natural
hedge?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Sharon, I think you're going to have to stay-tuned for that. But clearly, yes, it does sharply
reduce ethane exposure or eliminates the long ethane position after the expansion at WPZ. So we've certainly reduced
that, but we'll have ethylene exposure and we'll need to make sure that our coverage is sufficient to account for that.
And again, if ethylene prices are very high, you would expect to have relatively high coverage on that part of the
business, and if ethylene prices are lower, we would expect less coverage just like with our NGLs today. And if you
look at slide number 83, I think we try to indicate that somewhat, but we'll be tuning that up as we go through
discussions with the Conflicts Committee as well as continue to look at our view of the forward markets.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And I guess also related to the Geismar drop-down, should we just assume that it would be
structured so that WPZ would not be paying I guess taxes on that cash flow?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yes.

<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And then I guess on the PDH potential project, can you – do you have like a potential
in-service timing of that facility? Is it a 2015 project?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yes. I don't think we've released anything on that yet. And it is, as we noted, kind of in the
scoping phase right now. So that's probably something we'll be able to give a little more color on in the coming
quarters. But I think right now, it's a little preliminary to drive a stake in the ground.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And then I guess in terms of feeling comfortable to proceed with that comp – project, would
you be looking to secure minimum volume commitments or like a fixed propylene margin?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yes. I think that kind of gets back to the earlier answer that I gave around disposition of the
propylene, and we're looking at all the options. Of course, if you do lock something and fixed, you're probably giving
away some upside, and those are decisions that we'll be making as the project gets fully vetted and pulled together. So
we should have a good line of sight on that by the time that project is in action.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay, great. And then I guess the last question, in terms of the Leidy announcement, has that
CapEx been included in your budget yet?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, it has not. So when we come forward again with guidance, we'll update to include
that, assuming that the open season is concluded and we've got all the contracts tied down so we know the size of that.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay, great. Thank you.

And moving on to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Hi, guys. Sorry, still one more question on Geismar. I respect your desire for the competitive
advantage, but when you do the drop, since it is very significant, will you provide investors the basis for why you think
that you will not pay taxes on the income?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Becca, I think you'll have to stay-tuned for that. I think we'll have to see if that's something
that is required or we feel as [indiscernible] (41:51) something that we need to offer. Again, I think we believe that we
have something that is unique at this point and we want to make sure we take full advantage of it without necessarily
offering the roadmap for others.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. Thank you. And then on the PDH facility, as I understand it you'll need about 20,000
barrels a day or 20 million barrels a day of propane, is that correct? And you have 7,000? So where will the incremental
come from to source that PDH facility?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Well, as you're probably aware from previous calls, we do have other projects that we're
working on out there. So the – over time, we do expect our equity propane to increase. But there's – there are plenty of
places between now and then to buy propane in Canada. So we don't think the supply side is any particular challenge
for us right now. And we're very comfortable with that, whether we're going out on the open market and buying it or
whether we're just building it over time with our internal equity barrels.
<Q - Becca Followill>: And then the rail costs to get it down to the Gulf Coast. What kind of delta in propane prices do
you need relative to the Gulf Coast in order to make up for that $0.05 a pound rail cost?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. I don't think we want to get into probably that level of detail yet.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: We've got ongoing analysis on that. And I'd just say let's leave that for a future call. But we do
think the situation is very favorable and very supportive of that project. But we have some continued analysis that is
ongoing on that.

<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. And then, finally, on Marcellus. If my memory serves me well, you guys were
expecting gathered volumes from the Susquehanna Hub of about a Bcf a day this year and Laurel Mountain about 215
million a day. Is that still the case?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Those are generally in the neighborhood. I think on Laurel Mountain, we're probably already
over that. I think we're up around 280 million, if I'm not mistaken, on Laurel Mountain. And I think our target on
Susquehanna Hub is just shy of a Bcf a day by the end of the year.
<Q - Becca Followill>: And where are you guys now on Susquehanna?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Let's see. Hang on just a second, Becca. Let me see if I can track that down.
