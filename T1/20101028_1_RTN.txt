Bill.
William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results during the quarter with sales of 6.3 billion,
adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of 413 million. Bookings
during the quarter were 6 billion, and on a year-to-date basis, our book-to-bill ratio was around 1. Our missile business
brought in over $2 billion on orders during the quarter driven by broad-based demand from U.S. and international
customers.
At our other businesses, the pipeline remains healthy. We continue to see strong demand. We also see a continuation of
the congestion that we discussed on our prior conference calls and webcasts that impact the timing of awards. I'd like to
put it in perspective. We really don't see the "if" issue, just when. And in this environment, when it is little more
difficult to predict. Given that, the onus is on us to further reduce our cycle times. We have an internal push to increase
speed, and we applaud the government's efforts to increase efficiency and reform export control. I think that's good for
both sides.
Within this environment of challenges and opportunities, we continue to execute well. Our strong program
performance, coupled with Six Sigma and lean processes that take costs out of our business is reflected in our results
during the quarter. Our updated outlook for the year and our competitive position also reflects this domestically and
internationally.
Our customers in the U.S. are dealing with challenges. What I'm hearing from that DOD leadership is that the
department needs to continue to invest in capabilities to defeat threats to national security. At the same time, economic
conditions require an increased focus on controlling costs on both sides. We support the DOD's overall objectives to
prioritize spending, improve efficiency, reward contractors that deliver strong program performance and we stand ready
to help.
On the international side, our business is strong and continues to grow. International sales in the third quarter were up
11%, reaching 24% of our total sales. Again, the driver is the threat environment, which remains high, particularly in
the Middle East and parts of Asia. Our customers in these regions have the resources to support the required
investments in their security. We have a number of additional important international orders in various stages of the
procurement and notification process.
If you stand back and look at world events, the threat environment remains high. It hasn't changed. For all of us, this
means that we need to get even better at what we do. Raytheon's well positioned for the future. We have outstanding
technology. We have a flexible portfolio, and our consistent focus on providing innovative, affordable and proven
solutions will ensure that we remain well positioned. To help put that in perspective, we've institutionalized Six Sigma
in the philosophy of continuous improvement. We made the tough choices on getting the utilization rates in our
factories up. We've invested in common engineering, supply chain, financial, IT and HR systems that enable us to
design anywhere, manufacture anywhere and ship from anywhere. And our talent can transfer their knowledge across
the company.
We have a strong balance sheet for some time now, so we have the financial strength to continue to make the right
investments in our business and for our shareholders. We are a company that is a consistent performer with a strong
and focused portfolio of programs, and our businesses are well- managed. It's a portfolio built on industry-leading
technologies, core capabilities and on opportunities to apply both to meet our customers' needs in the U.S. and in the
world. Our business model enables us to benefit whether our technologies are used to build new systems or to upgrade
existing systems. We support our customers in multiple ways.

In closing, we'll continue to work with our customers to deliver products and services they need for mission success. In
that regard, the environment today is exactly what it was yesterday. It's all about innovation, performance, affordability
and agility, and we strive to be the very best in each of these areas.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening comments, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be
referring to the webslides that we issued earlier this morning.
Okay, if everyone would please turn to page 3. Strong operational performance across the company drove our margin,
EPS and operating cash flow results during the quarter. Sales were $6.3 billion, which I'll discuss further in a few
moments. Adjusted operating margin was 12.9% up 60 basis points. Our adjusted EPS of $1.36 was up 9%, primarily
the result of operational improvements and capital deployment actions.
Third quarter 2010 adjusted EPS excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment and the favorable tax settlement that we
received during the quarter related to multiple prior years of tax filings. We delivered solid operating cash flow from
continuing operations of $413 million, driven primarily by the timing of initiatives related to working capital
management.
We continue to improve our working capital efficiency. And by way of example, we've increased our operational
working capital turns from 10.4 four years ago to 17.2 in 2010, and this translates into about $800 million in cash flow.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 9.5 million shares of common stock for $425 million, bringing the
year-to-date repurchases to 23.7 million shares for about $1.2 billion.
After the close, we executed a number of capital deployment actions, taking advantage of the favorable market
environment. First, the company issued three tranches of long-term debt for $2 billion, 5, 10s and 30s, with a weighted
average coupon of 3.35%. We used approximately $750 million of the net proceeds to fund the redemption of the
existing notes due in 2012 and 2013. The expected close is November 5th. In addition, last week we made a $750
million discretionary cash contribution to our pension plans.
Turning now to page 4, let me provide some more detail on our third-quarter results. Our total company bookings for
the quarter were $6 billion, and on a year-to-date basis, were 18.5 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of about 1.
Missile systems was the highlight from a bookings perspective with $2.2 billion of new awards during the quarter
including 545 million for the production of AMRAAM missiles, 451 million for the competitively awarded Small
Diameter Bomb II and 237 million for SM-3. We also booked significant awards for RAM missiles, the Javelin
program, AIM-9X and EKV in addition to winning the competitively awarded Excalibur Ib program.
IDS booked 190 million for a TPY-2 radar for the Missile Defense Agency. IDS also booked 104 million on the
Zumwalt-class destroyer program and 103 million for the Aegis weapon system for the U.S. Navy. IIS booked $447
million on a number of classified contracts and our NCS business booked 84 million for airborne tactical
communications systems for multiple customers.
SAS booked 265 million on a number of classified contracts. SAS also booked 87 million for the production of AESA
radars, for the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard. TS booked 306 million on domestic training programs and 121
million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities. And we ended the quarter with a
$35.7 billion backlog.
If you'd move to page 5, relative to our prior guidance, our third-quarter sales were impacted by the timing of awards as
well as our cost reduction efforts. Focusing on increasing efficiency and taking cost out of the business is part of
Raytheon's culture. We're clearly focused on stepping up our efforts in this area. Let me put some color on this. The
reduction in cost on our cost-type contracts results in savings on those programs, which we pass along to our
customers, but also results in lower sales for the company.

Now from a margin perspective, the various cost reductions that impact fixed-price programs in our backlog drive
margin improvement, and we saw some of this reflected in our Q3 results. Space and airborne systems sales were up
9% in the quarter. Strength in their classified business and growth on an international tactical radar program were key
contributors. Technical services
sales were up 10%, driven by both domestic and foreign training programs. IDS, IIS and NCS were the businesses most
affected by the timing of contract awards.
Now moving ahead to page 6. We delivered strong operational performance. Continued strong program performance
was reflected in our adjusted operating margin, which was up by 60 basis points. All of our businesses delivered solid
results during the quarter. Missiles, SAS and TS had significant margin expansion primarily driven by operational
improvements.
Turning to page 7. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2010 was $1.36 up 9%, and on a year-to-date basis, was up 12%.
This improvement speaks directly to our continued focus on productivity and cost efficiency actions.
If you now move to page 8, I'd like to comment on our guidance for the year. Our sales outlook reflects both the timing
of awards and the impact of our cost reduction activities. We reduced the high end by 500 million and the low end by
300 million. As we've done in prior years during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our
pension plans. As a result of the update, FAS/CAS pension expense for the year increased by $9 million from $220
million to $229 million.
We updated the range of our interest expense to be between 110 million and 115 million, which now reflects the results
of our recent debt offering. We also lowered the range of our diluted share count to be between 377 million and 379
million. We reduced our effective tax rate to 24.3% driven by the favorable tax settlement in Q3. As a reminder, we're
assuming that the R&D tax credit extension gets passed in 2010. It's worth about $0.07 in earnings per share.
We increased the high end of our adjusted EPS for the year by $0.10 to reflect the increase in our expected margin for
the year, with the adjusted EPS to be between $5.28 and $5.38. You should note that we also increased our 2010
guidance for GAAP EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.55, which includes the $0.75 reduction, the full year EPS from the
U.K. Border Agency program termination in the second quarter, the tax-related benefit of $0.45 recorded in the third
quarter, the estimated $0.13 charge we'll book in the fourth quarter associated with the make-whole provision of the
early debt retirement and the $0.39 in full year FAS/CAS pension expense.
Our current operating cash flow outlook for the full year of 1.4 to 1.6 billion now includes the $750 million
discretionary cash contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter. And finally, we increased the low
end and narrowed the range of our outlook for ROIC to between 12.3 and 12.6%. Overall, our updated outlook for 2010
reflects our ability to drive earnings growth through operational improvement and capital deployment actions.
Moving on to page 9, let me give you a little more detail. The two principal drivers for the updated sales and margin
guidance are consistent with what I've already said. Compared to our prior guidance, the lower sales at IDS and NCS
are the result of the timing of awards as well as cost reductions, which, again, are a key driver in the increase in
margins. At MS, SAS and TS, we also see an improved margin outlook.
Overall, we're pleased with the results of the operational improvement and the margin we've delivered, while at the
same time passing along savings to our customers. Now we plan to provide you with the details for our 2011 outlook
on our fourth quarter conference call in January. By that time, we'll have more clarity on the FY '11 budget, the
continuing resolution and the timing of some of our U.S. and international awards. Now with that said, we do want
provide you with some sense of what we're seeing at this point in time.
If we had to peg next year today, we're looking at a sales range of 2 to 4% over 2010 and for margins on an adjusted
basis, we expect to be in line with this year. And from a cash perspective, we fully expect to continue to deliver strong
cash flow as we have in the past. We've also provided an update on how we see FAS/CAS pension expense trending for
2011.

So if you would please turn to page 10, we've provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2011. The shaded
area on the matrix reflects our range of estimates for the current environment. We are currently at, on a year-to-date
asset return basis, of slightly over 7% consistent with our return-on-asset assumption of 8.75%. Just to be clear, the
discount rate and the actual asset return won't be known until we close out 2010.
As a reminder, the FAS/CAS adjustment is non-cash and non-operational. It simply reflects the temporary difference
between FAS and CAS pension accounting. The key point is that pension cost is recoverable over time through our
rates.
Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize our third-quarter performance and our outlook. Continued
improvement in operational performance during the quarter drove margin expansion, strong growth in earnings per
share and good cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to address the opportunities and also the
challenges in our industry. We have the right strategy, the right capabilities and the discipline to capital deployment
plans that drive growth and attractive total shareholder returns.
With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Over to you, Marc.

<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Hi, Rob.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Bill, I guess we don't have a lot of baseball to talk about this time. We live in a the wrong
part of the country.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's right. You got that right. But if you
grew up in California, you do have to root for the Giants, I guess.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: I'm not even going to touch that.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: On the 2011 guidance, Dave, thanks for the color. Could you talk about that within the
context of each of the businesses? Where are the growers there? Where is the pressure going to be, both on a sales and
margin basis?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: You know, Rob, it's a fair question.
It's a little bit early. We're still going through the planning process, and we think it was appropriate to give you some
sense of where we were at this point. But to go through each of the businesses at this stage is just, a term my boss uses,
it gets out over our tips a little bit.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: All right, well, then is there any area that is particularly within the range of what Secretary
Gates is trying to focus on here with his austerity measures? Do you have any of these advisory services that he seems
focused in the O&M accounts?

<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, it's one of the things, you all know my
feelings on Fed IT and consulting and those kinds of areas. It's not something Raytheon has gone into. So we look at it,
and that's not a concern on our part. Rather than call them austerity, to me, I look at them as efficiency initiatives really
designed to help protect or increase the DOD modernization and fore- structure accounts, which is good news for the
DOD and the industry. The real key here for all of us is going to be the implementation and then the consistency of
approach. But to answer your question specifically, that's not in our worry bead bucket.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay, and then just, Dave, just on space and TS, really outstanding margins there. You
mentioned it. Could you go into a little more detail?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Sure. SAS's performance was strong,
as you just noted. It was driven by a combination of things, primarily program performance. And they are the one
segment that was also favorably impacted by mix, in particular some international sales. It's probably notable that the
balance of the businesses, from a margin perspective, was primarily driven by program performance.
Technical services, again, they've been performing strong for quite a while now. That continues. It's essentially their
focus on overall efficiency within the group. There was also some relatively small, but it was worth, probably, 20, 30
basis points, some contract modifications that took place during the quarter. But let me reiterate that overall cost
efficiency is what's driving their margins.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: I just want to follow up on the margin question, which is if I just look at what your annual
guidance is, there's only one quarter to go, and I look at missile systems, NCS and SAS, how did the year come down
40, 60 basis points from where you stand at nine months? Is there something that's going on in those three segments
that would put a lot of margin pressure in the fourth quarter?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: No, Sam. Let me just frame this.
We've had a very focused effort on productivity and cost improvements. We talked a little bit about that a few minutes
ago. We saw some of the benefits in Q3. On a year-to-date basis, I hadn't mentioned this earlier, our adjusted operating
margins were up 50 basis points. So the timing of how that margin improvement impacts the year is by and large
behind us, it happened in the first three quarters simply because of when the programs went into play.
Now if you go into the fourth quarter, there's a couple of things happening. At some level in some of the businesses
mix does work against us a little bit overall. And secondly, we're starting to think, obviously, about next year and
starting to put in place programs that will be more beneficial to next year than it will be in the fourth quarter. Keep in
mind, though, that we did improve our overall outlook for margins to 12.1 to 12.3%, and that's pretty healthy. So there's
nothing, I guess the takeaway is there's nothing remarkable happening in the fourth quarter. A lot of it is just timing.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Okay. And then if I can just have one follow-up is the sales reduction, I guess, for the year,
three to $500 million. Can you, I guess, talk about how I should think about how much of that might be program delays
versus the cost-plus business where you've lowered the cost?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Yeah. Let me just kind of cut to the
chase on this one. If you're looking at, say, the $300 million that we took the lower end down by, about 2/3rds of it
relates to program delays and about a 1/3rd of it relates to cost improvement activity.

Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Access 342.
<Q - George Shapiro>: I guess, Bill, you mentioned that the international grew 11% in the quarter. So by my quick
arithmetic, it implies that the balance of the business or the domestic business declined somewhere 2 to 3%. Can you
just explain where those declines are occurring because it's seems like the industry's not yet in the mode of declining
revenues?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. That would be, from my standpoint, it'd
be hard to pick any one particular business. But we really see it in program delays, when we put our planning into
place. It's hard to figure out all the timing in this environment, as I said in my opening remarks. But if I had to place
one place there, I'd probably put in IDS, and I'd relate that more to the naval area where it's taken a little bit longer to
get things done. Plus, we went through a Nunn-McCurdy breach on Zumwalt which delayed things because when they
reduce seven down to three ships, nothing we had done, it changed the whole cost profile. So it's taken us a little while
longer to get through that process, in my opinion.
<Q - George Shapiro>: And then just a follow-up on that, the program delays, now is this just a function of the
changing policy with the Carter initiatives and all? Or is this something that we're just in an environment, we're going
to hear every quarter, we got program delays?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I don't think, at least I hope we don't hear
it every quarter, George. I think part of it is when you put in some new initiatives and you're trying to have everybody
do their capability-based studies and go through it, it adds a delay in the process. And as I said earlier, the real question
here is what's the implementation going to be like and then the consistency of approach. And sometimes people wait to
see that before they go do things.
From my standpoint, I think everyone in the industry, as we sit with DOD, we're trying to work through it. But let me
just say that's one aspect of it. I think the onus is on us, and we're taking a look at everything we can do in this company
to speed up our processes. I don't accept that things take longer. And if there's anything we can do on our side of the
equation, then it's incumbent on us to go do that and that's what we're doing here. But I don't think this is a long-term
area that's going to hit us for a long time. At least that's not my view.
<Q - George Shapiro>: Okay.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: George, let me just add one thing
because, like always, you're correct in your analytics there. If we look at the fourth quarter, we are expecting growth,
both on the domestic and the foreign side. Domestic should be somewhere between, say, 4 and 6% over last year's
fourth quarter and double-digit growth, again, from an international standpoint. And then taking it one more step, I
think this is important, from a book-to-bill standpoint we expect to exceed one, both domestically and internationally as
we close out the year.
<Q - George Shapiro>: That's helpful. Thanks, Dave.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Okay.

<Q - Troy Lahr>: Yeah. Thanks. Given the cost savings initiatives that you guys are implementing, and I would
assume more favorable international mix next year towards higher margins, I guess why are margins just in line? And
when you say in line, are you talking about including the FAS/CAS headwinds that you might be facing next year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: No, I was talking operating or
adjusted margins, number one. Margins are improved substantially this year as we close out 2010 relative to what we
had expected when we started out 2010. Now what's important is that the cost reduction programs are basically serving
two purposes, and I talked about that a little bit a moment ago, so let me repeat it. It's important. One is we pass along a
lot of these savings to our customers, that's number one. Number two is you are right. The cost reductions will add to
margins over time because they directly impact our fixed-price backlog programs. But as you know, if you move
forward and put new contracts in place, we also pass those savings along to our customers. With all that said, it's early;
12.1 to 12.3 is a healthy starting point. And we're, at this stage, comfortable with that range of guidance.
<Q - Troy Lahr>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research Group.
<Q - Richard Safran>: Hi, good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard Safran>: I've been noticing on the DSCA website, a number of proposed sales of Raytheon products,
some nearly a billion. You've been noting international sales is 24%, growing double digit in 4Q. Am I right, one, is
that that seems a better than that you expected initially? And I wanted to know, I know you're not providing specific
2011 guidance, but could you comment directionally on foreign sales as a percent in 2011?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, let's put it in perspective right now,
where we're at. Sales were about 24% of Q3. We've had double-digit growth there. We expect our international
bookings this year to be in the 24 to 26%. We expect sales to be in the 22 to 24% range. So it kind of gives you a feel
of where that's going from our standpoint.
We see a little bit of the same as we keep going here in the next year. Clearly for us, we've got some international
awards and the timing of those scheduled here in the fourth quarter. Some of those may go into January. It's really hard
to peg them right now. But we're pushing hard to go do that. So from my standpoint, internationally, 2011 feels a lot
like 2010. And we intend to keep pushing the international because it's one of our strong suits in our company, if that
helps.
<Q - Richard Safran>: It helps. Thanks very much.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you and a terrific performance, guys. Very nicely done.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Part of my question's been answered, but if you give us a little more detail where
international orders were in the third quarter, and if I just do the quick math, if you're going to do at least 6.3, 6.4
billion for the year, it looks like you have a strong foreign book-to-bill in the final quarter. And if U.S. is also over one,
is your full year order bogey still 26.5, or has it moved up?

<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, no, Cai, we kept the bogey the same.
The hard part, you're younger than I am, but we've both been around a long time. We know that the international is
tough to peg, and for us, we've got Saudi Config-3 out there. We're in the final stages of Ts and Cs (terms and
conditions) there. Turkey Patriot, we'll have an announcement at the end of the year there of which way Turkey is
going. For us, next year we've also got Taiwan and Kuwait in there. They haven't started their LOA process yet, but we
expect those. We also expect the TPY-2 radar to start having the international sales mid next year. You know, those are
a couple of hundred million dollar radar packages when you put all the support and services, everything together. We
also have an Australia program we've won down there. Because of the recent elections, that's delayed the process. We
expect the country to still buy.
So that the order pipeline is there. We can see them all. We can touch them. Our job is to nudge them over the goal line
or kick them over the goal line, one or the other, if that helps.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: That's very helpful. Could you maybe comment a little bit more on there's this proposed F-15
sale to the Saudis, which has a fair amount of your gear, as you know...
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. It's a good question, Cai, and I should
have mentioned it and thanks for bringing it up. That notification is a large number. It contains everything for
everybody plus government costs in there, so that's why it's a big number. For us, we probably expect 3 billion-plus in
that particular release. Plus, we've got others in the notification cycle and some getting ready to go into the notification
cycle. And for somebody like me, you can see them. You want to go grab them and pull them, and that's what we're
trying to do.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Dave, I'd like to go back to the margin issue and what you're guiding for Q4. You said that
mix is going to be negative against you in Q4, and that's why your guidance implies the margin comes down. Going
forward, though, can we expect the margins to be a little bit more stable, or is this sort of volatility quarter to quarter
something we should expect?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Well, we've had some nice
improvement in the first nine months of the year. This year, as I mentioned, we have stepped up the cost reduction
programs and those, depending on timing of implementation, will move the margins at a particular point in time. Going
forward, I would suggest that it's likely a little more level-loaded quarter to quarter as you're comparing to prior year's
same quarter. But again, Bill mentioned during his commentary earlier, I did as well. There was just a lot of activity.
We'll continue that moving forward, but I think today I would say we're in a good pace and cadence relative to
productivity programs and expect, sort of, continued improvement over the long term.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: And just as a follow-up on the cost front, has there been any one-off, like, redundancy costs or
site closure costs that have occurred in this quarter that won't be there going forward?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: I'm glad you asked that. The answer
is there's nothing, there's no significant or unique event that moved the margins, from an overall company perspective,
this quarter. It's a just a multitude of different cost reduction activities that we have been working on and will continue

<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And I would add, Dave, that when you look at
the cost reductions, they're across the board. They're not only in direct and indirect. They're not only in support and
touch, they're also in material, they're in scrap, they're in rework. All our businesses are attacking everything they can
do because now's the time to have your cost structure in the best possible shape you can have. That's what our

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JP Morgan Securities.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: Good morning, guys.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: Back on the margin topic, just maybe only ask this in a slightly different way because there
really is, what you've been doing year to date and your outlook for the fourth quarter and what you're saying for next
year, the numbers do move around quite a bit. If you take the 12.9% you did in the quarter and you take out all cume
adjustments, some of which were performance and a good performance, some of which were related to your cost
takeout actions that you've been taking. What was that 12.9? Does it look more like 12.5 or a lower 12?
And then, Dave, can you quantify, you talk about some of the cost savings actions that in Q4 that might be a little bit
more material than what you've incurred year to date which haven't really been material and that's one of the reasons
that you're looking for, by my math, that 10.7% adjusted margin. Can you quantify maybe how much the Q4 number is
below the ongoing run rate? Thanks.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Okay. Yes. It might be easier to give
you a little bit of detail around this because I think that might be what you're getting at. So if you look at our IDS, okay,
we've increased guidance 20 basis points to reflect improved performance and cost reductions. Again, nothing unique.
It's a lot of the programs we've been talking about. Bill just went through that.
From an IIS perspective, they've been impacted primarily by the period costs that will incur as a result of the
termination, and that's worth about 20 basis points. Q3 and year to date, from a missile standpoint, higher than
guidance, driven by, again, the timing of the productivity improvements. We're increasing the year by 20 basis points.
Again, no particular issue, no particular area. It's just the overall cost reductions.
NCS, again, SAS continues to perform well. There's nothing unique there. I talked about SAS earlier having a little bit
of favorable impact as a result of mix. TS, I mentioned the favorable contract modification earlier being worth about 20
basis points.
So I think if you're standing back, you're looking for something unique to say, well, there was one event that impacted
margins 30 or 40 basis points on the quarter, and it's more normalized at 12.5,
I think that's, frankly, the wrong way to look at it. I'll go back to what I said before. It's simply the timing of when we
put into our EACs, the impact of these cost reduction actions. Once they're firm and in place, we're able to take that
benefit. And it was notable in Q3, again, throughout the year, and it's just the timing between where we are now and
where we'll be as we exit the year.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: In the 10.7 relative to the run rate, how much do you have in there for actual non-recurring
costs?

<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: For actual non-recurring costs.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: In Q4, yeah, you mentioned that...
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Yeah.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: ... you mentioned in your comments that you're preparing for next year. So what's the number in
there?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Well, again, we really don't look at it
like that. There's nothing, again, these are just programs that we're putting in place. We have 15,000 different contracts.
So there's not one area to spike out to say there's a big non-recurring event in Q4.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, let me kind of help with the mix. The
way I think about it, we have about 23 contracts that make up 25% of our business. The next 25% of our business is
represented by 96 contracts. The remaining 50% is driven by 15,000 contracts. So when you look at it, there's a lot
there. And so the way we run this place is we drive for efficiency. We drive for productivity and we pass those savings
on. We set the baseline lower next time in the cost structure and we challenge ourselves to keep driving the margins up.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: And let me just close out the
question based on what Bill just said. Joe, your math is right as well. It's like one of your colleagues earlier. With that
said, we are continuing to push on margin improvement programs that could impact the fourth quarter. You know, I
want to make sure everybody's on the same page. This is what we're seeing today. We have outperformed our own
expectations year to date. We're continuing to look at various areas of opportunity and, again, closing out the year at
12.1% to 12.3% is pretty healthy.
<Q - Joseph Nadol>: Okay. Bill, maybe just a non-numbers one for you, just on the e-Border situation from last
quarter. Three months have gone by now. Any update, any debriefing you've gotten out of the U.K. or any additional
thoughts on what happened and what might happen?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: First, let me say the system we delivered is
operational. They're using it, and it's providing actionable data. So it's not a performance issue on my part, the way I
look at it. We are in litigation, and we've started that process. And I still feel as strong, if not stronger, on Raytheon's
position, if that helps.

<Q - Doug Harned>: On the export control reform initiatives, could you give us a sense of how material the impact
may be if it goes through, once it goes through Congress? Are we seeing something that would significantly change the
way in which you pursue international contracts?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'll break it up into two categories. The
categories that we've determined that there are other sources and that we've tried to protect something that we shouldn't
protect. That will expedite the process considerably. I would almost say, if I had to guess, I could cut it in half. On the
stuff that is critical, that we want to protect, I think the process will get better, but it will not decrease in half. If I had to
say it, it might be a 10%, 15% improvement.

But when we think about all of this, this is from a standpoint of DOD or state, and I believe that commerce will now get
involved in a number of the license activities, and that'll be more on a commercial basis and that'll be for things that
DOD does not want to protect as much. And so overall, the stuff that we sell around the world that isn't in the missile
business or air defense, I expect those will all move a lot quicker.
<Q - Doug Harned>: But if you were to look forward and think about how that might impact your revenues on
international, are we looking at something that would materially change that above the level of bookings you have
now?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I don't think I would say materially change
it. I just, for us, it's going to allow us to focus even more on the ones we need to, and the others will be on a routine
kind of process. It's mainly how quick can we get them in here. So it's a timing issue. It's not, from our standpoint, you
see how much we get released. We sell in 80 countries around the world, so we can do business internationally. This is
all about can we do it quicker and bring the orders in. And that's what everybody's trying to do because there's a lot of
calories spent on this area.
<Q - Doug Harned>: And if I could, Bill, I've known you a long time, and you've never been a big fan of debt. So the
decision to issue two billion in debt to make contribution to the pension. This all, I think, makes great sense. But is
there a change in your philosophy and how you look at debt and in the capital structure of the company going forward?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I guess the way I look at it, when you can get
debt at five years at 1 and 5/8, even somebody that doesn't like debt has to look at it and sit there and say, can you make
your balance sheet and your operations more efficient? And even an engineer like me can understand that one.

Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
<Q - David Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Hey, David.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - David Strauss>: It sounded like you, Bill, to a prior question, you were talking about international growing
double digits again next year which, in the context of 2 to 4% total growth for the company for next year would seem to
imply domestic flat to down. Is that right? And if so, can you give a little bit of color around that?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Dave and I were trying to peg it. We've
noticed not everybody's looking out and giving some guidance here, and we wanted to give you kind of a feel. And
what really determines that, and I hate to say it, is the timing. And when the timing moves to the right, you don't pick
up everything you've lost, and that's the hard part here. And so when we look at the timing on the international, we
want the things that we've got in our forecast to happen, and as Dave pointed out in his remarks, it's where we stand
today. We need to see what's going to happen on the fiscal year '11 budget, the continuing resolution. My gut feel says
that we're going to operate on that into next year. And so those things have a real effect on your domestic growth. And
then right on top of that, we're going to be looking at fiscal year '12. So we've tried to give you a peg of where we think
it is and the timing that we see on things. But this point in time, the end of October, there's a lot of in flux, more so than
I can remember in the past. But we still felt confident giving you the numbers we did.
<Q - David Strauss>: Okay, great. Dave, unfortunately a couple of questions on pension. Just want to be clear that the
sensitivities table you gave includes the 750 million contribution. And then, what is your total contribution you're
expecting for this year and then any color? You had talked about '12 and '13 coming down a fair amount off of '11. '11's
now obviously changed a bit. But any kind of thoughts on '12 and '13?

<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Yes, okay. So this year, the gross
contribution will be about $1.9 billion, on a net basis about 1.2 billion. As we were looking ahead, if you assume,
which is not an unreasonable assumption, that we maintain the long-term asset return assumption at 8.75%, discount
rate environment stays, let's just peg a number at 5.25%, next year we'd be looking at a gross funding of about $1
billion, and on a net basis, about 300 million.
And as we go forward, if you're interested in the FAS/CAS accounting difference, we expect '11, again under those
same assumptions, to be between 450 million and 500 million for '11. '12 would be, say, between 200 and 250 million.
Now importantly, and I'm glad you asked this, see, if the interest rate environment were to adjust and the discount rate,
say, moved to 6.25%, the FAS/CAS differences would improve, from a P&L standpoint, by about $200 million,
favorable.
<Q - David Strauss>: That's in '12 or '11?

<Q - Peter Arment>: Yeah, good morning, Bill and Dave.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Good morning, Peter.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Can you, Bill, maybe can you just, it's hard to talk about. Can you talk about some of the
classified perspective from a growth perspective, what you're seeing domestically and international? I mean, you've
indicated classifieds you have double digits, I think, year over year this year. I mean, are you seeing or hearing any
changes in those budgets? I'm just thinking from a growth perspective because it's not something that we have much
insight into.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, let me give you some color here. Sales
were about 14% of the total this quarter. If we're looking towards the year, we expect bookings this year to be around
14%, and we expect sales for the year to be up about 14%. So we see double-digit growth in that area this year.
We see, looking into next year from what we can see right now, classified continuing to grow, which is strength for the
company. We've had a number of tech wins in that area that we think we're going to continue to do well. Our
technology growth has almost been SeaRad and so forth, almost at double digit. It's high single digit in a budget that's
probably around 2%. So we've really been taking market share in the technology, and that's why we have so many
programs that are under $10 million. But they're the seed corn and they lead to some of our larger programs that we
have today, if that helps.
<Q - Peter Arment>: That does help. Thank you. And what are you seeing and just regarding, it's kind of related to
this, though, on the M&A front? We're seeing a lot of properties in this area in classified that are going at big multiples.
Are you seeing, do you still see like there's opportunities for you to add in capabilities? I'm thinking of the great BBN
acquisition which gave you Boomerang, which sounds like the penetration there, for those systems continue to go much
higher. So can you just talk a little bit about that?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. We're continuing to look. Our M&A
strategy hasn't changed. If I could find one, two or three more BBNs, I'd do those in a heartbeat. There's not those

falling off a tree every day. For us, we've closed one deal this month, the second one'll close. We have Technology
Associates. They're a leading provider of data extraction and analysis and exploitation. I'll say that much and stop there.
The other one is a Trusted Computer Systems (sic) [Solutions] . We expect to close that next month. They really
provide cyber security solutions to our customers. Clearly, what they do is provide domain solutions that allow
classified levels to be shared on the same network or on computer operating systems, and it gives me an opportunity to
highlight one of our teams. The Distributed Common Ground System, DCGS, you've heard me talk about it in the past,
but we just completed with the Air Force the successful evaluation of DCGS at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany.
What DCGS does, it supports multiple ISR platforms, satellites, manned, unmanned systems. To me, I refer to it in the
company and outside the company, it's like Google with a clearance. No offense to Google, but DCGS allows you to
move data around. And what's important to it for us is as we look to the future, worldwide intelligence is going to even
take on a bigger role, if you think about it. And how do you look at that information across the globe and sort it out and
share, at multiple classified areas, and that's what we're lining ourselves up to be able to do.

Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Myles.
<Q - Myles Walton>: I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the missile defense portfolio in a couple of ways. One is
on MEADS and the potential there for termination. Under that scenario, what is the incremental opportunity for your
portfolio? And then second, in related business, with respect to the MDA's decision on SM-3 Block 2B to openly
compete that? Can you talk about how we should think about that, specifically in your program, and if you're seeing
that in other areas that might put, at a minimum, margin pressure?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think, from our standpoint, on
MEADS, that's something for the government to sort out. They'll be going through that. It's a big program, lots of
money, and in this tight budget. The way I look at it MEADS satisfies three customers. Patriot satisfies, at minimum,
12 around the world, and people will decide what they want to do in that process. I'm highly biased, so you know my
answer. But I think, from our standpoint, Patriot is the most capable air defense system in the world for both air
breathers, ballistic missiles, aircraft and cruise, and there's nothing else like it. And put Patriot up against anything in
the world, for that matter. So we expect Patriot to be around a long time. And so from that standpoint, there could be an
upside depending on what the decision is there. But I'll let people that have to make that choice make it.
Regarding Standard Missile, we have a family of Standard Missile. We have Ia, Ib, IIa, IIbs. The IIa was just increased
in funding about 25%. It's the one that's got a very successful flight test program. And for us, we're a company that
competes every place we go. So competition really doesn't frighten us. People didn't think we were going to win the
small diameter bomb, but lo and behold, the company did that. Our customers told us we significantly provide them
better mission capability making our technical approach.
We won the strength of our tri-mode seeker, our innovative warhead technology, in our aircrafts integration and our
past performance was rated exceptional. So from my standpoint, competition doesn't bother me. We're prepared to go
head to head with anybody, especially in the missile business. So I realize what MDA has to do, but when we start
talking about something in 2020 and 2025, that's a long ways out, and a lot of things can happen between now and then.
<Q - Myles Walton>: From a standpoint of, your performance is not an issue, so, I mean, it seems like this is their way
of inserting competition into an area where the incumbent is performing well and so the upside is cost savings. So I'm
curious if you're seeing this in other areas of your portfolio and if you think that's a change from the past?

<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I just go back. People that know me, I've
been doing this a long time. We competed on AMRAAM. We competed on Maverick. We competed on missile
systems and, per Raytheon's history, and every time we've done that we found a way to get the cost down. We found a
way to get the reliability up. We found a way to get the performance even better. And doing all of that, we still
delivered consistently high margins. And I don't expect that to change.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Marc Kaplan, Investor Relations>: John, we have time for one more question please.
Operator
Okay. The final question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: I apologize if I'm harping on this, but I guess I'm just confused with the lack of official '11
guidance. You guys have provided the initial look with the third-quarter report for several years in a row, and you're
talking about a continuing resolution. But many of those years in the past, you had a continuing resolution. Is it just, are
things just very, very dynamic and less visible in this industry right now? It would seem like with industry calling for
slow steady growth, that it would maybe not be as challenging to predict that?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think that – do you know what's going
to happen here in the elections on the 2nd? I won't put you on the spot, but I mean there's a confluence of things going
on. So part of it is that...
<Q - Noah Poponak>: But things like that, we've gone through in the past, I guess.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, no, no, no. Not like this where we've got
23 new initiatives. We've got an economy, not only domestically but internationally, that's equivalent to one of the
biggest recessions in history. I don't think I've gone through one of these in my last 39 years like this. And so my point
is: this is different. And I think we're somewhat unique in the guidance we've given you at this point. If I read what
others have done, there's not a lot out there.
Q – Noah Poponak>: Right.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So we try to do is as much as we can, knowing
what's there. But Congress is going to change, and when it changes, it delays things and so that's the whole issue. It's
the timing really. It's not the "if." That's not my concern. My concern is can I predict what's going to happen here? And
we've got some unknowns. And I'm not concerned about that because I think the company will continue to do well.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay. If I could just maybe sneak in one follow-up as well. Technical services continues to
really grow rapidly and show very good margin. Similar lines of business that other companies are struggling there
with revenue and margin pressure. How are you differentiating there? Is it the Warfighter FOCUS program? Maybe
just an update on that segment.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think the way I would describe it is we
found a way to do the training aspect or education aspect of the job, I think, better than others. Our commercial
experience here, doing it for GM, Chrysler, Opel and others have helped us take and cut down the amount of time that's
spent in that area. If we give you an example, we call it compression. If you can cut down your training costs by
anywhere from 20% to 30% and up the retention factor at the same time, that's what our customers are looking for and
that's something we can offer. We have proven results in that area, and this is, in the O&M side, where customers really
want innovation. We think we have it, and we also see other areas where we can expand it, not necessarily in the DOD
