Good morning. My name is Steve and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the UPS Investor Relations third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute
to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. Please
note we will take one question from each participant to accommodate more analysis during the call. Thank you for your
cooperation. It is now our pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Vice
President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.

Good morning, everyone. Before I get started I want to point out that during the call today we will make references to
our recent Investor Conference. For those of you who are unable to attend, all information presented is available on our
website. I encourage you to watch it . Based on feedback from those that have, I think you'll find it worthwhile.
Now regarding our earn earnings. I'm here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO and Kurt Kuehn our CFO to discuss
the company's results for the quarter, and our expectations going forward. Before they begin, however, I want to review
the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our
expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to
risks and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2010 Form 10-K and 2011 10-Q reports. These reports are
available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is
being webcast and will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website.
I want to remind you of an adjustment we recorded in the third quarter of last year. The adjustment was related to the
sale of real estate and increased net income by $61 million, or $0.06 per share. As a result, in their remarks today Scott
and Kurt will refer to UPS's third quarter 2010 results excluding the impact of this gain. Additionally, all 2011 full year
references and comparisons to 2010 will refer to adjusted results, we believe this is a more accurate picture of the
company's performance. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP
financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules are also
available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the financial section.
Finally in an effort to allow maximum participation on the call, each participant will be allowed one question. And then
be required to get back in the queue for any follow-up. I hope you understand, and thank you for your cooperation.
Now to begin our review I'll turn the program over to Scott.
D. Scott Davis
Thanks, Andy, and good morning everyone. It was great seeing you at our conference in Louisville. I hope you came
away with a better understanding of our many capabilities and the investments we're making for the future.
UPS delivered another good quarter of earnings growth, highlighting the balance of our global business model and its
ability to perform in the face of challenging economic conditions. Results like these reflect the value that UPS solutions
are providing customers. There is increasing uncertainty in the global economic environment. Most notably exports
from Asia which slowed significantly during the quarter. On the other hand, it appear the U.S. economy has stabilized
and continues to show modest growth. Despite all the concerns of the European economy, our business there continues
to perform well, with exports up 9%. The outlook for the remainder of the year is for continued slow growth.
Because we have seen less buildup of inventories heading into peak season, UPS could benefit if consumers respond
with stronger than expected holiday purchases, just like they did in 2009. We really won't know this until two weeks
prior to Christmas as peak has become more compressed.
Taking a step in the right direction, I want to congratulate congress and the administration for approving the critical
trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. Export growth to these countries will provide economic
growth and create jobs here at home. I'm encouraged to finally see some bipartisan cooperation, and hopeful that our
leadership in Washington can continue to work together to stimulate our economy, like a jobs bill that delivers real
results and tax reform that encourages business investment. Here at UPS we are not standing by waiting for the
government or the economy to lead us. As we demonstrated during our conference, we continue to innovate and invest
in the technology and solutions that our customers value.
Recently we rolled out several innovative ground-break products; the most notable being UPS My Choice, which
provides consumers with unparalleled delivery options. This service puts controls in the hand of the residential
customer. As a secondary benefit, it helps UPS lower costs by eliminating multiple delivery attempts. Since the recent
launch of this product we have over 100,000 subscribers, and that number continues to increase rapidly.

To support our continued growth in Europe, we announced a significant expansion of the Cologne air hub. This $200
million project will include state-of-the-art UPS technology and boost capacity by more than 70%. Capital investments
like this allow us to grow our network efficiently and achieve the return on investment and capital goals unveiled at our
conference.
As we outlined there, UPS's solution based approach spans the entire supply chain. These global capabilities are
unmatched, and customers recognize the value UPS provides. The connectivity across business units and the reach or
of our network continues to drive results. Though economists expect global economic growth for 2012 to remain below
historic trends, I am confident in our ability to perform, rewarding share owners during both the current period of
uncertainty and over the long term. With that said, let me turn it over to Kurt.
Kurt P. Kuehn
Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. On last quarter's call some thought that UPS was a little ahead of the curve
with our economic outlook. However, during the past few months we did witness the effects of economic slowing and
continue to see the near-term outlook pointing to slow but steady growth.
Now let's discuss UPS's third quarter results. With the exception of the International segment, UPS performance during
the quarter held up well. Especially considering the economic conditions and increased uncertainty. UPS experienced
strong revenue growth of 8%, and once again earnings per share improved at a double digit rate, up 14%.
Now let's take a look at the segment performance starting with U.S. Domestic. Operating margin is the highest we've
experienced in three years improving 60 basis points to 13.1%. Clearly this segment is on the right track. Revenue
increased almost 7% on flat daily package growth. Our focus on quality of revenue is paying off as yields were once
again strong, up 6.5%. Base price increases of about 3% and higher fuel surcharges were the key factors.
UPS Next Day Air volume gains were encouraging, up more than 1% with strong growth from packages offsetting the
decline in letters. Operating leverage was apparent as improvements in productivity and investments in UPS technology
helped produce operating profit growth of more than 11%. In fact we once again experienced reductions in direct labor
hours, miles driven and block hours. During the quarter we took another step in extending our early morning delivery
advantages when we announced the expanded coverage of UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. We have added or improved
coverage on 1,300 ZIP codes which solidifies our market-leading position.
Now for the International segment, which is both about slowing economic activity and challenging comparisons to
strong results last year. If you recall in Q3 '10 we experienced 47% volume growth in the Asia to U.S. lane. This year
in the third quarter UPS International operating profit declined slightly due to excess capacity, higher fuel prices, and a
slight drag from currency fluctuations. Remember, during the our second quarter earnings call we mentioned that due
to macro conditions exports from Asia were starting to exhibit softness. This eventually turned into volume declines on
the Asia to U.S. lane. UPS acted swiftly to take down aircraft and pull capacity out of the market, but not quickly
enough. And margins were negatively impacted. Bottom line is, we built a network expecting a certain level of growth
that did not materialize. Because of this we have now reduced our air lift capacity out of Asia while still maintaining
our recently added service enhancements. If demand continues to soften, we can make additional adjustments. On the
other hand, UPS is capable of adding back capacity if the surge in consumer demand occurs before peak, like it did in
2009.
Despite this slowdown UPS's International revenue jumped more than 14%, driven by solid volume growth in other
theaters. Export volume was strong, up 6.5%. UPS continues to lead the industry in international export growth.
However, during the quarter this growth occurred in the shorter trade lanes. Such as within Europe or within Asia, as
well as across North America. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 3.5%, with strong growth in Germany, France and
Poland. Package yields were up more than 9% as a result of currency, higher fuel surcharges, and base rate increases.
These were offset somewhat by changes in product mix as the growth in our trans-border products outpaced Worldwide
Express. On a currency neutral basis, yields grew 3.2%. To support our international growth, we announced the
expansion of UPS World Ship to 25 additional origin countries, bringing the total number to 63.

Now let's discuss the Supply Chain & Freight segment. As a perfect example of leveraging our technology across the
entire portfolio we have extended the UPS paperless invoice to include Air Freight shipments. Now our customers can
enjoy the most comprehensive digital customs clearance option offered in the industry.
Revenue for the segment was $2.3 billion, up more than 5% compared to last year. Operating profits were $195 million
with margin expanding to 8.3%. UPS Freight led the way with margin expansion and solid revenue improvement to
15%. LTL revenue per hundred weight was up over 13% resulting from higher fuel surcharges and stronger base rates.
Revenue in the Forwarding Business unit was muted due to excess capacity in the Air Freight industry and the slowing
demand from Asia. However, margin expanded and operating profit grew slightly. As expected, the distribution
business experienced a mid single digit increase in revenue while margin expansion was impacted by investments in
the healthcare sector. During the quarter we continued to expand our global healthcare distribution presence with the
addition of facilities in Brazil, and the Netherlands. These new buildings bring the total UPS healthcare compliance
space to more than 4.5 million square feet.
Regarding taxes. We have lowered our expected tax rate for 2011 to 34%, based on the geographic mix of taxable
income and other items. This impacted the third quarter and will impact the fourth as well.
Now let's talk about cash flow. For the first nine months of 2011, UPS generated free cash flow of more than $3.7
billion after capital expenditures of $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion in pension contributions. Distributions to share owners
accelerated during the quarter, as UPS significantly increased share repurchase activity. Given the weak market
conditions, we jumped at the opportunity and increased share buybacks to more than 1.1 billion shares in the quarter.
So far this year UPS has repurchased 32 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion, and paid dividends of $1.5
billion, an 11% increase in dividends per share.
Regarding our guidance for the remainder of 2011. As I indicated at the Investor Conference, we are reiterating our
earnings per share guidance of $4.15 to $4.40 per share. As we think about peak season it seems a lot like last year,
where customer sentiment is mixed and cautiously optimistic. In general inventory levels are tight and consumer
demand for the holidays remains to be seen. As we have experienced in past, the last two weeks before Christmas can
have a meaningful impact on fourth quarter results.
In our U.S. Domestic business we expect year-over-year margin expansion similar to what we experienced in the third
quarter, as we continue our focus on the quality of revenue and improved efficiency. Daily package volume growth is
expect to be 1% to 2% for the quarter.
International volume and revenue growth is expected to outpace the market once again. Revenues should increase
approximately 10%, driven by strong growth in intraregional shipments. We expect the growth environment out of Asia
to improve a bit.
Operating profit is expected to be slightly above last year's level, with operating margin in the mid-teens.
For the Supply Chain & Freight segment we expect moderate year-over-year revenue growth and continued margin
expansion.
So, to wrap this up, UPS continues to produce quality earnings growth in an environment of moderate economic
activity. We remain confident in our ability to succeed in these conditions, and expect to produce record earnings per
share for 2011. Thanks for listening this morning, and now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.

have. Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Jon Langenfeld of Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jon A. Langenfeld>: Good morning.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Hey Jon.
<Q - Jon A. Langenfeld>: On the domestic side, the international piece, I know you had a pretty tough comp there,
margins came in better than you had talked about. But if I think about that over the next couple of years, and kind of
playing out a relatively subdued growth environment, is there still enough room from the pricing offsetting the cost to
move this higher as we progress over the next couple of years?
<A - Andy Dolny>: Hey Jon, this Andy. Are you talking International Domestic or U.S. domestic?
<Q - Jon A. Langenfeld>: Talking about the domestic – overall domestic on the profit margin side.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yes. We – you know, we feel pretty happy about our continued momentum in the domestic
business. Even in a muted growth environment with the focus on yields and the broad productivity improvements
leveraging many of the thing we talked about at the conference, we're continuing to see margin expansion. Clearly it's a
lot easier in a more robust economy, and time will tell how 2012 looks, but as long as we keep focusing on our
effectiveness and improve the value proposition with things like My Choice we feel pretty bullish about the long term
domestic opportunity.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: I think Jon we'll stay in a rational price environment which will also help us enhance the
margins.
<Q - Jon A. Langenfeld>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Hey, Andy – or Kurt I guess, you talked about the story of decreasing letters going on for
years. I just want to know as you talked about the focus we could see kind of a sharp rebound into the peak season here,
so can you talk about when you talk about Next Day Air, is that kind of where the focus will feel it first? Do you see
Ground kind of feeling some of that in a rebounding economy and kind of on the mix changes within that Next Day
Air, does that impact it ads as well? Thanks.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes Ken, clearly we have been pleased with our progress in the air business with the financial
industry continuing to struggle and the housing industry weak, it does negatively impact the letter business. But we've
seen good growth in our Next Day Package. Both with the A.M. commitments and with the afternoon commitments, so
we do see most of the growth in the package arena as supply chains continue to speed up and that is accentuated in an
improving economic environment.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And Ken, I think the lean inventories that our customers are stocking right now could certainly
lead us to stronger both international and domestic air express business in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.

not be sustainable in to the fourth quarter? And beyond?

<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes, we had guided at the beginning of the year to a range of 34% to 35%. And you know, we
do expect overall that the rate will come in at the low end of that range at 34%. And it's combination of the geographic
mix of our earnings and some minor specific settlements. It really just means that we are coming in at the lower end of
the range and we'll probably see a similar adjustment in Q4 as we had in Q3.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And David, in January we'll talk about the rate for next year as we look at the expected earnings.
Distribution of earnings.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you about the International side and get a sense of
how significant the cost take out and network adjustment is on Trans-Pacific, I guess in terms of how much cost
reduction we can look at in fourth quarter. And then also if you want to comment on pricing within International given
that capacity utilization came down a bit. Thank you.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes, I think Tom, the good news is, is that the pricing has remained stable in the international
environment. It is a rational environment, clearly on the cargo and the freight side, the pricing is a little weaker and that
benefits our forwarding unit. We do expect to see the international demand firm up a little bit in Q4, there's some
product launches that last year were in the third quarter that are now in fourth quarter. On the other hand though we did
take a substantial amount of capacity out. So we've lowered our year-over-year capacity out of Asia by about 10% or
so. And we'll continue to look at that. We did – we have made though over the last year, year and a half, a number of
substantial enhancements with the direct flights to Europe and some of those things. And we do think that investing in
that and continuing to leverage that platform is wise. But we'll adjust and adapt as the economy tweaks it, but right now
we feel like we're in pretty good shape, and barring further declines we should be pretty well calibrated.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Morgan Keegan, please go ahead.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Thank you. Hey, Kurt, given your comments about pricing can you talk a little bit about the
sequential decline in yields? Was that – my assumption was that fuel had been – surcharges have been flat throughout
the quarter. Was that – was I wrong about that, one, and two, was it a mix issue?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: The International did see some impact and that's really that demonstration of the mix. As we
said, we showed continued strong growth. European exports most of which stay on the continent grew upper single
digits. North America trade continued strong. So there's a mix within that International Export that did have an impact.
And if you take out the currency and the fuel certainly that wasn't a somewhat negative impact on yields, but we think
on a same package basis or a same-store basis that yields remain firm, and there are some mix changes. But all in all we
feel very comfortable both domestically and international that the value proposition is such that we're able to sustain
good yields.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yes, domestically the yields between the third quarter and the second quarter were very similar,
there really was no degradation whatsoever.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: The International profitability just feels like it's been an issue now. That that's more than just a
slowdown in demand and your International volumes weren't that terrible. International is a lot of things going on. Is
there some part of the world where profitability is becoming a bigger issue relative to what you saw most of the last
five or six years?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: First of all, the question is Europe, that's not the answer. Europe has stayed very strong. We
have had – we're very pleased with performance and profitability out of Europe. Clearly this was an Asia issue. And as
you know Ed, that we have the most leverage, both positive and negative coming out of Asia. And it's tough to get the
network cut down quick enough. But clearly the issue here was Asia. In the third quarter and the second quarter.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Ed, I guess I will comment that we're just showing a very slight decline in profits, 2%. Just the
impact of fuel and currency would more than account for that. We're not pleased with the third quarter results but we're
taking steps and we feel very confident that the International segment is going to continue to outgrow. And we had a
pretty sudden change in Asia. We telegraphed that in July and talked about it also in September. So it is a challenge but
we still feel very positive on the long term prospects for the International.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Can you talk to the Asia capacity in terms of what you were built for growth and what capacity
you took out and so what you're aligned for growth right now from Asia, and what the volumes actually were in the
quarter?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: It's – you really have to look lane by lane Ed. We did actually go to negative on the U.S. to Asia
lane, and clearly that's a lane that we have substantial capacity. The other lanes remain positive. Actually Asia to
Europe continued to look good, and as I said, we had – we did take out approximately 10% of capacity in the quarter,
and barring continual declines we should be in better shape.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies, please go ahead.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Good morning.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Good morning.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: I was a little distracted early on in the prepared comments, I think you said that core pricing
was up 3% year-over-year, and I was hoping that you could just elaborate on that data point a little bit more? Is that a
mix neutral sort of same sales number, number one. Is that just domestic? How did that compare to the last couple of
quarters, and do you sort of see that number being the base level going forward?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: That was a domestic reference, and it was yes, a weighted average of all the products. The
Ground's probably a little higher than the average and the Air is a little lighter than the average. Clearly that's not a big
change. And in general those trends are pretty darn similar to Q2 if you ex it all out. So – as you know, we continue to
focus on creating as much value as possible and pricing accordingly, and that's gone very well this year.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: And is that a – so does that – is that mix neutral, or does it incorporate the mix? So that if mix
deteriorated modestly to slower modes during the quarter that sort of the same store pricing might have been a little bit
better than that?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: The only place that would be relevant a little bit might be in some of the premium services
where we are seeing a little higher growth in the afternoon services versus the A.M., so yes, you could adjust that out.

And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Thank you. Good morning Scott, Kurt and Andy.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Good morning.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: As you look across the international environment you said you've parked some airplanes to
manage the decline in volumes in the third quarter. Have you seen any improvement in October volumes? And how
much of an uptick do you need to see to bring capacity back online?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: We have seen – I guess it differs by theater a little bit. Asia we are seeing some firming.
Certainly some of that is due to these major product launches that you read about in the paper. Europe remains fairly
stable, although clearly we are probably a little bit cautious on Europe with all the headline risk. And the U.S. perhaps a
little bit softer but not a big change in trends.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I would say just on the economy in general, we're probably a little more optimistic than we were
one and two months ago. We've had a lot of good economic reports in the US. Retail sales looked better last month,
unemployment claims are improving, manufacturing is getting better, bank loans are increasing. So I think we feel a
little bit better. And that's been the problem out of on Asia exports. The demand out of the U.S. has slowed down, and
somewhat in Europe demand has slowed down. So I think if we can get some decision making done in Washington and
Brussels you'll see firmer demand going forward which obviously will help Asian exports.

<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes Bill. We clearly show the FX impact on the revenue side, and there was a fairly significant
impact. On the P&L though, we actually had a slight negative impact for FX. It cost us about $0.01 or so. It's a
combination of some of the collars we put on where the – it capped our coverage, and also some strengthening in Asia
against the dollar. So it's a mixed issue, not a huge trend but it was a headwind.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: The pension, Bill, is going to be obviously determined by the discount rate at December 31, so
we can't calculate that yet. And our returns in our plans have been pretty good this year despite the turmoil in the
market, so it's all going to depend on the discount rate. So we won't know that number until we announce it in January.

We have a question from the line of Rob Byde of HSBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robin F. Byde>: Oh yes, hi there. Good morning, guys. Just on Europe and the Cologne hub. Night flying has
recently been banned at least temporarily at Frankfurt airport. Is this likely to be a concern for your plans at Cologne?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: We feel pretty comfortable with the relationship we have at Cologne, and certainly as we've
discussed these expansions with the administrators at the Cologne airport we have got assurances that we're in good

Our next question will be from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Great thanks. Good morning, guys. When you think about the fourth quarter outlook on the
International side, is that supported by kind of the product launches and the firming that you have been seeing in Asia,
do you need to see any ramp-up going into the holiday season, or would that all be upside relative to your expectations
as it stands right now?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well certainly if there's a little bit of an inventory squeeze, and I'd say there's a decent
probability of that, then there is some upside. As Scott mentioned earlier especially those long trans-Pacific routes
there's incredible leverage on. And so to some extent you make your bets and you see how it comes through. There
does seem to be a little uptick as Scott had said in sentiment right now and that could create the need to speed up supply
chains. Clearly the flooding in Southeast Asia is a challenge, that may also lead to some late hurry-up orders to catch
up on supplies. It's one of the reasons we have been I guess balanced in our capacity reductions, taking enough out that
we don't feel like we have got too much but at the same time keeping enough infrastructure in place to capitalize on the
benefit.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay great. Thanks for the time.

<Q - Nate Brochmann>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Hey, Nate.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Hey Nate.
<Q - Nate Brochmann>: I wanted to talk a little bit, as we talk about some of the trends shifting internationally more
from maybe exporting to more of the intra-regional trade networks within Europe and Asia, was wondering if you
could talk little bit about what you're doing to take advantage of that, and what kind of growth opportunities you see as
maybe some of those economies shift a little bit.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I talked Nate a lot about this last quarter at the Investor Conference, that we really have invested
pretty heavily in our intra-Asia network, as it is probably the fastest growing business in the world right now. So we've
obviously improved time in transit, we've added a lot more flights between locations over there. And we'll continue to
invest heavily as we go forward. But I think generally we're focused on and we're paying a lot of attention to and
probably made our heaviest investments this year.

<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: And really the combination of the intra-Asia flights as Asia trades more with itself and the
continuing migration of integrated supply chains in Europe tends to drive the intra-European shipments also. So we
remain very focused and bullish on both those theaters.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And again, I think we're not writing off Asia exports to the U.S. I think as the U.S. economic
stabilizes you're going to see more demand for Asian products. So I think you will see a pick-up then. But if it's this
quarter or next quarter you're going to see exports from Asia to the U.S. pick up again.

We have a question from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Thank you. Good morning. It seems like most of the weakness in your international margins
are the declines in Asia, maybe some mix going to shorter haul flights and some FX. But was there any hit from your
expansion in Germany because you have got extra capacity or your spending there? And if not, is that something that
you think might weigh on results in Q4, or Q1 of next year?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Not material. I mean we certainly have been in a growth and expansion mode in International,
both with aircraft, and with sales resources and some other things. So – we have been investing for growth and we
continue to see the benefits of that with UPS far exceeding any of our competitors profits and growth rates. So we are
probably a little bit heavier on the investment side than on average, so there's some exposure if growth doesn't
materialize, but no single – the Cologne expansion would be the biggest capital investment in Europe, and clearly that
hasn't really broken ground yet.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yes, I want to reiterate though that Europe has stayed strong. Kurt talked about upper single
digit growth. Last quarter our profits were good, so we're comfortable. Everybody is worried about the headlines you
read about Europe's economy, but our business has stayed strong and we expect it to stay strong going forward.

about excess capacity that's in the network, and when you think you want to chase volume and add density?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: We continue to be pleased with our progress there. As we said Freight shipments were basically
flat this quarter. We think that's pretty much in line with the industry. We do see the market proceeding towards a more
healthy outcome, clearly we have been consistent on our revenue management policies, but many of our competitors
have been pretty erratic. So we're continuing to focus on value and offering a unique proposition to customers and we
will dial up our aggressiveness on market share as we see the right time in the industry. But at this point we're pretty
pleased with the progress we're making.

<Q - Matthew S. Brooklier>: Yes thanks, good morning. I think you may have talked a little bit to it, but wanted to
get kind of the all-in impact from fuel in the quarter.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Fuel was a modest tail wind for the Domestic and a modest head wind for the International. It
wasn't a huge number either way, but in International the absolute level of fuel is more important whereas in Domestic
it's primarily a timing issue. In aggregate it's not a big story, but it did help the Domestic a bit and was a head wind for
the International.
<Q - Matthew S. Brooklier>: All right, thank you.

And we have a question from the line of Mr. Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey, good morning, guys. It's Rob Salmon on for Justin. We've heard a lot of talk, I guess,
about the aircraft capacity coming out of Asia, yet you guys indicated you took out about 10% of capacity out of those
lanes. Could you give me a sense of how Freight load factors trended in Q2? Where we were in Q3, and kind of where
they are directionally thus far in October?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes. Clearly with the softening in Asia, capacity utilization across the Freight networks
dropped fairly substantially. And ocean freight clearly was kind of underwhelming this year, with the normal peak
being certainly smaller than we expected. We've really not written the story yet on Air Freight, as I said. We think
there's certainly a decent probability that there'll be a bit of a squeeze in the next couple of months, but at least so far to
date the air build up has been fairly modest. So we remain cautious in that theater. It is a benefit for the margins in our
Forwarding group, and certainly helped to – helped us to generate the 8.3% margin in that segment. But we do remain
cautious, there are a lot of players and there's some risk of overcapacity certainly.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: At this time in 2009 we did not see the Air Freight peak that happened. So it's because the
holiday season is so compressed that it's down to just a few weeks in December now. You won't see it for a while but at
this time – this call in 2009 we did not see the peak that we were heading into. Can't say it's going to happen in 2011
but it's certainly a possibility.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: That makes a lot of sense. When we're thinking kind of how full the planes are coming out
of Asia, could you give us a sense of the magnitude of where we are in October versus where we had been in Q3, kind
of following the adjustments you guys had made to the network?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: It's really too soon to lock that in I guess. With the product launches and some of the normal
volatility, it's too early for us to make a call on if we've nailed capacity and demand perfectly on the balance.
Remember though that we do have the ability to as a very strong forwarder to help smooth out the utilization of our
airline with utilization of our forwarding capacity. So in aggregate if you look at both business segments combined it
does reduce the volatility.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: What I'll say, we're planning on growth out of Asia in the fourth quarter, and we have less
capacity, so that should help utilization.

<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much, and congratulations. Some of these have been answered already.
You mentioned the $0.01 per share impact of currency. You mentioned fuel was a drag on International. So if I had to

more volume mix impact? You've already identified the currency aspect.

<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Jeff, if you factor out the two commodities, the fuel and the currency, clearly we would have
shown decent profit increases, probably mid single digit profit increases, maybe a little better. And then the product
mix jumps around on us, and this was one of the most volatile quarters. I mean, if you think of where we were at at the
beginning of the quarter and then the whole roller coaster we have been on with demand and expectations around this
global trade, that – we were pleased that we continued to see growth in those regional shipments, but with the high
leverage those long distance runs clearly had an impact on the margins.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I think, Jeff, again a lot of this was driven by concern and uncertainty in the United States when
after the first and second quarter GDP numbers came out and got revised down, there was a lot of concern of a double
dip, and people stopped buying, stopped consuming. Over the last month or so we're starting to see obviously better
economic numbers, so that there's more optimism out there, and that could change – that could turn things around. We
still expecting a slow growth economy but I don't think as negative as people were thinking two and three months ago.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: So we are confident that the International segment will be back on a profit growth trend, and
continue the market share gains. How rapid that profit growth is will depend somewhat on the mix of how the next
couple of months come together.

Our next question will come from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yes, thanks. You identified a 2414 LTL EBIT margin of 6% as a target. I guess I'm
wondering in addition to volume and price improvement are there some operational changes required to achieve this?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Certainly continued leverage and technology in our Freight operation is a big part of the margin
improvements. We had a good quarter this quarter, about two-thirds of the way to that goal as far as margins are
concerned. But we're leveraging a lot of the technology that we manage our business with, both on the line haul and the
pickup and delivery to streamline the Freight. And that's part of the synergies that we bring, much as we added
paperless invoice to our Air Freight shipments to streamline the customs clearance we're also bringing the operational
technology to the UPS Freight. And it's likely we'll have some other exciting announcements continuing on the UPS
Freight both for the customer benefit and the operational.

We have a question from the line of Mr. David Campbell of Thompson, Davis and Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Pearce Campbell>: Hi, good morning, I think my question has been answered but just to make sure, third
quarter tonnage in the Asia-Pacific region was up for you, but I assume that when you talk about product mix what you
mean in the fourth quarter is that there will be more growth or less of a decrease in your package business in the fourth
quarter. And that's what's driving better results and higher yields per ton. Is that one way to look at it?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: No David, you're a little too optimistic. We actually did see volume declines in our
International business on the small package. The forwarding was down also but sometimes the volume that hits our
planes or doesn't hit it to move around. No, we did see low single digit declines in exports out of Asia which is unusual
for us. We are expecting that to get back up to modest increases for Q4. But no, there were real sequential –
year-over-year declines at least. That was part of the problem.

You have a question from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital, please go ahead.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Hi, Gary.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Hi Gary.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Wanted to see if I could get a little bit of flavor for some of the moving pieces in the Domestic
segment. I clearly hand you that the comps are getting a lot tougher from a margin perspective, but you still have
pricing that I think you said up 2% to 3%, volumes looked actually okay in that segment, better than at least I was
expecting. So just curious if there's sort of something going on on the cost side that is slowing that down, and whether
or not that's something that could look better in future periods if these trends continue with volume and price the way
you have been seeing them.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes, that's a good question. Clearly we did pretty well in a flat growth environment. We
improved margin 60 basis points. But the comps versus last year on the comp and benefits were tougher. And that was
part of why we had fairly cautious guidance on that. Typically the third quarter is the quarter where we true up our
self-insured liabilities, workers' comp, some of those things. And the adjustment we made in 2010 was a much larger
credit than what we saw in 2011. So that did cause the comp and benefit line to be a little higher in comparison to
volume than normal. We don't – that is basically a one-time event although it does get adjusted every year. So we
continue to be optimistic, that's why we remain committed to the range we have done and are seeing great operational
results and are expecting volumes to begin picking up a bit in the fourth quarter.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And that's one of the key ways we talked about in the past to improve margins, Gary is to get –
our average wage rate's still high because we're not growing the business enough, and right now productivity is saving
us half of that wage increase. If we can get that average wage increase down by bringing in lower seniority employees,
that's going to help us an awful lot. So instead of saving half of the wage increase, can save much more than that with
the productivity improvements.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: And just to be clear, the things you were mentioning Kurt, like the workers' comp, et cetera,
those are not things that are uniquely hurting 3Q, those are things that we should expect to continue in the run rate
looking forward, right?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: It was really primarily a this-year/last-year comparison for third quarter.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Okay. Thanks very much, again.

Our next question come from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you. Good morning, guys. If we look at the volumes in Asia, you mention they're
expected to pick up a little bit here in 4Q due to some of the product launches. Will you expect them to be up if you ex
out the product launches in 4Q?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: It's almost impossible to factor that out. There's always product launches going on. As to
whether it would be positive or not, I'm not sure. We've had estimates on the product launches, and you have some
from multiple companies every year. But we do see Asia without the product launches getting a little firmer. I guess
that's the bottom line.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Oh, that's good, I appreciate your time.

<A - D. Scott Davis>: It really comes down though, it comes down to your, I guess your projections of demand out of
Europe and demand out of the United States. And right now there's cautious optimism, as Kurt said earlier, on the peak
season in the United States, where the National Retail Federation is calling for a 2.8% increase in sales, which is
actually higher than average for the last ten years. Not as good as last year, but higher than the average for that last ten
years, and if that happens that'll create demand. But as I said before, it's a compressed season, so we'll have to wait and

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Rob Pickels of Manning & Napier, please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Pickels>: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just following up in the International market,
you talked about demand and your own capacity. I'm curious a little bit about competitive capacity. One of your biggest
competitors has been buying a lot of long haul planes. Is that the chief sort of competitive capacity issue, or are you
also seeing it from smaller competitors or airlines? Just comment a little bit on that, and then are you seeing any of your
competitors take down capacity as you have?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: No, we are seeing some of our competitors react and take down excess capacity. Some of them
have changed the routes to improve their utilization and maybe done some fuel tech stops, but it's not just the express
carriers. As you mentioned, there are other players, some of the foreign flag aircraft that have added some capacity. So
we do think the market is rational, but clearly when you make those big investments you have to plan for the long term.
And so far though we do see people adjusting and taking some capacity out. So we don't think there's much risk of this
thing getting drastic with a dramatic imbalance, but we do have to be cautious.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: You know, we're taking out capacity and we generate probably double the margins of our
competitors. So you think there's got to be a lot of pressure on them to reduce capacity going forward.
<Q - Robert Pickels>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes, I've got a follow-up question for you in terms of the pension view on 2012. Going
into this year, you had put in a large cash contributions, I think, I guess in 2010, and then you had a pretty large
contribution in January this year which offset some of what would have been pension expense pressure this year. I'm
wondering if you would consider, if it looks like the discount rate is lower and going to cause pressure on pension
expense in 2012, if you would also consider a large cash contribution which would mitigate some of the potential
expense pressure in 2012.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Tom, we'll talk in certainly much more detail on the next quarter about our expectations for
that. We did have about a $0.07 headwind this year for increased pension expense, and with these frustratingly low
discount rates it does create some real challenges, at least from an accounting perspective on the earnings side.
However, we feel pretty confident that over time these incredibly low rates will come back up to a more normal
historical level which would do wonders for some of the plans.
Having said that, our plan is in great shape. As you mention, with the funding we did earlier in the year we're pretty
much 100% funded. So if rates stay this low through the end of the year, there will be some headwinds on at least our
reported expense for the plan, but it will still be very well funded. And at least at this point we're not planning for major
additional funding, anything that would be outside the normal.

And our next question is from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Vernon>: Just a quick follow-up on the European volume story. Kind of within Europe are you seeing a
different mix as far as the trans-border standard versus kind of overnight inside of Europe?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes, a little bit. A little bit. The blessing and the curse of this great integrated network is it's
very easy for customers to move up and down the portfolio. It was a tremendous strength for us during the recession
because customers could trade down to the portfolio to save money rather than trading out. So we're seeing a little bit
of that. Is it the beginning of a trend or is it just a blip, we're not sure yet. But we have seen in the last quarter a little bit
of an acceleration in the growth in our more standard products and slower growth in our premium products. But all in
all, Europe exports grew upper single digits, which is I think far above the market. We'll hear from some of our other
competitors in the next couple of weeks and see. But we remain very confident that we have got a very strong value
proposition there, and are helping customers compete in a challenging environment.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And I might add, we do very well on profitability in our trans-border Standard. So just because
you're trading down doesn't mean you're hurting your profitability.
<Q - David Vernon>: Yes, I was going to ask. So is it a similar delta in the premiums and deferred in the U.S. versus
in trans-border Europe, or is it a little less?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, you know, I guess the trick in the short term is that the premium products tend to have
more fixed cost. And that – the extreme is the Asia to U.S. flights. So it's mainly an issue for us of adapting our
network, right sizing, getting the right size plane and the right assets. And so over time, as Scott says, we can adjust and
continue to generate the incredible margins that we're able to, no matter what the product mix. But in the short term it
can create some challenges to adapting the assets.
<Q - David Vernon>: Great. Thank you.

Due to time constraints our last question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Can you talk a little bit about the guidance range, Kurt. You didn't narrow it at all going into the
fourth quarter, and we only have one quarter left. Kind of looking at the expectations you've laid out for the fourth
quarter, looks as if you're going to be in the lower end of the guidance range, and so there's a lot of upside there. Is the
fourth quarter – you mention that the consumers has spent better than people expect. Is there that much upside leverage
to the model where you could potentially hit the upside of that range?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: David, I don't want to get in detailed specifics on it. Clearly we've migrated over the last couple
of years to an annual guidance. If we think there's a risk of going out of that, either to the positive or the negative, we
would adjust. But it has been a bit of a roller coaster the last few months anyway, we've take a hard look at it, we are
very confident that we will complete the year in that guidance. And with the uncertainty in the U.S. on the holidays,
with the volatility we have seen across the globe, we figured we'd leave us a pretty wide range and not try to thread the
needle, for the remainder of the year anyway. So we remain optimistic, but we do think that since peak becomes more
and more intense and more and more short, we thought it safe just to go ahead and stay with this current annual range.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: David, I said last quarter I thought that the economy could be anywhere between 1% and 3.5%
in the second half of the year, and where the economy ended up could drive where we are on the range. So I think
there's a good chance we're going to be somewhere in the middle of it in that economy – economic forecast of 1% to
3.5%. So we feel pretty comfortable keeping the range where it is. Still, as Kurt said, the holiday season has a big wide

range on the results. So we left it where it was.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Thank you very much.
Operator
That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Dolny.
Andy Dolny
Yes. I'm going turn it over to Scott for some final comments.
D. Scott Davis
Thanks, Andy. Now UPS produced solid results as we managed through the economic soft patch in the third quarter.
But now we're starting to see a number of developments that give me optimism. The U.S. economy is stable and
showing modest growth, and we've started to see important decisions be made in both Washington and Brussels,
although much more action is needed there.
UPS is ready with a global integrated network in place to support stronger growth going forward. As we look for the
rest of the year, UPS is prepared to meet the needs of our customers, and finish up the year with a strong fourth quarter
as we achieve record earnings per share for the year.
Thanks so much and have a great day.
