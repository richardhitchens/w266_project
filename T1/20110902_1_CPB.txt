MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Campbell Soup's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over
to your host, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.
Jennifer K. Driscoll
Thank you, Mary . Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Campbell Soup Company's fourth quarter earnings call
and webcast. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Craig Owens, Senior Vice
President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; and Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of
Finance.
Today, Denise will give an overview of our strategies and comment on our performance for the fourth quarter followed
by a detailed discussion from Craig that also includes our expectations for fiscal 2012. Following the wrap-up from
Denise, all of us will take questions from analysts and investors.
As usual, we've created slides to accompany our presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this
morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. Please keep in mind that this call is open to members of the media
who are participating in listen-only mode.
As a reminder our presentation today includes certain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current
expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions

and estimates, which could be inaccurate, and which inherently are subject to risks. Please refer to slide four in our
presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could
cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement.
The results presented today have been adjusted for items impacting comparability, including those that the company
announced in June comprised of a series of initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and to reduce overhead costs
across the organization, as well as the charges related to the decision to close the company's Moscow office and exit the
Russian market. As a result of these initiatives, in the fourth quarter we recorded pre-tax restructuring costs of $63
million, or $41 million after tax, which equals about $0.12 per share.
Since our presentation includes non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of the
measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying the presentation.
These slides, as well as our earnings release and selected quarterly financial data can be found on the website.
We've also made a change in our reportable segments. You can see it on slide six. Consistent with our strategy and
recent management changes, effective this quarter we are reporting the businesses that formerly constituted the U.S.
Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment as two separate reporting segments. The first is U.S. Simple Meals, which
includes our U.S. Soup and Sauce portfolio, and the second is U.S. Beverages.
We also now have geographic designations on all of our segments so Baking and Snacking becomes Global Baking and
Snacking, with no change to the elements that comprise it. International Soup, Sauces and Beverages becomes
International Simple Meals and Beverages to match our U.S. naming convention. And North America Foodservice
doesn't change in name, yet beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011 costs associated with the restructuring activities
are not included in segment results and this change affected Foodservice comparisons for the fiscal year.
All of our segment results for prior periods have been modified to conform to the current presentation. Further
information on historical Beverages performance by quarter will be disclosed along with our first quarter earnings in
November 22 – it's the 22. We'll give you first through third quarters at that time.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Denise Morrison.
Denise M. Morrison
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Campbell's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for fiscal
2011. This is my first call as Campbell's CEO and it's an honor and a privilege for me to represent Campbell's here
today. I look forward to having an ongoing candid dialogue with all of you about our company, our performance and
our progress on the growth strategies we outlined in July at our analyst day.
In fiscal 2011, after a very weak first half, our focus was on improving our bottom line performance in the back half
while developing a strategic framework for Campbell's future growth. I'll share my observations on our performance in
a moment.
As I stated at our analyst day in July, our primary goal is to create value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales
growth. To achieve that goal we are pursuing three growth strategies. First, we will stabilize then profitably grow North
America Soup and Simple Meals. Second, we will invest to expand our international presence. And, third, we will
continue to drive growth in healthy beverages and baked snacks.
We are confident in and committed to these new growth strategies. We're heartened by the constructive feedback we've
received from many of you regarding our plans. Yet we also recognize, as you do, that the key to success is our ability
to execute these strategies.
We enter fiscal 2012 energized with a renewed focus on the consumer. While the economies in our primary markets
have generally improved since the lows of the economic crisis, many consumers remain cautious. The recovery has not
progressed at the pace or intensity consumers had hoped for. As a result, consumers remain careful about their
purchases and feel the need for resourcefulness and vigilance. In this environment it is critical for us to deliver

meaningful innovation focused on consumer needs and to differentiate our brands through effective marketing that
emphasizes our products' tangible benefits and value relative to the competition.
Turning to our results, I said earlier that one area of focus for the past few months was on improving our financial
performance in the back half. After an improvement in the third quarter this morning we reported that adjusted EBIT
increased 24% in the fourth quarter to $232 million. On a per share basis adjusted net earnings grew 30% to $0.43 a
share in the current quarter.
Global Baking and Snacking, which has been strong all year, led the way in the fourth quarter. This business, which is
an area targeted for accelerated growth in our strategy, posted a strong quarterly gain in sales and operating earnings.
We have a solid track record of innovation in both Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm. We intend to accelerate innovation
with our investment in the new Pepperidge Farm innovation center, which we will break ground on later this month.
Turning to U.S. Simple Meals, as you recall, in the first half of fiscal 2011 our Simple Meals performance suffered as
increases in promotional spending behind U.S. Soup did not deliver the expected volume lifts. Mid-year, we changed
our marketing strategy and pulled back on heavy promotions. As a result, we began to improve the profitability of the
Simple Meals business in the third quarter. Subsequently, we took a list price increase in U.S. Soup due to inflationary
pressures. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see further profit improvement in our Simple Meals business despite
anticipated volume declines.
Emphasis on brand-building combined with more consistent innovation is the right approach to stabilize, and then
profitably grow our Simple Meals business. To that end, customer reception to our new products in Simple Meals:
Slow Kettle Soups, Swanson Flavor Boost, and new Prego and Wolfgang Puck sauces is positive, and the sell-in is
progressing as planned. We also have begun the important longer-term process of reinvigorating our Simple Meals
innovation pipeline. As we told you, we intend to rebalance our consumer marketing support in U.S. Soup, and are on
track to stabilize and profitably grow the broader Simple Meals business over the long term.
Soup volumes and consumption were softer this quarter, as we expected, because price realization is coming through.
We have two more quarters ahead where we will be cycling the heavy discounting activity. While we expect further
volume declines, we will be competitive, and we believe elasticity will normalize over time.
As you've seen in our news release this morning, we've broken out our U.S. Beverages results. This new reporting
segment is aligned with our strategic framework, and increased emphasis on accelerating growth in Beverages. It also
provides a greater degree of granularity on our performance.
U.S. Beverage sales declined slightly against very strong prior-year performance while operating earnings declined
amid significant cost inflation and discounting in a highly competitive environment. Craig will comment further on our
new Beverages segment.
In July we provided updated guidance for the year. We finished the year slightly better than that. However, we are by
no means satisfied with where we are. Changing our growth trajectory will take time as we fully implement the
strategies we laid out for you in July.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Craig for his analysis of our financial results and an elaboration of our expectations
for fiscal 2012. Craig?
B. Craig Owens
Thanks, Denise. Good morning. I'll spend the next few minutes stepping through our fourth quarter results and segment
highlights followed by a recap of our fiscal-year results. I'll conclude with a brief discussion of our fiscal 2012
guidance.
For the quarter, we reported net sales of $1.6 billion, a 6% increase versus the prior year. Organic net sales increased by
1%. Excluding items impacting comparability, EBIT increased 24% in the quarter to $232 million. Earnings per share

was $0.43 this quarter, up 30%, compared with EPS in the fourth quarter of 2010.
The net sales increase of 6% reflected a five-point increase due to the currency translation as the Australian dollar,
Canadian dollar, and euro have all strengthened. Excluding the favorable impact of currency, organic net sales
increased by 1%. Pricing added two points, reduced promotional spending added one point and volume and mix
subtracted two points. The price increase is primarily in our Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's businesses in reaction to
significant inflation in grain-based commodities. The variance in promotional spending reflects our strategy to reduce
promotional spending in U.S. Soup in the back half of the year, and as expected, this has had a negative impact on
volume.
Our gross margin declined by 60 basis points from 40.4% to 39.8%. This decline was primarily due to cost inflation,
the rate of which increased in the quarter, partly offset by productivity improvements, higher selling prices and reduced
promotional spending. In the fourth quarter marketing and selling expenses decreased by 11% to $196 million,
compared to $221 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower out of season advertising spending in U.S. Soup,
reductions in Australia to reallocate more spending to trade in a very competitive retailer environment and lower
spending in Russia given our decision to exit that market. Administrative expenses increased $3 million to $170 million
this quarter, driven by the impact of currency.
Below the line, interest expense was comparable to the prior year. The tax rate increased 2.7 points to 32.5%, reflecting
taxes associated with a higher level of cash repatriations, compared to the prior year. Due to the impact of our ongoing
share repurchase program, diluted shares outstanding declined 5% in the quarter contributing to earnings per share
growth of 30%.
In our segment results for the quarter, organic sales within the global Baking and Snacking segment increased 7% as
both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's benefited from higher selling prices and strong volume gains. At Pepperidge Farm
sales increased primarily due to gains in Goldfish snack crackers while sales at Arnott's rose due to gains in savory
crackers led by Shapes, and the growth in Tim Tam chocolate biscuits.
U.S. Simple Meals sales declined 8% reflecting lower sales for both U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauce. U.S. Soup sales fell 9%
in the quarter. Soup volume performance was weak impacted by our strategy in the second half to reduce promotional
spending, our list price action to help offset inflation, and also, unfavorable movements in customer inventories,
compared to the year-ago quarter. Sales of both Prego and Pace declined for the quarter. The decrease in Prego sales
reflects continued competitive merchandising and new items in the Italian Sauce category. The decline of Pace sales
reflects share losses to private label.
Within the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment, organic sales were comparable to prior year. Gains in
Europe and Canada were offset by declines in the Asia-Pacific region and in Latin America.
U.S. Beverage sales declined 1% versus prior year, lapping strong growth of 12% in the prior-year quarter. Sales of V8
vegetable juice declined reflecting increased competitive activity while sales of V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash both
increased. The launch of new items, including V8 Fusion, V8 V-Fusion + Tea, new flavor varieties, and the 8-ounce
slim cans contributed to V8 V-Fusion sales gains. Organic sales of North American Food Service increased by 8%
primarily due to decreased promotional spending.
Operating earnings in the U.S. Simple Meals segment increased 4% to $101 million this quarter. The increase in
operating earnings was primarily due to lower marketing and selling expenses, and an increase in gross margin
percentage reflecting our price realization efforts.
Earnings within Global Baking and Snacking increased 26% due to growth at Arnott's, and the favorable impact of
currency, partly offset by a decline in Pepperidge Farm. The mark-to-market impact of open commodity hedges had a
negative impact on Pepperidge Farm earnings in the quarter.
Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages declined 29% versus strong results a year ago. The decline was due to
significant cost inflation and increased promotional spending, partly offset by productivity improvements. We
experienced significant inflation in fruit and vegetable concentrates, as well as packaging materials.

This quarter, we saw strong earnings growth within our International Simple Meals and Beverages segment and in
North American Foodservice. In the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment, operating earnings increased
by 300% primarily due to gains in Canada, reduced spending in Russia, and the favorable impact of currency.
Operating earnings within North American Foodservice increased by $13 million primarily driven by reduced
promotional spending and productivity improvements.
U.S. soup sales for the quarter declined 9%. Within soup, condensed sales decreased 10% with declines in both eating
and cooking varieties. Ready-to-serve was down 5% reflecting declines in Select Harvest canned soups and in
microwaveable varieties. Broth sales fell 11%. Soup sales, especially condensed varieties, were negatively impacted by
unfavorable movements in customer inventory levels. As I mentioned earlier, our reduced trade spending and list price
actions are also pressuring volumes.
For the full year now, reported net sales increased 1%. Organic net sales were down 1%. On a segment basis, the
organic sales decline is primarily due to the decline in U.S. Simple Meals, partly offset by growth in Global Baking and
Snacking. Excluding items impacting comparability in both periods, EBIT of $1.3 billion was down 1% versus a year
ago. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in gross margin percentage and lower sales volume partially offset
by lower marketing expenses and favorable currency. Earnings per share for the year increased 3% to $2.54 benefiting
from fewer outstanding shares.
For the fiscal year, our reported net sales increased 1% and included a gain from currency translation of two points.
Excluding the impact of currency, organic sales were down by 1%. As you can see on chart 27, the negative impact of
our increased promotional spending and our decrease in sales volume was only partly offset by higher selling prices.
For the full year, our gross margin percentage declined from 41% to 40.2%, an 80-basis point reduction that was
primarily due to cost inflation of approximately 2% and higher plant costs and increased promotional spending partially
offset by productivity improvements and higher selling prices. Marketing and selling expenses decreased, reflecting
lower advertising and lower selling expenses partly offset by the impact of currency. Administrative expense increased
$7 million primarily due to the impact of currency. Excluding the currency impact, higher pension and benefit costs and
costs associated with the new headquarters facility were offset by cost savings and lower incentive compensation costs.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased 5% to $111 million through the year reflecting a higher
percentage of long-term debt in the portfolio and a slightly higher average net debt balance. The tax rate at 31.5% was
comparable to the year-ago rate. For the fiscal year, net earnings declined 2% and benefiting from a 4% reduction in
diluted shares outstanding, EPS increased 3% to $2.54 versus $2.47 per share in 2010.
In segment results for the full year, the most significant movements were in U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and
Snacking. U.S. Simple Meals sales declined 6%, reflecting a 6% decrease in U.S. soup sales, as well as lower sales of
Prego pasta sauce and Pace Mexican sauce, both of which have been negatively impacted by increased competitive
activity. Sales for Global Baking and Snacking increased 4% versus prior year as both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's
achieved volume gains, and also, benefited from higher selling prices.
In U.S. Simple Meals, operating earnings declined 11% to $657 million. The decrease in operating earnings was
primarily due to lower sales and reduced gross margin percentage partly offset by lower marketing and selling
expenses.
Global Baking and Snacking operating earnings increased by 10% primarily due to the impact of currency and volume
driven gains at both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's.
Within the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment, operating earnings increased by 15%, primarily driven
by growth in the Asia-Pacific region, the impact of currency, and the benefit of reduced investment spending in Russia.
Operating earnings of U.S. Beverages declined 12% due to the increased promotional spending.
North American Foodservice operating earnings increased 49% driven by reduced promotional spending, productivity
improvements in excess of inflation and lower administrative expenses.

U.S. soup sales for the fiscal year fell by 6%. Within soup, condensed sales declined 4%, ready-to-serve soup decreased
9% and broth sales decreased 5%.
Category performance in the United States during the last 52 weeks based on IRI panel data and Campbell internal
estimates is shown on slide 33. The overall U.S. wet soup category declined in dollars by 1.6% in the last 52 weeks.
Our soup sales in dollars declined 4.2% under-performing the category. Our soup sales performance this year reflected
our heavy promotions in the first half, which did not generate the expected lifts, followed by a rebalancing of the
marketing mix and list price increase in the back half.
All other branded players saw an increase in U.S. Soup sales of 3.4% this year, while private label soup sales grew by
2.6%. While it's not shown on the chart, total volume in the Soup category was essentially steady with prior year.
Campbell's dollar share at wet soup for the past 52 weeks was 61.8%, down 170 basis points. Our market share for
condensed soup and broth was essentially unchanged. As has been the trend the decline in our soup dollar share came
from ready-to-serve soup. Of our share decline, two-thirds was picked up by other branded players while one-third
moved to private label reflecting the relative size of these players in the market.
Higher price realization in the second half contributed to our market share losses, but as Denise said, this move, in
conjunction with our efforts in innovation and brand-building is an important part of the transition to a more profitable
growth in our U.S. Soup and Simple Meal business.
Cash flow from operations increased by $85 million to $1.1 billion. Cash flow benefited from lower pension
contributions and higher cash earnings. Working capital requirements were also higher.
Capital expenditures of $272 million were down from $315 million a year ago. Looking ahead, we forecast capital
spending in fiscal 2012 of approximately $325 million. For the year, we repurchased 21 million shares at a cost of $728
million. We completed our strategic share repurchase program, announced in June 2008, authorizing repurchases of
$1.2 billion over the three-year period.
In June 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program with no expiration
date to purchase up to $1 billion of our outstanding shares. Net debt was $2.6 billion, an increase of 74 million.
With respect to 2012 guidance there is no change to our fiscal 2012 expectations on an absolute dollar basis. However,
given that we finished fiscal 2011 slightly ahead of the guidance we provided in July we have adjusted our 2012 growth
rates to reflect this and to maintain our commitment to support brand-building and innovation in 2012.
In fiscal 2012, we expect net sales growth to be between zero and 2% with the assumption that currency will not have a
significant impact. We expect a decline in adjusted EBIT of between 9% and 7%, negative, which includes an
incremental investment of $100 million in innovation and brand-building, input cost inflation, of between 8% and 10%,
a $60 million benefit from our recent restructuring program and a negative impact related to restoring incentive
compensation to targeted levels.
Finally, we expect a decline in adjusted earnings per share of between 7% and 5% with interest expense comparable to
the prior year and a tax rate in the 32% to 33% range.
Thank you. With that, Denise will now conclude our presentation.
Denise M. Morrison
Thanks, Craig. Before taking your questions, I want to make some closing remarks. We improved our EBIT
performance in the back half and began to make the transition in U.S. Soup towards a rebalanced marketing mix. We
continue to believe that improved innovation and brand-building is the right thing to do for all of our businesses.
We're confident in our strategies and plans. It's early and we're just beginning to implement these plans, but the
company is energized by the new course we've charted. We also recognize that changing our growth trajectory will take

Fiscal 2012 will be a transition year as we work to create a different company at Campbell. Our primary goal is to
create value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth and that is our focus going forward.
With that, we'll open up the call to your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Terry Bivens from JPMorgan.
<Q - Jessica L. Schmidt>: Hi. This is Jessica Schmidt on for Terry. So, we understand that there has not been a
significant change to the overall Soup category shelf space at Wal-Mart. And our question is, have you either gained or
lost any portion of that shelf space at Wal-Mart or any other retailers? Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We don't really comment on particular situations with retailers. So -
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I think we'd say overall that our shelf space is about flat versus prior year in the total grocery
and discount channel.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right.
<Q - Jessica L. Schmidt>: Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Next question, please.

Our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Chris.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I just wanted to ask you in relation to the guidance for next year just on the
percentage rate being down a little more, a percentage point less than we thought, what is that driven by? Are you
trying to do more in the form of marketing? I heard you say about $100 million increase in marketing. I thought that
was pretty consistent with what you said before. So, what is it that led the growth rate down a little bit more for next
year?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Chris, the only thing that changed is the base year. The base year was a little bit higher. Part of
that over-delivery was a little bit lower spend on marketing and we're just hanging onto the absolute guidance if you
will. I know we gave it in percentages, but if you look the absolute numbers would come back to what we said in July.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We just had thought it was really important to maintain the integrity of that spending plan
as we make 2012 a year of investment.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask about in ready-to-serve soup, for example, you had
a new product launch with Slow Kettle. Is a lot of that baked into – is a lot of those shipments in this quarter?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: No. Most of the shipments will happen in the first quarter. It just started shipping.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, got you. Thank you for the time.

Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello, Andrew.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: I think in your recent meeting in Canada you talked about being able to hope to hold gross
margins roughly flat year-over-year given some of the incremental pricing to help with the productivity for the inflation
rate. Is that still generally what you're thinking about?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. And then just on the way we should think about earnings sort of the trajectory, if you
will, through the year. Obviously, the EPS sort of results last year in your fiscal first half were lower year-over-year so
those comps a bit easier, but I know they'll be ramping up spending I would assume in the first half as well. But, you
know, I'm just trying to get a sense how some of these things play out and if there's any dramatic difference in the way
earnings flow throughout the year even if it's just directional?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Andrew, we don't give quarterly guidance and we intend to start spending against the
$100 million investment starting in quarter one, but the pacing will of course, vary by business. That said, we're not
expecting the first half to be easy. We've had a list price increase and competitors have delayed following suit. So, we
expect that competitive pressures will continue. So, we have to watch this very carefully.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it. Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Judy.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Denise, just on the competitive environment heading into the soup season you've talk about the
competitors slow to reacting to pricing actions, but just in terms of some of the promotional activity that you're
expecting from your competitors in the soup season going forward, and then how that could potentially affect some of
the merchandising support that you could be getting, as it relates to some of your innovation and your product
launches?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Well, we have not seen our branded competition move up base price in the marketplace,
and we believe that with the latest round of pricing we have the opportunity to offer the best price value across the
category while still covering our inflation and our marketing investments. Our intention is to be competitive. And I

don't know if you have anything to add to that, Craig?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: No. I think – I don't want to get into the business of trying to project what the competitor is
going to do. As Denise says, we're going be competitive. We're going to manage our way through the year. But
directionally and strategically what we've done in the second half is the way that we're going to approach the business
coming into 2012, which is with more emphasis on brand-building and less emphasis on trade discount.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah, I think it's important to recognize that even though we're pulling back a little bit
on trade we are still spending a significant amount of funds on both promotional spending, as well as advertising.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Absolutely. But we're applying a whole new level of discipline to that spending.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then, Craig, is there a way to quantify in the fourth quarter how much the Russian
closure lowered your marketing and selling expenses?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Russia was about a penny in terms of savings from the closure.

Our next question comes from David Palmer from UBS.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello, David.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good morning. Hi, Denise. Just a question on the competitive pricing and price gaps. I'm sure
you look at the effective price gaps for soup categories in detail and not just versus private label for the condensed
category, but maybe even versus ready-to-serve soup, which has become more promotional and maybe effectively their
prices have been coming down to condensed. Do you feel comfortable with the price gaps where they are today? Do
you think that that is a problem for condensed? Or is that more or less where you think is a sustainable gap?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Actually, with the price discounting we did last year on ready-to-serve soup, David, we
actually saw a compression in the retail prices of ready-to-serve and condensed. So, we believe that by focusing on the
pricing and promotion strategy we have going forward, with the discipline we're exercising, the consumer will continue
to see a good array of value from Campbell's with condensed and ready-to-serve soup.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And effectively you think that that price gap will widen a little bit this year with some of the
pricing actions that are being taken? Is that the thought?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It's early to tell. The price realization is just coming through on shelf so we'll see where
that ends up.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And you think – basically you think that the price gap – if there's any sort of price gap
widening that might be helpful, it might be that those two categories versus some sort of private label problem for
condensed?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think there will be consumers that will continue to shop the category for price, and then
there will be consumers that continue to shop the category for the benefits offered for the price paid and we intend
through our marketing to communicate our value proposition to the consumer in a much bigger way. We believe that's

Our next question comes from Ed Aaron from RBC Capital Markets.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Ed.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I actually want to ask about
the Snack business. You had a pretty good quarter there and that business has a fair amount of Australia exposure and
we've heard some pretty awful things recently about that market in particular. I'm just hoping you can maybe give us a
little bit of context around what you're seeing over there.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: The Australian market from an economic standpoint is starting to become more under
pressure. However, we believe that with the size of the business we have over there in the categories that we play, and
the customer relationships that we have, we'll continue to be responsive and continue the momentum that we've built in
that marketplace. We're very bullish on Australia.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Great. Thank you. And then one follow-up if I could on the U.S. Soup side. You had an
inventory draw down at the retail level this quarter, which I think is the second fourth quarter in a row where you talked
about that. As we think about the first and second quarters of the year, should we expect an add back there? In other
words, should your shipment growth exceed your consumption growth in the first quarter for example, just to replenish
what you didn't get in the fourth quarter?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It's actually a bit hard to predict, Ed, because the heavy discounting was so severe last
year that inventory didn't necessarily fall where consumption occurred. And so we are watching that relationship very
closely as we go into the season. But suffice it to say that it was really the discounting we did last year that made the
inventory situation course-correct in the fourth quarter for us this year.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: And just to add to that, point, because the fourth quarter is a small quarter for soup, a small
change in inventory does have a meaningful impact on fourth quarter volumes. But when you look at the first and
second quarters, it won't be material.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: You're welcome, Ed. Next question, please.

<Q - Adam Josephson>: Good morning, everyone. This is Adam Josephson in for Akshay. Thanks for taking my
question.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello, Adam.
<Q - Adam Josephson>: At your Analyst Day, Sean mentioned three factors that have negatively affected your Soup
business, fewer stock-up trips by heavy users, sodium reductions, and an overemphasis on promotions. Obviously, the
latter two factors are within your control. And you stated your intention to add back sodium to your soups and to focus
more on branding. But if stock-up trips remain low, or even decline from where they are today given the state of the
economy, how would that affect your ability to return to growth in your Soup business?

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think that the fact that stock-up trips are down are not an excuse. They're just a different
dynamic that we have to deal with. And the way we promote the product, the fact that we're funneling more investment
into advertising of the product to generate usage, will work more with the consumers' pattern for buying. We believe
that's the right way to proceed at this point.
<Q - Adam Josephson>: Okay. And just one other one. Sean also pointed out that over the past few decades the
number of items in grocery stores has skyrocketed, and the number of options available to consumers for lunch and
dinner is much higher than it ever has been. How has that situation changed the way you approach marketing soup, to
the extent it does so at all? In other words, do you market it differently than five, 10 years ago and if so, how?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We're still in the throes of developing our advertising campaign for next year. But I do
believe that that everything we do now will be in the lens of a broader competitive set within Simple Meals. And
recognizing that the consumer does make those choices and we want them to compel them to choose Campbell's.

Our next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll CFA>: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So, two questions, but they're just related to one
another. It's on the quarter, and then on fiscal '12 guidance. So, on the July 13, it seems that you had the guidance for $2
– sorry – you exceeded the guidance by about $0.05 and that's all from the fourth quarter beat from lower marketing
investments. When you say that marketing is going be up $100 million in fiscal '12, that's then on a slightly lower base
than what you were talking about on July 13. So, the first question is, do I have this right?
And then I think that translates into – on just an EPS basis when I plug my numbers in, the percentages that you've
given; guidance for '12 is about $0.02 better on both ends than it was on Analyst Day. Is that – Craig, do I have these
numbers right?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Well, yeah. First of all, David, the $100 million number that you have is not all going to
appear in the selling and marketing lines. We talked about $100 million as incremental investment in innovation and in
marketing, so some of it yes, will appear in marketing. Some of it will appear in R&D, and some of it will actually
appear in other SG&A lines to support the infrastructure that we've put in against innovation.
I think the best way to think about the guidance change is really that we over-delivered the quarter. Part of that was
because we had lower marketing spend, but we also delivered at the gross margin line a little bit more strongly in a
couple of the divisions. And as Denise said earlier, we've just made sure that we've taken the approach that for 2012,
we're going to hold the plan that we had in place, which implies a little bit lower lift at EBIT and EPS on a percentage
basis. But it's the same plan.
<Q - David C. Driscoll CFA>: Okay. But sometimes the percentages get confusing. The EPS numbers by my
calculation are up two pennies on the low end and high end for the 2012 number. And I suppose if that absolute
calculation is correct, I just – since Analyst Day basically the economic situation in the U.S. has worsened. And it just
is – it's interesting, maybe these are slightly minor numbers in the margin. I mean, if that's the answer, that's fine. I'm
just curious that at this early juncture in the year, you'd even make any changes to the absolute EPS guidance?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, I would have one penny instead of two, but I think we're slicing it pretty thin here for a
forecast for the full year when we're talking about the difference in a penny. And again, the approach was not so much
to agonize over the pennies as to just say we're going to hold our plan for 2012, and how does that work out in terms of
percentages.

Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: I just had a question about the transition away from trade spending. You said you're walking
away from some unprofitable spending that you did in the first half of '11. One of your competitors is – has actually
made a lot of progress on their margins by reducing trade spending, and I'm just wondering, in your guidance here,
you're guiding margins down about 200 basis points despite shifting away from these unprofitable programs. I'm just
wondering if you could help me understand how that is. Maybe it's just inflation or being – put in another bucket and
maybe a follow-up. Thanks.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: We do have, as we talked about in July, Rob, a pretty significant inflationary pressure in the
numbers and in the assumption for next year. I mean, of course, we haven't given guidance on the gross margin line,
per se. So, I think we also talked about in operating expenses that we've got a headwind related to the incentive pay that
we hope to get back to pay out at targeted levels. So I think there's some combination of maybe inflation, above gross
profit and SG&A pressure related to benefit cost and incentive cost below the gross profit line.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: I guess another way of asking it, Craig, is if those programs were really unprofitable
programs, would eliminating them provide any kind of a benefit in your margin outlook, or you don't think of it that
way?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: This is Anthony. That would certainly be true for U.S. Soup, but we're talking about a
fraction of the entire portfolio, and as Craig mentioned earlier, we do expect gross margins to be about flat in F'12, but
it's not flat for each of the businesses underneath that.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. You're switching to a brokerage sales model in some
of your channels. Can you give a little more specifics about where you're making those switches and maybe, Denise,
tell us how that's going so far?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. We have shifted our retail coverage to a broker sales model, and in doing so, first of
all, we already had a large – well, a fairly large portion of our business in a broker sales model, so this is not a new
relationship. And what we did was added on the retail store coverage because what we found in our evaluation of our
own direct retail force versus the broker is that they've made significant advances in technology, and the ability to
cover many more stores at a lower cost with quality. And so we thought that this was a good time for us to advance that
relationship, and we're very excited about the early days.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just a couple of follow-up questions. Just – the guidance, Craig, I guess in terms of – just to
be clear, does not include any effect of foreign exchange on either the top line or the EPS line, is that right?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: That's correct.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And that's because you're just not going to forecast it at this point at least for us, or
because there's some EPS – or there is some FX benefit in the base year and – I'm trying to understand that.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Well, I hate to get in the business of forecasting foreign exchange for obvious reasons. The
planning assumption is that it should be approximately neutral to the current year.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. Okay. And just looking at it the way it helped last year, it might help the first half, but
be a drag in the second half, I guess, is the way that I'm looking at it?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yes. That's reasonable assumption.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. Okay. And then just on the trade inventories, to the extent that they were – was a little
bit of a drag in the fourth quarter, is it normal now? Is there anything unusual that we should be thinking about in terms
of trade inventories in the first quarter or the first half?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: The unusual activity is all in the prior year. That's true for this fourth quarter, it would be to a
certain extent true as we cycle the first half of next year. But I think Anthony made a good point earlier. The impact as
a percentage of total sales is much more significant in the fourth quarter than it is in the heavier sales seasons in the
first and second quarter.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: In particular, on U.S. soup and quarter four is the smallest quarter of the year.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then finally, I guess Denise, just at this point, is it fair to say that you've sold in –
and this is probably more specific to your Soup and Sauces business. But just – you've got a new plan in terms of how
you're approaching promotions, and how you're approaching stimulating the consumer. And you've basically – you've
sold those pricing plans with some volume expectation attached to them into the trade. And so it's not so much going be
a matter – we won't be surprised by – with how the trade reacts to it. Now, it's really just a matter how the consumer
reacts to it. Is that right?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: That's correct. The sell-in of this new plan has gone well. And again, we continue to be
competitive in the marketplace. But the consumer will ultimately be the decision-maker in the first half.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: And just – when will we start to see more of the advertising or the marketing – I guess the
pull begin to show up in the marketplace? I'm assuming it will be, like, now? Is that right?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. The marketing actually will start a little bit later in the season to hit the high-peak
volume part of the season.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: One of the reasons that you saw our marketing spend down so much in the fourth quarter is
that we were cycling some fairly heavy out-of-season advertising last year, and our analysis would say that that just
didn't have very good payback. So, we're – while we're lifting marketing spend for 2012, we're also concentrating it
more to the season.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. So, as we're watching – as we're trying to make – just kind of monitor progress, and
again, I know it's very early. Early on in the season, you're going to have the effect of higher price, but not all of the
marketing – the full effect of the marketing pull in the market yet. So, it might look worse before it gets better. Is that
the right way to think about it?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think it will build steam as the half unfolds.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robert Dickerson from Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Hello.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, there, Robert.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Hey. How are you? First question is just – it's more strategic. I know you went over a lot of
your international growth plans at your Analyst Day in July. But just in general, I was curious. We could see in the
fourth quarter that sales or overall sales from your new Global Snacking business is obviously a higher percentage of
your total company sales. And if we just think that that category over the next five years should continue to outpace
what we're seeing in soup and a second pillar of your three-category – or your three-tier growth processes, international
growth, could it be fair to assume that over the longer term that growth internationally may assume some non-organic
growth in Global Snacking? I mean, would you potentially look to enter new markets to find that growth that we've
seen out of a number of other snacking businesses?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We've applied a lot of rigor to the international expansion plan. And as I said in July, we
had identified some key markets, and there is a very tailored approach to those markets depending upon what the
market conditions are. But we feel with the broader-described categories of simple meals, baked snacks and healthy
beverages, we have a lot to work with in terms of faster growing categories and faster growing markets.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: External development is clearly a tool. You've seen us use it in the China market, and the joint
venture with Swire and I think we're prepared to use it in other markets. But the heart of the thing is the strategy, and
the targeting of markets and categories that we think offer good growth opportunity.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Just a quick follow-up. Your – you commented earlier that
over the longer term that you should see elasticity in soup start to normalize? And I'm just curious. Is that also based on
an assumption that overall soup consumption at least in the U.S. should stabilize over the next year or two?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. That was the assumption, that it would be U.S.-based.

of it is obviously the $60 million from the restructuring then you've got the ongoing piece that's incremental as well.
So, if you can give us a sense what that is? And then if you expect it to flow through in the year in any disproportionate
way or fairly evenly?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Well, I guess I'll take it in two pieces. One is at cost of sales where, as you know, we've had a
pretty long established target of trying to offset roughly 3% of cost pressure. And while cost pressure's going be
somewhat higher than 3% this year, we still believe that we should be able to deliver at around that level. And that will
be driven by a pipeline of activity that we've got going and annual projects. But also as we've talked about our Soup
Common Platform work to simplify the soup-making process, will contribute to that number also this year.
Within expenses, the force reduction – some of the force reduction of course, is relevant to cost of sales. But the force
reduction that we had, particularly the piece that was relevant to administrative and headquarters expense will be one of
the factors as we are really beginning to try to pursue the same thinking in the management of expenses; i.e., in the
planning period, can we offset about 3% of normalized inflation to the expense categories? And the negative headwind
there would be the incentive cost and pension expense.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got you. Okay. And then just I'm curious if you think about the logic of last year when you put
out some of those trade promotions, which as you mentioned were not particularly effective in driving volume. One
could argue there was not a lot of elasticity to the upside from some of the trade spend. Do you think the logic works
the other way around? Or not? Meaning, now that you pull back on some less effective trade that it wouldn't necessarily
be a negative to the downside?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We sure hope so. But I – we don't know. And so we've planned pretty realistically and we
will watch that dynamic very carefully.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from David Driscoll from Citigroup.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll CFA>: Thanks for the follow up. Just so I understand the cost inflation guidance. So, on
analyst date it was 3% to 3.50% and I think you gave a percentage number of 8% to 10% on today's call. And again, if
I'm doing my math right, I think you're basically giving a little bit of increase on the absolute dollar number of expected
inflation. Do I have that correct, Craig?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: So the 8% to 10% is input costs, materials and packaging. That's what we said in July and
that's still about right. That gives us a total cost inflation expectation before our enabler program of around 6% to 8%.
As I just said I think we can offset around 3% of that. So, our expectation for total inflation and cost of sales, same as it
was at the time that we talked in July, 3% to 5%.
<Q - David C. Driscoll CFA>: And that's – that would then suggest to me given the fact we've seen crop prices
rallying here since analyst day that you have most of fiscal '12 covered. Is that -
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah.
<Q - David C. Driscoll CFA>: That's a good statement?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Right. I think the way to think about the crop price decline, actually, rallying for us I guess.
Not rallying for the market. But anyway the commodity price decline has helped us de-risk that forecast a little bit. We
had at the time we were talking of course, we had some forward buying done. We've taken advantage of the decreases
to do some more forward buying. We're not completely covered for the year. But we feel like we're getting closer to

<Q - David C. Driscoll CFA>: Okay. I think, Craig, perhaps what I'm seeing differently was that the sauce had been
up since then, but petroleum and diesel has been down since then. I understand your points. Thank you.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Okay.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Okay. And we have time for one more question, Mary .
Operator
Our last question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey. Thanks for letting me sneak one more in. Just on, I didn't know if you had disclosed
earlier just how much foreign exchange contributed to your earnings EPS both for the fourth quarter and for fiscal '11?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Go ahead, Anthony?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah, for the quarter it was about $0.03 and for the year it's a nickel.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, then just one follow-up. I think I caught this at the beginning of the call, but the
restating the quarters in terms of the new segments, we're going have quarters for 2011 after you've reported – when
you report the first quarter. Is that -
<A - B. Craig Owens>: That's right. When we report the first quarter we'll give you the full year of quarters for 2011.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Right.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Okay.
