MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Devon Energy's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only
mode. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question and answer session. This call is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir,
you may begin.
Vincent W. White
Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Devon's third quarter 2011 earnings call and webcast.
Following my preliminary housekeeping and compliance items, our President and CEO John Richels is going to
provide his perspective on the quarter. Then Dave Hager, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production,
will cover the operations highlights. And following that, Jeff Agosta, our CFO, will finish up with commentary on our
financial results and positioning. We'll conclude with a Q&A period, and as usual, we'll hold the call to an hour.
Also with us today is Larry Nichols, our Executive Chairman, and other members of Devon's senior management team
for the Q&A session.
A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our home page. And during the call today, we're
going to provide guidance for key fourth quarter metrics. We will not be issuing a revised 8-K today because our
full-year estimates generally remained within the guidance ranges that we provided in the 8-K we filed in August. Any

required to provide certain related disclosures. Those disclosures are also available currently on Devon website.
With those points out of the way, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO John Richels. John?
John Richels
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone.
The third quarter of 2011 was our first full quarter following the completion of our repositioning. As the company
focused entirely on North America, Devon delivered a very solid third quarter performance.
Let me begin by highlighting some of our results. Our third quarter adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of
$1.54 per diluted share increased 18% over the year-ago quarter and exceeded the First Call mean by $0.09. Our cash
flow from continuing operations of $4.19 per diluted share increased 26% over the year-ago quarter and surpassed the
First Call mean by more than 20%. For the third quarter, we increased North American onshore production 8% over the
year-ago quarter, driven by a 17% increase in oil and natural gas liquids production. With strong growth in liquids
production and a focus on controlling costs, Devon's pre-tax cash margin increased to more than $26 per barrel
equivalent in the quarter. Also, during the third quarter, we repurchased 10.8 million shares for $697 million, remaining
on track to complete our $3.5 billion stock repurchase program by year-end. And with $6.8 billion in cash and a
net-debt-to-cap ratio of 10%, our balance sheet remains in terrific shape.
In addition to the development drilling that's driving our current production growth, we're continuing to actively
evaluate the oil and liquids potential on our 1.2 million net acres and five high-potential new-venture plays. This
includes our positions in the Tuscaloosa, the Mississippian, the Niobrara, the Ohio Utica, and the Michigan Basin. Our
40-well program across those five plays is well under way. We have drilled our first wells in each of the plays and have
additional wells in various stages of completion. While it's still early on, we've been very encouraged with our results,
as well as those from industry peers near some of our positions.
To improve the risk-reward profile of these new-venture plays, we've been conducting a data room process to bring in a
partner. We're clearly not pursuing this because we need the money. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we could
easily pursue all of these opportunities simultaneously with 100% ownership. However, we see many advantages to
bringing in an exploration partner. First, a joint venture could improve our capital efficiency, both by recovering the
costs associated with establishing the acreage positions and by providing a reduction of our capital requirements in the
future. Second, a joint venture would allow us to accelerate derisking and commercialization of these new venture
positions. And third, a joint venture could allow us the opportunity to seek exposure in more new play types with less
risk. So a joint venture presents us with the opportunity for accelerated commercialization, improved capital efficiency,
and risk mitigation.
Give than we're currently engaged in this data room process and still adding to our positions, we're not going to report
specific well results in our new-venture activities today. However, I can tell you that the indications of interest we have
seen from potential partners have been very strong.
Now, before I turn the call over to Dave, I would like to address the subject of a number of recent questions concerning
our capital outlook for next year. Although we're still in the process of finalizing our 2012 capital budget, our
philosophy remains steadfast. We remain fully committed to optimizing value by maximizing growth on a per share

basis adjusted for debt.
In order to achieve that goal, we remain keenly focused on exercising capital discipline, maximizing our full-cycle
returns, and maintaining a high degree of financial strength and flexibility. Based on this philosophy, we will not
compromise our per-share results for top line growth by funding projects with low rates of return. Instead, we will
strive to optimize the allocation of capital among our alternatives of investing in our oil and liquids-rich opportunity
base, capturing additional resource, and repurchasing our shares. Of course, the relative attractiveness of these various
options changes with movements in Devon's stock price, our borrowing costs, and our outlook for commodity prices
and industry costs.
Since we've not finalized our 2012 E&P capital budget, I cannot provide specific capital guidance. However, I will
provide some directional comments. In 2012, we expect to implement a drilling program with activity levels similar to
2011. Our focus in 2012 will be on developing the high-margin oil and liquids opportunities in our existing portfolio
and accelerating the evaluation of the many new plays that we have captured.
Our preliminary 2012 capital budget does not contemplate a repeat of the roughly $700 million of acreage acquisitions
that we are making in 2011. Therefore, in total, we expect our capital outlay in 2012 to be less than 2011.
The majority of our 2012 capital will be focused on core development projects. In Canada, we expect to begin
construction on the third 35,000-barrel-per-day phase of Jackfish in the first quarter of 2012. In the Barnett and Cana,
we will continue the aggressive development of our inventory of thousands of undrilled locations in the liquids-rich
portions. Furthermore, in 2012, we'll be expanding our gas processing plants in each of these plays to keep pace with
our growth and capture additional value.
In the Permian, we will continue investing in our reliable development plays, including the Wolfberry, the Delaware,
and the Bone Spring. And in addition to investing in these low-risk development plays, we will continue to actively
evaluate our acreage positions established through our greenfields' new ventures. These exploration plays, coupled with
the emerging plays that we're just beginning to evaluate in the Permian and in Western Canada, hold tremendous future
potential for Devon.
We strongly believe that Devon's stock creates a differentiating opportunity for investors in the E&P space. Our deep
and diverse inventory of oil and liquids-rich opportunities provides us with great flexibility in allocating capital based
on market conditions. Our superior financial strength allows us to consistently invest in our business based on our
long-term outlook, regardless of the near-term macroeconomic backdrop. We remain intently focused on optimizing
margins and continuing to position ourselves as a low-cost producer. And finally, we maintain a disciplined approach
to balancing resource development with resource capture to optimize the value of our entire portfolio. All of these
factors position Devon to deliver competitive growth in cash flow and production per share.
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. Dave?
David A. Hager
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a quick recap of 2011 capital expenditures for our
exploration and development activities.
E&P spending was $1.6 billion for the third quarter, including $250 million of undeveloped acreage acquisitions. This
brings our E&P capital through the first nine months to $4.7 billion.
We expect fourth quarter expenditures for exploration and development to be approximately $1.5 billion. While this
would take us outside our guidance range for E&P spending, it is partially offset by our midstream capital, which
should fall well below the midpoint of our guidance range. Consequently, we expect our total capital expenditures for
2011 to come in near the top end of our guidance range.
Our 2011 E&P capital program is delivering outstanding results. Our [ph] corner store (11:18) development areas,
including the Barnett, Cana, the Permian, and Jackfish, are all performing very well. We also continue to move forward

with evaluating and de-risking the upside potential in our various emerging and new-venture plays. So let's take a
closer look at some of the third quarter highlights in these areas.
Starting with our thermal oil projects in Eastern Alberta, Jackfish continues to deliver industry-leading performance.
During the third quarter, Jackfish 1 production averaged 32,000 barrels per day, net of royalties, and continued its trend
of excellent plant reliability and efficiency.
At Jackfish 2, we continue to be very pleased with the ramp-up of production. In the third quarter, our net production
averaged 4,000 barrels per day, and in October, it averaged almost 9,000 barrels per day, exceeding planned volumes.
Review of our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 is nearing completion. Pending approval, we'll begin construction
in the first quarter of next year with plant start-up targeted for late 2014. Devon operates all three Jackfish projects and
owns 100% working interest in each.
At our Pike joint venture, our 2011-2012 winter drilling and seismic program will begin later this month. We plan to
drill roughly 140 stratigraphic wells and shoot approximately 50 square miles of seismic this winter. The program will
focus on confirming the resource potential for a third 35,000-barrel-per-day project in the Pike 1 complex. This will
bring the identified resource at Pike up to roughly 900 million barrels gross, which translates to gross production
potential of over 100,000 barrels per day. Devon operates Pike and owns a 50% working interest. Ultimately, we
believe the Pike acreage can support the equivalent of four or five Jackfish-size projects. In aggregate between Jackfish
and Pike, we expect to drive our net thermal oil production to between 150,000 and 175,000 barrels per day by 2020.
Moving now to the Permian Basin, we currently have 19 operated rigs pursuing targets in numerous play types across
the basin. Our third quarter Permian oil and liquids production increased 17% over the year-ago quarter. In total, our
Permian production averaged 50,000 equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter, with 75% of that being oil and
natural gas liquids.
In our Wolfberry light oil play in the Permian, we currently have four operated rigs running as we continue the
evaluation and development of our 160,000 net acres. Our net Wolfberry production climbed to a record 9,500 barrels
of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. While we are currently developing the Wolfberry on 40-acre spacing, we
have a 20-acre infill pilot program under way. We brought our first two 20-acre Wolfberry infill wells online during the
third quarter with encouraging results. The remaining infill wells in the pilot program are currently drilling, as well as
our first horizontal well in the Wolfberry development area. The additional potential represented by 20-acre well
spacing and horizontal Wolfcamp wells in certain areas provide upside to our current inventory of more than 850 net
risked Wolfberry locations.
Moving to the Bone Springs oil play, also in the Permian, we currently have eight operated rigs running. We continue
to see outstanding results from our horizontal program on both the New Mexico and Texas sides of the play. With
average EURs ranging from 400,000 to 600,000 barrels equivalent and well costs between $5 million and $8 million,
most of these wells are generating rates of return in excess of 50% based on the current strip pricing. In the third
quarter, we completed 11 Bone Springs wells with 30-day average IP rates of 540 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Production from our Bone Springs horizontal program has increased 300% to almost 5,000 equivalent barrels per day
since the beginning of the year.
Elsewhere in the Permian, we continued to run two rigs targeted at the conventional Delaware oil formation. We drilled
seven wells and completed four of them during the third quarter. The 30-day IP rates for the completed wells averaged
nearly 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Like the Bone Springs, these wells offer outstanding returns based on strip
pricing. We have approximately 125 net risked locations remaining in the Delaware.
Also in the Permian, we increased our Wolfcamp Shale Oil position in the Midland Basin during the quarter to
approximately 92,000 net acres. We brought our first horizontal wells online during the quarter and are very pleased
with the results. Much of our acreage is located in the area where current industry activity is concentrated, and our
initial results indicate that this acreage is commercially viable. We plan to drill eight Wolfcamp shale wells this year,
with six or seven completed and online by year-end.

Moving north to the Texas Panhandle and the Granite Wash play, we continue to see solid results from our Cherokee
and Granite Wash A wells. We brought 10 operated Granite Wash wells online during the third quarter. The 30-day IP
rates from these wells averaged over 1,250 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 180 barrels of oil and 405 barrels
of natural gas liquids per day. We are also drilling our first wells in the area to test the Atoka Wash and Caldwell zones,
which provide upside to our Granite Wash position.
Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in Western Oklahoma, reconstruction of our Cana gas processing plant is
now complete. We began processing gas in late October and are currently running about 138 million cubic feet per day
through the facility. Ramp-up will continue over the next several weeks, as we expect to reach the plant's inlet capacity
of 200 million a day in December. We have also started work on a plant expansion at Cana. This will increase the
capacity of the Cana plant to 350 million a day, with liquids extraction capacity of more than 30,000 barrels per day.
The expansion allows to us keep pace with our growing Cana Woodford Shale volumes and roughly doubles our
liquids extraction capacity in Cana. We expect the increase in capacity to be operational in the fourth quarter of next
year.
On the drilling front, we ended the third quarter with 17 operated rigs running in the Cana, six rigs fewer than in the
previous quarter. We have achieved drilling efficiencies that allow us to now maintain the pace of our Cana program
with fewer rigs. Accordingly, we made the decision in third quarter to release two rigs. In addition, while awaiting the
recommissioning of our Cana plant, we elected to sublease four additional rigs to another company for the remainder of
the year. With the Cana plant coming back online, we are confident in achieving our year-end exit rate target of 275
million cubic feet equivalent per day net to Devon's interest. In spite of the planned operation – or interruption, excuse
me – our third quarter net Cana production increased 6% over the second quarter to a record 200 million cubic feet
equivalent per day, including more than 8,100 barrels per day of liquids.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale field in North Texas, we currently have 12 operated rigs running. In the third quarter, we
brought 77 Barnett wells online. We are continuing to see outstanding results from our Barnett program in the
liquids-rich portion of the play. Our net Barnett production increased to a record 1.3 Bcf equivalent per day, including
46,000 barrels per day of liquids. Upon completion of our Bridgeport plant expansion in the first quarter of 2013, we
would expect to see our net volumes climb to an all-time record of more than 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day with our
current 12-rig program.
On the exploration front, in addition to the progress that John mentioned in the new ventures plays, we continued to
evaluate the potential of our position in a number of plays emerging in our historical areas of operations. In Canada, our
exploration efforts are ongoing as we target oil and liquids-rich opportunities across our more than 4 million net acres.
In aggregate, we completed 19 exploration wells and tied 10 of them into production in the third quarter. The best
results we saw were in the Cardium. In the third quarter, we brought three Cardium oil wells online in the Ferrier Area
of Central Alberta. Average 30-day IP rates from these wells were 770 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are
currently completing two additional wells in the area.
Another encouraging result from our third quarter exploration program in Canada came from our Viking light oil play
in Saskatchewan. We completed four wells in the third quarter with 30-day IP rates of up to 70 barrels per day. These
are shallow wells, and we would anticipate costs of roughly $1 million per well in the development phase of this play.
While we're still working to optimize our drilling and completion approach, we are encouraged by these early results.
I'll remind you that we own 100% of the surface and minerals in a very large acreage position with more than 1,000
potential drilling locations.
Also in Canada, we brought two Slave Point oil wells on in the Swan Hills area with average 30-day IPs of 300 barrels
per day. We have an inventory of more than 160 undrilled Slave Point locations and plan to drill three additional wells
in the fourth quarter. Of the 10 exploration wells brought online in Canada during the quarter, nine were successful. So
while it's still very early in the process, we are excited about the results we have seen.
In summary, all of our key development projects are delivering excellent results, and we continue to take important
steps in evaluating a deep inventory of exploration opportunities across our portfolio.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?
Jeffery A. Agosta
Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone.
This morning, I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our strong third quarter financial
results. I plan to limit my comments to items that require additional commentary or were outside our forecasted
guidance range.
The first item I would like to cover is our production. In the third quarter, we produced 60.8 million oil equivalent
barrels or approximately 661,000 equivalent barrels per day. This result was just above the midpoint of the forecast we
provided on our second quarter call, and as John said, it represents an 8% increase in production over the year-ago
quarter. On the liquids side of the business, we again delivered robust growth. For the quarter, our oil and natural gas
liquids production increased by 17% over the third quarter of 2010 to an average of 226,000 barrels per day. Strong
year-over-year oil growth from the Permian Basin and Jackfish, combined with liquids growth in the Cana and Barnett,
drove this impressive performance.
Looking to the remainder of the year, we remain on track to deliver full-year production of 238 million to 240 million
equivalent barrels. When compared to our North American onshore production in 2010, this represents top line
production growth of about 7% to 8%, driven by liquids growth in the high teens. With the Cana plant starting back up,
we expect Q4 production to increase to a range of 665,000 to 675,000 BOE per day. Given our growth in oil and
natural gas liquids production and the current weakness in natural gas prices, nearly 60% of our third quarter upstream
sales revenue came from liquids. Regional oil prices remained strong during the quarter, and petrochemical demand
pushed NGL realizations higher.
Our E&P revenues were again supplemented by cash settlements from our attractively priced hedges. In total, cash
settlements increased revenues by $96 million in the third quarter and boosted our companywide price realizations by
$1.58 per BOE.
Not only were our upstream revenues strong, but our marketing and midstream operations made another strong
contribution. We generated $138 million of operating profit in the third quarter, which represents an 11% increase in
the over the third quarter of 2010. To put this into perspective, our marketing and midstream operating profit enhanced
our companywide margins by $2.27 per BOE. Based on our results for the first nine months, we expect full-year 2011
operating profit to be in the top half of our guidance range of $515 million to $545 million.
Shifting to expenses, in the third quarter, we were successful in partially mitigating the impact of industry inflation.
Expenses in most categories showed a moderate increase but were generally in line with our expectations. In aggregate,
our pre-tax cash costs totaled only $13.56 per barrel for the quarter, or about 2% higher than last quarter. This
continues to give us a very competitive cost structure within the industry. We remain well positioned as a low-cost
producer and expect to continue to generate full-cycle margins that are among the best in our peer group.
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we remain comfortable with the expense forecast provided in our August
8-K. One noteworthy item for those of you who model our results is that fourth quarter G&A expense will include
approximately $20 million of noncash expense due to the issuance of annual equity compensation. Including this
noncash expense, we expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to range between $170 million and $180 million.
Looking briefly at income taxes, for the third quarter, we reported income tax expense from continuing operations of
$498 million or 32% of pre-tax income. After backing out the impact of special items typically excluded from analysts
estimates, you get an adjusted tax rate of 35%. This is made up of a current tax rate of negative 12% and deferred taxes
of 47%. This atypical distribution of current and deferred taxes was driven by a change in our estimate for our full-year
taxable income. The cumulative impact of this change was recorded in the third quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth
quarter, we would expect our overall tax rate to range between 30% and 35% with essentially the entire amount being
deferred.

Going to the bottom line, non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations totaled $640 million or $1.54 per diluted
share. Strong liquids production and pricing, coupled with our reduced share count, drove our adjusted earnings from
continuing operations up by 18% per diluted share over the year-ago quarter. As John mentioned earlier, this result
exceeded the First Call mean by $0.09.
As most of you are aware, in May of last year, we commenced a program to repurchase $3.5 billion of our common
stock. As of today, we have repurchased $3.4 billion, and we expect to conclude the buyback program in the fourth
quarter. We have a history of buying back shares when we believe it is the best use of our capital. Since 2004, we have
repurchased 114 million shares, reducing our outstandings by approximately 20%. In conjunction with finalizing our
2012 capital plans, we will determine what role, if any, additional share repurchases will play in our 2012 capital
allocation.
I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position. In the third quarter, cash flow before balance
sheet changes totaled $1.9 billion. On a per-share basis, cash flow from continuing operations increased 26% over the
third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, we comfortably funded all of our capital demands and returned nearly $800
million to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and
short-term investments of over $6.8 billion and a net-debt-to-cap ratio of 10%.
As we have discussed in previous calls, we currently have more than $6.6 billion of cash and short-term investments
outside of the United States. If a more favorable tax situation develops for the repatriation of these funds, or if we
deploy the proceeds into Canada, we can reduce our tax expense by up to $900 million. Until we have better visibility
into these opportunities, we plan to keep this cash outside the U.S. Given our short-term borrowing rates of less than 30
basis points, it is certainly worth our time to be patient and observe how opportunities, including the repatriation
legislation, evolve. Regardless of where our cash balances reside, we clearly possess a great deal of financial strength
and flexibility.
At this point, I will turn the call back over to John.
John Richels
Thank you, Jeff.
Well, the results we're seeing in 2011 are a great example of our disciplined approach to the business. Let me just
summarize that for you again.
In the third quarter, we delivered a very strong quarter. We continued to execute on our key development plays,
delivering oil and NGL growth of 17% over the year-ago quarter. We took important steps in evaluating a number of
emerging and new-venture opportunities. We delivered another excellent performance in terms of containing costs in
an inflationary industry environment. We delivered another solid quarterly performance in our midstream business, and
we continued to maintain a pristine balance sheet. As always, we remain committed to exercising capital discipline,
maximizing margins, and optimizing growth per share.
At this point, we will open the call up to your questions. Vince?
Vincent W. White
During the Q&A session, we ask each of you to limit your questions to one initial inquiry and one follow-up. And,
operator, we're ready to take the first question.

Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your
line is open.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - John Richels>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: When we think about 2012 and your drilling program, are there any rigs drilling today where
if gas prices hold, you would look to drop? Or do you feel comfortable, based on the liquids contribution from your
current operated rig count, that the rates of return and the current pricing environment are acceptable?
<A - John Richels>: Well, Brian, as you might remember, we're spending over 90% – or allocating over 90% – of our
capital in 2011 to oil and liquids-rich opportunities. And even at today's prices, in – any of the rigs that are drilling and
the gas plays where the returns are enhanced by liquids recoveries are still providing a good rate of return. So we're not
spending any material amount today on plays that aren't providing a good rate of return.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Okay, thank you. And then when we look at some of the new-venture plays where you didn't
necessarily discuss individual well results – Duvernay, the Utica, Tuscaloosa – A, do you feel your acreage positions
are where you want it to be, or should we expect that you would expand those positions? I think you mentioned in your
opening comments not to expect the 700 million of acreage acquisitions you're planning or have made in 2011. And
then B, when you think about bringing in JV partners, is essentially your view that selling a JV interest and potentially
buying more Devon shares with that cash has a superior rate of return versus drilling over time and retaining the upside
from otherwise keeping a higher interest?
<A - John Richels>: Let me start with the latter question. And then maybe I'll turn it over to Dave to talk about our
acreage positions. But what we're doing here, Brian, with the joint venture – as you know, it's something we've not
typically done. And we wouldn't be – it doesn't make sense to us to take a development project, for example, and joint
venture it, because we have pretty low cost of capital.
But we're doing this for different reasons. We have some acreage positions that are clearly exploratory in nature, and as
we said, bringing in a partner to try to diversify some of that risk and at the same time improve our capital efficiency in
the future just seems to make a lot of sense for us. So there are a lot of reasons for us to be doing this.
The way I'd kind of look at it, you look at these five new-ventures plays, and think about when we were in the
exploration business drilling wells. It's like five couple-hundred-million-dollar or more exploratory wells, and we
would always have brought a partner in. Not for the cash flow management as much as for the risk diversification. And,
frankly, even the Exxons of the world tend to do that. So that's the rationale behind the exploring of this joint venture.
And maybe I can have Dave address the question on some of these land positions.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah. And once again, I think that whenever we have the opportunity to essentially eliminate
the upfront negative cash flow associated with acquiring the acreage, and then that gives us the opportunity to redeploy
that capital either back into drilling or share repurchase. Of course, we haven't made any decision on that. It certainly
improves the capital efficiency, and it certainly improves our ability to grow on a cash flow per debt-adjusted share
basis.
But more specifically on the acreage, we're very, very happy with the acreage position we have. We have been
conducting a data room. And as John said in his prepared comments, we've had outstanding interest from the
companies who have reviewed our acreage position. So we feel there's – not only do we like it, there's a lot of
independent confirmation from other people out there that we have a great acreage position.
Having said that, it is possible that with good results on – or, continuing good results on some of these, we may
incrementally add some acreage on some of these plays. But that's really going to be driven by the well results that we
see. That's one of the reasons we don't want to go into too much detail on what we're seeing right now, because there is

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Bob Alan Brackett>: Hi. Considering these JVs, couple questions. One is, would you consider the Cardium and
Viking in a sort of JV package? And the second is, what's changed? If we go back – we've known of these five sort of
new-venture plays now for a while now. But this is the first we've heard of a JV approach. What's changed in your
thinking?
<A - John Richels>: Well, first of all, I mean, right now, Bob, we're just talking about those five plays. Whether we
would do anything in any of our Canadian plays, I think that remains to be seen. But really, nothing has changed other
than the fact that we see a lot of opportunity in these five plays and a lot of capital commitment over time. And as I
said, to bring somebody in at an early stage in an exploratory play to help diversify that risk just seems to make some
sense to us in terms of keeping the maximum capital efficiency and pursuing a prudent investment philosophy. So
nothing's really changed, other than the fact that these all have a lot of potential and a lot of capital investment over
time.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, we're ready for the next caller.

Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Morning.
<A - John Richels>: Morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Another question on the joint venture. It seems like the topic today. But what kind of structure
can you say in general you're looking for? Are you looking for one party to work with you in all these plays, or are you
looking at potentially having different partners in different areas? So what kind of structure are we looking at from that
perspective? And then in terms of the consideration, are you looking for a carry with some cash upfront or an all carry?
Or what are your thoughts around that?
<A - John Richels>: Well, we've been open to the structure, but typically, these have been structured in a way that
there's some cash up front. The good thing about that is it allows you to recover all or the majority of your capital
investment to date, and then some kind of a carry in the future. But we're not looking at doing a whole bunch of joint
ventures with different parties. What we're really pursuing is the idea of creating a joint venture with one partner where
we clearly align the interests of our joint venture partner with the interests of the company. So as we move down the
road on some of these projects that we don't just continue to drill because we got a bunch of joint venture cash out
there, but we can move it around, make sure that we continue to allocate the capital both from our point of view and the
joint venture partner's point of view to a place where we're making some money.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then I would assume that you'd like to retain operatorship?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes, we'd like to retain operatorship.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay, okay. And then the follow-up, in the Permian Basin, what are the governors there for you
right now in terms of increasing activity from where you're at right now?

<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, I'd say the primary governor on it is the technical understanding of – and confidence of
how quickly we could ramp up. Most of these are not what I would call your classic pure resource plays where you can
just go in and carpet-bomb these things on a set acreage space. And there's a lot of science involved in these, and so it's
really to have the right level of technical knowledge on all these plays.
Additional, there is some – particularly in 2012, I would say, as a secondary concern – but there are some takeaway
capacity issues that exist in the Permian. Those are being addressed, and we don't think they're going to be long-term
issues. But in 2012, it is something that we're certainly taking into account on how many rigs we're putting in what
area. We're making sure that we can really move the production out of there.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Appreciate it. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Wilmoth with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott M. Wilmoth>: Hey, guys, when thinking about your potential JV partner, is there any defining
characteristics in terms of you're looking for someone with exploration expertise, or is it more just to derisk the
investment?
<A - John Richels>: It's always good to have some technical expertise in your partner. But what we're really looking
for as well is we recognize that entering into a joint venture like this on five plays is not something that lasts for two
years or three years or four years. It's something that lasts for the next 20 years. And so we want a partner that we also
believe will be aligned with us in our investment objectives and that we can work with over time.
<Q - Scott M. Wilmoth>: So how much interest are you guys looking at selling down in each of these plays?
<A - John Richels>: That's still really to be determined, Scott. We got this process open, and we're going to be a little
bit flexible on that. So I can't tell you that at this point.
<Q - Scott M. Wilmoth>: Okay, thanks. And in the Cardium, positive well results out of the three wells you guys
released. What are the EURs? Does that make you rethink the EURs in the play? And what does your inventory look
like in the Cardium?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we really have the Cardium in two different areas. We have some in the Ferrier Area,
and we also have [ph] Cardium (42:14) in the Deep Basin play overall. We see, if the whole thing could work, we
could have up to 1,500 gross risked locations, resource potential, somewhere – 50 million to 100 million barrels. We're
seeing EURs – it's still early on, but we're anticipating EURs somewhere in the 200,000 to 300,000 barrels equivalent
per well range.

Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Thanks. Guys, good morning. David, I've seen some stuff recently about the possibility or the
potential for a shale play in the Washakie Basin. Is this something that might be applicable to you guys' legacy
production or interest in the play?
<A - John Richels>: Once again, you have me there, Mark. We have a big position in Washakie. But we, frankly, have
not been looking significantly at a shale position in the Washakie. And if there is, we'll take a look at it. But we're
looking at a lot of places, but the Washakie is not one that's been – hit the radar screen real high for us right now.

<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay, just as a unrelated follow-up. Dave or John, can you give me some idea – I mean, I'm
assuming as part of a potential joint venture, you would be looking for a pretty good promote. Can you give me any
idea as to the scale of that promote that you might be seeking?
<A - John Richels>: No. I think it's too early on to really go into the details of the scale of the promote that we're
looking at. All we can say is we've been very encouraged by the interest from the companies that have been through the
data room.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Hi. It's going to surprise you – I'm going to ask a question about the joint venture. So if I
hear what you're saying, it sounds like, rather than drill the acreage yourself or prove it up and try to sell it at a later
date, which in theory would have more value, you're choosing to mitigate the risk by doing this up front?
And then the second part of that would be, is part of the thought process not only a strategic partner for these shales,
but somebody that perhaps you could JV with up in Canada, and a larger partner that gives you some more flexibility
down the road? Am I thinking about that right?
<A - John Richels>: Sure. I mean, we could well, if we have the right partner and have the right relationship, this
could well expand, not only to Canada, it could expand to other new plays, as well.
But – and again, David, I'll say that one of our objectives here – and this is a little bit different joint venture. Most of
the joint ventures that you've seen in the business so far have been play-specific. This is one that covers a lot of
different plays and has some unique characteristics from that point of view, because it does align both parties with
pursuing the ones that make the most sense.
We may find that some, as we develop them, we want to sell and put that money into other opportunities within that
joint venture. And we'd be very well aligned with our joint venture partner on that.
So I think there's a lot of flexibility. It's early stages in terms of what the – exactly what a deal like that would look like.
But it gives us a lot of flexibility to develop these opportunities on a fairly accelerated basis.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Okay, and if Vince will allow me an unrelated follow-up. If I think about Cana versus
Permian versus Canada, can you talk about the different rates of return, how you guys see that as far as your decision to
allocate rigs and capital?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we obviously, as a global statement, we look at our entire E&P portfolio and allocate
capital to what we think are the best return projects across our entire portfolio. So we certainly compare their rates of
return in Cana to those in the Permian and those in Canada, so we have a good understanding of – and make sure we're
putting capital in the right places.
The Cana – the returns do vary somewhat. I'd say particularly the core of Cana, where we're currently even conducting
a downspacing pilot project, a series of those – those liquids-rich returns are extremely strong. And we're still only
booked at five wells per section in the core of Cana, and we see the opportunity, if there was downspacing, we could go
to 8 to 10 wells per section. And we frankly only drilled it on one well per section right now in most areas.
So we have a lot of liquids-rich opportunities remaining in Cana. Some of the areas do get somewhat leaner, and as you
would expect, as you get leaner, then the returns diminish somewhat. But we're careful that we're concentrating our
capital in the highest-return parts of the plays that complete on a portfolio-wide basis.

<Q - David R. Tameron>: Dave, just to restate, just to make sure I have the answer right, sounds like core Cana would
be at the top, and then [ph] non-tier (47:33) Cana somewhere down below Cardium and Permian? I put some editorial
comments in there, but is that the right way to think about it?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well – there's varying degrees. I think you're looking for a simple answer, and it's – the wells
are a spectrum, I'd say, from the core being the absolute best. And as you get somewhat less condensate and natural gas
liquids, then you have a continuum down to [ph] rates. (48:03)
But again, we're funding – we make sure that we only fund those that compete competitively – or compete well – with
the Permian or the Cardium or any other opportunities in our portfolio. So -
<A - Vincent W. White>: Yeah, this is Vince -
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Great, thanks. I appreciate it. Thanks.
<A - Vincent W. White>: This is Vince. I'd add to that, too. When you try to compare a specific play to the Permian,
we've got a number of different play types in the Permian, ranging from light oil, where the – in the current
environment, the rates of return are very, very strong, to shale plays that we're just trying to de-risk and understand. So
there's a wide spectrum of returns in the Permian.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: All right.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
<A - John Richels>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So a couple of quick ones. One and one follow-up. Your liquids pace has picked up again this
quarter. As you try and pull the whole thing together, in terms of rig activity, where you're targeting capital and so on,
can you give us some kind of idea as to how you see the projection of your liquids as a proportion of your portfolio
going forwards? I guess keeping pace with the 90% plus of capital you're putting into those plays? And I've got a quick
follow-up, please.
<A - Jeffery A. Agosta>: Well, I'd say that we see in the future that we are going to continue to allocate the vast
majority of our capital – 90%-plus – to the liquids-rich plays. And so I would expect that for some timeframe, that our
liquids growth rate would be consistent with what we're achieving this year, in the upper teens. Because that's where
we're focusing our capital.
<A - John Richels>: And we talked before, Doug, about the fact that in places like the Permian, we ought to be able to
grow that in the high teens or even up to 20% for the next few years. And as we're continuing to bring additional
volumes that we talked about earlier, with our plant expansions on in places like Cana and the Barnett, we're going to
get additional liquids volumes.
And of course, Jackfish ramped up from – the Jackfish 2 – from a small number of barrels right now up to somewhere
approaching 35,000 barrels a day through next year.
So we got a lot of places that we ought to be seeing pretty strong liquids growth over the next year.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Yeah, if you just -
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Very helpful. Go ahead, sorry.
<A - Vincent W. White>: If you just look at 2011, we're growing oil and liquids production in the teens, high teens.
And we're growing gas production in the low single digits. So clearly our production mix is moving towards our

reserve mix, which is more oil and liquids as a percentage of total reserve.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: That's very helpful, Vince, thanks. My quick follow-up is really on NGL pricing. You guys, I
guess historically, have a fairly [ph] DP thin cut (51:04), and I guess I'm really trying to figure out how sustainable you
believe that the strength of NGLs is, when you take the interplay of propane exports with Brent pricing and so on. Just
some color there. And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Yeah, this is Darryl Smette. Well, what we have seen, as you probably know, is a greater
increase in activity. And that has led to a much greater increase in supply. The positive side of that is that we've seen a
substantial increase in demand, both on the export side of things, propane primarily, and some increased activity in the
manufacturing sector, including refinery.
We expect that demand will continue to increase as we go through 2012. We have a little bit of concern as we get into
the middle of 2013 that we might see supply exceed demand for a while, until some of the new petrochemical plants
come on-stream, the expansion in the greenfields.
So we think that – there could be weakness as we get to mid-2013, maybe into 2014. But past that, we see demand from
some of these new projects coming online. And so we think that we'll start seeing the value of NGLs pick up again after
we get into 2014.

Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Société Générale. Your line is open.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yeah, hi. Two quick ones. With the Bone Springs wells, what kind of decline rates are you
seeing?
<A - David A. Hager>: Oh, I don't have the exact number in front of me, John, I don't think here.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: That's okay, I'll call Vince later. Thanks, Dave.
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, in general, somewhere around 70% first year decline, I think.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay.
<A - David A. Hager>: Excuse me, 50%, 50%. Excuse me. I looked at a wrong number on my spreadsheet. 50%.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. With oil field services, are you seeing any moderation in pricing? Should we anticipate
you becoming sand miners soon? What do you see?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: This is Darryl again. Well, we really do not have any plans to be sand miners. But we
continue to see price escalation, primarily on the service side of our business. Drilling rigs and other services have
increased about 2% in the third quarter from the second quarter. Overall, we're going to probably see a 10% to 12%
increase in costs this year. We expect that we're going to see some pressure on costs, primarily in the service sector, as
we go into 2012.
The biggest areas where we've seen the biggest increase in service costs have been recently in the Permian. They
continue to grow fairly rapidly in Canada. And then the industry, I think, is seeing some pretty strong service costs in
South Texas, but Devon's not a big player in South Texas.
But they have started winding down a little bit from where we saw in the first half of the year, but they're still
increasing primarily on the stimulation side and the drilling rigs.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Thanks, Darryl. That's it for me. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Good afternoon, guys. Not going to ask a joint venture question. As I think about your '11
CapEx on the midstream side, how much of that presses into 2012, and how much of that is just absolute cost savings?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: This is Darryl again. We're probably going to see about a $300 million midstream cost in
2011. While we haven't finalized our budget for 2012, we know we're going to spend about $200 million of the roughly
$300 million on our Cana plant and our Barnett plant in 2012.
So there's not been a lot deferred, quite frankly. But while we haven't finalized our budget, we'll probably see $200
million in the two plants that I mentioned. We have about $75 million to $80 million of what I call maintaining capital
that we spend every year on compression and things of that nature.
So $305 million this year. My guess is that we're going to be north of $300 million next year; could be a little bit
stronger than that, depending on where we drill the wells, how much infrastructure is needed, whether we need CO2
removal facilities, additional compression, that type of thing.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: So the new areas like the Permian, where you've had midstream constraints, you don't see
a big ramp in spending as yet?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: No, we do not in the Permian. Devon's position in the Permian – and not unlike, quite
frankly, a lot of the other industry participants – is that most of that infrastructure is old infrastructure. And most of
Devon's acreage, with the exception of some of the new acreage that we've acquired there, has been committed long
term to other midstream parties. And so we're really dependent upon them and industry as a whole to move product out
of there.
So Devon does not see that we're going to put a lot of capital in the Permian Basin. Although we'll put in some
gathering systems. We'll put in some treating facilities. We'll put in some compression. But in terms of large capital
expenses, in terms of processing plants, or pipelines out of the area, say down to the Gulf Coast, right now, we don't see
that's a space we'll be in.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Okay. And now just thinking bigger-picture capital spending, John, as you talked about
your 2012 CapEx trending down year over year. Thinking about – and I'm not trying to link the joint venture in – but
you all are targeting capital efficiency as the primary goal [ph] and the output is debt-adjusted growth. (56:48) In any
new area, initially, the capital efficiency for leasing and science wells is generally going to be – and the returns will be
lower than in things like you just mentioned, which would be the Permian and Canada versus your new ventures.
So really, when I think about the joint venture in your overall plan, you're really just trying to focus on capital
efficiency more so than – and maybe some risk mitigation – than trying to judge or call anything about the quality of
acreage or opportunity?
<A - John Richels>: Absolutely, and in fact, we are more positive about the opportunity. And as you can imagine, the
more opportunity we have, the more that that initial investment becomes as well. And you quite rightly point out,
David, that the negative cumulative cash flow on these new projects is not insignificant, and so to the extent you can
level that out and put additional funding into some of our development projects, it really improves the rate of return and
drives more to the bottom line.

<A - Vincent W. White>: Rehan, as John said, we are always comparing the various levers that we have. That is,
spending in our E&P business to the share buybacks and trying to select the optimum mix that gives us the best growth
in cash flow and production per debt-adjusted share. So as we are moving towards finalizing our 2012 capital budget,
we'll look at the potential for additional share repurchases, look at the impact on our per-share results over time, and
make a call.
<Q - Rehan Ahmed Rashid>: Okay. Thank you.
Vincent W. White
Thank you. That ends today's call. Thank you for participating.
