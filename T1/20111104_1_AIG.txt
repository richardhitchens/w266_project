MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Please stand by, we are about to begin. Good day, and welcome to American International Group's Third Quarter
Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the
conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Elizabeth A. Werner
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation
may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to
uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or
events. Actual performance and events may differ, possibly materially, from such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our 2010 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs under Management's
Discussion and Analysis under Risk Factors. AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to

Okay, thanks, Liz. For our company, we're operating as if the Federal Reserve will be our regulator. We don't know
what will happen, but it's important we operate as if the Fed will be our regulator. As part of that we have to do stress
testing, and so we constantly look at our company what the issues are, and we said what would happen – what would
happen if the equity markets fell apart? What would happen – if significantly on the S&P. What would happen if this
spreads blew out; serious issues in the fixed income markets especially – especially mortgages. And then we said, what
would happen if currency has started to create issues for us and throw on top of that a big hurricane maybe in the
Northeast, and what would happen if you had some typhoons running around Asia.
And so that's how we did our stress test. We update it all the time, and we had the opportunity in the third quarter to see
what happens when our stress test becomes somewhat of a reality. And so there is a question about AIG, our strength,
and how we would handle that kind of perfect storm, which is what we've just come through and I can assure you that
we are in very good shape. Our liquidity now is sitting at $15.3 billion, up from the last quarter. And big concern we
have gotten during the roadshow and from many of you over time is what's going to happen to FP RemainCo – and the
assets I should say, not RemainCo – what would happen under these scenarios and clearly, our collateral calls were
basically flat. There was no issue whatsoever in terms of cash demand. So, we are in pretty good shape.
So, let's talk about the $4.8 billion of noncash losses of three items. I'm going to start with Maiden Lane III. Maiden
Lane III, we're down $1 billion, but the cash flows continue to be strong. So, this is just the anomalies of the market at
this point in time. Keep in mind we've gone from $45 billion in the beginning, the Fed balance is down to $18 billion.
It's paying down cash flows of about $5 plus billion a year for Maiden Lane III and Maiden Lane II combined. This is
Maiden Lane II and III combined in these numbers. And so we see 2014 still as a year in which AIG will begin to
receive back its $6 billion investment before we begin to split the upside with the Fed after that period of time. So,
Maiden Lane III does cause some noise in the numbers, no question, but economically we see that is continuing to be
strong.
Also AIA we took a $2.3 billion drop in the book – in the carrying value of AIA marking it to market. And keep in
mind, as it relates to AIA, the SPV that we have from the AIA Alico SPV is now down to $8.3 billion. The collateral
against the $8.3 billion is Maiden Lane III, ILFC and AIA. We also have about $1.5 billion in cash sitting in the SPV
from the sale of Alico to MetLife, and that cash again will come out of escrow over the next year, another $1 billion I
believe and then the rest of it in 2013. Leaves us $6.8 billion left on the SPV.
We are taking our time to look at that $6.8 billion, and we are deciding what is the best way to handle paying that down
such that we maximize value for the AIG shareholders. So, whether it's to sell AIA now or later, whether it's to wait for
the IPO of ILFC, if it works out in the markets in the future. And as you know, ILFC is not core. We're looking to
monetize that at the right time for the right values. So, we are going to take our time. And I guess that's the only way I
want to continually stress that time to make sure that we're maximizing value for the AIG shareholders.
When it comes to ILFC, again a $1.5 was taken as part of our normal routine to look at what's happening in the
manufacturing space. Some new announcements were made on new aircraft. That puts pressure on scrap. That puts
pressure on some of our older planes and as part of our annual review we've decided to take a charge of about $1.5
billion to deal with that issue within the legacy aircraft, which we've been talking to you about. That's a problem we
need to resolve and work on. And we know it's a drag, but I think this resolves a good part of that drag.
So, let me come to capital management real quickly. You saw we raised $2 billion in the quarter, and that's really to
make sure that our debt maturities are matching to what it is we have in terms of cash on hand. So, that deals with the –
some future payments we're going to have to make. You saw from a capital management point of view that we're going
to be buying back shares.
Let me be very clear that until we were able to do the re-IPO of the company, we could not do any share repurchase
while we had Schedule G here at the company. Being able to launch the re-IPO, to be able to terminate Schedule G and
close that out had allowed us to begin to think about how do we want to handle capital management going forward. Our
priority, and it's important that you understand our priority is to be able to work with the U.S. Treasury so that we can
continue to be buying back shares from their shares, which represents overhang on the stock. That is our priority.

On the other hand, if we see in the marketplace that there are certain anomalies with our stock, and we feel it's an
opportunity to take advantage of what the market has done then the board of directors has approved a $1 billion share
repurchase, so that in these markets if we choose to go out and buy in the open market, we're able to do that and take
advantage of where the markets are today. That doesn't change our priority. Our priority is still to begin to think about
capital management in the context of the U.S. Treasury shares, and what we can do to facilitate taking that overhang off
the table.
So, as we think about our results for the quarter, Dave is going to bring you up to date on it and I just want to make a
few comments that clearly if you look at what's happening after that $4.8 billion, Clearly we had some storms hit us in
the quarter, but Chartis is continuing to make great progress. They're continuing to focus on how we get a better return
for the risk we're taking and making sure that our combined ratios start to come down as we promised in terms of our
aspirational goals. They are making very good progress on that.
SunAmerica continues to do well. They are continuing to see our client retention strong, sales continue to be strong and
keep in mind we're down somewhat, which would expect with this low interest rate environment in our fixed annuity
business, but still strong.
UGC continues to perform well on new business. We got that under control. However, there is still going to be a little
pressure yet as we work out some of the legacy book and some of the legacy issues and foreclosures, and so on.
And last, but not least, ILFC continues to do well on an operating basis. We did deal with the write down, but they are
continuing to get pretty good releasing of the planes that we have available. So, I would rather wait for some of your
questions to rather get into any more detail, but let me turn it over to David on what the stuff – the issues are
specifically in the numbers.
David L. Herzog
Great, Bob thanks, and good morning, everyone.
Let's turn to slide seven, and we will step through the slides and make sure we have plenty of time for Q&A. Third
quarter loss as Bob said is $4.1 billion. That compares to a loss of $2.5 billion a year ago. And our operating income,
which is our principal non-GAAP measure was a loss of $3 billion for the quarter versus $114 million a year ago.
Slide eight is the highlights of what Bob really covered with the AIA share price decline, the ILFC impairments, the
spread widening and the – some lower interest rates; the lower LIBOR rate drove some of the loss on ML3 and
obviously, cat losses. So, we will move past that; I think Bob covered that.
On slide nine is the ILFC impairment highlight. And again, we conduct this review annually. We typically do that in
the third quarter and much like we did in the fourth quarter we – we were – management's judgments were informed by
current market events, so the – as a result of the review we determined that 95 aircraft were impaired from an
accounting standpoint, and we took a non-cash charge of $1.5 billion. So, again the – there were a number of economic
events, aircraft technology announcements, idiosyncratic counterparty issues and other announcements that informed
our judgment.
Turning to slide 10 for our consolidated performance, Chartis reported pre-tax operating income of $442 million
affected by cat losses of a little over $570 million in large part due from Hurricane Irene, which totaled a little over
$370 million for the quarter, as well as Tropical Storm Lee, and typhoons in Japan. Interestingly that compares to
unusually low level of cats a year ago, which was about $72 million.
Turning to SunAmerica, which posted $444 million of operating income for the third quarter. The results include the
$43 million mark-to-model, mark-to-fair value for our Maiden Lane II investment again due largely to spread widening
and the underlying non-agency RMBS securities. The third quarter of 2010 actually had income from Maiden Lane II
of $156 million. So, you can see the dramatic swing that that had. So – and also, due to the decline in equity markets
we increased our provision for guaranteed minimum death benefits in our variable annuity business, and we had higher

DAC amortization as a result, thereof as well. So, together they were a little over $180 million for the quarter. The
equity market performance in the third quarter of 2010 was actually quite strong, and as a result, we had positive effects
on operating income of about $100 million from our variable annuity business last year, so again, fairly dramatic
swings.
As Bob mentioned United Guaranty, our mortgage guaranty business, reported an operating loss of $96 million versus
a loss of $124 million same quarter a year ago. Overall financial results for United Guaranty were unfavorably affected
by continued weakness in the U.S. housing market, as well as sustained high unemployment rates. Increased
delinquencies and the severity of loss cost on some of the older vintages was only partially offset by rescissions. In
addition this third quarter, overturns of previously declined or rescinded claims continued at a somewhat elevated rate.
Our Other reporting unit reported a loss of $1.5 billion versus income of a little over $400 million a year ago due in
large part to the mark-to-modeled loss of roughly $1 billion on Maiden Lane III, and also, to a much lesser extent, the
wind-down of the AIG FP portfolio. Again, cash flows on Maiden Lane III remain quite strong.
Global markets or Global Capital Markets had a loss of $174 million primarily from credit valuation losses, or what we
call CVA, on counterparty derivative balances and interest rate hedges. The super senior credit derivative portfolio
withstood wider credit spreads and was flat essentially for the quarter.
At the end of the third quarter, we had about $26 billion worth of notional in the CDS portfolio, of which $20 billion is
– doesn't require active trading management. The remaining multi-sector book is down to about $5.7 billion in notional,
for which we hold a GAAP liability of roughly $3.1 billion, most of which we've already posted collateral against. We
continue to believe that the actual settlements under these contracts will be less than the GAAP liability and the
collateral postings we have, thus giving rise to intrinsic gains. Also during the third quarter, AIG and counterparty
spreads widened substantially and those have requisite effects on the mark-to-market, mark-to-model instruments we
have in the derivative portfolio.
Our direct investment book had earnings of $119 million, the increase in that from a year ago was driven by net
increases in the value of the formerly AIG FP asset book. And finally, we've talked about the AIA mark-to-market,
which has already recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter thus far.
Turning to page 11, which shows our after-tax operating income reconciliation, the only comment I'd make is with
respect to taxes; we apply a pro forma tax rate to our operating income or operating loss for the quarter. We show the
benefit in operating in this case the benefit and the operating loss, and we've essentially reversed that out for the
reconciliation to GAAP net income.
On page 12 is our capital structure. Our leverage is currently in the low end of our longer term range, and we still
assume a 20% to 25% debt to total capital in our aspirational goals, and we continue to actively manage our capital
structure and cost of capital. Most recently, we issued debt to refinance some of our matched investment program
notes, and we launched an exchange offer for a portion of our hybrid securities.
Turning to page 14 for a word or two on Chartis. The financial results of Chartis are now reported in accordance with
the recent reorganization in the global commercial and global consumer businesses. Progress continues to be made
toward improving our risk-adjusted profitability and changing the mix of our business. Some highlights are as follows:
net premiums were up about just shy of 1% from a year ago, and excluding the impact of foreign exchange and
restructured loss sensitive programs, and exiting selected workers' compensation business, net premiums were flat for
the quarter. Adverse prior-year development was a benign $55 million after considering-related additional loss
sensitive premiums. We review a portion of the reserves each quarter throughout the year, and importantly, the accident
year loss ratio was 68.4 versus 67.7 in the second quarter and 68.5 a year ago. The expense ratio was 30.8%, up from
28.2% a year ago. Last year's quarter included the benefits of negative VOBA amortization related to the acquisition of
Fuji Fire & Marine. Fuji DAC amortization this year is higher from new deferrals since the time of acquisition.
Excluding the FX and the DAC expenses was – the ratio was up about 1%.
Chartis premiums are on page 15. Chartis continues to execute on its strategy to grow higher margin, less
capital-intensive business and implementing corrective actions on underperforming business lines. Excluding FX,

consumer insurance premiums were down about 1% driven by personal lines, which was a management action to deal
with a certain unprofitable warranty program. We see the results of our focus on the growth in higher margins lines.
Turning to commercial insurance premiums, excluding FX we're down about 2% driven by again a focus on capital
management and continued discipline in certain challenging markets. I think it's important to note that in the U.S.
commercial line we're seeing rate increase overall of about 4.1% on renewal business with rate increases led by over
8% in our property line. The trend is accelerating from prior periods. Our international business is now about 50% of
our net premiums, and that's up from about 45% a year ago.
Chartis investment results are on slide 16. Net investment income for Chartis was $1 billion in 2011, basically flat from
a year ago. Chartis continued to reduce its muni bond portfolio, which is now 27% of its invested assets, and that's
down from over 35% a year ago.
Turning to SunAmerica on page 18, SunAmerica's operating income was $444 million for the quarter versus $1 billion
a year ago. The decline in operating income reflects much of the market volatility that we've talked about with respect
to ML II, some partnership investments, as well as the higher guaranty minimum death benefits, DAC amortization in
our VA business. Premium deposits and other considerations totaled $5.7 billion for the quarter. That's up nearly 30%
over a year ago. Net flows were positive for the third quarter – third consecutive quarter at just shy of $550 million.
And it's interesting to note that year-to-date it's positive $2.1 billion year-to-date versus negative $1.6 billion a year ago
year-to-date.
SunAmerica's business remains diverse, strong, good momentum in sales, deposits and good strong customer retention.
Previous deposits, other considerations are on page 19 and I commented on PDOC overall. Life sales I would comment
were up 14% driven by strong retail life sales.
Let's turn to slide 20 for SunAmerica's investment income. Net investment income was $2.3 billion down a little over
$350 million from a year ago. As I mentioned ML II affected this quarter by negative $43 million due mainly to the
spread widening. Partnership income was muted this quarter due to the private equity and hedge fund investments,
which I would remind everybody are reported on a one quarter lag. There was also a $97 million impairment on equity
method investments interests and trusts that hold leased commercial aircraft. The same factors that gave rise to the
ILFC impairment affected these aircraft as well.
Excluding ML II in partnership and impairments the investment income was essentially flat. Importantly we've
redeployed the excess cash we had coming into the year. And you can see that in our base yields that are set forth in the
financial supplement.
Page 21 has some information about the SunAmerica spreads. Base spreads excluding the impact of partnerships and
other enhancements increased again as we've redeployed the excess cash from the beginning of the year. Looking
ahead, if we continue to take capital gains to realize the economic value of our substantial capital loss carry-forwards,
again I would just remind everybody that the spreads themselves, the reported spreads could come under some
pressure.
Now for a few words on our income taxes on page 23. As more fully described in our third quarter 10-Q, we apply a
framework for establishing the valuation allowance. Among other factors AIG has emerged from its recent cumulative
loss and now we need to demonstrate a level of sustained profitability. At the end of the second quarter, we described
that framework for evaluating the reversal of a substantial portion of that valuation allowance as early as the fourth
quarter of this year. If the framework is met, the valuation allowance for our net operating loss carry-forward, the
non-life capital loss carry-forward and the foreign tax credits could be released again as early as the fourth quarter. If
the framework isn't met, obviously the release would be delayed. Realized capital gain – realized capital loss, I'm sorry,
carry-forward remains more challenging to us as we've talked about in the past, and that portion of valuation allowance
will be released as the carry-forwards are realized.
We still expect an effective tax rate of roughly 25% to 30% for the rest of the year on our operating income driven by
our substantial investment in tax free muni bonds. From time-to-time other discrete items will affect that rate as well.

Just a couple of other comments then before we turn it over to Q&A, a word or two about the new accounting standard
on DAC, which is going to be adopted January 1st of 2012. We will adopt a standard and there are specific categories
of acquisition costs that are no longer deferrable under the new standard, and if we adopt the standard retrospectively
this will be – this will reduce our DAC balance by approximately one-thirds, so that's about $4.5 billion to $5 billion,
and it'll reduce our GAAP shareholders equity by about 3%, but it will have no effect at all on our statutory surplus.
Also during the quarter the parent company received dividends, distribution and other intercompany payments from the
operating companies of about $1.6 billion bringing the year-to-date total to $2.5 billion. That's consistent with our
capital management goals and aspirations, and so that remains on track. Again, looking ahead we would expect some
continued choppiness in the equity markets with respect to partnership incomes. We will in fact, have some losses on
the Thailand floods, but we're not prepared to quantify that at this time.
Lastly, we remain committed to our long-term aspirational goals that we set forth in our first quarter 10-Q. Bob now
back to you.
Robert H. Benmosche
Okay. Liz?
Elizabeth A. Werner
Yeah, at this time, operator, we'd like to open the call up for any questions.
Q&A
Operator
Yes, thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Thank you. A couple of questions, I guess first on the share repurchase. You mentioned the
priority is to buy back from the Treasury. It seems that there is a situation where they don't want to sell below a certain
price. Is it possible they might sell to you below that price versus selling to the public, or should we just assume that
until the price gets up 27, 28, that you won't be buying back from them?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I can't speak for the U.S. Treasury. I can only say that if they want to sell it to us below
that price, we'd be happy to buy it, But I think they have their view of what the company is, and what the company will
be. Their goal and our goal is to make sure that the American taxpayer gets back all their money plus a profit, and that's
their goal as well. So, I think that's clearly up to them.
There is no – the advantage you have – people say, gee with the U.S. Treasury isn't that a problem? And as far as we're
concerned they have allowed us to run the company the way we need to run the company. They are a very effective
shareholder for us. And their goal is to sell where they can get a profit for the American taxpayer. They are not trying
to time the market. They just wanted to make sure that they get out with a profit and time is not of the essence for the
U.S. Treasury. They just want to achieve that goal. So, I think if they chose to sell less than that, they could, but that's
not what their interest is.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Ed Spehar is here too, he is going to ask a question.
<Q - Edward A. Spehar>: Thanks. Just a couple quick ones. Could you give us some sense of what you think the free
cash flow is for both Chartis and SunAmerica, a kind of normalized sort of basis? And then just a couple of questions
on top line, the VALIC deposits were very strong this quarter and you mentioned rollovers. Is that a – is that something

that is sustainable? And if so why? And then on the Western National, was the weakness in sales because others didn't
lower crediting rates as fast as you did or is it just that you're not interested in putting out a lot of fixed business when
rates are at such very low levels considering the risk of shock lapses if rates start to go up?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Okay, I'll have David start and then I think when it comes to VALIC in terms of the
ongoing rollover programs, so it's not a one-time thing, but Jay can talk about the ongoing rollover program they've
been successful at, and also, the pricing strategy within Western that deals with making sure that we have the right
combination of commissions and price, and that's really up to the bank, and how they want to deal with that in this low
rate environment. So, I'll let Jay handle those two, but David, why don't you start?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Ed. The – I would first start by saying we are reaffirming the capital flow
in our long-term aspirational goal. So, while the markets are somewhat volatile, again we're – our expectations are that
those dividend flows and capital flows from the operating companies to the holding company, we would reaffirm those
expectations.
We had in the quarter about $1.6 billion overall of flows and again, the flows come in a number of different shapes and
sizes in terms of outright dividends. We have some surplus notes between the holding company and some of the
operating companies in SunAmerica, and so we are paying interest plus principal on that. We've got the tax payments,
so while we are not going to quantify a "free cash flow" I would just say that our risk-based capital levels remain very
strong and the earnings of the operating companies continue to be strong and therefore, the dividend flows are in line
with our previously discussed expectations, Again, we got about $1.6 billion this quarter and again, that's – it'll bounce
around a little bit, but that gives you – it won't be – you can't take that and annualize it. But, again I would point you
back to our longer-term aspirational goals that we set out.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Jay, you want to pick up the other two?
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: Yes. Good morning. On the VALIC question Ed, we did a very strong quarter on the
individual rollovers, I think that will continue; the exact numbers and such obviously can't predict. I think the reasons
for that are probably threefold. We've had an increased emphasis on focusing on rollover sales for some time, in our
recruitment of financial advisors, in our focus on doing more financial plans for prospective customers. Secondly, we
have rolled out a series of new products more focused on that market. It's something we call PD Advantage, which is
for people rolling over from our core Portfolio Director product at the end of their service. We've added a new
contemporary guaranteed living benefit rider called Income Lock Plus that's available for non-flowing customers. And,
then finally, we also rolled out a new variable annuity for the rollover market we call Equity Director. Those have all
been picking up momentum and share starting this quarter.
And, then the last thing I would say is, in addition to our core VALIC field of financial advisors we do have a growing
independent distribution organization that is licensed with VALIC and a large part of their sales have been focused on
the rollover market. So, I think that you'll see continued progress here, and it continues to be a point of emphasis in
VALIC.
In Western, the reasons for the decline sequentially in fixed annuity sales – and I think we still had an increase
year-over-year – kind of three different reasons there. First on the positive front, we are now back in Wells Fargo,
which had historically been our largest distributor, That just came online in June. We're also back in SunTrust; that just
came online in August. So, we continue to get reinstatements, and we'll be building back our presence in those
organizations in the quarters to come.
But in the last quarter, with the absolute level of interest rates declining, that was a meaningful contributor to our
reduction in sales sequentially. We did see a few new competitors come in to our market. We've seen that over the
years, that's fine, didn't want to compete in a couple of cases. The fact is we've got I think something like 21 proprietary
arrangements now going through our banks where we are trading off crediting rate to the customer for lower
commissions. So, we feel like we are very well-positioned.
And the last thing I'd say is that in the last quarter, the second quarter, we hit our highest market share of the fixed
annuities through banks that we had ever hit, I think north of 40% is reported by [ph] CARA (32:42) or LIMRA and

I'm expecting this quarter we will be back in what is our more typical market share, which is not what we target, but
just where we end up, probably somewhere between 25% and 30% of the market and still far and away the largest. So,
those would be three reasons for the sequential change in Western National and our fixed annuities sales through banks.
<Q - Edward A. Spehar>: Jay, just one quick follow-up. Do you worry at all even if you are getting your spread today
– do you worry at all about the risk of writing business with rates this low and kind of shock lapses if rates start to go
up at some point?
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: We do worry about that. We worry about it in all environments and our – the major
mitigant there is very careful matching of our assets and liabilities. Our pricing is very disciplined; our guaranteed
minimum rates are now down to 1% on all products, have been for some time. The yield curve is still reasonably steep,
so we're still able to price and get reasonable spreads, but the main thing will be the continued matching of our asset
and liability durations, not only initially at purchase, but monitoring that very closely on a regular basis. But yes, we
worry about that in the sense that we've got to constantly match those durations.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: And keep in mind that what you have here and the way they have designed the product,
in many cases, there's been trade-off of commission to rate. And so when you look at disintermediation it is what you
got left that you haven't amortized. If you have left to amortize then the shock lapse aren't as onerous as you might have
on more traditional fixed annuity commission product. So, it's a – there's a lot of contributing factors to make this –
we're watching it and Jay is watching it very carefully, but it's not as bad as you might think, if you think just normal
fixed annuities.
<Q - Edward A. Spehar>: Thank you.

Okay, and next we will hear from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar CFA>: Good morning. I had a few questions, the first one for Bob. You mentioned that you
would be open – or you would preferred to buy stock back from the Treasury, but also would consider buying, and if –
in the open market if the Treasury doesn't want to. So, maybe if you could give us some sense of the timing of
completion of your share repurchase plan.
Second, you mentioned that ILFC was non-core, wondering if you can share with us what your thoughts are, as it
relates to AIA?
And then finally, for Peter on – in the P&C business just talk a little bit more about pricing; you mentioned commercial
property lines getting a little bit better, but maybe more details on the causality side and personal lines. And related to
that, frequency severity trends at Chartis, obviously results were affected by high cat losses this quarter, but if you look
at the combined ratio ex-cats and development, it still went up from third quarter last year, from the second quarter this
year. So, what you're seeing there and your comfort level with your long-term combined ratio targets?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Let me start with the timing of the buyback. We're going to, we've got the authorization
and the team will take a look at what the opportunities are, and we'll begin to do what we think makes the most sense
based on where the markets are. I don't have a goal to say we're going to be done in a month, two months, or three
months. We're just going to be prudent and see what makes the most sense. I don't want to give you that answer, but
we'll know when it's over.
As far as ILFC not being core, but what about AIA; AIA is – gives us the third interest in Asia and the question
becomes looking at the value of that position over time, and where the markets are, and what the opportunity we would
have, if were to monetize that and sell it, the question is what would we do with the cash. And obviously, you'd say
well, how about buying back AIG shares? We would look at that as one of the capital management opportunities. There
could be others. But whatever we do do, we'd take a look at what the market says that property is worth, and what else
we could with the money that would give us the better return over time, and that's, it's just a consideration we have to

make as we go forward. Right now, we're going to stand pat from what we see, but that doesn't mean that won't change
over time. And so, I would then turn it over to – I think that covered my piece of it, so I want to turn it over to Peter and
go through that Peter, if you will.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yeah. So, Jimmy in terms of pricing, I think we are seeing some hardening, as David already
mentioned, both in the property and in the casualty space. He mentioned specifically overall in the U.S. over 4%
year-on-year rate increase. And this is a trend that really started for us as early as the first quarter of this year, and it's
just a progression of year-on-year rate increase since then. So, I think that we're leading the industry by about a quarter
in terms of rate. And on the property side – on the casualty side, our workers' comp year-on-year in the quarter is up
about 6.3%, and again, that's a trend that actually was initiated earlier then the property, and really as early as early
middle of last year. So, we feel good about the pricing trends and – on the U.S. side.
On the international and on the consumer lines, the news really is Japan, which is the vast bulk of our consumer
business, and the fact that since the beginning of this year we got a relief from the regulatory block on incremental rate
increases that have been existence for three years until January this year. And it was not just us, it was across the whole
industry. And so each quarter, we've seen incremental pricing improvement in Japan, which we expect to continue and
has been matched with increased flows as well. So, we feel good about trends in Japan, although they're obviously
somewhat distorted by events in the first quarter and – both in terms of losses from the tsunami and the earthquake, but
also the disruption to new business flows in the second quarter. But rate and demand in Japan is looking good.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar CFA>: And just your views on your margins?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Sorry, yes. Your point on the combined, as we laid out in the roadshow, last year's combined
on an accident year basis was 103.6. We set out a target to get that number to 90 to 95 by 2015. That's a roughly 2 point
improvement per annum, and if you look at the projection for this year on a normalized basis, normalizing out the
extraordinary cats, we are right on track for that 2 point per annum improvement in accident year combined, So we're
feeling very good about our long-term aspirational plans on improving the combined.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar CFA>: Okay and lastly, does the loss in the third quarter hurt your ability to reduce the
valuation allowance against the DTA, or could you still do it if the earnings bounce back in the fourth quarter?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Jimmy, it's David. The – we had – you point to what happened in the third quarter, it's a
factor, but there is still a very real possibility that if we – that we can hit our framework, and that we can still release
the allowance in the fourth quarter. Again, that will be determined by the performance of the company, One of the
critical factors was the falling away of the three-year cumulative loss; that's done. And we'll just evaluate the specs and
circumstances in the fourth quarter, particularly as they relate or solely as they relate to the U.S. member taxable
income for the U.S. member company, so again, I think there is still a very real possibility of that happening in the
fourth quarter.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar CFA>: Thank you.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: But it's very complex. There's a lot of judgment, and we want to make sure that
everybody who oversees these kinds of activities as regulating entities all understand what they are. It's not simply
saying well, it looks like we're going to be profitable in future, let's just do it. There's a lot of rules and regulations
around how this works and a lot of complexity and a lot of judgment and so, it's not quite so simple to generalize what
it means. And we're going through all of those steps very carefully to make sure that what we do is – we're not in a
hurry. We just want to make sure when we do it, we want to make sure it's right, and it's got to be very clearly right and
something that's very great.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar CFA>: And obviously, what you do on the balance sheet doesn't affect the economics of how
you use it, right?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: That's correct.

We will now hear from Thomas Gallagher with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Good morning. I guess the first one is just for Bob or David, in terms of the little bit less
than $7 billion that's owed on the SPV, is there a fuse on that meaning would you have to make a decision to monetize
either AIA, ILFC, or come up with the cash in another way by a certain point in time?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: One, the fuse is you got to make sure you do what's right for the shareholders and there
is one shareholder that has 77% of the stock, and they want to make sure we maximize their value. So, that's the fuse. If
for example, we were pushed to pay it down, we've already developed a strategy and plan of what we would do, if we
chose not to sell any of the assets that are collateralized right now so we could free up the collateral. So, at this stage of
the game, our primary shareholder has said, look, maximize our value, that's what we want, and make sure that we can
sell as soon as possible, and so that's the only constraint we have.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Got it. Okay, and then can you talk a little bit – I guess this would be for David. Can
you talk a bit about your overall capital position today? I see you have north of $15 billion of liquidity resources at the
holding company, but can you talk a bit about, aside from the stakes in AIA and ILFC, which I realize are, at least I
think about them as residual asset values that could be monetized into capital. But, as it relates to capital levels at the
insurance companies, is there any excess – and I guess the other side question I had for that is the $11.6 billion of cash
and short-term at the holding company. There was a footnote in your Q that said $8.7 billion in reverse repos is used to
reduce unsecured exposures. I'm just not sure what that means, if you could elaborate. Thanks.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Sure, I'll cover a parts of it and I'll ask Brian Schreiber, our Treasurer, to comment on your
last part there with respect to the reverse repos and the strategy behind that, and that the use of those.
How we think about the capital management, you're right, we grew our cash and short-term and financial resource at
the holding company to just north of $15 billion in the quarter. Again, we renewed the bank facility, had a terrific stable
of banks participating. We were very pleased with that participation. We also announced that we've put in place an
additional contingent capital facility, again, building up contingent capital and contingent resources in order to, again,
allow us the greatest degree of financial flexibility.
I think we've talked quite a bit about historically the capital maintenance agreements that we put in place with all of our
operating companies. Those agreements, I would say, continue to operate as designed, that the capital flows are coming
to the holding company in accordance with what our expectations were with those capital levels. We don't report – or
haven't reported yet the RBC levels of the companies, but suffice it to say, our domestic life retirement savings
companies remain very strong and in line with where they were at year-end, which was upwards of 500% RBC. The
capital maintenance agreement levels were in the 350% range and I would expect Chartis likewise, to be at or above its
capital maintenance agreement threshold.
So, again, the underlying capital positions of our operating companies remains very strong. Again, I won't quantify a
"excess" capital, but you get a feel for that where we are there. Brian, do you want to comment on the short-term
investments and the use of the reverse repos?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Sure. A key component of our capital and liquidity plan has been to reduce contingent
liquidity risk at AIG. And as you know, AIG in the past had issued debt in foreign currencies and swapped that debt
back to dollars. That exposed us to contingent liquidity risk from a strengthening dollar. We have net assets, or we're
long capital, in many of the currencies in which we have issued the debt. So, we've been able to unwind the swaps,
eliminate the contingent liquidity risk and effectively invest short-term in those currencies to defease that debt. So, we
are economically hedged, and we have eliminated the contingent liquidity risk. We have chosen to go in reverse repos
because it offers the best sort of risk-adjusted returns for the company from a short-term investment standpoint, so I
hope that address your question.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: It does. Just a follow-up Brian. So, should I be thinking about $8.7 billion still available,
fully utilizable by your hold co or is there some level of – are those funds encumbered in some way shape or form. I

just want to understand how to think about? I hear the technical explanation, but I just want to know practically
speaking are those funds there for you or there is some level of – that those are encumbered?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: The cash at parent is not encumbered; it is a fungible asset that can be utilized how the
parent company sees fit.

We will now hear from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Yeah, good morning, everyone. I wanted to just follow up a little bit on the CDS book. Back
at the time of the roadshow the maximum capital call was about $1.6 billion, I realized mark-to-markets are not capital
calls, but you have had $1.6 billion in marks over the past two quarters. I'm wondering if your outlook has changed on
that at all in terms of the maximum capital call you could have from that book at this time?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: No, in fact, the – we continue to wind down the portfolio and reduce our exposure to
contingent liquidity and as you saw, we've further reduced the impact of a downgrade to AIG, our ATE risk is gone
down and every quarter that contingent liquidity risk is being brought down. So, So, I hope that – we don't disclose a
specific number for the overall contingent liquidity risk, but again, it remains on trajectory downward.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: And -
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Yeah, go ahead Bob.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Just let me make the comment, just keep in mind that we have at the holding company a
lot more latitude in focusing on economic value instead of just mark to the market and the consequences to capital
ratios, and so on. So, we feel pretty confident that while you're looking at various market anomalies that we're focusing
on the economic value when this stuff comes due, so I think that's what you'll see that we're not worried. It's a matter of
what do we think is intrinsic, and when we're going to achieve intrinsic.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Brian, I think maybe also comment the effects of what happened in the quarter with respect to
capital calls and the like and on the wind down book.
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Yeah. Essentially, as Bob mentioned earlier with the volatility we've seen in rates, spreads,
equity markets, and FX, we've had effectively zero postings in the quarter. And again, it's a result of actions that we've
taken over the last year plus again to reduce our exposure be it by terminating trades, by intermediating trades and I just
described on the last question about again taking off swaps where we are effectively economically hedged.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: And then on the upside you made this comment back at the roadshow that you can't predict
the future, but you though there was probably $1.2 billion in upside from that book. And, now we would get $1.6
billion, or down. So, does that mean you still think there is $2.8 billion, or has the current to market changed your
outlook for the value of the upside associated with that?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: No, we believe the intrinsic value of those assets remains, and we still believe there is a
significant amount of upside consistent with what we've articulated earlier.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: The trouble is nobody will sell us this stuff at this price
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Yeah
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: I understand.
<A - David L. Herzog>: That's right, that's why we're all sitting and waiting, and we can afford to wait.

We'll now go to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks. I'm just trying to square a couple of things, so rates were up 4% on average it
sounded like U.S. commercial, but premiums were down 8%. Obviously, you had some actions you took that impacted
premiums, but excluding those actions can you help us understand what happened to exposures there?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yeah, this is Peter speaking. To look at the top line first thing you will do is strip our foreign
exchange, and that's about a 4.2% adjustment so if you look at the top line adjusted for foreign exchange it's down
3.5%. The biggest driver of that reduction, which was about 3.4% was caused by us changing the policy form of certain
policies in the U.S. along the lines that David alluded to, the loss sensitive business is just simply rebooked in a way
that reduces the top line, has zero impact on the bottom line, it's actually slightly positive because it reduces the
premium tax. But it's really a dramatic effect on the use of statutory capital, and one example of where our focus on
risk-adjusted return and capital efficiency is motivating our behavior as opposed to targeting top line per se.
That being said, we're absolutely committed to a strategy of profitable growth. And so, we are shifting the mix of
business to activities that have long-term sustainable growth. And so, in our roadshow we talked about top-line growth
expectations of 3% to 6% over the five-year period. We still expect that, but in any given quarter you'll see some
top-line reductions as a result of exiting certain areas. One other area was the excess workers' comp, which contributed
about 0.3% of the reduction of the top-line, and that's something, which we've talked about before as a business that we
have exited completely.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: All right. Now, I guess I'm just focusing specifically on U.S. commercial where premiums
were down 8%. So, U.S. commercial only so I imagine there shouldn't be a lot of FX in there. And you had said – I
think Bob had said in prepared or maybe David said in the comments up front that rates were up 4% in U.S.
commercial. So, I'm just trying to understand just U.S. commercial, what happened and I get that it's about $300
million from the change in form that you had mentioned, but I'm just trying to understand what's happening to
exposures in the U.S., are they down to relative to rate, and that's why premiums looked to be about flat, that's what I'm
trying to get to.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: So, first of all, I was talking about aggregate total top-line commercial consumer and global.
As you know, roughly 50% of our business is international and roughly 60% of it is commercial. So, secondly, I've
made it very clear in all of our discussions that we are seeking to grow international faster than domestic and to grow
consumer faster than commercial. So, the math works out that we are shrinking U.S. commercial where we feel we're
not getting adequately rewarded and so, the reductions there are quite substantial in order to get that net number on a
global basis, so that's as far as I'd go to comment on that.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay and can you talk about – again U.S. commercial – can you talk about pricing versus
loss trend or how pricing is tracking to your expectations at the beginning of the year? Can you talk about that?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I'll ask John Doyle to comment on that.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Hey Michael, it's John.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Hey John.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: I would add to Peter – to the response to your last question that we continue to reduce our
exposure in the U.S. to cat property, to work comp, Peter mentioned excess comp, but also to primary guaranty cost
comp and to excess causality. Rates continue to trend more favorably. They are slightly ahead of what our expectations
were in the beginning of the year. We did increase our loss picks for some U.S. commercial lines at the beginning of
the year. That accounts for some of the year-over-year change in the loss ratio, but obviously we had planned for that
when we went on the road in the second quarter. So, the pricing trends are bit ahead of what we expected and I would
add that September pricing was better than August and August was better than July. So, while we still have some work

to do to get where we want to go, trends continue to move in the right direction.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: And any difference between large case and small case and maybe if you could touch a little
bit on professional lines, in particular, D&O and kind of what you're seeing there? Thanks.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Yeah, our rates in professional liability were down about a half a point in the third quarter.
That's better than where we were in the first and second quarter. The business there continues to run off very well, so
we're certainly confident in our portfolio there and have certainly read about lots of other markets talking about the
competition there. I would say that we're primarily a lead writer in the market and I think it can get a bit more
competitive as you move up above the lead layer, so we continue to be confident where we headed it there.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I want Rob (sic) [Michael] to just clarify something. Did you mention that you thought that
our commercial was down 8%?
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Well, if I'm looking U.S. commercials suggest so in your supplement, you break out
commercial lines by geography. So, I was looking at – I guess it's 3.8 to 3.5 roughly in net written premiums from 3Q
'10 to 3Q '11. So, I think that's about 8%. And as I understand about $300 million of that maybe – a decent chunk of
that is the rate actions we took in the third quarter or the -
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: But I guess
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: That's principally explained by what I talk about the loss sensitive business that we have
changed the policy form of.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Right, but still if rates are up 4% even if premiums are flat I would mean I guess that
exposures are down 4%? I mean, is that how we should thinking about it?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Exposures are down in comp in excess casualty and in property, and they are down more than
4% in that area, and we've written less new business year-over-year quarter-to-quarter because new business pricing
isn't as attractive as we'd like it to be.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. Thank you, that helps a lot. Thanks.
Robert H. Benmosche
We're – unfortunately we're out of time, and so to those you we didn't able to get to I apologize for that. But give us a
call, and we'll do what we can answer your questions.
I want to close on a very important statement, and that is fact that we have come to this point, we have shown the
strength and our resilience in this organization going forward, and, as it relates to AIA I want to repeat again because I
know there's been a lot of speculation and sometimes people say I'm not clear so I'm working on my clarity skills. The
lock-up has allowed us to sell the shares, but our timing and our decisions have nothing to do with the lock-up; it has to
do with making sure we do the right think for the shareholders of AIG and at the right time.
And so on that note I thank you all and look forward to hearing from you all next quarter.
