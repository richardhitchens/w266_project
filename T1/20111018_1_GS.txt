Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?
David A. Viniar
Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our third quarter results and then
take your questions.
Net revenues in the third quarter were $3.6 billion. Net earnings were negative $393 million and earnings per diluted
share were negative $0.84. The third quarter continued to be dominated by concerns surrounding the weakened state of
the global economy. The market was particularly focused on sovereign risk within the Euro zone, specifically the risk
of contagion from smaller GDP countries like Greece to larger GDP countries.
Market participants are also focused on how heightened sovereign risk will impact the banking system within the Euro
zone and beyond. The uncertainty surrounding the potential policy responses to these complex issues have amplified
the level of concern among market participants. The price performance within European markets was a strong indicator
of fears, with the EURO STOXX 50 down 23% during the third quarter. As would be expected, the Euro zone concerns
heightened worries regarding the implications of these challenges on economic prospects in the U.S.
Similar to Europe, equity and debt markets reflected increased fears about the U.S. economic outlook. The S&P 500
declined 14% and the VIX increased to highest level in more than two years. Ultimately, economic concerns within
Europe and the U.S. permeated investor sentiment within growth markets, as demonstrated by Hang Seng, Bavesta and
Shanghai Composite boasting quarterly declines of 21%, 16% and 15%, respectively.
Faced with a challenging global economic outlook, CEO confidence and investor sentiment remains under pressure.
Whether it was a volatile and unpredictable market that made new equity issuances very difficult to execute or our asset
management clients having much less conviction on investment decisions, the broader environment served as a
significant headwind to clients moving forward with their business objectives.
As we've said in the past, the firm's opportunity set begins with the clients' decision to transact, a decision which has
historically been correlated to a growing economic environment. A growing economy is also correlated to increasing
asset values and positive revenues from our investing and lending activities. Not surprisingly, the macro challenges in
the quarter drove lower levels of client activity in investment banking and certain FICC businesses and a significant
decline in asset values within our Investing & Lending portfolio, resulting in a third quarter loss.
Despite the negative revenues in our Investing & Lending business this quarter, we have a strong track record as an
investor and are positioned to the product of long-term investment decisions. We entered into these positions with a
focus on meeting our clients' needs for financing, supporting key strategic relationships and generating long-term
returns for our clients and shareholders. The firm also has a full understanding of the fair-value implications of these
investment decisions and our third quarter results reflect falling asset prices and are unrealized.
Given the significance and complexity of the economic issues facing governments and regulators, we are, of course,
cautious about the near-term outlook for our business. And while we are clearly disappointed about our third quarter
results, we remain optimistic about the medium and long-term outlook for Goldman Sachs. Our global clients continue
to place significant value on our services, whether acting as a merger advisor or as a financial intermediary. We will
continue to focus on serving our clients' needs and managing shareholders' capital prudently, a commitment which we
believe essential to our long-term value proposition.
I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced third quarter net revenues of $781 million, down
46% from second quarter results. Third quarter Advisory revenues were $523 million, down 18% from the second
quarter, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown of completed M&A transactions. We advised on a number of significant
transactions that closed during the third quarter, including Petrohawk Energy Corp's $15.1 billion sale to BHP Billiton,
Phadia AB's $3.5 billion sale to Thermo Fisher Scientific and GE Energy's $3.2 billion acquisition of Converteam
Group.

We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including Nalco
Holdings $8.1 billion merger with Ecolab, ING's 2.7 billion euro sale of its Latin American insurance and pension
operations to GRUPOSURA and Drogasil's $1.2 billion merger with Raia.
Third quarter Underwriting net revenues were $258 million, down 68% sequentially, as the more challenging market
backdrop significantly reduced new issuance activities. Equity underwriting revenues of $90 million were down 76%
from the second quarter, reflecting lower volumes in a volatile and declining equity market. Debt underwriting
revenues decreased 61% to $168 million, reflecting sharply lower leverage finance activity and more muted investment
grade issuance.
During the third quarter, we participated in noteworthy underwriting transactions, including ANZ Banking Group's
$1.4 billion convertible preferred offering, Carlyle Group's $1 billion sale of a portion of its equity stake in China
Pacific Insurance Company and Intel's $5 billion debt offering.
Our franchise remains strong, as demonstrated by year-to-date Global League Table standings, where we rank first in
announced M&A, equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs. Our Investment Banking backlog
increased compared to the end of the second quarter of 2011.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and Equities Client Execution, Commissions and
Fees and Security Services, net revenues of $4.1 billion were up 16% from the second quarter, as activity levels
improved in certain businesses despite the continued difficult operating environment. FICC Client Execution net
revenues were $1.7 billion in the third quarter, up 8% from the second quarter. Our rates business increased
sequentially as client flows improved in the midst of higher central bank activity and a more volatile interest rate
environment. Commodities improved relative to a difficult second quarter, as elevated volatility and macro uncertainty
drove higher levels of business across all of our client segments.
Foreign Exchange revenues were down sequentially, as volatility in certain markets proved difficult to navigate. Credit
continued to be challenging, as a lack of new issuance, wider spreads and customer risk aversion created a difficult
backdrop for hedging in inventory management. Our mortgages results reflected significantly lower levels of client
activity and the negative impact of asset price declines, particularly in CMBS.
In Equities, which includes Equities Client Execution, Commissions and Fees and Security Services, net revenues for
the third quarter were $2.3 billion, up 22% sequentially. Equities Client Execution revenues were up 45% to $903
million, due to increased client activity in certain equity businesses and effective risk management of customer-driven
positions in the more volatile environment. Commissions and Fees were $1 billion, up 18% from the second quarter on
higher market volumes. Security Services net revenues of $409 million were down 5% from the seasonally stronger
second quarter.
Turning to risk, average daily value at risk in the third quarter was $102 million, largely flat relative to the second
quarter. Our quarter-end VaR was higher than the average, largely due to significantly greater volatility in interest rate
products.
Now I will review Investing & Lending, which produced negative revenues of $2.5 billion in the third quarter. The
firm's investing and lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including Debt Securities and Loans and
Equity Securities, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through
funds, as well as lending activities. With the equity market indices such as the MSCI down 17%, ICBC down 35% and
the high yield CDX Index wider by more than 350 basis points, our longer-term investments posted significant
mark-to-market losses for the third quarter. Our investment in ICBC produced a greater than $1 billion loss. Other
equity investments generated a $1 billion loss across our portfolio fund and direct investments. Losses from debt
securities and loans were $907 million, primarily driven by wider spreads across our portfolio. Other revenues of $477
million consist primarily of operating revenues from our consolidated investment entities.
In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, down modestly from second quarter
results. Management and other fees were 3% lower sequentially at $1 billion.

During the third quarter, assets under management decreased $23 billion to $821 billion, largely due to market
depreciation in equities.
Turning to expenses, compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year
equity awards and other items such as payroll tax and benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenue ratio of
44% for the third quarter of 2011, a ratio consistent with the compensation accrual in the first half of 2011.
Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.7 billion, 11% higher than the second quarter, primarily due to
higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees as a result of greater equity client volumes and approximately $100
million for the UK bank levies.
Total staff at the end of the third quarter was approximately 34,200, down 4% from the end of the second quarter.
Our effective tax rate was 30.3% year-to-date. Given the significant uncertainty regarding the prospects for the
macroeconomic environment, there is an understandable focus on the strength and stability of financial institutions.
We, like many other U.S. financial institutions, took the lessons from 2008 to meaningfully improve our risk profile.
We significantly reduced risk exposures while materially increasing our capital base, resulting in lower leverage and
improved risk-adjusted capitalization. Our strong capital levels have also positioned the firm to prudently manage our
capitalization in the current environment, with the firm repurchasing 18.1 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion
during the third quarter. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any financial institution and, given the challenged economic
activity, our liquidity levels remain near historic highs.
We've also continued to take a prudent approach to our European region exposures. At the end of the third quarter, our
gross funded credit exposure to all sovereigns, financial institutions and corporates in Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece
and Spain was $4.2 billion, which only includes the benefit of cash and U.S. Treasury collateral. Our exposure net of
hedges was $2.5 billion.
Over the past two quarters, the operating environment has been dominated by macroeconomic concerns, which have
translated into generally muted client activity and significant asset value declines in the third quarter. In the near term,
several concerns need to be addressed to improve market sentiment and drive higher client activity levels across our
franchise. While we are confident that the environment will eventually improve, timing is uncertain. We're prepared to
stand by our clients and will continue to address their challenges, while providing best-in-class service. Ultimately, our
ability to adjust and effectively respond to our clients' needs will drive long-term returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today and I'm now happy to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: At some of your competitors, we've seen some fairly chunky debt value adjustments for
structured products. I know in the past, you've always had a policy of hedging these out, but sometimes there has been
something of an impact and I was hoping maybe you could tell us what it was? And if you have continued your
hedging policy, maybe you can just remind us about what you do?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Sure. And as you know, Guy, we do try and hedge that exposure as best we can and it was a
more significant number than usual this quarter. It was still pretty modest. The total amount was $450 million, roughly.
And roughly $300 million of that was in FICC and roughly $150 million in equities.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And maybe, David, you could just remind us of what you do to try to keep those numbers
from being the kind of outside numbers that we've seen elsewhere?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Well, we try as best we can to have close to offsetting positions against the -- against our own
credit spreads. Not in our own name because we can't do that, but in whatever names we can.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So you use a basket of some sort of a peer group?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yes.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: I wanted to follow-up with a Volcker question, if I might? Obviously, there is a draft out. It
has more questions than answers. And so it's early days, but I was wondering if you could give us some thoughts on
any changes in your operating model and compliance regime that you're thinking about at this point given what you
have seen?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yeah. You kind of started off by saying most of what I was going to say, which is, it is early
days. The proposed rule, as you said, leaves more questions than answers. In fact, as we add it up, when you add all the
questions, there are over 1,000 questions that need to be answered. We continue to work through it and work
constructively with regulators. We haven't changed anything at this point because, as you said, more questions than
answers. We don't know where it's going to come out.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And in terms of your interpretation of what you did see in the context of your Investing &
Lending business, do you anticipate material restrictions there, or --
<A - David A. Viniar>: As far as we can see, as you know, we've already shut down our walled-off proprietary
business, so that's gone. We think that any investment in funds will be limited to 3%. And other than that, more
questions than answers.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. I have a final question on Basel III and your Basel III basis Tier 1 common
target that you've alluded to in the past of getting to around 11%. Obviously, you have deployed a fair amount of
capital through share buy-backs, which you talked about. It seems like GDP growth, as you also alluded to, is weak.
And in the medium term, that seems to dampen earnings prospects. Are you still targeting an 11% Tier 1 common
target Basel III basis given all of that?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Guy, let me just clarify. I don't think we ever said we were targeting 11% Basel III capital
ratio. I think what we said was best calculation we could do right now looking out, using consensus earnings estimates,
passive – no active mitigation, just letting things roll off at the end of 2012, our best calculation was that we would be
at close to 11%. That was not our target. In fact, I think that's higher than what our target would probably be. I think if
we did that same calculation today, which of course is not necessarily a meaningful calculation, because most of these
requirements aren't in effect in 2012, the number would be closer to 10%, given largely, as you said, GDP down and
earnings estimates down. But we'd still have round numbers, best we can tell, with all the caveats, it would be roughly
10% at the end of 2012.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Thanks very much for the update, appreciate it.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome.

<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good morning. I guess the question's on equity and risk-weighted assets. In the past, you've
showed us that about $32 billion across investing and lending over the counter derivs and mortgage trading and
securities and trading. And the question was, is how, I guess, with some of the regs changing and then just also just the
real weak environment, how quickly does some of that equity in risk weighted assets get freed up? Is there a cyclical
component to it or is most of that given to us for illustrative purposes of if something changes in the regulation then
that's how much can get freed up?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Oh, it was the latter, Guy – I'm sorry, Glenn. It was the latter, Glenn. It was – we were just
doing the calculation of if that whole segment went away, how much capital would be freed up. It was not a calculation
of what was going to be freed up when. It was just so much talk that the whole segment would go away. So just let
people know if you really think the whole segment's going to go away, here's how much capital is going to be freed up.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Understood. On Investing & Lending specifically, you'd mentioned obviously that these -- the
losses in the quarter are all unrealized. The -- I'm assuming that the private pieces might have had bigger marks because
they passed some threshold. So I wonder if you can provide a little color on that. And then the flipside is, knock wood,
it's early, but so far, MSCI's up 6%, ICBC's up 12%. Did the same 10% rules apply after the recent markings or do we
have to wait for the new Q?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Well, couple things. First of all, I would say that there were – as you said, it was all unrealized
as far as the losses. In fact, there were very modest realized gains on some things that we sold, which actually offset it.
As far as the 10% numbers go, there will be slightly lower because the base will be lower because we lost money last
quarter in this. And so the overall amount is lower, so it's 10% off a lower base but the calculation is going to be the
same.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. That's cool. And then last one I guess, just to try to dig a little further on Volcker and I
know we don't want to go too far. But I'll give you my interpretation. You tell me if I'm crazy. In the current form the
way it's written, the specific part in market making that talks about having a very limited amount to be able -- of
revenue to be made from price movements of the underlying security and they want it all to be fees, commissions and
bid-ask. In my view, that's just not workable in the current market structure and that would actually be very disruptive.
Is that top of your list of questions to ask and things to go through during this comment period?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It's very hard to pick one out that would be top of the list, but I mean, some of the issues we
see are – and you've kind of a little bit alluded to this, as did Guy before you, at least as it's now written with lots – I'll
give you all the caveats, lots of questions, there is tremendous operational burden and cost of compliance for the entire
industry. Some or all of that would need to get passed through. It could result in diminished liquidity. That would hurt
our clients and the markets and we're also focused on the competitiveness in the U.S. financial institutions. So I mean,
those are some of the questions at the top of our mind but, as we said, there's 1,000 questions in there.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Right. Looking forward to the white paper. Thanks.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hi. Good morning. Let's see, I guess one question just in the VaR components. Is the
-- I noticed that the diversification benefit was lower this quarter. Is that a function of higher correlation across asset
classes? Or that your business mix has shifted a lot more into rates, which and actually went up and if you were more
concentrated there, you'd get less diversification?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think you hit it more on your first part. There is a much higher correlation between asset
classes. And look, I want to emphasize one thing since you raised it. As I mentioned in the call, VaR was higher at the
end of the quarter. As you know, volatility – VaR is a combination of position size and volatility. Volatility was up

dramatically as we went through the quarter. I would expect, assuming we made no changes to positions at all, that our
VaR would be fairly significantly higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And then I guess maybe just tacking on that, I mean, what have you seen here
in the last couple of weeks? It seems like there's been some decline in volatility, some decline in correlation, especially
across individual stocks. You see that bringing any increased risk appetite?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think it's too soon.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Yeah.
<A - David A. Viniar>: We had a – you think of what we've gone through in a little over two weeks. First two days of
the quarter or actually the first day and three-quarters were horrendous from a market point of view.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Right.
<A - David A. Viniar>: [ph] Not P&L, but from a market (23:37). Then things got a little better, were mixed; last
week, big market rally; yesterday, big market decline. So I think there's still a lot of uncertainty and a lot of it is based
on who says what on what day.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And then in Investing & Lending, can you just remind us a bit on the debt
securities? However you can talk about a composition of investments? Is this mostly distressed debt, structured? What's
in this mostly?
<A - David A. Viniar>: The main things it's really a combination of Mezz loans, you know we have a fairly large
Mezz fund, and senior debt. So it's really those – those are the two biggest components would be senior debt and
Mezzanine debt. There's also some distressed loans in there, but the biggest components would be Mezz and senior
loans.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And last question just on Basel – is Basel III. The mitigation component of
that, have you, as you've gone through this, have you found additional ways to mitigate? And also, how much is – of
the roll forward is predicated on monetizing investments in Investment & Lending?
<A - David A. Viniar>: The answer to the – let me do the last question because that's the easiest. It's none.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar>: And look, we continue to work through the Basel III numbers. We're really at the early stages
of doing it because, as you know, these rules don't take affect for several years.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Right.
<A - David A. Viniar>: So we're focused much more on running the business today but we do have groups of people
that are kind of beginning to look through of how we can mitigate some of the Basel III impacts.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Michael Carrier>: One more question on the Investing & Lending. So if we look at the balance in that business,
and granted, it's a quarter late, it's going to be lower, but I think it was around $50 billion. So if we think of the mix of
the products that are in there, so Mezzanine lending, you mentioned the senior debt, private equity, are you still
expecting something like a 10% return in that business, given the capital requirements? And so if we just translate that
out of the $50 billion, still we've got $5 billion number over the long run? Obviously, private equity returns have been
stronger than that over time. But just trying to get a sense of where you think the returns in that business still can be in
this environment?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Boy, that -- it is a very hard question. I think over the long run, we'd be disappointed with a
10% return in that business. Obviously, as you said, in any quarter, it can be extremely volatile and up or down a lot
more than that. But over the long run, we'd be disappointed with a 10% return. Our history has been a lot better than a
10% return.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Okay. And then just based on the current capital levels you know what you're seeing here in
this environment in maintaining certain ratios, the buybacks ramped up. Just in terms of outlook what you have
approval for, any way to gauge that going forward in this environment?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look it's the toughest question. We have approvals to do what we feel we might want to do in
this environment. When we sit here today, it's a very stressed environment, which causes us to want to conserve capital,
but we look at our stock price and we're pretty convinced that looking back we're going to wish we bought back a
whole lot of shares at this price. And so we're just going through it as the quarter goes and we'll decide what we think is
prudent as we go forward. And there's no magic answer to it. It's going be judgment calls as we go through the quarter.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Okay. And then just on Europe, you gave the updated exposures. I guess when you think
about your counterparty risk, when you think about the ways that you manage that risk, requiring collateral, marking it
daily, hourly, going to those clients to get collateral if you need it, just trying to understand how – when you're in that
stressed environment, and this is more the industry, but how do you manage those risks when you can see what your
exposure is to one counterparty but it's very difficult to see what their exposures are to other counterparties?
<A - David A. Viniar>: That risk management does not start when you enter a stressed environment. It starts as you
enter into transactions. And we have credit limits and we look forward and the collateral that we're getting tends to be
under agreements that were put in place when transactions were first entered into. Very difficult when the environment
gets stressed to go to a client and say, we've changed our mind, now we want collateral from you. So this is really part
of our ongoing risk management. We make judgments about how much exposure we should take to individual
counterparties but also to industries, to regions, to countries, et cetera. We set limits on those basis and we require
collateral on those basis.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Okay. And just last one on the expense initiative. Any update there, maybe on timing and just
given the outlook, whether it's from a macroeconomic outlook or regulatory pressures and more so I would say on
timing just in terms of where you guys are at in terms of achieving those synergies?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We are working through them. We expect to be done by the end of the year.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome.

<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Just back on Europe, I was hoping to dig deeper on the opportunity set as you all see it. If we
rewound to the '08, '09 crisis, the firm benefited from outsized share gains in sales and trading but then the distressed
opportunity really never came to the forefront. So I guess when you compare and contrast Europe now to what we all
went through in the U.S., how are the environments and the opportunities similar or different as you see it?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think it depends on what ultimately comes out of the powers that be in Europe. There's a
chance that we might have an opportunity to help some of our clients raise capital. But we don't know what's really
going to come out. There's a chance that we might be able to help them sell assets or possibly buy some of the assets.
You said it didn't really materialize in the U.S. There were some. It hasn't really materialized in Europe. But we may
see some. So I think those are some of the opportunities that might happen. But I think probably the biggest opportunity
for us is, is if they reach some resolution which gives the markets comfort on how things are going in Europe, that you
just see a higher confidence level around the markets and then more activity in general, which would be best for us.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Right. And I know, to that point, client activity is weak, but have you seen any benefit from
excess spreads or a pullback in risk capital from competitors in the region?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I did not, not really because there's just not enough activity for it.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Great. And then we saw a lot of volatility during the quarter in CDS spreads for
financial services firms, just outside of DVA, CVA, just can you remind us on what CDS spreads actually mean to you
operationally and were there any meaningful changes in client behavior, either positive or negative, worth noting?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Well, the answer is, other than we hate watching them widen, they don't really mean very
much to us. They didn't really affect our funding. There wasn't a meaningful change in client behavior, where in some
ways, confused and disappointed when we see them where they are, given all the numbers I've talked about, given how
strong our capital is, our liquidity is, the maturity of our funding, the balance sheet. We kind of scratch our heads a little
bit. But it really hasn't affected anything other than our emotions. We don't like seeing it but it hasn't had a big effect.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay, makes sense. And then finally, you noted equities was helped by the volatility. And
we can see that VaR, equity-specific VaR, went down. Just it may be helpful, could you just differentiate between why
volatility is a tailwind in the quarter like this versus maybe working adversely in a quarter like the second quarter of
last year? And has anything meaningful changed in your equities business as you see it when you compare and contrast
those two environments?
<A - David A. Viniar>: No. The second quarter of last year was really, as I think we talked about then, really just
specific positions that we got. Clients wanted to be in something. We took the other side and couldn't get out of it. It
was really just a specific issue with specific positions, as opposed to this quarter, where there was just volumes and
equities were pretty high and it was one in the business where there was more activity and volatility led to more activity
and that was beneficial to us.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: A couple questions, one on VaR just as a follow-up. You indicated that end of period was

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So the rest of them are pretty much in line with where the averages are?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yeah. That would be my expectation. But remember, we're two weeks in.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure.
<A - David A. Viniar>: So a lot could change as the quarter goes on.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure. Okay. And then, can you just remind us why you're not able to hedge on the I&L
segment?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Well, look, it's a very difficult question. A lot of that is our investment in our funds. That is a
business where our clients basically want to belong equities and we're investing alongside of our clients.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So you could hedge if you wanted to? There's no prescription keeping you from hedging?
<A - David A. Viniar>: There are some places we can and some places that we couldn't. So for example, we're free to
do what we want with ICBC, at this point. It's completely free. Some of the equities we could hedge but the decision's
been made not to in that segment.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. All right, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Yes, hi, a few questions. The first one is, and you discussed it briefly, the issue of CDS and
your CDS widening. At the same time, you're buying back stock. So how should I read this? What is the fixed income
market telling you that you obviously don't think is an issue? Just trying to understand what is the difference from your
perspective buying back stock and the CDS widening?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Kian, I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand the relationship.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: So the funding market is incrementally getting more concerned or more negative in respect
to the spreads. That's what the spreads are telling us of Goldman. At the same time, you are very confident about your
capital position and buying back stock. So what I'm trying to do is square the two movements?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Right. Look, that's, as I answered before, it's one of the reasons why in a way I'm a little
confused because the CDS spreads don't seem to make sense to us, given how strong our capital position and liquidity
position are. We made a decision as the quarter went on that our capital position and liquidity position are strong
enough that we could use roughly $2 billion of both our capital and liquidity to buy back stock, given where our stock
price was.
And as I mentioned, as we think about this quarter, it's a decision that we're thinking about, where it is a stressed
environment, so our natural tendency is to preserve cash and liquidity, even though we have a lot of both. And yet, we
look at our stock price being where it is. We think it's extremely low and that it would be beneficial to our shareholders
to be buying back stock at this price. So as I said, there's no formula for it, but it's a decision we make as the quarter
goes on.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And if you look at the cash funding market against the CDS spreads that you're seeing, how
do they differ?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Again, you're asking – it's a very good question. CDS is a much more volatile market than
cash. So what we've seen is less day-to-day movement in cash than in CDS. But directionally, cash spreads have
widened like CDS have widened. Maybe not the same – maybe not on any day the same amount and not nearly with
the volatility that CDS has moved, both widening and tightening, but certainly directionally, our cash spreads have

widened as well but on very, very little activity.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And then I compare your funding in – as I see on the screen relative to some of your
money-centered peers, which seems to be much lower. You are implying earlier in the question that it doesn't really
seem to make a difference to your business. Is that correct and is it also correct to assume that because you're not
writing any long-dated business, should there be long-dated business, it would make an impact?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It's had minimal impact on our business, so far.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And would it be different if there would be long-dated business?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We do some long-dated business and it might affect us versus some competitors who might
have lower spreads, but we also compete on execution, as well, and our execution tends to be pretty good.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Last question is on counterparty risk. Have you changed the way you look at counterparty
risk because clearly, there is some concern about certain counterparties in the market? And hence, one would assume
that counterparty has been constrained to certain parties or to certain segments geographically?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We haven't really changed the way we look at counterparty risk. We, of course, always
evaluate our counterparties based on what's going on and decide where we do and don't want to take exposures. I've
mentioned many times in the past that vis-à-vis most financial institutions without regard to a view on credit, we do so
much business back and forth with the other major financial institutions that we all tend to have margin agreements
with each other to make sure that credit exposures to other financial institutions never get very large. We have it with
our counterparties. Our counterparties have it with us. So we're always making credit judgments as we go on but the
way we do that hasn't changed.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay. And lastly, prime brokerage. How do you see balance movements at the moment or
last quarter?
<A - David A. Viniar>: They've been relatively stable over the quarter. We've had some ins and some outs, but
relatively stable.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Morning.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Two quick questions, one is, given the widening of your cash spreads, which I realize has
not been quite as volatile as your CDS spreads, and your desire to maintain liquidity, have you thought about
repurchasing some of the debt that trades currently in the market?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Again, a very good question. It is something that we think about. Given our focus on liquidity,
it's not something that we do very often. We make an active mark in our debt. If people want to sell some, we buy it.
Then we tend to sell it out. But it is something that we consider from time to time, but not in a very big way, given our
focus on liquidity.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. Just shifting the question a little bit and I'm sorry if you went through this. I
jumped on the call a couple of minutes late. Just curious about revenue trends across the geographies and if you can
sort of splitting out some of the trading issues, was there – were there particular – was there particular weakness in
Europe and relative strength in Asia or is that over-thinking the concept?

<A - David A. Viniar>: I think from the trading business, I think that is over-thinking it. I think we pretty much saw
similar trends, not exactly the same, but similar trends really around the world. Obviously, our overall revenues in Asia
were down a lot, given the $1 billion loss in ICBC. But from a trading point of view, I would say the trends were
relatively similar around the world.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. So what is the constraint for share repurchases? What's your authorization from the Fed?
You're trading below tangible book value. You say you want to buy stock. How much can you buy?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We haven't disclosed the authorization from the Feds.

<A - David A. Viniar>: Blackout period ends tomorrow.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Ends tomorrow?

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And when did it start?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It started towards the -
<A - Dane E. Holmes>: Middle of --
<A - David A. Viniar>: Middle – towards the middle of August.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Why so early did it start?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Middle of September.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar>: I had a moment of going back to being a November year-end, for a second. I apologize.
Middle of September.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Why not the – didn't it used to be the end of September or is that for you or for everybody?
<A - David A. Viniar>: No. We black out from about two weeks before the end of the quarter until our earnings
release. So it's about a five-week – five-ish week blackout period.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Is there anything else you can do to, I mean, sell off something and buy back stock you have?
Based on solely your comment, you think it's a good investment, probably a better investment than some other things. I
mean, why not just downsize even more, free up capital and use that to buy back stock? I mean, how do you think
about that trade-off?
<A - David A. Viniar>: The trade-off is what we think the business opportunities are going be. And while we're a little
cautious right now, we're not so negative on our business that we want to sell off a lot of things and shut it down. So
we're still going to run our business. We're still going to trade with our customers. We're still going to have a balance
sheet and have inventory. But we are, as I said before, thinking about the trade-offs between being in a stressed
environment and having a stock price that, as you said, below tangible book and a fair amount below tangible book.

And when we -- I know that someday we're going to look back and wish we had bought back more at this price.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: The CDS has widened along with everybody else. And you say it's wrong based on your
analysis of it.
<A - David A. Viniar>: I said it was confusing. I didn't say it was wrong.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar>: I don't believe markets are wrong. I think it's confusing.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Well, what can you do to help narrow that CDS spread?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I don't think we can do anything to narrow the spread any more than we can do anything to
change our stock price. The markets trade as the markets trade. We try and make sure people understand what the
extent of our liquidity and our capital and the conservatism of our risk management, et cetera. And we know that over
time, our spreads will follow that. In the short term there'll be a lot of volatility. There will be times of market stress
and we think it may not at times reflect the quality of the firm. But we're convinced that over time, it does.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, your pace of investing in Asia and emerging markets, emerging markets have
pulled back a bit. Have you had any change in your pace of investment?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Modestly, but not very much. We still think that the biggest medium to long-term
opportunities are going to be in some of those growth markets and while, just like everything else, as the world slows,
we might moderate the pace a little bit, but we're still going be investing in those businesses.

Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hi.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Just two questions. Good morning. On the non-compensation costs, I know you gave some
commentary stripping out brokerage $100 million, but there still seems to be some growth to me. And there seems to be
a rather large other expenses number, even if I take out the levy. I don't know if you could comment on that. And my
second question was on the fact your heads has gone down a bit more than your original plan, I think, that you gave in
Q2, maybe you could you talk more about staff numbers?
And the third issue is I know you've talked a lot about the CDS and funding, but just wondering about the elevated
senior debt cost if I look at some of your issues out there? And how you feel about any rollover you've got coming off
any maturities? And whether that means you just won't replace them at the current level or how should we think about
your senior funding? Thanks.
<A - David A. Viniar>: I'll try and remember. I think I wrote them down. So I think I have all three questions. So if I
don't, then remind me. As far as other expenses, three things make up probably close to two-thirds of the difference.
One is the UK bank levy. A second is, is as you know, and we announced, we bought the rest of Goldman Sachs
Australia, which we've had in our partnership, used to be called JBWere, now Goldman Sachs Australia. So that now
became consolidated. And the third was the increase in our litigation reserves, which was not a big number, but when
you look at the year-over-year change. If you add those three things, it's about two-thirds of the change and then
assorted other things that make up the difference.

As far as head count goes, so heads are down about 1,300 from the second quarter to the third quarter. We, as again you
know, we sold our servicing platform, Litton, and we consolidated the rest of Goldman Sachs Australia, as I mentioned.
The net of that was a decrease of about 800 heads. So the decrease, excluding those two things, was about 500 and that
is part of the expense initiatives that we talked about.
And the third thing on our debt, again, that's something that we're just going to consider as the quarter goes on. We'll
see what the opportunities are. We'll look at how much cash we have, how much funding, what our spreads are and
we'll make decisions at the time about whether we want to replace maturing debt. We don't have that much debt
maturing over the course of the quarter, and we'll decide as the quarter goes on whether we want to replace it or we
want to wait for a better time.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Could you remind us how much you've got maturing before the end of the year?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think the plain vanilla debt maturing through the end of the quarter, I think, is around $5
billion. If it's very different, we'll come back to you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So just one quick follow-up, I don't
mean to beat a dead horse here on the buybacks, but if we -- should we assume after the end of the year that it's likely
you'll exhaust the share repurchase? So at least looking back we can know what the authorization was from the Fed?
<A - David A. Viniar>: The authorization we have from the Fed is for the year. So it will expire at the end of this year.
Then we'll work with the Fed for authorization for next year. It's not a certainty we'll use all of it. So you'll know that
whatever we bought back was within our Fed authorization, but it won't necessarily tell you that was all of it.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Fair enough. And on that next discussion, there were some questions raised around the
timing of the scheduled stress test and the fact that results won't come out until 1Q's nearly over. Has there been any
change or any movement as a result of maybe some back and forth with the regulators there?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We continue to discuss that with the Feds and I think we'll reach a resolution soon.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then last one, given how the year is shaping up to be pretty weak and
expectations are low around year-end compensation across the Street, how should we think about a catch-up accrual for
comp in 4Q?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We'll see as the year unfolds. I think that right now we're accruing as best we can, but, as you
said, the year is not shaping up as strong as some of the others. And again, as you know, it tends to be in lower revenue
years, the percentage comp tends to be higher but we'll see as the -- as we do our comp at the end of the year and we'll
adjust it accordingly, if need be.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Fair enough. Thanks.
