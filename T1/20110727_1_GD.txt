MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2011 General Dynamics earnings conference call.
My name is Carris and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants' lines are in listen-only mode.
Later we will conduct a Question and Answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn call over to your host for today, Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please proceed.
Amy Gilliland
Thank you Carris and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter conference call. As
always, any forward- looking statements made today represent our best estimate regarding the company's outlook.
These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained
in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson
Thank you, Amy. Good morning everyone. General Dynamics performed well in the second quarter delivering $7.9
billion in sales and $949 million in operating earnings. Sales and earnings improved from last quarter with Combat

Systems volume leading the top line growth. Excellent performance across our three defense groups in the quarter
drove 12% company operating margins. Earnings per share totaled $1.79 on a fully diluted basis, $0.11 ahead of last
year's second quarter and $0.15 ahead of last quarter.
Second quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $658 million, nearly 100% of earnings from continuing
operations. Year-to-date free cash flow is $924 million, well ahead of last year. I expect this robust cash performance to
continue in the second half.
Regarding capital deployment, we took advantage of our healthy balance sheet and market conditions to repurchase
11.1 million shares of GD common stock this quarter. Through the first half, our EPS growth has been enhanced by the
repurchase of 14.2 million shares.
Subsequent to the quarter, we also took advantage of favorable market conditions to issue $1.5 billion in new debt. This
issuance increased the average maturity of our debt, reduced our average coupon rate, covered $750 million of notes
that matured two weeks ago and provides additional flexibility for future capital deployment.
Orders this quarter were nearly $7.5 billion, $300 million more than last year's second quarter due to particularly strong
demand for our Aerospace products and services. Defense bookings were more modest than anticipated, because of
slower than expected award activity following the delayed passage of the 2011 defense spending bill in late April. With
that said, I anticipate healthier order activity across our defense segments in the second half.
At the end of the quarter, funded backlog was $44.3 billion, up $400 million from the first quarter while total backlog
stood at $57.1 billion. Total estimated contract value which includes opportunities to provide products and services
under IDIQ contracts and options was $78.3 billion.
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups. First, let's talk about Combat Systems. Combat
Systems' sales and earnings improved this quarter when compared with last quarter and the second quarter of last year.
Sales totaled $2.1 billion reflecting growing international vehicle volume, particularly foreign military sales of
light-armored vehicles and somewhat lower U.S. vehicle and engineering volume.
Earnings were $299 million, resulting in 14.1% operating margins. This healthy operating margin reflects excellent
performance across the group's portfolio of mature production programs. In addition, the group's profitability has been
enhanced by ongoing continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives, aiming at ensuring that we remain
a competitive high quality provider in a tightening market.
These efforts were illustrated by several actions taken in the quarter, such as the decision to relocate our European
defense business headquarters to Spain by year end, and the consolidation and resizing of our guns and weapons
businesses to align with anticipated demand. We also continued our focus on core businesses by divesting the
successful but non-core detection business.
Combat Systems backlog totaled $10.8 billion at quarter end. Orders in some of Combat's businesses were somewhat
lighter than anticipated this quarter, in part due to the impact of a sluggish contracting environment on our ordinance
and weapons systems businesses. Notable orders that were received included approximately $286 million for Hydra
rockets, $124 million for MRAP upgrades and $62 million for Stryker double-V hull engineering.
In the second half, we expect additional U.S. awards for more Strykers, additional MRAP upgrades and a Ground
Combat Vehicle development contract.
We also expect international production contracts in the second half, including the Canadian LAV upgrade program,
two awards for an FMS tank upgrade program and a possible launch customer for the newest upgrade to our Piranha
family of vehicles. Additionally, requests for the next increments of 72 FMS LAVs and 125 Egyptian tank kits are now
proceeding through the appropriate approval channels.
In total, these international awards could add approximately $1.5 billion to backlog before year end. Given year-to-date
performance, current backlog and anticipated orders, Combat remains on track to achieve my guidance of around $9
billion in sales this year and a 14% operating margin.

As we look to the future, the Combat Systems group will be both challenged by an uncertain market environment and
bolstered by an array of opportunities. Domestically, our incumbency and unique experience in designing, producing
and servicing combat-proven vehicles positions us well.
For example, Stryker Double-V which arrived in Afghanistan in early June is already saving lives and the double-V
hull itself is quickly becoming a survivability requirement for all armored vehicles. We will continue to leverage our
investment in double-V in order to offer more survivable, lower cost solutions for future Combat and tactical vehicle
fleets.
The Abrams tank offers similar potential for further adaptation and modernization. We are encouraged by the strong
Congressional support we have received thus far in the 2012 budget process. This support will help ensure that the U.S.
maintains a healthy and reliable tank industrial base.
International vehicle markets and the growth that we expect to arise from several indigenous and foreign military
export programs are key to providing relative stability in Combat's outlook over the next several years.
We have a $2 billion multi-year FMS LAV program already in backlog which helps to mitigate some softening in the
U.S. vehicle program sales. In addition, the Canadian LAV upgrade program and FMS tank upgrade program and the
expected Spanish 8x8 LAV program will help to further offset pressure in our U.S. vehicle market.
In summary, Combat Systems is performing well and continues to build on the success of our franchise programs. As
we begin to look into 2012 and even 2013, we certainly have some work to do. But with that said, I remain confident in
our ability to provide best-in-class vehicles and weapons systems to U.S. and international customers at affordable
prices for years to come.
Next, Marine Systems. Marine Systems delivered a solid quarter. Sales in the quarter were down modestly, though
earnings were consistent with the prior year period at $1.6 billion and $161 million respectively. Marine sales reflect
lower destroyer, commercial shipping and T-AKE volume, partially offset by higher submarine, Mobile Landing
Platform and repair volume. The lower destroyer volume is really a timing issue, as we fully expect several destroyer
awards in the second half. Margins in the quarter were steady at 10.2%, driven primarily by improved performance on
the T-AKE program.
The group's funded backlog totaled $9.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $1.1 billion from the end of last
quarter. This increase reflects funding for the second FY11 Virginia class submarine, several NASSCO repair
contracts, additional funding for the DDG-1000 program and an $800 million award for construction of the first two
MLP ships and long lead material funding for the third. We were very pleased to add these two MLPs into our backlog
and look forward to another successful program.
Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $18.4 billion, down modestly from last quarter.
We now have an agreement with the Navy on DDGs 1001 and 1002, the second and third ships in the class and expect
the contract to follow shortly. Additionally, we are preparing a bid for the Navy's DDG 51 restart destroyers and
anticipate an award announcement late in the third quarter or perhaps early in the fourth. We also continue to see the
need for replacing aging Jones Act commercial ships but that has yet to translate into orders at NASSCO.
For the remainder of the year, group sales will grow progressively due to continued growth on the Virginia and
SSBN(X) programs and incremental destroyer volume once we're able to add these ships to backlog.
Overall, 2011 sales should be similar to last year, consistent with my prior guidance. Given the group's performance
through the first half, Marine margins for the year should be in the high 9% range, better than my earlier guidance.
The group's excellent track record of taking cost out of this business and its continued dedication to process
improvement positioned it to remain a leader in designing and constructing the most affordable reliable ships moving
forward.

Now to IS&T. Our IS&T group had a good second quarter. Sales were $2.8 billion while earnings were nearly $300
million. The group's IT Service business realized growth throughout the first half, primarily attributable to large IT
infrastructure support projects in the DC area, such as the DOD's Mark Center, Walter Reed National Military Medical
Center and the relocation of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency headquarters.
IS&T Tactical Communications business did experience lower volume, particularly in its shorter cycle product
business, which includes encryption, mobile and ruggedized computing products. This lighter than anticipated volume
is primarily a timing issue, the result of both prolonged acquisition cycles and the aftermath of the continuing
resolution. We anticipate volume to increase materially in the second half.
IS&T operating margins were 10.7% in the second quarter, 20 basis points better than last year's second quarter and 90
basis points improved from the last quarter. This margin improvement is a direct reflection of the group's ongoing
response to top line pressures. In reaction to the new reality of slowed acquisition cycles and less predictable customer
award activity, our IS&T businesses are taking prompt action to ensure they remain competitive, including
consolidating and adjusting staffing levels across the portfolio.
The group's backlog totaled $9.6 billion at the quarter end; consistent with the prior quarter as book-to-bill was very
nearly one times. Our IT Service business enjoyed its best order quarter in almost three years, and helped offset the
more sluggish award tempo in our product and systems integration businesses. IS&T's opportunity pipeline is very
robust and we anticipate full year book-to-bill to be at or very near one times.
Even with some of the awards sluggishness just mentioned, the Tactical Communications business has recently secured
several notable contracts. In the United Kingdom, we received a $174 million Bowman Support and Enhancement
contract, critical to maintaining and evolving this franchise product for the British Army. Similarly, following a key
Pentagon milestone decision, we were awarded a contract for 6250 JTRS HMS Rifleman radios and 100 Manpack
radios. Our HMS products continued to perform well in testing to include success in a recent Army network integration
exercise where the handheld and Manpack variants demonstrated their ability to provide transformational networking
capability.
The group's IT Service business was also selected for several multi-year IDIQ contracts in the second quarter, including
an award to build the IT backbone for the new Department of Homeland Security headquarters. These awards drove a
nearly $600 million improvement in the group's potential contract value. In the second quarter we announced the
acquisition of Fortress Technologies, a provider of secure wireless networking equipment for the U.S. military and
other government customers. Fortress' product portfolio provides a secure wi-fi hotspot for battlefield logistics, convoy
and command post users that do not currently enjoy this capability.
We also recently announced the acquisition of Network Connectivity Solutions, a provider of enterprise services, cloud
computing and cyber information assurance solutions to the Department of Defense.
IS&T's volume in the second half will exceed both last year's second half and this year's first half. For the full year, I
expect group sales to be flat to modestly up from last year, a revised outlook that reflects the realities of contract award
activity in the first half. Margins will be in the mid 10% range, somewhat higher than my previous guidance. Looking
ahead, IS&T's highly diverse portfolio positions the group to leverage its current capabilities to capture new business in
fast growing market segments.
Now let's move to our Aerospace segment. The Aerospace group's second quarter sales were $1.38 billion, consistent
with the year ago quarter and up modestly from last quarter. Earnings totaled $209 million resulting in a 15.2% group
operating margin. The group's operating margins are down in the first half when compared with last year's period
primarily because of the timing of R&D spending and supplier payments at Gulfstream and to performance challenges
at Jet Aviation. Even with the impact of R&D expenditure timing, Gulfstream margins remain robust and the business
is performing extremely well.
In my last quarterly earnings remarks, I noted the problems that Jet is confronting in its completions business.
Specifically, I highlighted that as a result of the economic downturn, Jet's OEM business jet completion volume
deteriorated markedly. This loss of OEM volume was aggravated by less than optimal performance on narrow-body

wide-body contracts. While underperformance is not related to the quality of the products delivered, it has impacted
throughput and subsequent volume.
Therefore, to better align jet completions to the realities of today's market; we are restructuring the business,
eliminating overhead and transforming the management team. We will see continuing improvement in Jet's completion
business as the year progresses.
Jet's service operations continue to do well, especially the FBO business as flying hours increased globally. I have great
confidence that new management at Jet Aviation and healthy demand for its completions, MRO, FBO and management
services will help to ensure improved performance moving forward.
Broader Aerospace market indicators were generally positive again this quarter, when in fact second quarter Gulfstream
orders were the largest we've seen since the economic downturn began. When combined with low customer defaults,
this strong order book drove a $428 million increase in the group's backlog in the second quarter. At $18 billion
including an 18-24 month delivery window for our in-service large cabin aircraft, our backlog is solid and sustaining.
For the year, large and mid cabin in-production green deliveries remain on track at 80 and 15 to 20 respectively.
Orders through the first half reflect the reality of today's market environment. Customer appetite for large cabin aircraft
remains very healthy, while mid cabin demand continues but at lower levels. International customers represented over
70% of our order book in the first half, with Asia Pacific customers accounting for 50%. When compared with the first
half of last year, Asia Pacific orders have more than doubled their share of the order book.
We were also particularly pleased to see a doubling of North American customer orders from the first to second
quarter. It's good to see our domestic markets slowly coming back, particularly given recent political rhetoric which is
very harmful to our industry.
Gulfstream flying hours continue to improve and have now returned to pre-recession levels. This has driven additional
growth in our aircraft services businesses, which enjoyed another quarter of record setting service demand.
Year-to-date, the group's service sales are up almost 20% with both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation delivering double-digit
growth. We're working diligently to ensure that our service network remains well positioned to serve our customers and
the growing installed global fleet. In pursuit of this goal, we added two new European warehouses this quarter,
enhanced our air product support program and introduced new FAST teams able to deploy around the world to deal
with customer maintenance needs.
Market pre-owned aircraft levels continue to slowly decline. We had two aircraft in inventory at the beginning of this
quarter, took two additional pre-owned aircraft in trade during the quarter and have sold all four at a modest profit.
On the product development front, the G650 returned to flight in late May and our four test aircraft are busily
progressing toward certification. While the two month delay in flight testing introduced some additional risk into our
planned certification schedule, we are pleased with the progress we've made since returning to flight.
We continue to believe that we can attain our objective of delivering 10 to 12 green G650 aircraft this year. However, it
is fair to assume that these delivers will happen later in the year than previously planned.
The G280, which was recently renamed, also continues to make progress towards certification having achieved several
critical milestones in the quarter to include obtaining engine certification. For the year, I expect the group's sales to
grow approximately 14-15%, slightly below my prior guidance. Margins will be around 15%, somewhat lower than
previously expected, given Jet Aviation's performance through the first half.
As we look to the future, our current order book, healthy pipeline of potential customer orders and continued
investments in new aircraft development bode well to the future of our Aerospace group.
In summary, General Dynamics delivered a solid first half and is well positioned for success in the second half. I now
expect earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be $7.15 to $7.20, an increase from my prior
guidance.

This revised guidance reflects the changes to segment guidance I provided this morning, the sale of the detection
systems business, additional interest expense resulting from our debt issuance, and share repurchase through the first
half. As is our practice, this guidance does not presume further deployment of capital, although our healthy balance
sheet affords us great flexibility to do so.
Before I turn the call over to Hugh, I want to comment briefly on today's dynamic business environment, particularly as
it relates to our defense businesses. As we speak, talks on resolving the nation's debt challenges continue. Although it's
not yet certain today how or when the debt ceiling is raised, it is clear that defense spending will play a role in helping
to ease the country's economic challenges.
The President's recently announced plan, for example, would cut national security spending by $700 billion over the
next 10 to 12 years. The distribution of this reduction has not yet been detailed, although it is probable that the largest
cuts will target budgets in the second half of the decade rather than those in the nearer term. The Pentagon, under the
guidance of the new Secretary of Defense is in the midst of a roles and missions study which will identify an array of
options for capturing savings commensurate with the President's plan.
While we have no insight into the study, it is apparent that senior leadership in the Pentagon intends to make sure that
any cuts are made deliberately and with known strategy and capability consequences.
Secretary Panetta, who most certainly understands the multiplicity of threats facing our nation, has clearly expressed
that he will not create a hollow force. The Secretary has also stated that while he understands the defense cuts are
necessary, he does not believe that the country must choose between strong fiscal discipline and strong national
security.
As we continue to closely track the conclusions of this study which will predominantly inform the fiscal year 2013
budget submission, the 2012 defense budget request is proceeding through the Congressional approval process. We
have been pleased with the support our programs have received to date. While there are several steps remaining before
the 2012 defense bill is enacted, I remain confident that GD's core programs will receive solid Congressional support.
Furthermore, in the event that the 2012 Pentagon budget is funded through a continuing resolution, we remain
relatively confident in our outlook given the robust funding for our programs in the 2011 spending bill.
General Dynamics is particularly well positioned to excel in this fast changing high pressure environment. The
platform incumbency that we've established, particularly with our Army and Navy customers will afford us significant
opportunities to evolve our defense products in a manner that both addresses emergent war fighter requirements and
minimizes costs. And the expanding global business jet market and continued investment in our product and service
portfolio will help to ensure that our Aerospace segment is the company's growth engine for the next several years.
We are taking appropriate actions across this corporation to ensure we can continue to provide the most capable and
affordable products to our customers as we enhance value to our shareholders.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd
Thank you, Jay and good morning everyone. I would like to begin by following up on Jay's comment regarding the
issuance of fixed rate notes subsequent to the quarter.
As a result of the increased debt, we now project full year interest to approximate $140 million. That's up from our
previous expectation of around 130 million.
Also following the end of the quarter, we replaced our $975 million credit facility which was set to expire in December
of this year. We replaced that with a $1 billion facility expiring in July of 2015.
This, together with our facility that expires in July of 2013 maintains $2 billion in back up liquidity for our commercial
paper program. Our next scheduled debt maturity is $1 billion of notes due in July – excuse me, in May of 2013.

With respect to income taxes, our effective rate for the first half of the year was 30.8%, consistent with our
expectations and with our current outlook for the full year of around 31%. With respect to pensions, as planned, we will
make a voluntary contribution to the pension plans totaling $350 million, mostly this quarter – this quarter meaning the
third quarter of this year.
Also as Jay discussed, we divested the detection systems assets of our Combat Systems group during the quarter. That
transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of just under $40 million, which you see reported in other income on our income
statement. After considering the tax impact of the transaction and adjusting for the second half earnings that were
associated with these operations, the transaction has a net favorable impact of approximately $0.03 per share. And
that's the impact for the full year.
Finally, with the decision by the Supreme Court to remand the A12 case to the Federal Circuit and the Federal Circuit's
decision to remand the case to the court of Federal Claims, we are anticipated a prolonged path to resolution.
Accordingly we accrued our estimate of the additional legal cost [indiscernible] (31:25) with this revised outlook, and
you see that reported in discontinued operations net of taxes.
With that, I'll turn the time back over to Amy for the Q&A.

Thanks Hugh. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to
participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Carris could you please remind participants
how to enter the queue?
Q&A
Operator
Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of
Canada. Please proceed.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Jay, you mentioned that the mid cabin area is slightly improving for you. I was wondering if you
could give us a feel of how much it's really recovered say sequentially or year-on-year and what your expectations
might be for mid cabin deliveries as we head into the next year.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, look, we see continued activity in the mid cabin as I highlighted, Rob. It's not – it
certainly doesn't compare with the large cabin activity, but it is, I would categorize it as being fairly steady at this point.
We're going to deliver 15 to 20 this year. I feel very confident in that. It's too early to call next year yet, but I like what
we're seeing thus far. And it really is across all the models in our portfolio.
I'm reading from other OEMs – mid cabin OEMs they're seeing continued activity as well. So I think slowly but surely
we're getting ourselves back into that market. And as you know, it's not a large portion of Gulfstream, but we're
encouraged by what we see across the market space.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: As a quick follow up on the aircraft, this is the third consecutive quarter of demand increase or
backlog increase at Gulfstream. At what point do you think we can expect maybe production on the large cabin jets to
head higher.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: That part of the first question, Rob?

<Q - Rob Stallard>: I was just saying that you have three consecutive quarters of demand increases. I was wondering
at what point we should be expecting production of large cabin jets to increase.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well we keep ourselves as you know in the 18 to 24 month backlog. That's kind of where we
are now. We get on the long side of that, we can ramp it up an airplane or two and we're not afraid to do that. But for
now, I kind of like where we are.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with Lazard Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael S. Lewis>: Good morning and thank you for taking my question.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Welcome
<Q - Michael S. Lewis>: Thank you. Jay I was wondering if you could expand a little more on the Jet services
restructuring. And more specifically, when do you think the operation is right sized?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: We're in the process of doing the latter as we speak, Mike. But let me just say, it's – there are
two pieces to this, okay. One in Jet is the services business which is doing quite well. I'll put that aside for this part of
the discussion.
The completions business is challenged as I described this time and in previous conversation. And it really does come
down to OEM volume cutbacks which have caused us to have to reshape that business. And then the OEM -- sorry, the
narrow-body wide-body completions. I think the best way for me to describe that is to say that what happened to us at
Jet completions is that the volume in the front door overcame the throughput efficiency that we had on the deck plates,
if you will. And so we brought them in the front door but couldn't get them out the back door in a timely enough
manner. When they got out the back door, the quality, the product was fine, wonderful actually, but it just, you couldn't
get them through the flow.
We've taken very, very specific steps, and as I mentioned, to reshape that business, to resize it. We've put a lot of new
talent in there to help those on the shop floor, and we feel good about everything we're seeing. But as you would expect
– and oh by the way, while we're doing this, we wicked down, if you will, the volume coming in the front door which is
as I mentioned in my remarks, part of the issue with the rest of the year, okay, in terms of volume. That's a temporary
condition that is being adjusted, in fact, as we speak, to continue more volume in there now that we're getting our
processes and throughput efficiencies in stride. That won't happen overnight. That will take the rest of the year.
.
But one thing I am certain, as I mentioned in my remarks, with the leadership team we have in place, the management
of that production facility over there, I'm very confident that 2012 is going to be a better year for us than 2011. But
we're just going to have to work our way through it.

Your next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: I'm wondering if you could talk about the budget delays and maybe quantify how much impacted
the quarter. Maybe if you could take a stab at that and then do you see risk some of the money actually doesn't get spent
this year and you start seeing some revenues slip out into 2012?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I don't know if I can quantify it Troy. But you heard in my remarks and we feel it particularly
in IS&T. We particularly feel it in some of the sort cycle pieces of Combat Systems as I said. You're obligating 12
months worth of budget in five months and contractually, that's really hard to do. So, we're not the only ones that are

saying this, obviously. But it's just the reality that we're dealing with. So things move to the right. Nothing's really
fallen off the table but it's just going to take longer.
Remember, in Combat in particular, we're ramping markedly in the second half. That's always been the plan but it's
exacerbated somewhat by the CR delta that we're dealing with. IS&T, we're really pleased with the turn at 1X on
book-to-bill or very close to it and we project that for the year. So we'll gather stride here as we go. We are gathering
stride as we go but inevitably we're going to push some of it to the right. We are seeing that.

Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much. Jay, could you give us a little bit more color about kind of the
elements of profitability in the second quarter and the year at Aerospace, specifically how much was the R&D and
SG&A up sequentially given we know R&D was higher and presumably with the good orders, the commissions were
higher. Where was Jet's profitability? Was it black? What kind of level and what kind of ramp can we expect going
forward? Are we going to see more expenses in the second half or is the profitability going to get better? Thank you.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Gulfstream, as I said, Cai, it continues to do extremely well. I think the – let's talk about the
R&D for a second. Net R&D is up this quarter. That's really a function of not the R&D itself growing much at all, it's a
function of the launch assistance being, for example, one third of what it was last quarter. It's kind of timing. For the
year, you know well, we are the 2% to 3% folks with our R&D, net R&D investment. We're still there. So it's a
quarterly blip, if you will, against a year that's essentially a little bit higher but not much higher than we normally see.
Some of that has to do with 650, some of that has to do in terms of [ph] our (40:30) spend; some of it has to do with
across the product portfolio. But the R&D expense is a little bit higher this quarter, no question about it.
Jet, the profitability at Jet, as I indicated before, we were challenged. We're challenged right now. It's going to take, I
would suggest several quarters to work our way through this but I'm encouraged by what I see and each quarter will be
better than the one before it.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning Jay
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning Rob.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: And Hugh. Jay, I would like to ask a strategic question on Marine and clearly understanding
the uncertainty at hand here, perhaps this can leverage your vast naval experience. I would like to talk about the ship
plan long-term and where you see the pressure points. So for example, can Virginia class and SSBN(X) crowd want
another out? Might they have to share funding? There's been talk that we can put ballistic missiles potentially on a
Virginia class. Do you see pressure points on the carriers? How do you see this long-term, because at some point one
would imagine that the ship plan's going to come under some pressure?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I don't disagree with you at all, Rob, on the reality that the shipbuilding budget will come under
some pressure. I would suggest maybe the term, the numbers may be different but the shipbuilding budget historically
has always seen – my experience is it always seems to come under some pressure.
But that said, the things you talk about are very relevant in that. Look, you've heard this from me before. We are a
global Navy. We will always be a global Navy. To be a global Navy, thou shalt have large combatant vessels, okay.
You need carrier strike groups, okay. You need submarines, both attack submarines and ballistic missiles submarines
and you need surface combatants and all auxiliaries attendant to that force. That's not going to change, okay. How we

shape it is the challenge.
And as you've heard me say again, in times past on the surface combatant side, the DDG-51 is going to be, I believe,
the long term mainstay for the surface combatant Navy, okay. There's a whole new flight of ballistic missile-capable
51's that will be coming in the next tranche and we will be building 51's I believe for quite some time to come.
The points you make about the submarines is a very big part of the challenge, I think, for the Navy and frankly for the
country. In terms of dealing for the requirement for Virginia class submarines to replace the Los Angeles class, as well
as the Ohio replacement program for the SSBN(X) or whatever they're going to end up calling it. Will they compete
against each other? My sense would be yes they would but we're going to have to figure out a way forward that
accommodates both of them because the requirements are fairly well sacrosanct.
There's a lot of talk as you highlighted about do we put another missile and modify the Virginia class? Look, I don't
know where that's going to go. But the requirement, the strategic requirement for the ballistic missiles submarine is
inviolate. Okay, it is the most survivable leg of the strategic triad and nobody's talking about doing anything with that.
It's a question of how you manifest the Ohio replacement program going forward. As you would expect, we're in the
thick of that with our electric boat engineering and development efforts and we'll help shape that outcome as we go
forward. But that will be a very robust discussion.
The carriers, you know, my background keeps me interested in carriers but my business doesn't deal with carriers at
this point, so I'll let Mike Petters talk about the carriers.

Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Jay, following up on that a little bit at Marine. Obviously the performance in the quarter was
strong. You raised the margin guidance there, but can you talk about looking forward the outlook for Marine,
particularly the trade of MLP or T-AKE leaving, going away and the trade for MLP. And then as a follow up on share
repurchase. Obviously a much higher level than what we've seen in the past. Can you talk about the sustainability of
repurchasing shares at this kind of level going forward? Thanks.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Okay. Look, let me take them backwards. The share repurchases, you know that we're tactical
share repurchasers. We've always done it that way. We'll continue to buy shares when the market tells us it's
appropriate to buy our shares. So whenever that's the case, we'll be in the market. We keep the authorization up and
we're very pleased with the value we're creating with our share repurchase program. Particularly, particularly when you
look at us with the Aerospace growth engine we've got and what's coming in the next five to seven years. Buying back
our shares right now we think is a really good move for our shareholders.
That said; now let's talk about T-AKE and MLP. They're actually feathering together – my words, not Fred Harris'
words – they're actually feathering together very nicely out at NASSCO and we'll flow one right into the other. To be
followed by, I believe, yet to be detailed but followed by the T-AO(X) program. So that part of NASSCO, the Navy
build at NASSCO, if you will, looks very positive for us going forward.
The T-AKE performance is superb. You heard me say that. You see it in the numbers. I would suggest that the MLP
performance will be likewise very, very, very strong, because the design for that MLP was as complete, is as complete
as any ship we've ever built. So we know exactly what we're doing as we build that set, that series of three vessels and
are very confident in our ability to generate really good margins out of it, okay.
So don't forget also that we've got other volume impacts, if you will, out at NASSCO, one is the repair work which is
steady and actually increasing which I think last year was like a quarter of their sales and earnings. That will continue,

as I said.
The commercial side is still out there. I mean, if you look at the addressable market in Jones Act ships alone, nearly
100 ships sooner or later, that market is going to get service because the Jones Act ships are getting very old and they're
going to have environmental etcetera challenges, as you know. Single hull, double hull. We've talked about some of
that before.
We have not translated any of that into contract yet, but that market will come back. So we think NASSCO is in a great
position right now, and as you know, they're a premier shipyard, so we're proud of what we're doing with T-AKE.
Underway. I saw my first picture, I haven't been out there yet to see it but I saw my first picture of MLP yesterday and
it's real. It's in the build; MLP-1 is very real. So we're anxious to get it in the water.

And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Jay, could you talk a little bit about the 650 and sort of the changes
that have been brought about as a result of the accident and where you go from here? I know you sort of said it will be a
little tight to get the year done. But how is the airplane performing, and some of the other things that I'm sure you had
questions that you've not heretofore been able to answer.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning, Howard. Listen, I'm very pleased with what's happening with 650. As I said in
my remarks, we're back in the air; we're flying our test points and proceeding towards certification. Yes, it's going to be
later in the year. I'm not aware, Howard, I'm not aware of anything, material shall we say or significant that's been
changed or that we're doing to the airplane that would cause, certainly need to be concerned about it. It's performing
beautifully, so off we go.
I still, as reflected in the guidance I delivered today, I still am really confident that we're going to get 10 to 12 green
deliveries this year. And so I'm still on 650 bullishness, if you will. The backlog in 650 continues to increase, okay.
We're taking orders for 650, so it's still a great program for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Jay you mentioned I guess in Combat Systems about relocating the headquarters and resizing
the gun and weapons systems, and then also in Jet talking about the restructuring and reduction in overhead. Can you
just talk about what kind of costs you might be absorbing in both of those businesses for those restructuring, either
whether it was in the second quarter or just prospectively, and then I guess within gun and weapons, is that potentially
an allowable cost as well.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I don't think I'm – I'm not going to quantify any costs. These are good business leaders that are
running their businesses to become more efficient given the realities of the world. I mean the savings in the macro
terms are probably de minimis, but it's important for them to maintain their competitiveness and efficiency and that's
exactly what they're doing.
It made sense for us to move the headquarters of our European Land Systems out of Vienna into Madrid. Why?
Because European Land Systems' core of business is resident in Spain. It's things like that that just makes good
business sense. More opportunities will come to us with a Spanish headquarters for ELS than was the case was
previously.

So it's just the – it's the charge I give to the business leaders. It's a charge I give to the business leaders to run their
businesses to be more competitive and efficient. That will continue. There are others I didn't even talk about this
morning in IS&T and other places and we've resized some of the business to maintain our competitiveness.

Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, Jay, on the G650, a question in a different way. Can you talk about how the production is
going on the plane? And I'd like to get some thinking about how you plan to make rate decisions. Is it going to be based
on milestones or is it going to be calendar? Are you waiting to see the number of planes built before you make a rate
decision? As we had...
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: No. I mean, to me rate decision – I've given you the rates that I see for the next several years –
are really going to be determined by how, as I use the words, how our battle rhythm develops down in the production
facility at Gulfstream, how the vendors and supply chain feed into that production center that you've seen down there.
That's really going to determine, I think, the pace.
As we've talked many times in the past, when you've got over 200 in backlog, the desire to increase the rheostat of
production is a very real one but you don't want to do it before you're ready. So I'm very comfortable with the pacing
we've got right now but the production is going just fine. There's no – we're moving along, we're building airplanes, it's
full, the production facility has a lots of G650s in it right now. I'm going to go see them next week as a matter of fact.
So, I'm very encouraged by what I see down there but again we're going to pace the production to our ability to deliver
what we say we're going to deliver.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks, good morning. Jay, on the 650, is it still operating or flying under a restricted
envelope or has that been lifted? And as we look at the margins for the business your guidance implies 14% in the
second half of the year and I know there is problems at Jet but you said that's going to improve every quarter. And so
what else – what else is going on there? Why are the margins down in the second half? Are you lowering your
expectations for 650 margins?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: No, Joe, the 650, I'm still where I was in probably our earlier discussions on 650. That's going
to hit with margins that are accretive to the group but not certainly what we see in our in-production large cabin
aircraft. And we'll work our way over time through the latter of those two.
So, I'm fine there. What it really boils down to, to your specific point on the second half is Jet still, okay. And I
mentioned earlier, it's going to take us several quarters to work through this. But it's also at Gulfstream side a little bit
of mix, okay. I said we're going to do what, 15 to 20 on the mid cabin and I think the number we had in the first half
was seven. So we're going to have a little mix shift there. And I think in the second half, we've also got perhaps a little
bit more 450 than we had in the first half. So you're going to see some of that, less liquidated damages and a little bit
higher, as I said before, R&D expenses in the second half. But overall, the Gulfstream side is very strong with the
elements I just mentioned and we're going to work our way through Jet, okay.
Now, to your other point about the restricted envelope. I believe that is still the case, but it is certainly not affecting our
ability to proceed along our test paths if you will. At the appropriate point, if they need to adjust I'm sure between
Gulfstream and the FAA they'll adjust but for now we're proceeding apace and I like everything I'm hearing about our
650 test program. I mentioned it in my remarks as well, but since you asked about 650 flights, I would also suggest that
the 280 side is proceeding very nicely toward certification as well. That's a sweet airplane as I've talked before.

<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Jay, I was wondering if we could get you to reset your – or give us the latest sort of medium to
long term kind of three to four year outlook for Combat. I feel like there was a period where you all were describing
Combat as a steady low single digit grower over the medium to long term. It's unclear that you still feel that way. Is that
the case, and can you just update us there?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I think the way I characterized it was suggested in my remarks, Noah, that it's a very dynamic
environment and I think, I certainly am confident in what I see this year as I reaffirmed this morning. I've got a pretty
good site line I think based on what went in and what next year's going to look like. But then I think we need to see a
couple of things.
One, we need to see what our customer, our Army customer does with their combat vehicle review that's ongoing and
should come on before too much longer which will inform us into their views of basically all the major platforms. And
then I think we all – all of us need to look at what happens with what's going on right now in terms of the debt ceiling
and all attendant to that. And very specifically as it applies to the defense businesses the roles and missions study that's
underway.
I think that would be the best source of look-ahead knowledge if you will, beyond say the year 2012. I mean, I just
think anybody who says they've got a clear site line on 2013 and beyond I think is making it up.

Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Jay, I was hoping you could help me out with the
IS&T margin performance. I think you said the IT business was actually up and growing, and the C4 is where you're
seeing the top line pressure. I'm trying to understand, obviously a good performance on the margin side given what I
would expect would be an otherwise adverse mix. So have IT margins structurally gotten better or is there anything in
the quarter. Then a clarification on repo. I think you authorized another 10 million shares in the quarter but it seems
like you've exhausted that. I'm just curious is this going to become more of a flow authorization of share repurchase
than anything else?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: We have not re – I mean we have not gone through our authorization. That's just a fact. I mean,
we've got more repo we could do if the market talks to us appropriately.
But as to your IT margins, they, like everyone else, are very aggressively taking costs out of their business and
reshaping and performing extremely well. I give that the most credit, that we're very competitive and we're very good at
what we do across that very diverse portfolio. So all elements of our IS&T business are performing very well right
now. There are mature programs, tactical communications, good execution in IT Service, bringing home some big
contracts and outperforming those contracts. I'm very pleased with what we see with IS&T. Very bullish on the whole
group.
