Now I'll turn the call over to Greg.
Gregory D. Wasson
Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today, I'll begin with a review of
the highlights of our results for the quarter. Then I'll touch on our announcement earlier today on the Walgreens and
Alliance Boots strategic long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen and how that carries forward one of our three
key strategic growth drivers to create an unprecedented global platform through our Alliance Boots partnership. After
that, I'll turn the call over to Wade for more information on our performance this quarter and details of the Walgreens,
Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announcement.
Turning to our overall financial results, we're pleased to report a solid quarter with adjusted earnings of $0.96 per
diluted share and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.79. With that performance were a number of highlights.
First, we had operating cash flow for the second quarter of $1.2 billion and free cash flow came in at $953 million.
Second, our Balance Rewards program continues to show a strong response from our customers with more than 60
million customers enrolled. Third, the Alliance Boots business and synergies are on track with our expectations with
accretion to our adjusted EPS of $0.05.
Finally, this morning's announcement of our strategic, long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen demonstrates
how we continue to move forward on our strategy to create a global network for pharmacy-led health and well-being
with Alliance Boots.
With those highlights, let me recap our financial results for this quarter. As we began doing in the fourth quarter of last
year, we'll present our results on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. We reported first-quarter sales of $18.6 billion,
virtually identical to the same quarter a year ago. Remember, that this quarter includes one less day due to last year's
Leap Day and sales also continued to be impacted by the growth in lower-cost generic drugs, which help our bottom
line.
GAAP operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter was $1.2 billion up 10% from $1.1 billion for the same period last
year. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter was nearly $1.4 billion, up 12.9% from just over
$1.2 billion in the second quarter 2012. GAAP net earnings for the quarter were up by 10.7% from $683 million, or
$0.78 per diluted share last year, to $756 million, or $0.79 per diluted share this year. The non-GAAP adjusted net
earnings for this quarter were $915 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $776
million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year.
As I mentioned in January, we came into this year with a number of tailwinds and we capitalized on these positive
trends in the second quarter. That's especially true in Pharmacy which continues to be on the upswing. I would like to
quickly review some of these tailwinds.
With our multi-year contract with Express Scripts, we saw an increasing percentage of those patients returning to us
this quarter. Walgreens is now a preferred drugstore in four Medicare Part D plans, giving these members a financial
benefit when they choose Walgreens over our competitors. Our reinvigorated private brands, led by Nice!, Delish and
Well at Walgreens, are driving margin and receiving great feedback from our store managers while they continue to
build momentum with customers.
And this month, we are cycling last year's change in our promotional strategy that moved us away from predominantly
print promotions. Instead, we are leveraging digital media and our new Balance Rewards loyalty program launched last
September.
From a global viewpoint, our Alliance Boots strategic partnership is now firmly in place and we're already realizing
benefits from our procurement joint venture. And now, with this morning's earlier announcement with Alliance Boots
and AmerisourceBergen, we're taking another step forward in establishing an unprecedented and efficient global
pharmacy-led health and well-being network and achieving our vision of becoming the first choice in health and daily

living for everyone in America and beyond.
Turning to trends in gross profit dollars and SG&A, in the second quarter on a GAAP basis, our gross profit dollar
growth increased 4%, or $218 million, from a year ago. SG&A dollar growth increased $213 million, or 5%, compared
to a year ago.
On a non-GAAP basis gross profit dollar growth, after adjusting for the LIFO provision, increased $218 million, or 4%,
year over year, driven primarily by growth in generic prescriptions while front-end margins also increased slightly.
SG&A dollar growth was up $178 million, or 4.2%, after adjusting for the Alliance Boots transaction costs, other
acquisition-related amortization and the USA Drug acquisition-related costs. Through the quarter, we continued to
make steady progress in executing on the three major strategic growth drivers we put in place in 2012 to position our
company for long-term growth and value creation.
On creating a Well Experience, this week we're opening our newest flagship store in Washington, DC, followed by a
flagship in the Empire State Building later this month and one in Boston next month. These locations are raising the
Walgreens brand in important markets as we continue to drive innovation across our store network.
On transforming community pharmacy, among other steps, we recently formed accountable care organizations, part of
the national healthcare reform, with three leading physician teams in Texas, Florida and New Jersey. And this
morning's announcement with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen was a significant step forward on our third
growth driver, establishing an efficient global platform.
Our new strategic long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen has three main components: a distribution
agreement; strategic collaboration; and equity alignment. Let me touch on each and then Wade will provide more
details.
First, our distribution agreement is a long-term, 10-year contract. It offers expanded service levels and more frequent
deliveries, and it offers improved economics through a number of operational efficiencies and better rates. The second
component, the strategic collaboration, gives us supply chain and procurement benefits, new opportunities for customer
and supplier collaboration and for domestic and international growth. Finally, the equity piece of the agreement is
designed to align our common interests and allow us to participate in the joint value creation.
Let me sum up by saying we're very pleased with the way customers, patients and partners are responding to our efforts
to help people get, stay and live well. We see this in their response to Balance Rewards, our vaccination and
immunization program, our health and wellness initiatives, our innovations and partnerships and the excitement we
continue to generate in our Well Experience format.
With our partnership with Alliance Boots performing well and producing the expected synergies and a new strategic
long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen we announced today, we believe Walgreens is truly on its way to be
the first choice in health and daily living for everyone in America and beyond.
Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Wade.
Wade D. Miquelon
Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning I'll take you through
our quarterly results, as well as build on Greg's comments regarding today's announced strategic relationship between
Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen.
I'll also provide greater detail on the 10-year agreement as well as further perspective on why we're confident this
relationship will unlock significant opportunities for our companies and provide value to our shareholders.
Starting with the quarterly results, as Greg noted earlier, for the quarter we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.79 per diluted
share based on 953 million shares. This chart illustrates the walk from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS for the quarter.

The LIFO provision was $0.05 per share. The acquisition-related amortization was $0.08 and the Alliance Boots
adjusted earnings tax add-back was $0.04, for a total of $0.12 per share. And finally, the special items column had a net
zero impact on adjusted earnings per share because of the $0.01 of acquisition-related costs and they were offset by a
$0.01 gain related to client retention escrow proceeds from the sale of our PBM in 2011.
The sum of these yields an adjusted EPS of $0.96 per diluted share for the quarter. It's also worth noting that the quarter
this year had one less day than the quarter last year, which included Leap Day, February 29. Adjusting for Leap Day,
the adjusted earnings per share increased over 10% in the quarter, rather than the 9.1% that Greg noted.
Let me now provide more detail on our comparable store sales for the quarter, and keep in mind that all comps are
reported on a 28-day basis. Comparable prescription sales decreased 1.2%. Comparable front-end sales decreased
1.6%. Total comp sales decreased 1.4%. Comp prescriptions filled increased 5.7% versus a negative 6.1% script comp
a year ago. And I'll also note that comparable prescription sales were negative versus the positive script comps,
primarily due to the increased introductions of new generics year over year.
This slide illustrates the trend in prescription comps for the last 14 quarters and clearly shows the impact on comp store
script numbers for the prior four quarters were not part of the Express Scripts network. And as you know, Express
Scripts customers started returning to our pharmacies in the first quarter. The comp stores scripts increased 5.7% in the
second quarter. And please note that the script comp also included a 1.9% positive impact from a higher incidence of
flu this quarter versus a year ago.
The next slide shows the trend in front-end comps for the last 14 quarters. The primary drivers behind the trend the last
four quarters were the impact of the move to rebalance our overall ad and promotional spending strategy and the impact
of Express Scripts. Our goal is to strike the right optimal balance between sales and profitable growth using our
promotional strategy as well as our unique Balance Rewards loyalty program, which gives us an additional lever to
help find this balance between loyal customer sales and margins.
We are pleased to achieve stable margins in the front end despite a very promotional environment. On a 28-day basis,
traffic in the quarter decreased by 4.4%, basket size increased by 2.8% and the front-end comp decreased by 1.6%.
Keep in mind, we'll lap the change in overall promotional spend strategy this month which should help improve the
recent comp trend. March comps will also be positively impacted by the shift in Easter from April 8 last year to March
31 this year.
Turning to margin, our FIFO gross margin was 30.5% in the current quarter compared to 29.3% last year, a 120 basis
point improvement. The overall margin was primarily helped by Pharmacy, but the front end also contributed.
Pharmacy margins were positively impacted by generics. Front-end margins were positively impacted by OTC drugs,
personal care and household products, but these benefits were partially offset by the increase in points accruing as we
ramp up our loyalty programs. Front-end margins were also negatively impacted by the e-commerce mix effect.
Taking a look at our longer-term gross margin trends, it's important to note that this quarter's 120 basis point
improvement builds on a 20 basis point increase a year ago and the improvement this quarter is similar to last quarter,
both quarters a testament to the benefit of generic introductions this fiscal year.
The front-end benefit to margin did move from neutral to positive sequentially. And also note the 4% improvement in
FIFO gross profit dollar growth, which is much better than the 0.1% growth last quarter and the 1.5% growth in the
quarter a year ago.
This illustrates our two-year stacked SG&A dollar growth trend on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters, and the
next slide shows the trends on adjusted basis. Two-year stack adjusted SG&A trends improved versus a year ago to
7.9% growth in the second quarter of 2013, down from 11.6% last year.
To get to adjusted SG&A dollar growth, you can see that our reported SG&A dollar growth of 5% included 30 basis
points of Walgreens amortization and 50 basis points of acquisition-related costs. This resulted in adjusted SG&A
dollar growth of 4.2%.

This illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trend for the past 10 quarters on a GAAP basis, and the next
slide shows the trend on adjusted basis. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased from a positive 0.1% in the first
quarter to a positive 4% in the second quarter. The trend in adjusted gross profit dollar growth data shows the benefit
for members of Express Scripts plans returning to our stores combined with an increase in the mix of generic drugs.
Following the same construct, this slide shows the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past 10 quarters on a GAAP
basis and the next slide shows them on adjusted basis. As I discussed in the SG&A walk earlier, the adjusted SG&A
dollar growth for the quarter was 4.2%, an increase from the 2.5% adjusted SG&A dollar growth reported in the first
quarter.
Keep in mind that the adjusted SG&A dollar growth rate of 4.2% also includes a few other non-comparable expenses
like the operating expense related to the USA Drug acquisition and further expenses to sign up Balance Rewards
members, among other items as well.
Focusing on our income statement for a moment, this quarter included a LIFO provision of $72 million, the same
amount as a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the year was 2.75%, up from 2.5% a year ago. Net interest expense
was $23 million including the impact of the Alliance Boots acquisition and interest income associated with the delayed
payments by a state Medicaid payer.
Our effective tax rate was 36.6% versus 37.3% last year and average diluted shares outstanding were 953 million shares
versus 875 million shares last year, and again, this increase is primarily due to shares issued for the Alliance Boots
investment. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.4 billion at February 28 versus $1.1 billion a year ago. Overall, working
capital decreased by 5.4% versus a year ago.
Accounts receivable decreased by 1.1% while accounts payable increased by 4.4% and inventories decreased 1.3%.
Total FIFO inventory increased by 2.5% in the quarter versus a negligible percent increase in total sales. FIFO
inventories on a per-store basis were flat.
During the second quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations versus $1 billion a year ago. Cash flow in
the quarter benefited from the timing of a $300 million employee profit sharing contribution, which occurred in
February last year but occurred in March this year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $953 million versus $703 million
a year ago. And keep in mind, we also raised the dividend over 22% this year to 27.5 cents per share per quarter.
Let me now transition to our accretion for the quarter as a result of our partnership with Alliance Boots. Second quarter
accretion was $0.05 per share in line with the $0.04 to $0.06 range we forecasted last quarter. We are reconfirming our
estimate of $0.12 to $0.13 per share for the third quarter and $0.09 to $0.10 for the fourth quarter.
The next slide illustrates the synergy dollars, the amortization adjustments and the equity earnings that [ph] comprise
(18:34) $0.05 of accretion. As shown, we realized $25 million before tax in synergies during the second quarter and
$15 million after tax. We expect synergies to ramp during the second half of our fiscal year, but we remain comfortable
with our $100 million to $150 million combined synergy goal for fiscal 2013.
Amortization adjustments amounted to $23 for the deal amortization and $12 million for the brand amortization.
After-tax Alliance Boots equity earnings were $85 million for the second quarter on a GAAP basis. On adjusted basis,
the income from affiliates was $120 million, as noted here, and the incremental after-tax interest expense to Walgreens
was $13 million. After the cost of share dilution, the accretion equaled $0.05 in the second quarter.
Now let me take a few minutes to speak about our announcement this morning regarding the strategic long-term
relationship with AmerisourceBergen. I would like to fully express my enthusiasm for this agreement and what it
means with respect to the various opportunities that it brings us. As Greg outlined earlier, this relationship has three
components: distribution agreement; strategic collaboration; and equity alignment.
First, let me first describe the detailed structure of the agreement.
First and foremost, Walgreens is committing to a 10-year comprehensive pharmacy distribution agreement with
AmerisourceBergen. The strategic collaboration will allow broad international reach and significant knowledge-sharing

opportunities to create efficiencies and design programs to improve access to pharmaceuticals for healthcare providers
worldwide.
To align interest and strengthen the long-term relationship, Walgreens and Alliance Boots together have been granted
the right to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen beginning with the right, but not the obligation,
to purchase up to 7% of the fully diluted equity of AmerisourceBergen in the open market. We've established a joint
venture with Alliance Boots that we intend to fund over time that will be an efficient vehicle to purchase and hold these
shares.
In addition, AmerisourceBergen has granted to Walgreens and Alliance Boots equity warrants exercisable for 16% in
the aggregate of the fully diluted equity of AmerisourceBergen. The first warrants, representing 8% of the fully diluted
equity of AmerisourceBergen, has a strike price of $51.50 and will be exercisable for a six-month period beginning in
March 2016.
The second warrants have a strike price of $52.50 and will be exercisable for a six-month period beginning in March
2017. Walgreens and Alliance Boots have agreed not to acquire additional equity of AmerisourceBergen under the
terms of a standstill agreement.
A Walgreens executive will be appointed to AmerisourceBergen's board upon Walgreens and Alliance Boots together
acquiring a 5% equity stake and an Alliance Boots executive will be appointed upon exercise in full of the first
warrants. These new board seats will add to AmerisourceBergen's current nine-member board.
The 10-year comprehensive distribution agreement will be positive to earnings and cash flow from operations. The
agreement is market-based and is expected to be modestly accretive to fiscal year 2014 adjusted earnings. The working
capital was negotiated to essentially have a neutral impact to both parties; specifically the reduction in inventory days at
Walgreens will largely be offset by the decrease in accounts payable days over time.
The operational benefits for Walgreens will include an enhanced supply chain with daily deliveries. Synergies will also
contribute to earnings and cash flow from operations in fiscal 2014 and they're expected to build in subsequent years.
Likewise, the equity investment will drive dividend income in fiscal year 2014 and beyond.
To summarize, the financial benefits for both Walgreens and Alliance Boots that begin in the first year are improved
commercial agreement rates, synergies and dividend income that arise from the investment. Beginning in year three,
the Walgreens and Alliance Boots JV also expects an incremental financial benefit from the equity income.
As we stated in our announcement, this transaction is structured to enable all three organizations to work together on
programs to improve service levels and efficiencies and benefit from available synergies.
To wrap up today, I'd like to revisit our fiscal year 2016 goals for the combined Walgreens Alliance Boots equity. We
are not changing our goals and want to clarify that the agreement we announced today will provide operating income
synergies and operating cash flow benefits accretive to our prior plans. We continue to believe that this partnership will
reward our stakeholders and will deliver significant synergies, enhance mutual capabilities and change the strategic
landscape in the U.S., Europe and other geographies around the world.
The business performance objectives are meeting our expectations and are on track to meet our first-year synergy
target. And now with the new strategic relationship with AmerisourceBergen, we are well-positioned as leaders in the
rapidly changing global healthcare environment.
In that context, we affirm our combined stated goals for fiscal 2016 of: $130 billion of revenue; $9 billion to $9.5
billion of adjusted operating income, or $8.5 billion to $9 billion on a U.S. GAAP basis; a combined synergy goal of $1
billion with $100 million to $150 million in fiscal year 2013 combined synergy goals; $8 billion of operating cash flow.
And given the strong cash flow trends at both Walgreens and Alliance Boots, we believe that with a 7% investment in
AmerisourceBergen we'll still meet the combined net debt goal of $11 billion or less.
So in summary, we are on a journey, a journey to alter the global landscape in pharmacy-led health and well-being and
create significant shareholder value along the way. With our partners, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen, the

opportunities before us are limitless and combined capabilities are unmatched.
Thank you, and we appreciate your interest in our company. And with that, I will turn the microphone back over to
Rick.
Rick J. Hans
Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of United Bank of Switzerland.
Your line is open.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: All right. Thanks. Good morning. Hey, just a question on the gross margins. Again, it
looked pretty strong in this quarter and obviously there is some seasonality as we kind of jump from the holiday-related
quarters to the non-holiday. So I'm just curious, I know you don't like to give guidance, but to the extent you've kind of
shifted from LIFO to FIFO gross margins, should we assume the same sort of seasonal progression of gross margins on
a FIFO basis that we saw previously on LIFO? Just any general color along those lines would help. Thanks.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yes, a couple of things. One is we are very focused on margin. I think in the front end,
even though we've had some volume softness, I think we've been able to do a very good job of improving profitable
mix. On Pharmacy, you're seeing some of the benefit of generics, but also, I'd say, a real focus.
I think at the end of the day, we will keep looking to improve margin opportunities. But really, again, I'd focus on our
gross profit dollar growth versus our SG&A dollar growth and being able to continue to widen that spread. And I think
you see now, for the first time since the Express Scripts dispute, we've actually crossed back over into positive territory
and I would expect that momentum to build.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. And that previous guidance you gave along that is kind of unchanged on a FIFO
basis versus what you gave on a LIFO basis previously. Is that – just to confirm that, is that correct?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah. So obviously, LIFO to FIFO, I mean, you never really know until you get various
price increases and things that flow through. I think FIFO is very indicative, though, of the way we do run our business.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: But again, I think for all the things I mentioned, we should be able to have nice solid gross
profit margins over SG&A dollar growth.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. Thanks and congrats on the ABC deal as well. Thanks.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Appreciate it.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Just a couple of things on the Amerisource deal. Did you – your comment about working
capital, is that neutral to the system or neutral to you?

<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: It's relatively neutral to the system and to us, but over time, working together we should
both be able to get additional efficiencies and drive additional days of inventory out. So I think there's probably upside
for both of us as we work together. But it's relatively neutral to the system and it's in balance. So it is relatively to both
parties with some exceptions of some initial start-up fees.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. And then the idea that it's modestly accretive in 2014, is that including some
one-time costs? And then how do you think that generally ramps up in 2015?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: There should be very modest one-time costs, so it's probably modestly accretive and
modestly accretive including those. But the key thing here is we're going to have – today, effectively, we have three
distributors when you think about it. We've had AmerisourceBergen, we've had Cardinal and we've had ourself. We're
streamlining all of that into one, and generic volume is very, very significant and so that will be phased in over time.
And as we phase that in and get that up to speed, that's where there's additional opportunities, significant opportunities,
for both parties.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right. And then lastly, if we look at the front end and script count as well, if you look
at February was – it looked like it was somewhat impacted by macro, both Pharmacy and front end. Maybe your take
on that as we've kind of gotten to this year with payroll tax and what have you, and do you still think, in terms of
getting positive on traffic at the front end, that's still likely to be a laggard relative to average ticket, I assume. Do you
think we'll see positive traffic by the end of the fiscal year?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, John. Greg. Yeah, I would, I guess, agree with your comments to begin with as far
as macro trends in February and certainly in March. As we've said, we've got an early Easter. So we'll probably know
more by the time we come through April.
But as far as the front end, certainly, as Wade said, we focused on shifting that promotional strategy from ROTO to
some of the new media opportunities. [ph] And, John, (28:31) I think we're working to balance both traffic and basket
size. I think, certainly, we want to have both. As I said, we're lapping the change in that new strategy beginning,
actually, last month.
But we're focused now on really reinvesting some of that margin that we're picking up from our private brands, from
our Balance Rewards program, to focus on traffic. So we want a little more balance going forward and we think we
should be able to achieve that. Whether it's by the end of the fiscal year or not, we don't want to give guidance, but we
think we're going to achieve that.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot and good morning. Couple questions. First of all, if you think about the
cadence of Express reclamation, talk about how they're progressing relative to your plan, and given that you're almost
through the first 90-day cycle of the calendar year, what kind of build do you think you might see beyond the calendar
first quarter?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Matt, again, we've kind of focused on comps versus just the Express Scripts. But I
think we feel good about our comps and the win-back that we're seeing. I think that certainly, to the earlier call, the
macro environment in February tightened up a little bit post flu season, but I think we feel very good with where we
are. We're on track and we feel good about our Pharmacy comps going forward.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it...

<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: You know, far from being able – we continue to win back that business, which we are, we
also feel very good about the ability to keep growing disproportionately our share of Part D. We're – go ahead. I'm
sorry, Matt.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: No, please go ahead, Wade.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Right. I think we're just seeing very nice gains as we expect and we expect those to
continue to grow throughout the year as people switch into a preferred plan with Walgreens.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Understood. And just a quick follow-up question on the Amerisource deal. If you think
about the equity investments you might make down the road, what would the cash needs be to fund those and what's
your expectation for how you pay for it?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Well, over the next immediate period, we have the ability to purchase up to 7% and that
will be at the market price so that will be whatever it will be. As I said before, though, the fact that both Walgreens and
Alliance Boots, we've been exceeding our cash flow targets and we believe that we will, over that period, be able to
continue to exceed and in fact still be on track with the $11 billion net debt or better, even with that investment.
The warrants will be a separate investment. You've got the strike prices and you've got the time. Again, we have the
right to purchase those but not the obligation, so as we go down the road here, we can reassess what makes sense at that
time.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: So most likely, cash on hand and incremental free cash flow or would you see going back
to the debt markets or to the bank line to fund this at all?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: No, I think we can do it internally, at least for the first piece, the 7%.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you so much.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning. Two questions for you. First of all, Greg, you commented a little bit of the
evolving front end and certainly understand what you've done over the last year, but curious how the front-end strategy
is evolving as it regards to promotions. Also curious in terms of the new store format what the strategy is in terms of
rolling that out broadly. Obviously, you've had a change in merchandise leadership or are going through that right now,
but give us an update of how all of those steps are evolving.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Eric. Maybe I'll start with your last one first. As far as the change in leadership,
certainly our strategy has not changed, will not change. We feel very good with our Well Experience format, as you
referred to. We're in over 400 stores. We're certainly still in pilot and learn and enhance, but we feel good with how
we're going forward with that. The customer response, which is kind of the leading indicator, is very good, which tells
us that we're moving in the right direction. There are a lot of things that we feel very good about, that are working well.
There are some things that we want to continue to tweak, but I think you'll see that continue to evolve and expand.
As far as our front end, I think we feel very good with the adjustments and the opportunities that we have. You know,
Eric, as I've said before, a shift from primarily print advertising and a lot of spend in that area to leverage and utilize
more digital media and our Balance Rewards program, that's a big strategic shift.
We actually feel good as far as how we've moved. But there is opportunity to look at ways to reinvest some of that
margin that we have to make sure that we continue to focus on driving traffic and that's what we are doing. I think the
luxury that we have is the fact that our private brand strategy is doing extremely well, which is obviously delivering
margin that we can reinvest.

<Q - Eric Bosshard>: And then secondly, with the ABC deal this morning, obviously you've got a lot going on with
Boots, especially with on the purchasing side, and I'm just curious how you are going to balance the effort with ABC
along with combining those two businesses. It seems you put a lot on your plate, especially within purchasing, before
we think of these other things. Can you talk a little bit about the bandwidth to execute on what becomes sort of a
growing list of things to get accomplished?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Eric, I think it's a fair question and, frankly, we believe that actually it will become
easier for us. As Wade said, we're actually moving from three distributors down to one. But I think when we look at,
certainly, our three key objectives, I think we have a real focus in the organization in driving those three key objectives.
I think, secondly, with our partnership with Alliance Boots and where we are and being on track with that, we feel good
there. I think when we began to explore our strategic opportunities for our U.S. supply chain with our expiration of our
contract, we looked at a lot of different options and, frankly, this was the most compelling strategic and financial option
that we had. And with AmerisourceBergen's expertise, Alliance Boots' expertise, we actually think it can enhance our
supply chain and, frankly, simplify and ease some of the work that we've been doing in the past with self-distributing.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: And so we've also established our JVs and our collaborative efforts in bringing them into
the fold as a partner that is really, I would argue, is not more work. It's just going to complement and augment what
we're already doing.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Wiltamuth>: Hi. Good morning. Can you maybe go through the global nature...
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Hi, Mark.
<Q - Mark Wiltamuth>: Of the transaction with AmerisourceBergen and how this works for the Boots side of things?
And then, if you are shifting to more generic sourcing, doesn't this kind of get entangled with that synergy target that
you've laid out? And it sounds like your goals here are not incremental to – or they are incremental to the synergy
targets you've given us. Maybe explain how that interaction works on the generics.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Okay. Well, they are incremental. And with respect to the international collaboration, the
efficiency work, for example, our JV and our employees there will be working with the AmerisourceBergen people.
And again, we expect incremental benefits for both us and for them and our benefits will be split with our partners,
Alliance Boots.
Separately, on the other global work, the Alliance Boots folks are working with them to identify various opportunities,
whether it be expansion of specialty overseas, 3PL, pre-wholesaling and others, and we feel there's a lot of
opportunities over time. And as those get more firmed up, I'm sure we'll share more details.
<Q - Mark Wiltamuth>: Okay. And just on a separate topic, how do you expect the script gains from the preferred
Part D networks to really start to build as the year progresses, and how much were they on the quarter for script
volume?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: We haven't dissected the quarter, but we did see nice gains in January as people switched
into plans where Walgreens is in in preferred. And what we usually see, what we saw the year prior, is that throughout
the year, as Part D people are made aware of the benefits they can get by going to a preferred pharmacy within that
network, we tend to see gains all year long as well. Not to mention the 12,000 people a day which are entering into Part
D and getting into a plan and, hopefully, disproportionately into a plan that has Walgreens and/or is preferred by us.

Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering – I'm trying to understand the mechanics of
the relationship with AmerisourceBergen. Are they going to take over operating your distribution centers? Will those
distribution centers ever support their independent or other customers? I mean, are you really merging the two supply
chain networks, or is it not going to be like that?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Selectively, they may utilize some of our generic distribution assets, but they'll get the
large benefits by integrating broadly into their supply chain. Now a lot of our distribution centers have a generic
distribution component and a front-end component, so we've got, actually, lots of volume still there and lots of
opportunities to reallocate resources. But broadly, they will be taking this volume into their system to get the full scale
and efficiencies and be able to deliver three lines of business to us versus just one prior – or three lines from three
different distributors, if you can include ourselves as one.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: It sounds like they were very anxious to do this business. Obviously, there are many, many
layers and pieces to the benefits of this. It's all very interesting. Just talking about the supply chain contract, it seems
like because you have been shipping generic drugs on your own trucks where you're shipping front-end product, isn't it
just less efficient for them to be the ones that ships that product?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Meredith, Greg. Keep in mind that they deliver daily, which is – obviously it improves the
service level that we have in our stores as we go direct, in most cases, once a week. I think that the opportunity – think
about it this way. Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen are experts in pharmaceutical supply chain distribution.
We're very good at it. But the combination of what they both do to improve our supply chain, take that off of our hands
and improve our service levels, is really the opportunity that we're excited about.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: So they can – rather than do brand deliveries as separate from our generic deliveries, they
can consolidate brand, generic and all specialty into one shipment, which has lots of positive implications for us and
lots of efficiencies in aggregate for everyone.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Right. Well, congratulations. It's really very interesting transaction. And I will turn it over to
somebody else.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Meredith.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on your deal.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Ed.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: I have a question for you related to this, along with the original synergy target with Alliance
Boots. I think it was kind of asked maybe a couple different ways, so it's still kind of unclear to me. Practically, how
does this impact the capture of the generic procurement synergy that you initially talked about? And I ask that question
because you had control, I guess, in the past, right, over your own generic purchasing. You were going to combine that
with Alliance Boots and it's clear as to how you benefit from that scale. But I think you're transferring that control to
AmerisourceBergen. It's just unclear to me how all this is going to work and how it flows through into the income

statement of the companies.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: We're not transferring control. In fact, our JV, which is set up and working, will continue to
work and it will work on the behalf of our partner effectively as well. And we do see that these benefits are going to be
incremental, the component for us, but also incremental for them. And so again, we will maintain control on this. A lot
of those benefits on our side will flow through our JV structure, which then gets split and then cycles a little bit because
of the 45% ownership that we have in Alliance Boots. But at the end of the day, we see that this will bring incremental
value for us and, clearly, incremental value to AmerisourceBergen as well.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Ed, in essence, we're bringing a new pool of buying volume from AmerisourceBergen into
the Alliance Boots/Walgreens venture that we've established.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Is there upside to that initial synergy target, or is that upside captured in the better pricing of
this deal?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: There's upside to the synergy target. The commercial agreement is very separate. The
commercial agreement stands on its own...
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: With respect to our distribution agreement. And we feel that it's a good agreement and
better than we have today for lots of reasons, not only cost, but what will be service levels of the deliveries. It's also a
market fair and good deal for AmerisourceBergen. And again, by having gone through, effectively, three distributors to
one, it provides opportunities for both parties to gain. But this agreement is really separate from that.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And then just one other question for you. On SG&A this quarter, a little bit higher than
we thought it was going to be. And you've been talking in the past, Wade, about looking into your stacks. So if we
think about to your stack today and we carry that forward to the second half, it looks like you could see SG&A dollars
up, like, 9%-plus. So I guess the first question is that right – the right way to think about it? And then secondly, if that
is right, can you still grow gross profit dollars faster than that in the back half?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah. A couple things is, one is our SG&A this quarter has, outside of what we even call
adjusted, had some anomalies. We had some further investments in loyalty. We had some M&A which adds SG&A on
top of it from a growth point of view, but you get gross profit as well. And then there was actually some other one-time
items in there we didn't call out. So we actually felt pretty good about our SG&A this quarter.
I think the thing to look at is the SG&A versus gross profit dollar growth, which both – gross profit dollar becomes
easier in the back end, too, so it's that spread. Separately, our sustainable model has always been to have organic
SG&A growth of 3.5% to 4.5% of any period, 1.5% to 2% of that driven by new stores. And I think, on a two-year
stack basis over time, that model should still be as relevant as it ever was before.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Good morning. To kind of piggyback on Meredith's question, just logistically over time with
the AmerisourceBergen contract, is there still going to be some cross-docking of branded drugs? Or are they going to
basically, over time, be going to Walgreens stores directly on a daily basis?

Page 13 of 15
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Andy, they'll be going to the stores on a daily basis. That's a big part of the
opportunity, is the improved service levels, frankly, over time. I think also, as Wade mentioned, certainly if there's
opportunity to leverage some of the space that we have in our DCs that's committed to pharmacy warehousing, that also
frees up capacity with our existing distribution centers for our front-end product as well. But yeah, we'll be leveraging
their ability to come to the stores on a daily basis.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay. And the second part of that question is daily delivery, really from my view, can really
increase your in-stock rates, particularly around specialty drugs. So can you discuss what the long-term – as more of
the pharmaceutical market and the value of the pharmaceutical market moves to specialty drugs, is that the underlying
– or part of the underlying reason for this agreement long-term strategically?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Love that question, Andy. Yes, I think that the opportunity to leverage that daily delivery
for all medications, but even in particular, high-cost specialty medication. So the patients can access their trusted
community pharmacist that they've known for years to pick up their special meds is a huge opportunity.
One of the things that really excites me and intrigues me is, obviously, of the wholesalers in the U.S.,
AmerisourceBergen absolutely leads in the specialty sector. So we think there's a lot of opportunity to work together to
provide new and innovative solutions for specialty. The other thing that I said that's intriguing with AmerisourceBergen
is their focus on health systems and in-patient meds and the fact that, as you know, we're working a lot of major health
systems with outpatient pharmacies as well. So there's a lot of opportunities along those lines, Andy.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: And just lastly, shifting to the Balance Rewards program and the membership strong numbers,
what can you talk about usage rates and how they're trending versus expectations? Just some color around that. It's a
very ambitious program, not just for Walgreens, but I think from what we've seen in the country.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I mean, I think we've been, I guess I'd say, we've been in heavy ramp-up phase with
more than 60 million members in a very large, let's say, a majority of our sales now on the card, it's really that
investment phase. As I said, [ph] I said all along (46:42) the magic now comes with redemption. Now that we have a
critical mass of people signed up, a critical mass of purchases, people are getting a significant number of points that
they can use. It becomes about redemption and turning that into [indiscernible] (46:55). And that's where I think, Greg
said, we're riding the horn on promotion. But to some extent, too, we're also exiting the build phase on loyalty and
that's why we see that as a win going forward.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Andy, I'll weigh in there. Think of this as, obviously, a new currency that it takes a
while for people to understand the value of that. And as they build points and then begin to redeem them, they begin to
understand the value of that currency especially in an economic climate like we have today. And that's what we're
beginning to see gaining momentum and we feel will really help us with the traffic in the front end as we go forward.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay, I mean, because a lot of the behavior you're trying to get is [indiscernible] (47:36) to
accumulate the points is to get people to buy a certain product. That is a different kind of modality, I think, than a
typical loyalty card and so that's what I was asking. Is that on trend? Are the CPG partners getting what they want out
of that, whether it's trial of a new product? That's what I was asking you to maybe shed some light on.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, like anything, obviously, there's some learning in start-ups. But what I would say is
that the loyalty card holders are – the feedback is very, very positive in terms of the program and, increasingly, the
ability to understand it. So I think we feel that we're in a very good spot there.
As we continue to tweak and refine in terms of what will motivate people, how do we make the CPG dollars and others'
money go as far as possible, there've probably been some refining and tweaks. But I think that directionally, we're on a
good track and we know where we're going to take this over time.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Hey, specifically to your question, Andy, we're encouraged by the basket size lift that
we're seeing with loyalty members.

Our last question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Thanks very much and good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Good morning.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: I just had two quick questions. First, just wondering, Wade, was there any benefit in the quarter to
gross margin from your purchasing synergies now that you have the purchasing alliance with AB, with Alliance Boots?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Well, there's about $25 million of total combined synergies of which the purchasing piece
was a big piece, right? And of course, without all the nuanced detail on the phone because of our JV and because of our
percent ownership, whatever, it's a little complex in terms of how it flows right back to the company. So yes, there was.
And again, we have the $100 million to $150 million run rate.
This quarter, again like I said, was circa $25 million but that's building very quickly. So we expect a very nice tick-up
here in the back half, in part because there is a P&L timing. When we get the cash benefit, it's different from when
some of this actually flows through our inventory and through our accounting.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Great. And then my second question had to do with ACA as we start thinking about exchanges and
calendar 2014 and we think that about relationships with exchanges. Can you talk about how you anticipate those will
be set up? Will the rates be the same as we see in commercial markets? So, therefore, if you have a relationship with a
large managed care and today you'll just get the increase in that volume would be my first question. And then secondly,
what are your thoughts in anticipation around Medicaid, whether it's fee-for-service Medicaid or direct Medicaid
increases and what that'll do for reimbursement as we start thinking about 2014?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Well, Lisa, I think a lot of that certainly is unknown at this time, although we're beginning
to see things take shape. I believe that the first opportunity the community pharmacy has, and we're certainly looking
forward to do, is to help people understand, educate and navigate to help the government locate folks who are eligible.
I think secondly, as far as participation in networks, I think you'll see all of the above. I think you'll see some preferred
networks like you are with Medicare Part D that, certainly, we want to leverage our existing relationships with to
participate.
Medicaid, I think with the expansion of Medicaid, it'll be interesting to see how states respond. I think you'll probably
see maybe – potentially, you may see more move into managed plans. But there again, I think we intend to work with
them in whatever way or form or fashion they're looking to go forward with, whether it's a preferred opportunity or not.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, Lisa, one thing I'd say about the ACA is even though a lot of it's unknown, it's kind
of unfolding before our eyes. I think there's very – two positive dynamics embedded in it for us as a community
pharmacy. Number one is the fact that, similar to Medicare Part D, individuals want to go where they want to go, and
so when there's a dynamic that allows people to choose what they want, we typically more times than not are able to be
a provider to people that want to go to Walgreens.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: That's a good dynamic. I think the second thing is by the nature of these over time, we'll be
looking to reduce the overall cost of healthcare for the patients and community pharmacy, be it more generics
utilization, be it preventative things that we can do on the front lines; screenings, consultations, a variety of things. We
hold a lever for that so we can – we would expect to be fairly compensated for what we do because the levers that we
can pull to reduce the overall cost of that are significant well beyond just the cost of the drug.

<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah. Lisa, I think both the plans and the government understand that finding, educating
this population to help them find plans that work for them is going to be even more difficult than with seniors.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: And...
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I think – go ahead.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: No, I was just going to say am I also correct, though, by, Wade and Greg, in thinking about this
that you have a leverageable fixed cost today that you probably have excess capacity in most of your stores that this
should be – all of this increase in volume, there shouldn't be a lot of incremental cost on your side to bring these on?
And, therefore, if the pharmacy of choice is Walgreens, that you're going to see this increase in volume without a lot of
increase in costs of finding those patients and bringing them in the door? Is that the right way to think about it?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I'd say that to some degree that's true. I thought you were going to say are we looking into
variable pricing and the answer is no. No, but yeah, for sure. Some will be incremental, but, also, there will also be
some shifts, I suppose, from mid and small employers, maybe others, that choose to go a different way and push people
into exchanges. And from that vantage point, it's probably a zero-sum game.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay, great. I appreciate the comments.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Lisa.
