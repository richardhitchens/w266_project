Good morning and thank you, List. I want to say just a few words about List Underwood before we get started with our
financial results. As we announced earlier this week, List will be retiring at the end of the month. He's been with
Regions for 23 years and has been a trusted adviser and valued member of our management team. His impressive
career spans 43 years and today marks his 90 earnings call with our company. List, congratulations. We'll certainly
miss you as you start your new phase in life and wish you the very best in retirement.
M. List Underwood
Thank you, Grayson.
O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.
Moving on to results. Overall, we're pleased and encouraged by our achievements and results in 2015. During the year
we focused on the fundamentals, growing and deepening our customer relationships while also strengthening our
financial performance by investing in initiatives that will drive revenue growth and create a more efficient and effective
organization in the future. As a result, we're a much stronger organization today and are committed to continuing to
build sustainable franchise value. For the fourth quarter we reported earnings from continued operations of $272
million, bringing our full year 2015 total to $1 billion. Earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.21 per diluted share
and $0.76 per diluted share for the full year. These results reflect growth and total adjusted revenue despite a
challenging operating environment.
Importantly, we continue to deliver results in categories that we believe are fundamental to future income growth
including checking accounts, households, Regions360 relationships and credit card accounts. For example, checking
accounts grew by more than 2% during the year and active credit cards increased 11%. We remain focused on
expanding and deepening relationships through our need-based approach to relationship banking and our 2015 results
demonstrate that this approach is working. During the year we delivered strong average deposit growth of $3 billion, or
4%. The mix of our deposits continues to strengthen as 92% are now low-cost deposits and as we have noted before,
our markets provide us with unique and competitive advantages from a deposit composition perspective.
In 2015 we achieved solid adjusted loan growth of $5 billion or 6% from the prior year. Adjusted loans and leases
include a lease reclassification adjustment, which David will speak to shortly. Both business and consumer grew loans
with total production for the year of $66 billion or an increase of 12% from 2014. Business lending had an excellent
year growing adjusted loans 7%. Commercial banking, corporate banking and real estate banking all grew loans. And
95% of our markets achieved loan growth reflecting strength of our business models as local bankers collaborate with
industry and product specialists to grow loans.
In particular, within corporate banking our specialized industries group experienced solid growth led by technology and
defense as well as franchise restaurants and the real estate investment trust lending business was strong throughout the
year. Consumer lending was also strong in 2015. Total loans exceeded $30 billion at year-end, an increase of 5% over
2014. Mortgage led this growth with loans increasing $496 million or 4%. Additionally, our new point of sale initiative
bolstered growth in indirect lending with increased loans of $339 million. Additionally, credit card balances increased
7% from the previous year, which drove growth in card and ATM income of $30 million or 9%. Total adjusted revenue
for the year increased 2% over 2014 reflecting growth in the balance sheet and investments we made to grow and
diversify our revenue. Capital markets income was exceptionally strong increasing $31 million. Our recent acquisition
of BlackArch Partners as well as our planned initiatives are expected to further augment capital markets income in the
future.
Wealth management had a strong year with income increasing 10% over the prior year. Our focus to grow wealth
management by continuing to retain, recruit and develop talent was evident in the success of our financial consultants
and insurance initiatives. During 2015 we executed on our capital plan returning 93% of earnings to shareholders,
which is expected to be one of the highest percentages among our peers. We also made several small but yet important

investments and acquisitions in 2015 that will help drive future income. These transactions were a prudent and optimal
use for our capital enabling us to expand our capabilities and product offerings to supplement future revenue growth.
With respect to the economic environment while the U.S. economy is still slow and steadily improving, there's a clear
significant pressure from the global economy. Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industries while
benefiting others. Consequently, we continue to closely monitor our energy portfolio. As expected, there continues to
be downward migration in risk ratings in this portfolio. These shifts will continue if oil prices remain at current levels.
However, we remain in close contact with our energy customers and believe that we're taking appropriate actions to
mitigate vulnerabilities. We continue to prudently build reserves, which now stand at 6% of our direct energy exposure.
As a result, we are cautious but we expect any future losses related to this portfolio to be manageable.
As we begin 2016 we remain committed to our three primary strategic initiatives. First, grow and diversify our revenue
streams; secondarily, to practice disciplined expense management; and lastly, to effectively deploy our capital. These
are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan. We continue to operate in a challenging environment
that requires us to focus on what we can control. To that end, as we discussed in our Investor Day in November of last
year, it's essential that we take more aggressive steps as it relates to expense management. Our goal is to eliminate $300
million of core expenses over the next three years, approximately 9% of the 2015 adjusted expense base. This plan
which is underway will help us fund our initiatives and build sustainable franchise value.
In summary, 2015 was a solid year for Regions. We accomplished a great deal while laying the foundation for future
earnings growth.
With that, I'll turn it over to David who will cover the details for the fourth quarter. David?
David J. Turner, Jr.
Thank you and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the fourth quarter details and then provide our
expectations for 2016. As Grayson noted, 2015 was a solid year for Regions and the year ended particularly strong,
which sets us up well for 2016. Before I get started, during the fourth quarter, Regions corrected the accounting for
certain leases, which had previously been included in loans. These leases had been classified as capital leases but were
subsequently determined to be operating leases. The cumulative effect on pre-tax income lowered net interest income
and other financing income $15 million and reduced the net interest margin by five basis points in the quarter. The
adjustment resulted in a reclassification of these leases out of loans into other earnings assets totaling approximately
$834 million at the end of the quarter. The company does not expect this adjustment to have a material impact to net
interest income or other financing income or net interest margin in any future reporting period.
With respect to the balance sheet, adjusted loan and lease balances totaled $82 billion at the end of the fourth quarter
and were up $1 billion, or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending achieved solid growth with adjusted
balances totaling $52 billion at quarter end, an increase of 1%. Adjusted commercial loans grew $563 million, or 1%.
Commitments increased 2% and line utilization increased 30 basis points to 46.3%.
Consumer lending had another strong quarter, with every loan category increasing. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30
billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter. Indirect auto lending increased 2% and other indirect lending, which
includes point of sale initiatives increased $55 million linked quarter, or 11%. We are pleased with the results of this
new initiative. Year-to-date, loans in this portfolio have increased $339 million, and we expect continued growth in
2016. Looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 6% from the previous quarter, and our penetration rate
into our deposit base now stands at 17.3%, up 160 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year. Mortgage loan
balances increased $81 million and total home equity balances increased $31 million from the previous quarter as new
production continued to outpace portfolio runoff.
Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $322 million, and ending balances increased over $1.2
billion during this quarter. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points, and total funding costs
remained low at 26 basis points. With respect to deposits, we are primarily core deposit-funded with 74% of our

deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low-cost deposits were 92% of total deposits. Approximately
half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people, and 50% of our deposits are from customers with
$250,000 or less in their account. This is why we believe our deposit betas will be a competitive advantage for us as
rates rise.
Now, let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable
basis was $856 million, essentially flat with last quarter. However, excluding the impact of the lease adjustment, net
interest income and other financing income increased $15 million, or 2%. Higher loan balances and balance sheet
hedging and optimization strategies were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter increase along with interest
recoveries. The benefit from interest recoveries is not expected to be at this level in the first quarter, approximately $4
million less going forward. The overall increase in net interest income and other financing income was partially offset
by fixed asset repricing. The net interest margin was 3.08%. However, excluding the lease adjustment, net interest
margin was 3.13%, or flat with the previous quarter.
Total non-interest income increased 4% on an adjusted basis from the third quarter, driven primarily by gains on sale of
affordable housing investments and by higher card and ATM income. Card and ATM fees increased 3% primarily
related to an increase in commercial bank card usage, an increase in a number of active cards of 3.7%, and an increase
in seasonal consumer spending. Service charges were impacted by posting order changes that went into effect in early
November and reduced non-interest income by approximately $7 million. We expect the ongoing impact of this change
to be at the lower end of our previously stated $10 million to $15 million quarterly range. Wealth management income
was down slightly quarter-over-quarter due to lower insurance income, partially offset by higher investment
management and trust fee income. Capital markets income was relatively flat linked quarter as revenue from new
product and service offerings was offset primarily by lower loan syndication fees.
Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the fourth quarter were $873 million. On an adjusted basis,
expenses totaled $861 million, representing a decline of $33 million, or 4% from the prior quarter. This included a
decrease of $24 million in FDIC fees primarily due to additional expenses of $23 million in the third quarter related to
prior assessments. The expected quarterly run rate for this expense is in the $22 million to $24 million range excluding
the impact of the proposed FDIC surcharge. Additionally, the fourth quarter benefited from lower expenses related to
unfunded commitment costs of $12 million.
Salaries and benefits increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter, primarily attributable to $6 million in severance-related
expenses. We also incurred $6 million of expenses related to 29 branch consolidations. Our adjusted efficiency ratio
was 63.4% in the fourth quarter, but excluding the $15 million lease adjustment, the adjusted efficiency ratio was
62.7%. As discussed at Investor Day, we will continue to make investments to grow our business; however, we must be
more efficient in everything we do. As Grayson noted, our plan to become a more efficient organization, including the
elimination of $300 million in core expenses, is underway.
Let us move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $18 million to $78 million, and represented 38 basis
points of average loans. This increase was primarily related to one large charge-off in the energy loan portfolio.
Total business services criticized and classified loans increased $117 million, driven by some weakening in a small
number of larger loans primarily within the energy portfolio. However, total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held
for sale, declined from the third quarter. Troubled debt restructured loans, or TDRs, also declined, down 1% from the
prior quarter. The provision for loan losses was $69 million and our allowance for loan losses was down 2 basis points
to 1.36% at the end of the fourth quarter. And at quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-accrual loans or coverage
ratio was 141%.
And regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices have declined, exposure remains manageable. Should oil prices
remain at current levels, charge-offs will be in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016. The energy charge-off
taken this quarter reduces the previous range of $50 million to $100 million. Additionally, we currently have just over
$150 million reserved, or 6% of our direct energy exposure. And given where we are in the credit cycle, the volatility in
certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and
fluctuating commodity prices.

Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During 2015, we've returned $925 million to shareholders, which included the
repurchase of $621 million of common stock and $304 million in dividends. And under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was
estimated at 11.7% and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common
Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. Our loan and deposit ratio at the end
of the quarter was 83%, and at the end of the quarter we were fully compliant as it relates to the liquidity coverage
ratio.
Now let me give you an overview of our current expectations for 2016. We expect total loan growth to be in the 3% to
5% range on an average basis, excluding the impact of the operating lease reclassification. And regarding deposits, we
expect full-year average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range. And commensurate with our loan growth projections,
we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase in the 2% to 4% range. Now, should we
experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range.
As a result of our investments, we expect to grow adjusted non-interest income somewhere in the 4% to 6% range. And
we will continue to make investments in 2016; however, we have also begun to execute our plan to eliminate $300
million of core expenses, of which 35% to 45% will occur in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted non-interest
expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from 2015.
We expect to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 63% in 2016 and positive operating leverage somewhere in the 2%
to 4% range. And we still expect our net charge-offs to be in the 25 basis point to 35 basis point range. However, given
the current price of oil, we would expect to be at the top end of that range.
In closing, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year. The investments we made in 2015 positions us well for
2016 and beyond. And we look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year as we continue to build
sustainable franchise value.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I will now turn it back over to List for
instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.
M. List Underwood
Thank you, David. We are ready to begin, excuse me, the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many
participants as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question
and one related follow-up question.
Now, let's open the line, operator, for your questions.

Operator
Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the
Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Ryan.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Maybe we'll just start off on credit, on first, can you maybe give us a little bit more color on the
loss you took? What type of loan was it? Is there any credit left? And then, I guess when you think about the reserve
that you've taken, the roughly 6%, what does your reserve contemplate for oil prices? And we've heard others say that
if oil prices stayed at this level, you could see another incremental amount of provision. I'm just wondering what that
number would be for you.

<A - Barbara I. Godin>: It's Barb Godin, Ryan. Let me go ahead and answer that first part of the question.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hi, Barb.
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: And I'll address the second part. The first part was an energy credit that's been around for a
few years. It was M&A activity, which originally led to the credit. It is a shared national credit. There're five banks
involved in it. We saw some distress in this credit in the early part of the year. So we have been working this credit
really hard during the course of the year. And it simply came to conclusion near the end of the year. And what we've
done is we have appropriately marked that credit. We've taken the loss on that credit, as you've heard, and we've moved
the residual balance into our held for sale. And we anticipate that we will have that out of our held for sale numbers by
the end of, we're hoping, January, but certainly this quarter it will be out of your numbers. And back to individual
credit, the charge off on that was approximately $25 million, adjust for rounding.
In terms of how we think about our reserve and look at prices as we work our way through our process, in the backs of
our minds, we look at our price stack, our price stack is roughly $36 right now, sensitivity $28.90, so we're looking in
that range as we determine and establish what those numbers should be. But we're also looking very heavily at each and
every individual customer, what their cash flow looks like, what our collateral looks like, what our asset coverage is.
We currently have asset coverage of 1.71 times on the E&P book as an example. So, again, in conversations, and we
had some ongoing conversations with our customers because we really do have a small number of customers, we still
believe that repayment ability is adequate with them. And, again, establish our reserves accordingly.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. And then, David commented in his prepared remarks that you're expecting charge offs to
be towards the high end of the 25 to 35. I guess from both a portfolio, whether it's metals and minings or some other
related areas, or even if it's across different geographies, whether it's Texas or Louisiana or anywhere else that's
exposed to oil and gas. Are you seeing any other sort of changing in credit patterns, whether it ticks up in delinquencies
or anything that's having impact on either growth or the overall credit performance?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: No, we're keeping a really close eye on all of that. There is some pressure, certainly, on
commodities in general across the industry, as you know, and that's just given the strong U.S. dollar, what's going on in
Europe and in China in terms of the dislocation of the markets. So there is some pressure there, but we've seen nothing
yet that is significantly concerning.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: All right, maybe one, just one last quick one. David just can you help us understand the
trajectory of the net interest margin? I guess maybe both based on the forward curve and if we don't get any additional
rate hikes in 2016, where do you think the NIM would trend over the course of the year?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, so, Ryan, I gave a little bit of guidance in terms of if we don't get another change,
we'll be at the lower end of our 2% to 4% guidance that we've given you. I also gave you a little bit of guidance in my
prepared comments in terms of barge and we did have unusual interest recoveries. We think about $4 million of that
won't repeat going forward. But we're looking for a relatively stable NIM. And this is adjusting, by the way, for the
lease accounting, so we were at 3.08 on net interest margin, five points related to lease adjustments, so 3.13 would have
made us flat and we're looking for a relatively stable – and just to remind everybody, that's been one or two points
either side of where we are for 2016. And so we're looking for that guidance in terms of growth in NII that we've really
been focusing on to be that 2% to 4% through the year. So you may see some unusual changes in a given quarter, but
you've got to keep the year in mind when thinking about NIIs or trajectory.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.

<Q - David Eads>: Hi, good morning. Maybe following up on energy. When I look at the – you guys had some
disclosure on the criticized loans, which I thought was pretty interesting. And when you look at it, the criticized loans
are actually higher on a percentage basis in the E&P portfolio compared to the oil field services. So I was wondering if
you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing that – has you more comfortable with the exposures on the E&P
side and I guess maybe a little bit less so on the oil field services.
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Again, it's Barb Godin, I'll be happy to answer that. As we do our redeterminations, and
we've just finished up our fall redeterminations, just about done. What happens is as you readjust the borrowing base
and, again, for fall redeterminations this year borrowing base adjustments downwards were a little under 8%,
notwithstanding if that causes an over advance. What we will immediately do is call that loan a criticized loan and
move it into a non-pass category. So again, that would account for the reason that we have roughly 48% of our E&P
book that is shown right now as criticized. Having said that, we have a rigorous process, as well, around our oilfield
services portfolio. As you can see on the charts that we did provide, 32 customers make up 75% of that portfolio. So
we're able stay in constant and close contact with them. Again, if we see any weakness there, again, we are very quick
to move it into a criticized category.
<Q - David Eads>: Just maybe to follow-up on that, on the E&P portfolio, if you have 400 – if close to half of the
loans were in – a lot of those were in an over-advanced position, I would think that they'd only be in a further
over-advanced position now where oil prices have gone since the redetermination was complete. So would that suggest
that criticized loans are – the real criticized exposure might even be higher than that?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: No. If I take the spring redetermination that we did, that was somewhere between – let's just
use roughly 15% reduction in borrowing basis. And now we're seeing that there's an incremental 8%, I'll round it up, on
top of that, so roughly 23% reduction in borrowing base. Remember, as well, in the industry customers get a six-month
cure period in which they're able to cure, and we have seen a number of customers – again those earlier in the year that
had access to capital markets and even now those that are still very strong, some of them have access to capital markets
and they're able to take themselves out of an over-advanced position.
<Q - David Eads>: Okay. And then maybe just as we think about the dislocations we're seeing in the markets right
now, I know it's fairly early, but do you guys have any sense of how that – if this continues, how that would impact the
strategy you guys have for growing the capital markets and wealth management business? Is there anything that's
particularly sensitive to market activity levels and that you'd be more concerned about the growth trajectory?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: This is David. I will tell you that we are creating these new products and services. The
driver of that is because our customers need that and we're looking to have a more fulsome offering to our customers
and we're out there talking to them and feel very good about where they stand right now, which is why I reiterated our
guidance for 2016 on things like loan growth being in the 3% to 5%. We're seeing in our discussions with our
customers, we still see the domestic economy being okay. We're looking at 2%, 2.5% GDP. And so there is this
dislocation that's happening here of late, but as we see our customers, we believe they need the products and services,
the capital markets investments we make and we think are going to be very strong and looking for that to continue and
help us get to that 4% to 6% growth rate that we're expecting in non-interest revenue.

<A - M. List Underwood>: Thank you, thank you.
<Q - Stephen Moss>: And I wanted to ask about energy again. Just wondering here with regard to oil, if declines
further to $20 to $25, let's say, what are your potential losses there?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Well, as we look at – and I'll ask Barb to reiterate and complete the statement, but we
look at our energy portfolio. We have got a very disciplined process of calculating probability defaults and loss given
defaults. We've got the redeterminations that we're doing on E&P portfolio twice a year and so we feel good about the
level of rigor and discipline around our process that drives that evaluation of how much we reserve based on what we
think the incurred losses may be. And so I think our confidence in that process is very solid. We're staying disciplined
around that process. And if oil prices continue to decline, that process is going to drive risk ratings down on some of
our credits. It will drive a higher level of criticized classified loans and it will drive how we reserve against those loans.
But it will be on an incurred loss basis and until that incurred loss occurs, from an accounting perspective, our process
is going to determine that. So, Barb? Do you want to add to it?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: I think what I would add to that is the operative word here being how long will oil prices stay
depressed. You mentioned somewhere in the $20 a barrel range and again, if it's in the $20 a barrel range and it stays
there for an entire year, it could be, in terms of charge offs, since it's not in provision, could be up to an incremental
$50 million. And that is based on some back of the envelope versus anything precise, I would have to tell you. But
again, that's not our view and I don't think it's the view of the industry at this point that oil is going to stay sub-$30 for
any length of time.
<Q - Stephen Moss>: Okay. And then with regard to the criticized level, you indicated on E&P it was 48%, I was just
wondering what is the total amount of criticized loans in the energy portfolio?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Total amount of criticized loans in terms of everything including the operating leases we
had, $900 million.
<Q - Stephen Moss>: Yes. Okay.
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: $900 million on 3.2, or 28%.
<Q - Stephen Moss>: Great. And then I guess one more thing. With regard to the margin, just a little more color here
in terms of short-term expectations for the margin. Given the first Fed hike, how would you think about the margin in
the first quarter?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, so I tried to give you a little bit more global view of where we thought NII and
margin was going. So when we start breaking it down, we get pretty granular. There's puts and takes either way. If you
just want to focus on that component of the December increase, we're probably benefiting in the $5 million to $10
million range in the first quarter. But remember there are some other things going the other way. You've got day counts
about $5 million dollars working against you, you've got the interest reversal of $4 million that I talked about in my
prepared comments. So I think it's better to kind of look overall at the guidance in terms of relatively stable margin, and
growth in NII in that 2% to 4% range commensurate with the loan growth that we've talked about of 3% to 5%.
<Q - Stephen Moss>: Okay. Thank you very much.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Geoffrey.
<Q - Geoff Elliott>: Good morning. Congratulations to List on your retirement. So on energy again, looking at the
build from 4.7% reserves that you talked about at the Investor Day for 3Q up to the 6% and then taking into account the
charge offs as well, to me it looks like almost all of the provisioning in the quarter related to the energy portfolio. Is

that the right way to be thinking about it, or am I missing something there?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: No, you're actually thinking about it right. If you look at the balance of our book, the balance
of our book actually improved. And we were able to reallocate that provision over to the energy sector.
<Q - Geoff Elliott>: Great.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: And if you look at the credit quality of our book and you ex energy, then the balance
of our book performed very well this past quarter. And we continue to see improvements in almost all of our credit
metrics. But if you look at, if you add the energy back in, and to Barb's point, there's stress in that sector. But because
the way our portfolio's performing, it allowed us to build reserves around the energy portfolio.
<Q - Geoff Elliott>: Great. That's clear. And then just to follow up, you've mentioned commodities a couple of times
in the discussion. Can you just remind us where the other commodities exposures are and how stress in commodities
beyond oil and gas could have some impact on credit?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: As I think about commodities, firstly, our [ph] book-in (36:40) commodities, we have
roughly $400 million in fabricated metals, and primary metals, another $430 million. So just to give you a rough sense
for the size of the book. And again, a lot of those commodities in terms of metals, that's also an indirect hit, so to speak,
from what's happening in the oil sector. Because they rely on a lot of those metals to provide piping, et cetera. And so
that's where we're seeing a secondary knock on effect and one that we're keeping a close eye on.
<Q - Geoff Elliott>: Great. Thank you very much. Oops, sorry.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Oh, and I said, we have a fairly minor exposure to agriculture.
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Yes, $800 million in ag.

Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Stephen Kendall Scouten>: Hey, thanks, guys.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Hey, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen Kendall Scouten>: Question for you maybe on the expenses. You had some nice progress here in the
quarter. I'm wondering, is any of that going to reverse out in the coming quarter especially maybe that $12 million on
the unfunded commitments that was saved? And maybe beyond that, are you still expecting about 35% to 45% of the
$300 million in saves to come out here in 2016?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: So we do expect 35% to 45% of the $300 million to come out in 2016. And you're right
that the unfunded, the reason we worked that out separately is that, that is not something that is expected to benefit, at
least to the degree we had in the second quarter. So we want to call it out separately so you could take that into account
in your model.
<Q - Stephen Kendall Scouten>: Okay. And just on a net basis, do you still believe that the $300 million really just
allows you to keep overall expenses relatively flat and maybe even still up on a total dollar amount for 2016?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, that's right, Stephen. We're calling for continuing to make investments to grow
NIR, utilizing our savings of the $300 million, at least a 35% to 45% of that, to help us keep expenses relatively flat to
up modestly from that level that we're reporting for 2015.
<Q - Stephen Kendall Scouten>: Okay, great. And then maybe if I could on capital and the buyback. It seems like you
got about $350 million remaining maybe relative to the CCAR ask. Could that be accelerated in the quarter based on

where the stock is trading now, with it under tangible book? Is that something where you guys can take advantage of
where the stock is trading currently?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: So any change to – so the $350 million is right. $175 million generally in each quarter. In
order to change the amount and/or timing requires an approval from our regulatory supervisors, and there is a
mechanism for doing that. But we have to assess that and can't guarantee there would be any change from what's
already been approved.

Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Hey, Gerard, good morning.
<Q - John Hearn>: Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually John Hearn on for Gerard. Just two questions for you.
The first back to the criticized balance for the energy portfolio, can you tell us what it was in the third quarter?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Criticized balance, it was roughly $300 million less.
<Q - John Hearn>: $300 million less. Okay.
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: I can get you an exact number after the call.
<Q - John Hearn>: All right, thank you. And then more broadly, the regulators in December, I believe, they expressed
some concern about underwriting standards for CRE and construction lending. Can you comment a bit about what
you're seeing in those segments? And are you beginning to see any changes since the comments came out?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: No, in fact, we're feeling very good about our book, CRE and construction lending, back to,
we used to have a book that was very heavy. Previously going back several years and we've taken a lot of lessons from
that to ensure that we understand what we're putting on our books and that we need to feel comfortable both in a stress
situation as well as a normal situation. So we have been very deliberate about what we are putting on the books. We
have not had very much growth, came off a very low base in terms of growing that book. And, again, very deliberate on
the types of credits that we're willing to underwrite. So again, from a credit perspective, I feel very comfortable.

Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning. Chris.
<Q - Christopher William Marinac>: Thanks, good morning. Hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask about where
acquisitions may fit in, in select markets if at all this next year?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Yeah, I mean, Chris, we certainly are very analytical and disciplined about how we
focused on acquisitions, quite frankly. Our primary focus has been on bolt on acquisitions in the non-bank space. In
2015, we did two relatively small transactions that you're familiar with. We continue to look at the marketplace, and we
still think there's opportunities in both our wealth segment as well as our capital markets segment, and insurance
segments for bolt on acquisitions. We continue to look. I think that the expectation is these are going to be relatively
small in size and still at this juncture we're – evaluations are that predominantly our interest is in the non-bank space.
<Q - Christopher William Marinac>: Okay. Great, thanks for that color. And, Grayson, if pricing did change, would
you reconsider the bank's odd, or would that have to shift a lot to affect that?

Your next question comes from Peter Winter of Sterne Agee.
<Q - Peter J. Winter>: Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter J. Winter>: I just want to go back to the 2016 expectations, the operating leverage of 2% to 4%. If the
revenues come in a little bit weaker than expected, would you guys let more of the expenses fall to the bottom line to
ensure that operating leverage that you're forecasting?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, we've looked at a lot of different scenarios, Peter, in terms of committing to the 2%
to 4%, or at least indicating that we could get to 2% to 4% operating leverage. There are a lot of different scenarios. We
believe through our expectations of revenue growth and our expectations of expense management, that we'll get there.
Now the combination of how we get there may change, and we'll adjust, adapt, and overcome. But our goal is to
generate that positive operating leverage regardless of the environment.

Your next question comes from Jack Micenko of SIG.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Jack.
<Q - Jack Micenko>: Hi, good morning. One of the industry conferences in the fourth quarter, I think you had
disclosed that you were moving towards the upper end on the branch closure range that you gave at Investor Day. Does
that still hold true? And then the second question would be the cadence of those closures, should we think about – is
there any kind of guidance we can think about in dealing with modeling some of those one-time charges that we saw,
like, in this quarter?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, Jack, so we did say we were looking at 100 to 150 branches. We said we would
probably be towards the upper end of that through our strategic planning period. We've announced 29. We continue to
look each and every day at how to best optimize our branch footprint, which has included even growing some, or
opening some new ones at times. But it's hard to get the cadence down to give you that commitment upfront because
it's all fact and circumstances based. We have to look at our footprint, what's going on in the footprint. We have a lot of
coordination that has to happen.
What I can tell you is, so we had a $6 million charge on the 29 branches that we closed, or made a decision on
consolidating this quarter. There will be another roughly $6 million associated with those branches. So it's, call it, $12
million. And we expect a payback on that of about two years, which is what we've had historically. So all branches
aren't created equal, they're all a little different. But if you go back and look at all of our branch consolidations, it will
give you a feel for what that charge might be over time. But it's hard for me to give you the precise timing.
<Q - Jack Micenko>: Okay, thank you. And then, obviously, you have a large – large portion of your deposits are
consumer. Have you been feeling any pressure on the commercial side to pass on any of the rate increase some of the

other banks have talked about it today?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: No, at this juncture, we just have not seen deposit rate pressures. Given such a fairly
modest increase in rates, the pressure from any part of our depository base has been very muted. We continue to watch
very closely what our competitors are and watch very closely what our customers are saying to us. But quite to the
contrary, we continue, as you saw this quarter, to grow deposits and, in fact, grow low-cost deposits at a pretty healthy
pace, and so we're just not seeing that particular issue arise at this juncture.

Your next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray.
<A - M. List Underwood>: Good morning, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Hello, good morning. You made the comments that you're looking at acquisitions in the
non-bank space. Could you describe that a little bit further and what targets you're looking at potentially in order to
expand your fee income?
<A - M. List Underwood>: Go ahead.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Sure, this is David. So as Grayson mentioned, we really – one of our strategic initiatives
is to diversify our revenue. And in this context, diversification is a way from NII and into NIR. As we think about the
desire to diversify and we think about how we can have a more fulsome offering to our customers, things in capital
markets have come to mind. So you saw our acquisition of BlackArch Partners, our M&A advisory firm. We've looked
at insurance entities and we'll continue to do that agencies, continue to expand there. We would like to have a more
solid offering in fixed income sales and trading, so we're looking there. And I think that these acquisitions have a
tendency to be smaller acquisitions, but they fit into our need and our desire to continue to diversify, and we think fit
very well with our strategy.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: And really serve the customer need, where you're trying to identify the needs that our
customers have and how we can serve those better, but at the same time, to David's point, diversify our revenue. But we
make sure that these are incremental in nature, bolt-on acquisitions that don't – that have a risk profile that we feel like
is prudent. And so I think you can see us – you should expect us to continue to look at those opportunities over 2016.
But our primary focus, as you've seen, is on organic growth in the markets we're in today, with the services we have
today, but this is in addition to that. But primary focus is organic growth.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Okay. And my apologies if somebody might have mentioned this earlier, but in regards to
your CCAR in 2016, you had a pretty big impact from the stress test last year. Given the decline in oil prices and where
you are now, do you anticipate a similar decline this time around, and how are you preparing for CCAR going into
2016?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Well, so we've got a lot of work going on with CCAR to be prepared for our submission
in April. We look at a lot of different portfolios. I think from a credit standpoint, we mentioned earlier that ex energy,
our credit portfolios are actually improving. And so that works one way in terms of the CCAR submission. Energy
clearly needs to be taken into account, and I think Barb laid out some of the stresses that we're seeing and how we'll
account for those.
So, from our standpoint, we have one of the strongest levels of Common Equity Tier 1 of our peer group. We did return
93% of our earnings to our shareholders, which we think was appropriate. And as a result, we didn't want to continue to
accrete capital because we felt like we had enough capital to run our business in a prudent manner. So we look at our
stresses all the time, not just from a CCAR standpoint, we do that for ourselves to make sure we're managing and
optimizing our capital in our company so that we have enough in time to stress, and – but not too much in terms of
ensuring we can have an appropriate return to our shareholders. So exactly how all this will manifest itself in CCAR,

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Hey, Stephen, good morning.

$50 million to $75 million in potential incremental [ph] off if the oil (51:18) stays around here. That's assumed just for
2016 as I heard it, and so would we assume that there could be further tail risk if oil prices remain depressed for a
longer period of time?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: That's right. That's a 2016 number, and obviously if oil stays low longer, then there is
tail risk to that.
