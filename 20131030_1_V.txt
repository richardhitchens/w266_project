Byron H. Pollitt
Thank you, Jack.
Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, some color on the fourth quarter's net revenue growth. As
reported, net revenue grew 9%. Three callouts, starting with gross revenue. For the quarter, it grew at a healthy 11%
rate.
Turning to the incentive line, during the quarter we closed 73 major deals compared to a quarterly average of 53 for the
2013 fiscal year. This resulted in an incentive rate of 18.6% for Q4, which is well within the neighborhood we signaled
on our Q3 earnings call. When combined with the first three fiscal quarters, incentives as a percent of gross revenues
came in at 16.5% right in the middle of our 16% to 17% guidance range for the full year.
Finally, the FX headwind, which has accelerated in the second half of the year, reached about 1.5 percentage points of
drag on revenue growth in Q4. The full year FX headwind was just under 1% for fiscal 2013. We expect this headwind
to continue to grow in fiscal 2014 to about 2 percentage points of drag on reported revenue growth net of our hedges.
Second callout relates to full-year revenue growth. We began fiscal 2013 with revenue guidance of low double digits
and refined the guidance to around 13% on the Q3 call. We end the year with revenue growth up 13% after observing
the impact of heightened deal activity in Q4 and a growing unfavorable FX impact.
Third callout relates to the most recent U.S. payment volume trends. While rest of world payment volume and global
cross border trends remain in double digit growth territory for the September-ending quarter, U.S. domestic payment
volume dropped from 11% growth in August to 8% in the month of September. While October's first three weeks have
up-ticked slightly to 9%, there has clearly been some constraint in U.S. consumer spend showing up in our numbers in
both debit and credit. Our guidance encompasses what we are seeing in September and October and presumes that a
tepid recovery in U.S. economic growth continues.
Fourth callout relates to operating income and EPS, which grew 15% and 20% respectively versus fiscal 2012's
adjusted results. Included in our Q4 results was a restructuring reserve of $44 million, representing about $0.04 of EPS.
This restructuring reserve reflects a streamlining of our cost structure aimed at achieving greater alignment between our
costs and our strategic priorities and capturing organizational efficiencies as we adapt to changes in our management
structure.
Finally, fifth callout. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. Three highlights. First, as
announced last week, we raised our quarterly dividend per share by 21% to $0.40. Second, during Q4 we repurchased
over 7 million shares at an average price of $177 per share, returning $1.3 billion to shareholders. Finally, third, we
announced a new $5 billion share repurchase program, our largest ever. Please note this buyback program has no
expiration date and is in addition to $251 million still remaining under our prior authorization. This means purchases
could take place throughout fiscal 2014 and in 2015 as well.
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is my practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction
trends for the fiscal fourth quarter, followed by our results through October 21st. I'll then cover the financial highlights
of our fiscal fourth quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2014.
Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 13%, on par with the June quarter's
13%. This was driven by a sustained growth in all of our regions. More recently in the U.S., through October 21st,
payment volume growth was 9% compared with 10% in the September-ending quarter.

Drilling down further, U.S. credit growth was 9% through October 21st, compared to 11% in Q4. Similarly, debit
growth at 8% in October, compared to 10% in Q4. While a decline in U.S. gas prices is part of the story, there is also a
modest downshift in other retail segments.
Global, cross border volume delivered a solid 11% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter, on par with the
11% rate in the June quarter. The U.S. grew 10% and the rest of world 11%. Through October 21st, cross-border
volume on a constant dollar basis grew 13% with a U.S. growth rate of 10%, rest of world at 14%. Transactions
processed over Visa's network totaled $15.5 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 14% increase over the prior year
period. The U.S. grew 10% while the rest of world delivered 28% growth. Through October 21st, processed transaction
growth was 13%.
Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 9% increase
year-over-year, driven by solid growth globally in both domestic and international transactions and, as mentioned
earlier, restrained by a significant increase in incentives tied to deal activity and a growing FX headwind.
For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was $11.8 billion, up 13% over the prior year and at the high end of our
beginning of year guidance of low double digits.
Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.4 billion, up 10% over the prior year and was
driven by solid global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up 12% over the prior year's
quarter, based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions inside and outside the U.S. and continuing strong
CyberSource transaction growth.
As we signaled last quarter, we have fully lapped the implementation of U.S. debit regulation resulting in revenue
growth that more closely approximates growth in processed transactions. International transaction revenue was up 13%
to $899 million, reflecting solid strength in cross-border volume and a continuing benefit from higher currency
volatility.
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up only 1% from the prior year results. Personnel costs were
up 6% for the quarter and 12% year-over-year in support of our growth strategies around the globe, which heavily
emphasize the investments in our country teams outside the U.S. along with our newer product initiatives. That said, in
Q4 we also took a $44 million restructuring reserve for the reasons discussed earlier. This callout's important when
considering our run rate for personnel costs as we move into fiscal year 2014.
Marketing expenses were flat from the prior year and declined 6% sequentially, primarily as a result of lower media
spend. Operating margin was 59% for the fourth quarter and 61% for the full fiscal year, both in line with our guidance
of around 60%.
Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 32.5%, and while higher than our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%, the full-year
figure of 31.4% was within our guidance range.
Capital expenditures were $138 million in the quarter and totaled $471 million for the full year. This was at the top end
of our expected range going into the year.
At the end of the fiscal quarter, we had 638 million shares of class A common stock outstanding on an as-converted
basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 644 million and for the
year totaled 656 million.
Finally, in terms of guidance, we had previously provided fiscal 2014 metrics around revenues, EPS, and free cash
flow. Let's start there. Given our expectation for a more significant FX headwind in 2014, we are reframing our
revenue growth guidance going forward leading with a constant dollar growth rate, which is consistent with the
payment volume metrics we provide each quarter and better represents the underlying growth and health of our
business. Then, we will provide the expected FX impact for the year.
So, for fiscal year 2014 we expect constant dollar revenue growth of low double digits and an FX headwind of around 2
percentage points.

A little further color on revenue. Given the continued slow pace of global economic recovery, combined with the
growing impact of a strong U.S. dollar, our expectations today are slightly lower than they were in June on Investor
Day. That said, our expectation for diluted earnings per share remains the same and continues to be mid to high teens.
Free cash flow guidance of about $5 billion reflects the partial reversal of a 2013 tax deduction associated with the
eventual return of Visa's share of the Multi-District Litigation cash payment as a result of merchants opting out of the
Multi-District Litigation class settlement. As I mentioned in June at Investor Day, this event, combined with the
non-recurring deduction in fiscal 2013 associated with our Multi-District Litigation settlement payment, will lower free
cash flow from $6.9 billion in fiscal 2013 to about $5 billion in fiscal 2014.
New guidance metrics for the full-year 2014 include the following: Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue will
move up modestly next year within an expected range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Our annual operating margin is expected to
show a very modest improvement over the past couple years, which means we expect it to remain in the low 60s.
Finally, we have made the decision to discontinue providing quantitative guidance on marketing expense, capital
expenditures and tax rate. We are moving in this direction because of the track record we have established since our
IPO in 2008.Given the progress we have made with, and now the stability of these metrics, we deem them ripe for
retirement.
However, having said that, and to provide some parting color, we would view marketing and CapEx as likely
increasing over time commensurate with overall growth but at manageable rates. While we'll always seek opportunities
to optimize our tax rate, we are not going to see the same magnitude of sustained improvement that we were able to
drive in the first five years of our public life. We expect to see more modest incremental improvement only.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.
Charles W. Scharf
Thanks very much, Byron and good afternoon to everyone.
I thought I would start out with just a few comments about the fourth quarter and then move on to some other topics.
First of all, we feel very good about the continued strong financial performance that Visa has exhibited with no
surprises to speak of.
As Byron mentioned our revenue growth of 9% and on a gross basis at 11% was reflective of heavy incentives during
the quarter, as we anticipated, and we just think of those as a good thing. That is, getting more long-term deals signed
with our clients is clearly a positive for us.
Global payment volume growth of 13%, consistent with prior quarter; expense growth of 1%, as we talked about
including $44 million of severance; 15% net income growth while we bought back 7 million shares for about $1.3
billion. All this contributed to EPS growth of 20%, again including the effect of those incentives during the quarter and
restructuring. All that added into the 2013 full-year performance of 13% revenue growth, 8% expense growth,
translating to 23% EPS growth, all in line with the guidance that we've been giving.
Let me turn now and just give a couple of updates on other topics, and I'll start with litigation and regulation. First I'll
start here in the United States. As I think most of you are aware, we are waiting final ruling on the MDL, the
Multi-District Litigation case. A decision is expected at any time. We continue to remain confident that the court will
approve the agreement as we've said in the past.
Also within the United States, again I think most people do know that the U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon ruled
on July 31 that the Federal Reserve implemented certain parts of the Durbin provision of Dodd-Frank improperly,
specifically related to the level of interchange and the networking provisions.

Just a couple of comments the Judge Leon ruling. First of all, we're pleased that Federal Reserve filed a Notice of
Appeal in August and that the Fed was granted a stay in July pending the results of its appeal. Our review of the appeal
papers filed by the Federal Reserve leads us to believe that the government has a strong case on appeal. Relative to the
timing, as best as we know there's no timeline proposed for when the case will be argued or decided; however, the
briefings are expected to be completed by December 4 of this year.
Over in Europe, we've talked about a series of things there in the past; there really is no new news with anything that
we've discussed, including the Visa Europe put.
Let me move on now and talk about tokenization for a minute. On the last quarterly call, I spoke at length about our
thoughts on tokenization and where we viewed our role. We made a significant announcement this quarter, which I
hope you saw. We, along with our partners in the industry, MasterCard and American Express announced a set of
standards to move towards a newly tokenized payment environment. This will serve several purposes.
First of all as we all know, it's just good for security. Removing sensitive information crossing the payment system is
good for every network participant. But probably more importantly for the long-term, it creates a framework as new
network participants emerge to ensure the security and the integrity of the payment system is in fact maintained, and
when I talk about the integrity of the payment system, I'm including protecting the position that we have and our clients
have in the value chain. And that's something that's obviously very important to us.
It's early days. They're just standards as they've been defined, but we're working both on the technical implementation
of these as well as the practical implications with more to come in the future. But we think this can lead to some
exciting things.
Next update, I'll turn to V.me for a second. We've spoken before about the convergence of physical point of sale,
ecommerce and mobile. You hear it everywhere you go. Our objective is simple with V.me. It's – people talk about
wallet sometimes as if they're very confusing to us, and what our goals are, they're very, very simple and
straightforward. We want to replicate the simplicity, the speed, and the security of a transaction, just like people have
today when they swipe, dip, or tap a card. It's that simple.
We've learned a great deal since I've arrived at Visa through discussions with issuers, acquirers and merchants relative
to our own development of V.me, and we're in the process of simplifying our product, becoming targeted towards the
goal of creating this simple, fast and secure online and mobile acceptance. The feedback has been hugely valuable.
Our product is going to be issuer, acquirer, and merchant focused. That's relative to the branding and the data flow.
We're working to make it easier to integrate into merchant websites and into mobile applications. And we've done this
in collaboration with our clients today, and the feedback has been positive, and we're optimistic.
Having said that, we have made significant progress. We have over 150 financial institutions and about 60 ecommerce
retailers offering V.me within the United States, Canada and Australia today, and we have an additional 300 merchants
signed and are in various stages of integration.
Let me move on now and just talk for a second about network security. In my year here, as I've gotten the opportunity
to talk to many of you and read many things that get sent across about what's going on in our industry, there's a great
deal discussed about the potential disintermediation of existing payment systems. And just relative to network security,
I just don't – I want to make clear that I don't think people should underestimate the value existing payment networks
have regarding security.
Criminals across the globe are becoming – there are more of them. They're becoming smarter. They're better funded,
and they're becoming more bold. They're attacks are becoming more frequent and much, much more complex. We as a
company and the established people in the marketplace here have been dealing with these risks for years, in our case 40
or 50 years. We've invested billions of dollars to secure our network and you just have to remind yourself people use
networks because they trust them, and they'll use them until they don't trust them anymore, and then when they don't,
those networks won't exist.

We understand that and work every day to protect our environment, and just keep in mind that risk takes several forms.
The first is just practical day-to-day fraud. We spend an awful lot of energy working on our data analytics as our clients
do to fight what I refer to as the common everyday fraud. Our transactions are screened by us and our financial partners
on a real-time basis. The modeling to do this has been developed over 40 or 50 years, and we've driven fraud rates
down to historic lows to the point where they're less than $0.06 for every $100 transacted over our network are actually
lost to fraud.
The second risk is the scary one, and it's perpetrators getting access to the network. Just to remind everyone that we
have a centralized processing and architecture that allows us to scan, evaluate, protect, and react to any risk that we see,
as necessary. As a company, as I said, huge resources, huge amount of our time as a management team, and we have
some of the most talented people and sophisticated technology to combat threats and are committed to continue
investing in this.
As we think about these risks, again I just wanted to point out these risks are very real. These aren't things that our
people are concerned about that might never come to fruition. They will go to the weakest link in the system. As I think
most of you know, the White House is directly engaged in this as is the President himself, and we certainly feel that
having the secure environment like our established payments network is a great place to be as these risks continue to
increase.
Now let me just turn and just talk for a second about the almost year that I've spent at Visa and just share a few of my
thoughts. Again, some of these – many of these don't relate to anything that I've done but relate to the broader team at
Visa.
First of all, this company has delivered growth consistently and delivered on what it said it would do since the IPO. I
personally remain confident in our ability to continue to grow the franchise over the long-term. The opportunities are
hugely significant. They're global, they're technology-driven, and they're based on partnerships that we have and will
continue to strengthen across the globe.
First of all, on globality, again I've had the opportunity since I've joined the company to spend a lot of time overseas. I
visited over a dozen countries. I've probably met with 40 to 50 financial institutions from the very largest to some of
the very smallest, met with two dozen acquirers, met with many merchants and government officials in five countries.
You all know and I think we've talked about this that our business outside U.S. is growing at a rate much faster than
inside the U.S., but the opportunities within both are still hugely significant. We talked at Investor Day that the
displacement of cash is still the big opportunity for us. 41% of transactions in the developed world are still cash and
check, 62% in the emerging markets. That translates to over 11 trillion of cash and check in our geographies, which
excludes Visa Europe and those numbers are growing.
What's been most striking to me as I've had the opportunity to travel across the world is the extent to which
governments understand the huge benefits of moving payments to electronic means and the desire to partner with us to
bring about this change and that's in fact what we're doing.
As I just alluded to, technology is also a huge driver of the opportunity we have in front of us. Cash is, in fact, the
enemy. Electronic solutions just are far superior. They're safer, they're more secure. We have some of the best products
in the world. Our products are accepted, if you include mobile points of acceptance between 36 and 40 million
locations across the globe, we have over 2.1 billion cards outstanding, a full set of products and again a tradition of
safety, security and soundness. We all know data and mobile create the opportunity to accelerate that electronification,
and we have continued and will continue to build out our capabilities here.
We've also talked a lot about partnerships. Our clients are much more than clients. They are partners. Our issuers have
always looked at us that way, that we are a strategic partner for them in building their business. We – when we talk to a
lot of people on the outside, they like to talk about the price of our network. When we talk to most of our issuers,
absolutely they're concerned about price but they're equally concerned about the ideas and the assets that we can bring
to help them grow their client relationships. And that's what we spend our time inside the company working to develop.
It's what's been done for years.

The same is true for the acquirers and I've said we're building this DNA and these capabilities to create those kinds of
merchant partnerships that we do have in some parts of the world, but we need certainly here in the United States and
elsewhere. We have a long way to go. We know it's critical for our success but we do want to be viewed as a partner to
grow their business at a fair price. And we will be flexible. We will customize our efforts here, as long as we preserve
the things that I've talked about, that are important to us and the network. And in short we feel great about the future so
everything we've been talking about, about our future is still in fact the same.
Let me just shift gears now and talk for a second about capital. Since our IPO, we've been consistent about how we
have thought about capital management and since I've come onboard I've reaffirmed the same principles that have
existed within the company. To date the company has repurchased the equivalent of about 151 million shares or about
20% of the company's shares outstanding, we've returned nearly $17 billion of capital to shareholders.
Let me just walk through a couple of principles which I laid out on a prior call, but let me just do again. We believe the
highest and best use of our excess capital is reinvesting it, first organically in our business, then through acquisitions to
further our growth. After supporting that growth, we believe in continuing to grow our dividend and we think about
targeting a 20% payout ratio of prior year net income. The final use is buying back our stock.
Just a few notes for a second. We treat decisions to invest our capital for both organic and acquisition purposes as
serious, independent, and discrete decisions and we conduct vigorous analysis on all of those. And so we get excited
when we find investments, whether they're organic investments or acquisitions that pass those tests and we're
constantly searching for ways to grow those things.
We also understand the value of a consistent and fair dividend to our investors. Our goal is to grow the dividend as our
net income grows. And our stated goal has been and continues to be to return the majority of excess free cash flow to
our investors. We've done this through aggressive buybacks and we'll continue to do this, always with an eye towards
valuation. We understand that when we buy our stock back, we're making an investment decision and, to the extent that
we are buying the stock back, that tells you that what we believe the future of this company is like.
As you've seen, we continued that practice through this quarter. We announced a 21% increase in our dividends from
$0.33 per share for quarter to $0.40 per share. This equates to 20% of that prior year net income, as I alluded to earlier,
and that's the way we think about it. We also announced our tenth and most significant share repurchase authorization
to date, which was $5 billion. Both of these decisions, as I've said, reflect our belief in returning excess capital to
shareholders and in our confidence of our future.
And speaking of the future, just a few last words before we open it for questions. Byron commented that through
August 21, we've seen solid payment and transaction growth across the world, some weakness here in the U.S. with
some strong growth elsewhere. As we've said, the recovery has not accelerated. Uncertainty certainly continues as you
look across the world, and our financial guidance reflects this tepid global growth and volatility in the foreign exchange
markets. We do expect one day to benefit from stronger economic growth, we just don't know when yet.
Looking ahead to 2014 and beyond, I continue to remain excited and energized about Visa and the opportunity that we
have to continue growing the business from the top line. We continue to focus on the same initiatives that we outlined
at Investor Day. The secular opportunity to penetrate cash and check PCE remains healthy across the globe. We're
working hard to expand the value of VisaNet. We're continuing to invest in our future and we continue to think about
being more flexible and adaptive to the business needs of our customers as we seek to become closer partners with
them.
So, In closing, I would just like to thank the 9500 global employees of Visa who are all working hard every single day

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. You may go ahead.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Thanks, guys. Just on the currency because I know it's unusual for you guys to have a
callout of this magnitude, is it mostly the volatility in the Brazilian real, or are there some other specific currencies and
you simply didn't have enough hedging in place?
And then, just as a follow-on to that, does the top line impact that we saw in Q4 and that we're projecting for fiscal
2014, is that similar impact on the bottom line?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: So, let me respond to that. So on currency, I'll just remind everyone, we hedge one year out on
a rolling basis. So, literally every month we put hedges on, hedges come off. So we'll never be perfectly matched with
regards to our foreign exchange exposure unless literally there's no volatility whatsoever in the rate.
We hedge 14 currencies. We do business in 180. The impact is not – does include the Brazilian real, but it's more than
that. It includes the Aussie dollar, the yen, the Canadian dollar. So there are a handful of currencies that have – that are
causing this impact, not just limited to Brazil.
The primary impact is revenue. There is a more modest offset in expenses. Obviously expenses incurred in other
currencies that are brought back to the U.S. dollar actually translate at a lower level. So, the impact on the bottom line
is moderated by the expense benefit, but it doesn't moderate it all that much.

Our next question will come from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yeah, a couple questions. First, the high deal volume in the fiscal fourth quarter, could you
please discuss, if you can, the pricing trajectory at a high level for those deals versus what you were seeing during the
rest of 2013?
And secondly just thinking about growth outside the U.S., we're hearing that the Mexican banks are lobbying hard for
Visa and MasterCard to be allowed to process locally. Any thoughts on those discussions or a timeline for that?
Thanks.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Let me take the first one. When we gave our guidance on the Q3 call, if – when we guided to
16% to 17% incentives for the year, the incentive rate that we ended up incurring in Q4 is very, very consistent with
that guidance and very consistent with how we expected deals to sort out. And as it relates to pricing, I would say
there's no major callout here on pricing.
I think the perspective we would leave you with is we were pretty much spot on in the end of year and Q4 incentive
guidance, which should give you some comfort around how we anticipated those deals to be priced. The reason, as I
alluded to in my remarks, the reason that the incentives are so high is because we did a significantly higher number of
important deals in that quarter. Something that's not unusual. It's why incentives are lumpy and we don't guide by
quarter. We guide on the full year and so that's the perspective we'd offer on that front.
Charlie, do you want to pick up Mexico?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Sure on Mexico, certainly and I think if you think back to the Investor Day, Bill Sheedy
talked a great deal about what we believe is the opportunity outside of the United States to increasing our processing
penetration. Mexico is certainly one of those markets. I've been there and we've had the conversation about the value
that we think our processing capabilities can bring to the banks and so we hopeful and trying to be helpful that our
processing capabilities will be useful in that marketplace.

Just on a related note on Mexico because I didn't cover it in my remarks but I do think it's an exciting thing for us, we
announced today that we've signed an agreement with a joint venture between Grupo Bimbo, which is the largest
Mexican-owned baking company, and Blue Label Telecom Limited, which is a leading provider of prepaid air time.
The significance is we've also talked a great deal about the opportunity to increase acceptance in the markets that aren't
as developed as the United States. This is an opportunity for us to work with the capacity that Bimbo has, and
potentially add up to 150,000 point-of-sale terminals, using their distribution capability. So it's something that we're
very excited about and when we think about increasing acceptance, we think about processing, it's certainly one of
bigger opportunities for us.

Our next question will come from – yes, our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMC. Your line is open.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Great, thanks. Just on the incentive line, the 73 major deals, how many of these were new
deals for Visa versus renewals? And then I guess, looking into 2014, should we expect a more normal year for deal
activity?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Well, we don't have immediately handy how many were new versus renewal. What I can
provide as additional color is the majority of those were outside the United States, with a heavy focus on the
Asia-Pacific and CEMEA region.
With regards to 2014, I'm not quite sure what a normal year would be, but we've given you our guidance relative to
incentives, and what I can say is that if we're to look at it, say, from the perspective of our top-ten global clients, none
of those are scheduled for expiration or renewal in the upcoming year, 2014.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: And I just want to add to what Byron said earlier, which is again we don't guide quarterly
on incentives because we know it's going to be lumpy. And this – while it's a large number, not a surprise to us, and
again to the extent that we are signing up people either earlier or more of them, we think those are good things and over
the course of the year those things tend to balance out, which is why we provided the guidance that we provided for
2014.
Operator
Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital. You may go ahead.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: Thanks. So as we think about 2014 a little bit more on the incremental investment side and
you mentioned a lot of things going on here. But you did highlight previously that about 80% of your investments
incrementally up to this point have been on products, technology, and infrastructure, and the remaining 20% was kind
of on international markets. And I'm just wondering it sounds look it might be tilting more towards international
markets and should we expect kind of the incremental margins from that to be similar, better, worse? Because your
margin guidance for me seemed like it was biased to the upside. Thanks.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Let's see, how to respond to that? I think that if you were to – I think those ratios continue to
work. I would say that when we talk about 80% of investment going into product, a lot of that is capital. When you
think of the investment that goes into rest of world and countries outside – other than the United States, and we think of
head count, a lot of that is going into our country teams and our – and we consider those investments because more
people – we're at our best when we are present locally, serving clients locally. And so the margins are highest when we
are leveraging transactions over the network in our core businesses, and they are less when we are investing in products
and services that begin to move away from the network. They extend the network but they don't directly – they're
transactions that require additional investment and additional costs in order to drive the transactions to the network.
And so the way we talked about it I think on Investor Day is probably a good way of continuing to think about it over
in 2014 and 2015. Charlie, do you want to add anything?

<A - Charles W. Scharf>: The only color I'd add is just where you wound up, which is as we sit here today and we've
obviously – we have our plans for next year and they're in all of the glorious details that you'd expect. We don't look at
the distribution of those investments as being at all significantly different than we thought at Investor Day. It's still the
same set of opportunities, the growth opportunities outside the U.S. have been hugely significant for this company. It's
where the majority of the head count growth has been over a period of time. So, we would expect where we invest to
look very similar as we develop the products and services that we've talked about.
Operator
Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks, guys. Just when we look at the volume trends through September and October, first
of all just comment on some of the moving parts here in terms of maybe the government shutdown impacting or any
other variables.
And then, when you think about your 2014 guidance, is that inclusive of this kind of run rate for the U.S. trending
maybe in the 8% range versus the – or 8%, 9% range versus what you've seen in the past few months?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: So on the first – on the U.S. side, I would say it is continuation – as we said in the remarks, it
is the continuation of a tepid recovery. And so, somewhere in the zip code of what we have been seeing is what we
would expect to see going forward.
And I'm sorry, the first part of your question was? Government – the government piece?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: I want to repeat what Byron said. He also said this in his opening remarks, which is that our
guidance encompasses what we are seeing in September and October.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay, that's helpful.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: And, as Byron said, our guidance presumes that we do have this tepid recovery, with the
U.S. economy.
And relative to the government, it certainly appears from our looking at our information, that the government shutdown
certainly has an impact, it's very hard to prove, very hard to understand exactly what the impact is, so it's more guess
than anything else, and certainly to the extent that the U.S. government can get its act together on the debt limit and on
the budget, we would expect that to change the trajectory of what we would see for consumer spend.
Operator
Our next question is from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn T. Fodor>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Charlie, just given your experience at a place that was
impacted by Dodd-Frank's debit regulation and the looming second round of potential actions here, can you just put
your bank hat on and share with us your views of if this does go through how issuers may approach their response to
further debit interchange reductions and or loss of exclusivity on signature, and how could that impact the networks?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Sure. I'll answer the question relative to, in my current job, conversations that we've had
with issuers and our sense for the way people are thinking about it.
Listen, I think first of all relative to the level of interchange, it certainly depends where the rule ultimately comes out.
When issuers first were dealing with the Durbin reduction down to $0.22, there was a lot of thought that went into
people's desire to support the product. And at $0.22, while people don't make much money on the product, the
consumers liked the product and they still felt a need to support it and we see strong debit growth at that point.

As the number drops – if the number drops significantly below that, people do have to rethink what that means. We
always have to remind ourselves that we can sit around and talk about what we like and our issuers can do the same,
but there are customers on the other end that are using these products and consumers like debit cards. They like to
segregate their money. They like to have control over what they spend relative to the amount of money that's in their
bank account and all of the safeguards, checks, alerts and all of the things that go along with that, and forcing consumer
behavior to change is a very hard and very dangerous thing to do, and not one that I think, at least that I could tell,
banks take lightly.
So we're still – depending on where the numbers come out – confident that the support will still be there, and if for
some reason people choose to look another way there are very good prepaid products in the marketplace, which are –
which could be important drivers of their business and our business as is the case with credit cards. And just to remind
ourselves, the credit card business is very different than it was ten years ago.
Credit card companies are predominantly controlled by banks that look at the entirety of the relationship and the
entirety of that relationship allows them to make credit decisions that they wouldn't have felt comfortable making years
and years ago. And to the extent that they can make those credit decisions, put controls and alert and parameters around
that that consumers like, that's certainly an option. So lots of things unfolding here, obviously, it depends on where the
appeal turns itself up.
And then, listen, relative to network routing, I guess the only thing I'd say on that one is that one is very complicated.
It's not clear that the system is capable of handling that today and the system thought about broadly whether it's
physical devices, whether it's networks, whether it's acquirers, processors or anything like that, and so that one I think
we will wait and see what happens in the Appeals Court, and go forward from there.

Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. Just a question back on the U.S. spending trends. I was wondering if there was
more elaboration around the trends. Byron, you mentioned certain verticals seeing impact as well. I was wondering
maybe what those verticals were, and maybe what consumer segments you might have seen the impact?
And then just one data point question. When I look at the card service to purchase volume ratio – that declined a lot
more in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter and I was just wondering if you could just help me with what
might have attributed to that. Thank you.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: With regards to the softening in the U.S. retail spend, clearly gas is important. We're looking
at an average price per gallon of – in October of $3.36, which for us is 12% below where it was at the same time a year
ago. And that shows up in a significant way in the shortfall.
I would say other verticals that show up, supermarkets, various elements of travel, a number of categories that we
would traditionally associate with small business. And when you look at the spread, it's pretty broad based, and I would
almost say after gas that I think what struck us with how many categories you would naturally associate with small
business.
With regards to the second part of your question, I'm not familiar with the ratio that you are inquiring about. Could you
rephrase that real quick?
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: I guess I look at card service revenues to purchase volumes. Card service fees to purchase
volume and that ratio's kind of in the – it was like 12.67% relative to the 12.75% last quarter. And when I look at the
year-over-year decline, that decline was a little bit more than what we saw last quarter.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Yeah. It's a metric we don't typically look at. So this is service fee over PV? If that's what
you're looking at, to the extent that we have been adjusting our pricing so that more of what we book ends up in data
processing versus service fees, as was the case with a major U.S. bank that recently signed up for ten years, that would

Our next question is from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Yes, I just wanted to inquire more about the restructuring actions. Can you just provide
more specifics on what the restructuring actions were and what prompted them and also whether there's more to come?
And then, I guess, related to this on a more strategic level, does the need for some restructuring recently mean you're
needing more levers to keep your margin trajectory? It seems that, given the inherent operating leverage in your
business, you probably don't need significant restructuring to hit your margin targets at this point, but I wanted to
inquire about that in case we're missing something.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: So let me start. We're not – we don't believe in using restructuring to manage margins. We
use restructuring if there are things that we want to do to right size different parts of the company. This is not expected
to continue. It doesn't mean that we won't learn things as time goes on and decide to move resources around at the
company, but that's exactly what this is.
The majority of this restructuring comes from a sharpened focus on what we're doing in our global products area. As
you know, we've had some leadership changes there over the past couple of months. We've spent a lot of time, as I
referenced in my remarks, talking with our clients about what we're doing, what they want from us and where they
want us to focus, and that has directed us to reorient our activities. And I think of that, by the way, as just those
activities as normal practice. If we're innovating enough, if we're doing enough things, some of those things will turn
out not to be – not to have all of the opportunity in them and we'll course correct and that's what we've done here. So, I
think that answers all of your sub questions.
Byron, did I cover everything?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Yep, I think that's good.
Operator
Our next question is from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Smitti Srethapramote>: Hi there. Just a quick follow-up to the tokenization discussion that you talked about
earlier. Just wondering what is the process timeline for it to move from being a proposal to being a standard and can
you talk about the timing on when these standards could potentially get implemented?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: That is a good question. Which I can't – I would be less than accurate if I was too specific.
The standards have been published. We have continued to put out some guidelines to our clients as to what fields will
have to be available in releases that will come out next year, because this tokenization work requires work and
acquirers and processors. We would hope that some of these solutions would be in the marketplace by, call it the
second half of the calendar year next year.

Our next question comes from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Hi, thanks. I was just wondering, could you expand again on the spending changes? Did
you see changes in signature and credit on your high end credit cards? You've talked about affluent consumers driving
a lot of the spending in the past. Did that change in September and October as well?

And then I wonder could you just give us an update at the end of the period in terms of what signature debit's
contribution is to volume revenue and earnings?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: We don't typically – I think we break it down between signature or what we refer to now as
Visa debit versus Interlink. I think the important call-out here is that we're now lapping the full implementation of
Durbin where we had a year where there was a significant and a permanent loss of debit share as a result of the routing,
and that's now in our base and so as we begin to lap that, the debit numbers are going to look a whole lot healthier –
growth numbers than they did a year ago.
With regards to specific reference to the affluent, as we have articulated previously, this remains an affluent-led
recovery. To the extent that there may be some lift on debit, at least in the U.S. that would partially be due to a shift
from credit to debit as a result of a drop in gasoline pricing. As the price of a fill-up gets more within range of
immediately accessible funds, it has been our – it has been our experience that we will see some shift from credit to
debit, but that's a result of the drop in oil prices and since they're in drop mode, that's something we wouldn't be
surprised if we saw at the next report out.
Operator
Our next question is from Bill Carcache of Nomura securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. Charlie, some investors have expressed concern over the inevitably of slower growth
at some point in, say the next few years, given that mathematically you're growing off such a large base. Can you talk
about your confidence in the sustainability of the current mid to high teens growth as you look to the future, and
perhaps comment on whether an eventual slowdown is something that you worry about, or is the run rate for growth so
large that it's not even something that crosses your mind?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Well, I think when you're new at a company that is growing like this, it's something that
you think a lot about and you look a lot about, so absolutely it's something that as I've gotten here – I don't know
whether "worry" is the right word but certainly spend a lot of time on.
Listen, I don't think that the opportunities for this company are significantly different than they were four or five years
ago. In fact, we believe that there are things going on in the marketplace that would suggest that the opportunities are
broader. And I'm speaking now. I'm not – and again I've said this. I know we are concerned about our quarters and
we're concerned about our years. We give guidance, we understand the importance of that, but here we're talking about
you know, our belief that this company can continue to grow for the long-term.
The dynamics that exist with cash and check across the globe is a gigantic opportunity. It will take us – and I don't even
know how long it will take us to actually conquer cash and check across the globe, but it's a very, very long period of
time.
We also look at all of the things that are going on in the world of technology that people initially get concerned about,
relative to our position. The majority of them, we look at and believe they're hugely valuable to us. The network that
we have, as I've said, it is really, really, really hard to duplicate what we have. A couple of people have networks like
this. There are always going to be niche players out there, but to tackle the global opportunity that exists in growing
payments, you need to have the size and the scale that some of us have. And so this is one of the world's great
platforms to be able to do that and I don't feel any worse and in fact I probably feel better about the long-term growth
opportunities from a revenue perspective of the company today than when I first joined. And that's consistent with what
I thought at Investor Day.
<A - John R. Carsky>: Brad, at this point we have time for one last question.

Your last question comes from Arvind Ramnani of BNP. Your line is open.
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: Hi, just one final question. If Visa believes in being a partner with the issuers, merchants
and acquirers, then why are there so many groups out there kind of putting hundreds of millions of dollars into finding
a way around Visa? Why is Visa not offering them what they want, anyway, so badly?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Well, we should spend some time with you offline because we've talked a lot about, and I
think I've been very, very open and honest about our need to do business somewhat differently in some parts of the
world than we've done it in the past.
So there's no question that the participants in the network have to do a better job of balancing out the role of the issuers,
the acquirers and the merchants. We've not treated them as partners as much as we possibly could, especially here in
the United States. Again, other parts of the world, you get a very, very different story. And at the heart of a lot of the
disagreements that we've had, we certainly believe that we've got the opportunity to change the nature of that
relationship, and that's why we formed the group under Elizabeth Buse, called Global Solutions. We're dedicated to
showing up with solutions to help them grow their business over a period of time.
I've also said this is not going to take one month, one quarter, or even a couple of quarters. It's going to take a period of
time. But listen, we have the tools, we have the assets, and we have the desire to do that, and it's on us to change the
nature of those relationships. We've started those conversations, and over time it will be very easy to judge our success.
But it's certainly something that we're excited about because we know that we can add a great deal of value to the
merchant community.
So with that I guess I'll wrap it up and thank everyone for taking the time and for the effort in following our stock.
