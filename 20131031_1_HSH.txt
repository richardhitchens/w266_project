Sean M. Connolly
Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before we get into our first quarter performance,
as I always do, I want to take a minute to touch upon the big picture at Hillshire Brands, meaning our core beliefs
around how we'll create maximum value for our shareholders over the long run.
Hillshire Brands is a focused food company with category leading iconic brands. We are committed to delivering both
growth and profitability and to do so sustainably. Accordingly, we believe in a very consistent and disciplined approach
to brand building and innovation across our core brands. Though we also believe in improving cost efficiency in order
to fuel our growth agenda, we've been relentless in this regard and we'll continue to be that way because at Hillshire,
cost efficiency is not a project, it is a mindset.
We are now one quarter into the second year of our plan to build a leading food company, and we feel very good about
the path we're on to create a sustainable winner for both our shareholders and our employees. Now let's jump into Q1
and our outlook for the year.
I'm pleased to report solid performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as we successfully navigated a challenging
macro environment. Our brand building and innovation investments continue to track well and our core brands became
stronger. We'll cover lunchmeat in a moment, but the headline is our merchandising programs achieved the desired
effect.
We continue to make progress on our challenged businesses, and we'll further those efforts in the quarters ahead.
On the input cost front, clearly we've experienced much higher inflation than we originally anticipated and therefore
are taking additional pricing actions. We'll cover that fully in a few minutes. We still expect to finish fiscal 2014 in a
position of solid growth, fueled in part by the strong innovation slate we have set for the second half.
Finally, a previously stated full-year guidance remains unchanged at this time. As you know, we are committed to
delivering growth momentum in the back half of the year, and Q1 was important in terms of laying the foundation for
that momentum. We expanded distribution on innovations; we launched late last year. You see several of those items
on the left side of this slide. We also continue to support our brands with strong MAP investment, including robust
advertising programs on Jimmy Dean and Ball Park. We recently activated a strong new slate of marketing programs
on Hillshire Farm, and we continue to expand our unique Aidells in-store sampling capability.
The bottom line is, these programs are having an impact. What you see on this slide is multi-outlet sales performance
from the retail scanner data. And not only do you see solid growth year-to-date versus the prior year, but you also see
momentum on key businesses in the last month, particularly the Hillshire Farm franchise, as our lunchmeat
merchandising and new smoked sausage advertising kicked in. I want to be clear, however, that you should not get
ahead of yourselves in terms of extrapolating these trends. That's because we now know we will need to take more
pricing than originally envisioned due to inflation, and clearly that will dampen sales trends. Nevertheless, we like what
we see. Now you just saw the strong recent performance on Hillshire Farm lunchmeat on the previous slide.
Here's a different look at the business that I think you'll find helpful. What you see here are the past 13 months of
performance on Hillshire Farm lunchmeat in terms on IRI dollar sales and dollar share data. Obviously we are pleased
to see the strong rebound in early fiscal 2014. As we said last quarter, it was important to us to recapture consumers
who drifted from this business last fiscal year following the packaging difficulties that we ran into. To that end, instead
of investing our Q1 lunchmeat marketing dollars in MAP, we invested in quality merchandising events with our
customers, and these programs delivered the desired effect. And Hillshire Farm lunchmeat again showed how
responsive it can be. We've talked before about a few businesses that are a bit more challenged than the rest right now.
We've made some real progress here, but clearly we're not done. Our bakery business is in need of innovation, so that's
what we're doing, both in Retail and in Foodservice.
Our Deli business has put up solid performance on the bulk side where much of the volume is, but the pre-sliced side
needs more attention. Short-term that looks like better price competitiveness, but longer-term it's really about different
thinking around innovation, more on that at a later date.

Finally, State Fair corn dogs has faced a more competitive environment than it has seen previously, which is requiring
both short-term pricing adjustments and some new product and pack-size thinking.
Now let's talk inflation.We expected input cost to be higher but not like this. The acute challenges we've seen in the
pork and beef markets were certainly not fully forecast and are driving major cost increases, and this is no longer
primarily a first half concept, as we now expect significant inflation throughout the year. The net of this is that we will
continue to take additional pricing on top of what we had originally planned for. In fact, we're already taking more
robust pricing actions as we speak, and as you can imagine, this will likely weaken volume trends as consumers
acclimate to higher price points. But we plan to mitigate this elasticity effect in the back half with continued MAP
support and a robust innovation slate.
Recall our long-term goal on innovation is to be generating between 13% and 15% of our annual revenue from items
launched in the prior three years. Historically, we covered around 9% on this metric. Last year we moved the needle to
11%, and in the second half of this year, we have very exciting new innovations coming on a number of our core
brands. We'll share more details on these new products following Q2, but I think you will really like them when you
see them.
Before I turn it over to Maria, let me add a few words on Foodservice. Overall, it was a solid quarter. We grew sales
and took the pricing we needed. We also advanced our dessert innovation agenda and launched a terrific new line of
double-layer pies. But at the end of the day, our outlook here remains modest as the overall industry continues to be
challenged.
With that, Maria, over to you.
Maria Henry
Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you've just heard and as you've seen in our results,
we had a solid start to fiscal 2014. Rapid movement in certain areas of the commodity market, particularly pork and
fowl, caused our input costs to be significantly higher than we expected when we gave guidance in August.
As we saw these higher costs materialize, we took pricing actions in our Foodservice business within the quarter, and
that helped us post stronger sales. Overall though, the higher input costs put more pressure on our gross margins and on
our operating income and you see that in our year-over-year comparisons for the quarter.
As we indicated we would do, we targeted additional dollars in above-the-line marketing investments in the quarter,
particularly in trade to defend some key brands in the near-term with pricing actions and in slotting dollars behind
innovation. Overall, brand investment remains an important part of our growth story, and we increased our total year
spend year-over-year for the quarter, when you consider trade investments, slotting and MAP combined.
We also closed the previously announced Golden Island jerky acquisition during the quarter. We've integrated this
business into our Gourmet Food Group business unit, which manages our Aidells and Gallo brands. While it's early
days, so far we've really liked what we see with Golden Island. And finally, we closed the quarter with a strong balance
sheet. And we continue to evaluate acquisition alternatives to create value with our assets and capabilities.
Now let me walk you through some of the financial details.
First, let's take a look at the quarter's financial results. Our adjusted net sales increased 1% on a 0.3% decrease in
volume. Our sales of commodity meat were less of an impact on the results this quarter than they have been recently. If
you exclude commodity meat sales, our adjusted net sales would have been up 0.8% on a volume decline of 0.1%.
As I've already mentioned, higher sales were driven by our Foodservice Other segment, as commodity inflation
triggered pass-through pricing. Our Retail segment sales were down modestly in the quarter. Gross profit dollars and
rates were down versus last year, primarily as a result of higher input costs. For the quarter, our adjusted gross profit
rate was 27.3%. This is down from 30.5% last year, when we had significant commodity deflation.

Our first quarter MAP investment was $40 million or 4% of net sales. We continue to be disciplined in where and when
we spend our MAP dollars. Where we do invest, we continue to see results. We're also driving productivity in this area,
which allows us to have a greater impact per MAP dollar spent.
You see in the numbers that for the first quarter, our MAP spend was down versus last year. This reflects not only the
productivity we have achieved, but also our decision to put some of our investment dollars in above-the-line marketing
activities, and the fact that we had a high level of MAP spend in last year's first quarter. As we expected, our adjusted
SG&A excluding MAP, was up versus the first quarter of fiscal 2013, when we had an unusually low level of SG&A.
Corporate costs were $9 million for the quarter, slightly behind a normalized run rate because of timing. We still expect
to be tracking to about $60 million for corporate expenses for the year.
The net of all of this is that our adjusted EPS was down 28.6% for the first quarter off of a very strong comparable in
the first quarter of last year when our adjusted EPS was up 88%.
As I said on the last call that fiscal 2014 would have exaggerated quarterly comparison against fiscal 2013. And you're
seeing that in our numbers. Our goal is to fundamentally improve the profitability of our business from where we
began. We will have some ups and downs in any given period because of commodity cost fluctuations, but we're
working to move the centerline of our profitability up over time through brand building, innovation, and cost
efficiency.
When you compare our first quarter results with our fiscal 2012 baseline year, as we do on this slide, you can see that
we are making progress. Now let's look at the segments. Our Retail segment sales were down 0.7%, a positive
performance of our Jimmy Dean, Ball Park, and Aidells businesses were offset by our near-term pricing and
merchandising investments in lunchmeat and corn dogs as well as increased slotting investment behind innovation.
Operating income was down 27.8% compared to an increase of 46% in the first quarter of last year. The Retail segment
results were affected by the significant commodity input cost inflation, as well as the near-term defensive actions that
we've been discussing.
In our Foodservice/Other segment, first quarter sales grew 5.7%, driven by increased prices as we pass through higher
input costs. Excluding commodity meat sales, Foodservice net sales were up 5.2%. Operating segment income was up
only slightly as increased pricing mostly offset higher input cost inflation in this segment. The operating segment
margin of 9.2% is expected to be the high for the year because of favorable mix in the first half of the fiscal year, and
some delayed spending by our Foodservice team in the first quarter. So you shouldn't extrapolate the 9.2% margin for
the year.
The Foodservice industry overall continues to be a tough space, and while we are outperforming the market and taking
share in some important spots, we expect our margins to continue to be under pressure in this area.
Moving on to cash. Our adjusted cash flow was a use of cash of $12 million, including the cash paid for Golden Island,
and $10 million of share repurchases. Our adjusted EBITDA was 11% of net sales overall. We ended the quarter with a
strong balance sheet. As of the end of the quarter, we had $369 million of cash and short-term investments, and we are
well positioned to execute the growth agenda that we've outlined. Our capital allocation plan has not changed. Our first
priority continues to be investing in the business. Our investments in brand building, innovation, capability
development, and efficiency programs are targeted at creating long-term sustainable growth and profitability. In the
quarter, we've repurchased $10 million of stock as part of our plan to repurchase $200 million over 2 years.
And finally, we continue to pursue additional M&A opportunities to drive value. Our fiscal 2014 guidance remains
unchanged. We continue to expect sales to increase slightly in fiscal 2014. Our outlook incorporates the expected
benefit of higher pricing and innovation launches being somewhat offset by volume softness, as consumers react to
higher prices.
Our EPS outlook for fiscal 2014 remains flat-to-down mid single digits. This incorporates the sales estimate I just
spoke about, our expectation of significantly higher input cost for the year, continued investment behind brand building
and innovation, the benefit of our savings initiative, helping to offset inflation, and the lapping of onetime benefit we

experienced in SG&A in fiscal 2013.
So let me wrap it up. We had a solid first quarter with sales coming in a bit better and earnings down year-over-year, as
expected, against a big comp last year and higher-than-anticipated commodity input cost inflation. The inflation we've
spoken about, continued competitive pressure, as well as a tough macro environment create a challenging operating
landscape.
We are navigating through this and remain committed to our growth agenda and value-creation plan. Our efficiency
programs remain on track, and we continue to make progress on establishing a continuous cost management mindset in
our culture. And finally, we're holding the guidance for the year.
So with that let me go ahead and open it up for questions. Sue?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from
Robert Moskow. Sir, you may ask your question and please state your company name.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi. It's Credit Suisse. So, just one clarification, Maria: there's a line item here called 'cash
used to invest in short-term investments' on the cash flow statement. I guess I wanted to know what that was. And I'm
going to jam in the second question. Can you give us an order of magnitude of what kind of pricing to expect for the
year, and how it flows in Retail or Foodservice? Is pricing on retail going to go up significantly? Or is this really just a
Foodservice pricing action? Thanks.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure, Rob. On the short-term investments, what we did is we have a significant amount of cash,
as you know, in the balance sheet. And so what we did is we moved some of the cash to short-term investments in
order to increase the yield. All of the investment vehicles that we have though are short term in nature. And so when we
did that, we reclassified it on the balance sheet. The way that I think about it is I think of the total of both cash and the
short-term instruments that we're now using as available cash. So that's what – that's what that is. And that was just to
get a little bit more in terms of yield.
In terms of pricing, our intent is to price against higher commodity. Now in Foodservice, as you know, we've got a
substantial amount of pass-through pricing that we're able to take. The Foodservice team did a really good job getting
out in front of the commodity movement that we were seeing very quickly. So we saw the benefit of that in
Foodservice in the first quarter.
In the Retail business, as you know, that takes a little bit more time to get pricing into the market. So we are taking
pricing. We expect to take additional pricing based on what we're seeing in the commodity markets. And, Sean, you
may want to comment more on our philosophy there.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Sure. Obviously, our game plan all along has been to recover inflation with pricing, and for
competitive reasons, I can't get into specifics on our exact pricing plans, obviously. But we've done this historically.
We've recovered inflation with pricing. And the way it works is pretty simple. In deflationary times, we tend to over
recover, which gives a boost to earnings. And then in inflationary times, earnings tend to be pressured because we don't
tend to recover 100% of the cost increase in a given period. But over the long term, it does net out as a full recovery or
slightly better.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay. I'll pass it along. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Lazar. You may go ahead with your question, and please state your
company name.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Barclays. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: I guess with respect to some of the pricing actions that you're currently engaged in taking, is it
your sense that you're – Hillshire's in sort of a leadership role there or perhaps following? We're just hearing,
obviously, somewhat of a different story from some other industry players where it sounds a little less rational. And I
guess more importantly, I know when you took pricing several years ago, there were certain areas where you needed to
kind of roll some of that back with some – where the gaps got a little bit too large, I think, for where the brands were at
least then from a brand health perspective. You've obviously done a lot in the last year plus around some of that. So, I
guess, I'm trying to get a sense of your confidence level around being able to take this pricing and perhaps have some
price gaps widen a bit, given where the brand health is today.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Sure. It's a great question. I would characterize our overall pricing analytics and game plan
as significantly advanced versus where we were a couple of years ago. As I think we've talked before, we are pretty
buttoned up when it comes to understanding price elasticities, price gaps, price thresholds. And we deploy a whole
suite of approaches to taking pricing whether it's taking a list price increase, whether it's adjusting our trade spend
downward, whether it's downsizing a particular package so that we can stay below a price threshold. And obviously,
the actions we take are informed by all of those analytics.
So there are businesses where we may lean in a little bit harder and businesses where we may lean in a little bit less
because they're not in a position to take it. So it's – we approach it very analytically and we feel good about our
philosophy on this and our capabilities on it. And it's the right thing to do. Now obviously, we need to stay agile in this
space. So we need to look – we need to continue to track the movements in inflation cost. We need to stay focused on
executing our game plan. But we need to stay agile, because if our assumptions are wrong, we've shown that we can
move quickly to adjust. So, I feel pretty good about it overall.
With respect to your question on the environment that's out there, let's face it, the consumer is seeing a lot of
uncertainty right now. And when that happens, they get very discerning, particularly about the products that they buy.
That's why product innovation is so important to our plans, and it's not just about low price. It's about perceived value,
and that's really what we're trying to drive.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from John Baumgartner. You may go ahead with your question, and please state
your company name.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Thank you. It's Wells Fargo. Sean, in terms of Foodservice, anything you can speak to in
particular relating to Hillshire-specific execution across channels? Any convenience or product mix, which may be
notable or changed since last quarter you can point to?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I think the overall message on Foodservice is that the space, on average, has been in a
bit of a cyclical malaise. And in that type of environment, what we try to do is get down into the granularity of where
can you drive growth. And you make a good point that some of it is what I'll call the sub channels of Foodservice. A
good example of that would be the convenience store channel, which is a focal point for my Foodservice team, and they
are putting up good points on the board in C stores. And a lot of it is branded, by the way. So it's – I would characterize
it as not only volume and net sales, but it's also strategic because it advances our brand equities.
But at the end of the day, when you've got $1 billion Foodservice segment like we do, a lot – you have to make it work
in the traditional Foodservice channels, broad line distributors, restaurants, et cetera. And we believe in – the type of

environment we're in right now, the name of the game there is to win market share. And the way you're going to win
market share, really, is not done well through price reductions. It's done well through innovations and coming up with
new products that are extremely tempting to these otherwise very discerning operators. And a good example of that is
this pie product we launched this year in the first quarter called Luxe Layer pie. It's literally a 2-layer pie. It is the only
one of its kind in the world, and it's early days, but it's the kind of thing that's helping us to pick up some share in an
otherwise challenging environment.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Great. Thanks, all.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Jason English. You may go ahead with your question, and please state your
company name.
<Q - Varun S. Gokarn>: Hi, guys. It's Varun Gokarn in for Jason at Goldman. I wanted to focus on some of the
volume drivers that are a little independent of price. Golden Island seems to be an acquisition that's pretty similar to
what Hershey did with Brookside. You've got Costco exposure and the potential to expand that distribution in other
channels. So my question is what are your distribution expansion plans there? Will that require any additional CapEx or
investment on advertising? And then what do you expect the timeline on that kind of build out to be?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: So the question is really around our plans with jerky if I can paraphrase a little bit, and we
have not unveiled those plans yet. And we're not prepared to unveil them today. Obviously, it's a competitive space.
We view Golden Island acquisition as a great initial entry point into a very attractive category. Their capabilities, we
think, are outstanding, in terms of the product quality that they've got. And currently, you're right. It is a small business,
and it's largely focused at Costco and it' s performing exceedingly well there. So all of that's good. Obviously, our plans
in this space are bigger than just the status quo, and we're continuing to refine them, and we'll be back at a later date to
share a bit more on that, including what kind of marketing support those plans will require, and what kind of capital
investment.
<Q - Varun S. Gokarn>: Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Goldman. You may go ahead with your question, and please state your
company name.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: It's JPMorgan. Thank you for the question. Maria, can you help detail which commodities, in
particular, have come in significantly higher than what you expected? And to what extent does your guidance factor the
potential impact from the porcine virus on the hog supply? Because it sounds like, starting in January, we'll see supply
drop as a result of the virus. So just hoping to get your thoughts on whether that's baked into your numbers.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure, Ken. On our commodities, as we talk about, just to frame it all up, as a reminder, we said
that – excuse me, 60% of our cost of goods is commodities and of that, 60% is meat related. So you get to a number
somewhere around the $1 billion mark. We've also said that in terms of the weighting within our commodity meat
basket, we are tipped to pork. And when I talk about pork, I'm talking about pork and sows there. There has been a
significant impact from PEDV on the sow market and sow pricing, both on pork and sows. So we are heavily affected
with what's going on there.
And as you probably know, we had a spike early and then the number of reported cases was coming down. And now
the number of reporting cases is going back up, and that reeks a bit of havoc on that piece of the market and particularly
around pork and sows. Sean also mentioned that beef is continuing to be inflationary with some of the things that are
going on in that market, and you guys look at the same data that we look at and you see what's happening with live

cattle prices. Lean hogs have been on a run, and sows are significantly up. All of that affects our input cost.
So the comments that we've made today and the fact that we are holding our guidance takes into account what we see
happening in the commodity market through the end of our fiscal year. As we said, we intend to cover commodities
through pricing over time. The question will be: if we put pricing into the market, how much coverage are we able to
get into this fiscal year and exactly how the consumer reacts to higher price point and what the effect of the higher
pricing is on our volumes. So we've taken into account our expectation on all of that when we affirmed our guidance.
And we're just through the first quarter, pleased with what we did on the top line this quarter and we'll have to see how

Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Zaslow. You may go ahead with your question, and please state your
company name.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Ken Zaslow, Bank of Montreal. Good morning everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Just – I know you guys have done a lot of analytics. Can you talk about which brands do
you think have the least degree of elasticity when you're raising pricing and which ones, you know, can you just talk
about how your analytics work and how you're seeing which brands are the least elastic to price increases?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Sure. As I think many of you know elasticities of demand are dynamic. They're influenced
by a lot of things, but it's – to answer your question, it's really actually a very simple answer. Where we are performing
the best in the current environment is where we are farthest along on our brand building and innovation efforts. And
those are the brands that are perceived to have the highest value to our consumers, and therefore the consumers when
they go to the shelf, if they see a small price increase they tend not to overreact because they have a tremendously
strong affinity for that brand. In brands within the portfolio where we are – we've either not begun or we're in early
days of the brand building innovation effort, obviously, the level of affinity the consumer has for that brand is not as
great as it is say on Jimmy Dean, some of the brands that are the strongest in the portfolio.
So it's – I think the key point behind all of this is, this is core to the philosophy of how we run this company, which is
we have been and will continue to be focused on building this business for sustained long-term value creation. And that
means building stronger brands through consistent MAP support and innovation, as well as this continuous
improvement mindset that we've got on costs. And if we find ourselves in any given year in an environment where
input costs move significantly, we will look to strike the right balance between near-end profitability and investing for
the long run. But in a year like this year of cost going against us, it means we will take price but we won't abandon
marketing and innovation just to inflate short-term performance. That's the way the business was run in the past and
we're committed to really doing what's right to drive the centerline of our profitability continuously north here over
time.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. I appreciate it.

company name.
<Q - Gretchen Guo>: Hi. This is Gretchen calling in for Alexia at Sanford Bernstein. Maria, can you give more color
around the productivity MAP spending that you mentioned? What changes are you making to make that more efficient?
And does that change how you think about your long-term goals for MAP spend levels? Thanks.

<A - Maria Henry>: Thanks for the question, Gretchen. In terms of the MAP productivity, there's 2 areas where we're
driving MAP productivity. The first is in the split between working and non-working MAP. And we've continued to
drive down the mix of nonworking MAP for the total amount that we've spent through various productivity initiatives.
The second area is getting more productivity and more hits per dollar of MAP spend that we have. And Sean's probably
much more – able to talk about those things than I am. So let me turn that over to him, but it's really in those 2 areas.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I appreciate you handing over to me because I did want to address our MAP support
in quarter 1. I would characterize our MAP support in quarter 1 as excellent. Our GRPs, which really are the touch
points that we have with our consumers with our advertising whether it's on TV or online, were up double digits overall
in the first quarter. And that is despite a planned reduction on Hillshire Farm advertising where instead we shifted our
investment into lunchmeat merchandising, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks.
And as Maria points out, working MAP dollars were up in the quarter, while we reduced non-working spend as part of
our overall efficiency programs. And on that, just, I think the point on our efficiency programs is simple, which is, if
we confront inflation levels that are higher than we expected, we need to try to accelerate as many of the efficiency
programs that we've got in place to the degree we can execute them. And we did some of that in terms of MAP
efficiency in quarter 1. And the last thing I'll just point out here on MAP as I've said a number of times, don't straight
line out our MAP line to the 5% long-term target.
Recall last year, we closed the year at 4.4%, which, frankly, was higher than where we expected to be. And the only
reason we ended up at 4.4% is because we had a bunch of deflation, and we invested a good portion of that back into
MAP. But Q1 last year was unusually high. It was a 4.7% MAP rate out of the gate, and it's because we had a lot of
things to get done, but I feel quite good about the overall MAP level we had in quarter 1, especially given our priorities
on Hillshire Farm were merchandising.
<Q - Gretchen Guo>: Great. Thanks so much for the color. It's really helpful.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Akshay Jagdale. You may go ahead with your
question, and please state your company name.
<Q - Lubi John Kutua>: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Lubi on for Akshay over at KeyBanc. You've talked a
little bit about pricing potentially having a dampening effect on volume growth, as we move through the year.
However, I think, net-net, you're still expecting some improvement in volumes in the back half, driven by an additional
MAP support and innovation initiative. So my question is, first, am I correct in saying that in aggregate, you expect an
improvement in volume in the back half? And then if so, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what gives you
confidence in that outlook given that the consumer environment still remains relatively weak?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Sure. Great question. The way it works, at least in just about any of the categories I've
worked in my career, when you take price increases, the greatest consumer reaction to the price increase you tend to get
is in the early days after the price increase. And then the question is how long does it take until they adapt to the new
pricing, and you kind of get your run rates back and running. So with respect to our sales guidance, I think our key
point is that we still expect to build momentum in the sales trends as the year unfolds and close out the year with
momentum heading into fiscal 2015.
Now nearer term, we've got some drags on the top line here with increased pricing will be rolling into the marketplace,
but we believe we have the actions in place to close the year in a solid position and driven in part by this innovation
slate that we've got queued up in the back half of the year, which we'll share with you all later, which we feel very good
about.
<A - Maria Henry>: Lu, I'd also add that we've provided outlook on sales and not volumes. So we've made some color
commentary around volumes that when we expect to see happen with volumes as we put additional pricing out into the

market. The back half comment that we've made with increased momentum has to do with our sales lines, just to be
clear.

Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Perkins. You may go ahead with your question, and please state your
company name.
<Q - Ken Perkins>: Good morning. It's with Morningstar. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a quick question
on your MAP spending. You've done a lot more above the line in the first quarter, so I'm wondering if you think about
your total pricing algorithm. If you can kind of walk us through how you're thinking about the MAP spending above
and below the line as you look to price over the input cost increases.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, we don't guide to – on an annual basis, to where we expect to be a MAP. What we've
said before is that what we'll call total marketing spend above the line and below the line is expected to increase
year-on-year and that encompasses below-the-line advertising investments as well as innovation investments, trade
spend, and new item slotting.
And how we deploy that increase always depends upon a number of factors, namely the competitive environment, our
innovation calendar, et cetera. So we – that's about the level of detail we get into on that. But overall, I want to continue
to make the point that the way we want to run this business is with more and more emphasis on innovation and
below-the-line marketing, equity-building marketing. We want to compete on the basis of the strength of our brands,
not on the basis of the lowest price on average. That is really core to our philosophy.
<Q - Ken Perkins>: Okay. So is it fair to just assume then that the rest of the year will sort of look at least like the first
quarter in terms of that?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: No. I don't think we'll guide to what our specific MAP spend, as I said, looks like in any
given year. But what I'll say is, look, we will continue to focus our energy on brand building and innovation and that
means we'll continue to support our brands in a healthy way.
<Q - Ken Perkins>: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Ramey. You may go ahead with your question and please state your
company name.
<Q - Tim S. Ramey>: Hi. It's D. A. Davidson. So just to kind of clarify your response to a question a couple of
moments ago. I mean, it just mathematically, it sounds like you're saying that volume will go meaningfully negative for
maybe 2Q and 3Q in order for the MAP to work out. I mean, we've got volume. We've got price-mix to get to a slight
increase in sales. And you said that pricing would be meaningfully up. I know you're not wishing to give volume
guidance, but are we right in thinking that we should be thinking sort of down low to mid-single-digit volume in the
2Q, 3Q?
<A - Maria Henry>: Tim, As you know, and as you just stated, I don't want to get into giving volume guidance. But
when you hold the guidance of sales to increase slightly, and we talked about the pricing that we're going to put into the
market, you can back into the fact that we are expecting to see some pressure on volumes as consumers adjust to the
higher price points that we expect to have in the market.
<Q - Tim S. Ramey>: Okay. So with that said, then, how is it that – I think you also said you expect the year to sort of
exit with momentum. I mean, am I reading that wrong or is the momentum just in price, but not volume?

<A - Maria Henry>: The momentum that we're talking about is around sales, and we talked about the drivers of that
being the pricing that we've just been commenting on and then the innovations that are coming into the market in the
back half of the year. You'll also remember that in our fiscal fourth quarter of – fiscal year last year, we had a
challenging fourth quarter. And so we're going to have an easier comp in the fourth quarter as well as we exit the year.

Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Robert Moskow. You may go ahead with your question, and please
restate your company name.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: It's Credit Suisse again. Sean, I was just thinking, like, you're raising price here and most
likely, your competitors will follow in the protein space. But this comes at a time when a lot of other convenient meals
might be deflationary, just because of the direction of commodities and the timing of commodities. Have you thought
through at all like what happens to these protein-based products if other convenient meal items are falling in price, like
soup or pizza or frozen entrées or anything else? Thanks.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Sure. Well, you make a great point, which is that a lot of times, when we talk to folks about
our brands, there tends to be an assumption that there's just simply trading between our hotdogs and another company's
hotdogs, or our lunchmeat and other company's lunchmeat. That's not the way it works. These are basically simple meal
categories, and people have a consideration set, usually around day parts. In our case, we have a lot of lunchtime
businesses, we have a lot of breakfast businesses, and you switch between them.
So we track exactly what you're talking about, Rob. We know exactly where we source volume from when we're
winning within the broader simple meals arena, and we know the categories to which we would be vulnerable should
our pricing get out of certain thresholds. So when we talk about pricing analytics, we not only look at pricing analytics
versus the exact same type of product in the exact same category, but we also look at it relative to other products and
even brands that we might switch with. So we're keenly on top of that.
Interestingly, many of those products also have meat in them. So – and frankly, a lot of them don't have a different cost
profile than ours. So if you look at Jimmy Dean sandwiches as an example, that's a category where meat is just a
fraction of the total weight of the product. And the kinds of products that are – a lot of our products interact with are
similar, where they tend to be – have some element of protein in it. So there tends to be some directional alignment, I
would imagine, between how COGS move together.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Okay.

Thank you. Our last question is a follow-up question from Ken Goldman. You may go ahead with your question and
please restate your company name.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: JPMorgan. So Maria, I might have thought given your favorable cash in debt position and
considering the stock price had been in a low valuation level that you might have, maybe considered buying back a bit
more stock in the period. So can you talk a little bit about your thoughts about buybacks in the moment? I realize that's
not your first priority for cash. I'm just curious how you sort of balance your long-term goals for cash application with,
I guess, maybe some shorter-term opportunities?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure, Ken. We look at share repurchases opportunistically, and we do expect to repurchase $200
million worth of shares over a 2-year period. At any given quarter or point in time, we balance out the opportunities

that we have in front of us, and we look at the expected returns and the flexibility that we need to be actionable on the
opportunities in front of us to create value. So we view it very opportunistically. We monitor it very closely, and we
weigh the various alternatives that we have. So I can't predict exactly how much or when we will be buying, but we
still do intend to do $200 million of purchases over 2 years.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: And I'm going to come back to – I have one follow-up thought on Rob Moskow's question
from a minute ago, which was really around kind of the relative value equation. I just wanted to put out there that I
don't buy the notion that the only place to drive growth these days is in the value tier of the good, better, best
continuum. We are driving good growth today on brands like Aidells, Ball Park burgers, Jimmy Dean sandwiches,
despite the fact that these brands carry a premium price. And the reason that's the case is because number one, they're
truly great brand equities; and two, we keep them fresh and relevant with innovation and MAP support. So, certainly,
the value tier is an important consideration, but it's got to be pursued very surgically, in my experience, because the
best profit pools don't always reside there.
Sean M. Connolly
So with that last bit of color, I think I'll bring the call to a wrap up. I appreciate everybody calling in, and Melissa will
be around for any follow-up questions you have. Thanks very much.
