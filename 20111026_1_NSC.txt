Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, President and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2011 earnings
conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including Don Seale, our Chief Marketing
Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Squires, our Chief Financial Officer, all of whom you'll
hear from this afternoon.
Continuing to build on the first half's momentum, Norfolk Southern produced excellent results in the third quarter. We
achieved all time highs for any quarter in income from operations and earnings per share and our third quarter
operating ratio of 67.5% equaled our best ever performance.
As you would expect, these third quarter results coupled with the first two quarters, which were also outstanding, led to
across the board record results for the nine-month period including all time highs for revenue, income from operations,
operating ratio, net income and earnings per share.
Much of this was driven by continuing improvement in our service product which helped to produce significant growth
in revenues. Don will provide you with all of the details in a few minutes, but let me give you a few highlights. The
trend of the first two quarters extended into the third as we continued to see highway conversions lead Intermodal unit
growth of 8% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date.
Similarly, export coal volume has sustained its strong pace, up 23% for the quarter and 24% for the year-to-date. We
foresee solid strength in these markets continuing into the fourth quarter and on into 2012. With respect to service, we
achieved another quarterly sequential improvement with the third quarter composite service index of 78.2%
representing a 160 basis point improvement over the second quarter. Mark will give you all the operations details a
little later.
As you all know, we have consistently been investing in our service product in terms of both increased crew hiring as
well as investments in assets and technology. While these investments have obviously impacted our expenses, they
have also allowed us to efficiently bring on increasing volumes into our network, resulting in significant operating
leverage and our record-tying OR of 67.5%.
These strong operating results have led to record cash flows for the first nine months, which we have used to reinvest in
our business and to reward our shareholders. I mentioned our investments in our company and thus far, in 2011, we
spent $1.4 billion on capital projects, including items such as new locomotives which provide both immediate and
ongoing benefits as well as longer-term projects such as terminals which will add value beginning next year.
On the shareholder front, we paid $432 million so far this year in dividends, an 18% per share increase versus 2010.
And in addition, we repurchased over $1.6 billion of our shares through the first nine months. Both are clearly strong
indicators in our belief in the continued future strength of our company.
I'll go ahead now and turn over the program to Don, Mark and Jim and then I'll wrap up with some closing comments
before we take your questions. Don?

Donald W. Seale
Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon to everyone. During the third quarter, we saw an economy that posted modest
improvements and favorable global trade patterns. When combined with our ongoing new business development, we
produced a strong quarter which was within $5 million of our all-time high set in third quarter 2008. In total, revenue
for the quarter reached $2.89 billion, up $433 million or 18% over the third quarter of last year with yield improvement
across all business groups and volume growth in Intermodal, metals and construction, automotive and coal.
Approximately 82% or $353 million of the revenue gain in the quarter was driven by higher revenue per unit, including
pricing gains and increased fuel surcharge revenue. The remaining $80 million was the result of increased volume,
which was up 3% or 57,000 units.
With respect to yield, we achieved our second highest revenue per unit ever reaching $1,596, up $195 or 14%
compared to third quarter last year. This was just $8 per unit below our all-time RPU record which we set in the second
quarter of this year. Improved pricing based on market demand and tighter transportation capacity across all modes
combined with higher fuel surcharge revenue drove this performance. For the quarter, we achieved record RPU levels
in Agriculture, Metals and Construction, Paper, Automotive and Coal surpassing the records previously set in each of
these groups during the second quarter. Additionally, Intermodal RPU was up 10% led by higher fuel surcharge
revenue and improved pricing.
The pricing environment for our business continues to be favorable as truck capacity tightens and driver turnover
continues to be an issue. According to the American Trucking Association, driver turnover at large carriers has reached
its highest level since the second quarter of 2008, now standing at 79% and barge capacity remains tight for coal, grains
and other bulk commodities.
Now turning to our volume performance in the third quarter, total shipments of 1.81 million units were up 57,000 units
or 3% over third quarter 2010. This was our highest quarterly volume since third quarter of 2008, just prior to the
recession. These favorable results were driven by both economic and project growth with overall gains in Intermodal,
Metals and Construction, Automotive and Coal more than offsetting declines in Chemicals, Agriculture and Paper.
Overall volume during the quarter reached a new 52-week high in late September led by a 52-week high in Intermodal.
Now transitioning to our major business sectors as shown on slide five, coal revenue of $899 million was up $190
million or 27% over third quarter 2010 and that was our highest revenue quarter ever. Volume of 405,000 units
improved by 2,400 loads or 1%, driven by increased global demand which led to higher export volume. This more than
offset lower volumes to utilities which came as a result of some gas displacement and reduced demand for electricity in
our service region with Eastern coal burn down 5% year-to-date through August.
For the quarter, we also saw a slight improvement in domestic metallurgical coal as more coal became available from
additional production to the domestic coke market which continues to be below targeted stockpiles. Increased met coal
production came on stream during the quarter at two Norfolk Southern served mines which is favorable for both
domestic and export met coal going forward. As we continue our discussion on coal, you will note on the next slide that
our export volume of nearly 62,000 loads was up 23% in carloadings and 25% in tonnage over the third quarter of 2010
reflecting more productive coal cars. Tightened met coal supply around the world and an 11% increase in global steel
production continues to support strong demand.
At Lamberts Point, volume for the quarter reached 42,000 carloads, up 39%, while shipments over Baltimore were
down 2% due to weaker demand in Japan and flood-related issues during August and September.
Concluding my discussion of coal on slide seven, our utility volume of 265,000 loads was down 4% compared to the
same period in 2010. Competition from natural gas and reduced electrical demand impacted coal burn across our
network, which was partially offset by new business. Stockpiles at Norfolk Southern-served power plants on average
are below targeted levels and we expect to see continued sequential utility volume increases ahead on the heels of the
record heat experienced this summer across the NS service region.

Now turning to our Intermodal network. Intermodal revenue of $551 million was up $87 million or 19% over third
quarter of 2010. This gain was based on increased fuel-related revenue, volume growth and improved pricing. Volume
surpassed 826,000 units, up 65,000 units or 8% with strong gains led by our domestic business. Domestic volume
growth of 13% in the quarter was driven primarily by highway conversions with tightening truck capacity in the
marketplace while the 7% volume growth in international included strong growth in local lanes as well as some
evidence of increased seasonal demand.
Premium volume, which was up 3%, benefited from tight truck capacity as well and highway conversions in the
less-than-truckload segment in addition to other new business, and Triple Crown volume was up 1% for the quarter.
As you can see on the next slide, we made appreciable progress in growing our volumes across our major Intermodal
corridors during the quarter and for the first nine months of the year. Notably, the volumes for Crescent Corridor,
which parallels some of the nation's most congested highways, are up 30% for the quarter and 32% for the first nine
months of the year as compared to last year. The large increase over the Heartland Corridor is comprised of organic
growth of 24% and 15% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, with the balance representing re-routed
shipments that previously moved over longer routes by Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Knoxville, Tennessee.
During the third quarter, our export container business was up 13% while imports grew by 7%. This volume includes
loaded units moving to and from all ports that we serve.
Now, let's turn to merchandise as shown on slide 10. In merchandise, we generated revenue of $1.4 billion, up $156
million or 12% over third quarter of 2010 with record revenue per unit in four of the five merchandise segments:
agriculture, metals and construction, paper and automotive. Volume for the quarter was 578,000 carloads, down 2%,
with softness in certain industrial products markets and negative comps in chemicals and agriculture offsetting the
growth in metals and construction and automotive.
During the quarter, we saw better than expected levels of manufacturing activity as noted by the ISM Manufacturing
Index, which reached 51.6 for September, up from 50.6 the prior month and the highest rating since June.
Now drilling down to specific market segments within our merchandise business. Our metals and construction volume
improved by 11,000 loads or 7% compared to third quarter last year with increases in metals and miscellaneous
construction materials. Drivers of this growth ranged from increased steel for auto production, to strong demand for
sand and other materials flowing to the Marcellus Shale gas operations.
In our automotive market, volume grew 8% over third quarter of last year driven by an increase in North American
light vehicle production, which is up 8% for the quarter and projected to be up 11% for the year, and robust vehicle
sales, which were up 7% in the third quarter compared to last year. New business gains, including Volkswagen
shipments from the newly opened Chattanooga assembly plant, also contributed to our growth in automotive in the
quarter.
In our other merchandise business groups, as shown on slide 12, chemicals volume was down due to difficult
comparisons to third quarter 2010 that included over 8,700 carloads of TVA fly ash business. As I've stated in previous
quarters. We will not clear that negative comp until December 1 of this year.
Agriculture volume declined 7% in the third quarter with tough year-over-year comps that accounted for over one-third
of the decline in this market. We will clear this negative comp March 1, 2012. The remainder of the decline in Ag was
related to a 17% reduction in shipments of corn primarily to short-haul Midwest destinations where greater local crop
availability reduced the need for inbound rail.
And finally, our paper and forest products business was down 5% due to weaker pulp board, clay and woodchip
volumes in the quarter.
Now looking ahead, we expect continued growth across most of our portfolio. The economic outlook for most
industrial sectors calls for slow but steady growth including upward projections for steel and North American light
vehicle production. We see positive signs for international trade which continues to bode well for our export coal,
manufactured products, grain and Intermodal business. And domestic truck load capacity challenges and the advantages

of Intermodal service further support growth ahead in our expanding corridor network.
We expect our volumes to continue to exceed the growth of GDP and we plan to price to market demand at a level
succeeding the cost of rail inflation, thereby increasing return for our shareholders while delivering value for our
customers through better capacity, service and equipment.
Thank you for your attention and now Mark will present our service update. Mark?
Mark D. Manion
Thanks, Don. Starting with safety, we ended the third quarter with a safety ratio of 0.67 compared to 0.86, a 22%
improvement over the same period last year. For the first nine months, our ratio is 0.76, a 20% improvement over the
corresponding period last year.
Turning to the service front, our third quarter composite service performance was 78.2% even with last year, but
sequentially improved from the first and second quarters. Good improvements in both train and connection
performance have driven the sequential gain. While even with levels of the third quarter last year, train speed has
increased sequentially from the first and second quarters. Terminal dwell, the average time cars dwell at a switching
yard, stood at levels consistent with last year, but again like train speed, improved over the first and second quarters.
Turning to the next slide, as you can see, our crew base is much improved over we've been in 2010 and earlier this
year. By September this year, we had crews we needed throughout most of the system with a few locations that will
continue to fill out through the rest of this year. In January 2012, our total T&E employment will stabilize with trainee
hiring slowing in order to maintain a steady-state workforce. As our total T&E employment levels out, our qualified
T&E employment count continues to climb for several more months as conductors finish training. We're at the point
where we are handling existing business and we're prepared for volumes ahead.
And finally, turning to our Productivity Scorecard, as previously indicated, volumes up 3% with crew starts up 3% and
additionally gross ton miles are up 4%. Railroad employees are up 7% as we continue to hire trainees in order to return
us to employment levels commensurate with our current traffic levels and the 2012 forecast.
Gross ton miles per employee is down 2% compared to last year which of course is influenced by the 7% increase in
employees. However, this is a 1% point improvement from the second quarter as the sequential growth in gross ton
miles is taking place at a faster rate than the growth in the employment population. Gross ton miles per gallon were
down 2% year-over-year primarily driven by a shift in traffic mix toward finished automobiles and Intermodal and
away from the more gross ton mile per gallon efficient bulk commodity unit trains. This is also a sequential
improvement from the second quarter when we posted a negative 5%. Gross ton miles per train hour improved 2% as
our network has grown increasingly fluid.
And now I'll turn it over to Jim. Jim?
James A. Squires
Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our financial results for the third quarter, which we're pleased to report, reflect
continued record performance.
Let's start with our operating results. As Don described, railway operating revenues for the quarter reached $2.9 billion,
up $433 million or 18% compared to third quarter of last year including an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of $179
million. West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil prices have progressively declined since May, resulting in a favorable third
quarter fuel lag effect of approximately $52 million. Year-to-date the fuel lag is negligible.
Slide three shows our total operating expenses, which increased $241 million or 14% for the quarter. The combined
operating results generated an all-time record $938 million of income from railway operations, a 26% increase
compared to the prior year. Our operating ratio set a new third quarter record at 67.5% and matched our overall record.

Removing the $52 million favorable fuel revenue lag, our operating ratio would have been 68.8% or 130 basis points
higher, also a third quarter record. Assuming level or a rising WTI for the remainder of the year, we would have a
negative fuel revenue lag effect in the fourth quarter.
Turning to expenses, this slide presents the components of the $241 million increase. Similar to our experience last
quarter fuel and compensation and benefits accounted for three-fourths of the operating expense variance. At the slide
on the following slide, nearly all of the $126 million increase in fuel expense was due to higher prices.
As shown next, our average price per gallon of diesel fuel was $3.10, a 42% increase compared with the third quarter of
2010. This year, our diesel fuel prices have correlated more closely with the Brent Index than WTI, our traditional
benchmark.
Since the beginning of the year, Brent has traded at an increasing premium compared to WTI and this has impacted our
cost structure. Although we've seen some relief from this trend in just the last week, we do expect the Brent premium to
continue to continue to pressure fuel expense and the operating ratio in the fourth quarter.
Compensation benefits displayed next reflected a $56 million increase up 8%. As detailed on the next slide, the
components driving the change are generally consistent with second quarter 2011 run rates. The volume related payroll
was up $19 million including $8 million for trainees. Medical benefits for agreement employees increased $13 million.
Payroll taxes were up $8 million and wage rates were up $5 million. Pension costs were up $4 million.
Purchased services and rents increased $26 million or 7% reflecting increased volume-related services primarily
associated with Intermodal and other transportation services as well as additional roadway and mechanical maintenance
to support the higher volumes.
Similarly, materials and other expenses presented next increased $20 million or 11% primarily due volume related
equipment maintenance activities, reliability initiatives for our locomotive fleet and travel costs.
Turning to our non-operating items, the majority of the decrease is due to lower net corporate-owned life insurance
returns coupled with the decreased coal royalties which reflect the absence of the 2010 favorable settlement.
As you may recall, last year's property sales benefited from a particularly large transaction from the City of Virginia
Beach. This year's results, while lower, include a $24 million gain from a property sale in Ohio.
As illustrated on the next slide, income before income taxes increased $170 million or 24% principally due to higher
operating income. Income taxes totaled $330 million and the effective tax rate was 37.3%. The income taxes last year
were $269 million with an effective rate of 37.7%. Our bottom line results presented on the following slide reflect third
quarter net income of $554 million, an increase of $109 million or 24% compared to last year. Diluted earnings per
share were a record $1.59, reflecting a $0.40 per share or 34% increase.
Turning to our year-to-date cash flows, cash provided by operations increased 30% year-over-year driven by higher net
income and increased deferred income tax expense, that's largely related to the benefit of bonus depreciation. The
additional cash generated from operations covered increased property additions through September. We've utilized free
cash flow along with cash and short-term investments to support share repurchases and dividends.
In the third quarter, we repurchased 12.2 million shares at a total cost of $819 million. Our remaining share repurchase
authority as of the end of the quarter is approximately 22 million shares. We ended September with $394 million in
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Thank you for your attention and now I will turn the program back to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thanks, Jim. Well, as you've heard, this was an excellent quarter and as I said earlier, a great indicator of the strength
of the Norfolk Southern franchise. As we look ahead over the short-term, we continue to see signs pointing to overall

modest economic growth. Don discussed our projected growth in domestic Intermodal and continued strength in export
coal. And we anticipate that our overall volumes will continue to grow at a rate somewhat greater than that of the
economy. Looking further out, we have an abiding belief in the ultimate resiliency of the U.S. economy. And we will
continue to manage and invest for the long term to maintain the safety and quality of our franchise and to improve
operating efficiency and service.
In that regard, earlier I mentioned our capital spending this year. We're now in the process of working through our
capital budget for 2012 and while the numbers haven't been finalized yet, we do anticipate another strong budget for
the year driven by our belief in our ability to grow volumes over the long term along with increasing expenditures on
positive train control.
Clearly, the other issues of the day are the current labor round and the deliberations of the Presidential Emergency
Board. I don't really have anything to add that you probably don't already know. But I'm hopeful and optimistic that the
Board will recognize that the contract which we have already signed with the UTU which represents about 30% of our
contract workforce is a good deal for our employees and should represent the pattern for a settlement.
I'll conclude by saying that excellent financial performance like that we produced in the third quarter is the result of the
hard work of a lot of people. We have a great team at Norfolk Southern and we're committed to continuing to produce
superior service for our customers and superior returns for our shareholders as the U.S. economy continues to improve.
Thanks for your attention and we'll now open it up to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is
from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah. Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks, Tom.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Let's see, I wanted to ask for a little bit more perspective on your coal view. I'm not sure
if I caught all of your comments, Don, so I apologize if I missed something. But how do you think utility coal may play
out in 2012 assuming you have a continuing low natural gas price? Is there further switching on your – switching risk
on your franchise? And then what would your view on export coal be in terms of demand and just kind of how you get
your arms around visibility to that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, let's take the first one, Tom. With respect to gas and the impact on utility coal going
forward, we believe that the effect of gas displacement is pretty much already baked into the volumes we're seeing. As
you know, most of that gas displacement are at the smaller older, marginal plants, heat rate plants. So, we've already
seen that impact and we don't anticipate an increasing impact going forward.
With respect to the export market, as you know, we're pretty much 100% metallurgical coal in our export portfolio. We
expect demand for that product to continue to be strong. You might have seen that coming out of the recent conference
in Madrid, Spain, The Coaltrans, that the projection for Chinese imports for coal by 2015 is projected to go as high as
200 million tons, up from 91 million tons at the current run rate. And we think China will continue to be a major factor
with respect to our export demand, as well as South America and Europe and the rest of Asia.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then I guess a quick one on yields; you had
just tremendous momentum on your yield performance this year and pretty sharp contrast to last year. I guess maybe
mix was a headwind last year and a tailwind this year, but how do we think about yield growth next year given that
there's been such a large difference in performance in this year versus last year? It's kind of hard to figure out what the
right ballpark is to be in on the overall yield growth for 2012.

<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, Tom, I would remind you that export coal is longer hauls and when we have utility coal
going to our Southern network, it's longer haul as well. So, those dynamics are at play. We certainly expect our export
market to continue to be strong, as I mentioned previously. So that portion of the dynamic will be there and we see
opportunities for growth in the utility market going forward, and that includes our Southern utility. So, those long haul
dynamics should continue.
Now, ultimately, our domestic met U.S. receivers will take more coal, that is shorter haul and it's very profitable
business for us though, and that will come into the mix when it starts to move and replenish stockpiles.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Right. Okay. Thank you for the time.

<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Don, obviously, you've sort of outlined here what's happened with the
volumes and they've actually done a bit better than some of the peers, and I'm wondering if there's a way for you to
parse out how much of the growth in your volumes is from sort of new business initiatives, organic growth, or maybe
even share gains?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We track that, obviously. I will tell you that year-to-date that over two-thirds of our business
gained is organic growth.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: So, just growth in market, almost same-store sales, is that the right way to think of it?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It is new business that's coming from the highway or new projects that we have launched in
the marketplace that's generating new rail freight for us.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. And then the other one-third is from?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It's basically partially truck conversion, and I would say that is the largest category. If you
look at our intermodal business and our domestic growth, that's exactly where it's coming from, is the highway.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. And then, Wick, I'm curious, in your experience, have we seen examples in a labor
negotiation where pattern bargaining really didn't hold, I mean aside from maybe a nuance in a contract here or there?
But is there any reason to expect that there could be a materially different economic outcome from this Presidential
Emergency Board?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: As I said, we're optimistic. I'm certainly optimistic that the Board will look at the
UTU agreement, which was ratified by a 60/40 margin, and it's the single largest rail union, and also look at the
economics of that deal, which are very good for UTU members, and it should represent a pattern.
It's been a long time since we've a Board in the rail industry, Bill, so I don't really have any experience of it being
anything other than a process in which the concept of a pattern is recognized. We certainly have some experienced
arbitrators on the Board, so that's what leads to our optimism that they'll view this at least in its overall outline as a
rational pattern to settle with the rest of the organizations.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. That's great. Thank you for the time.

<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey, good evening, guys. It's Rob Salmon on for Justin. Congrats on a real solid quarter. As
we think about your export coal exposure, could you give us a sense of kind of the ultimate customer as a percentage of
the overall business, like for example China, Europe, South America?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Rob, generally if you break it out, about 55% of our export is Western Europe. About 20% is
Asia and then the balance is South America. And when I say Asia, we're including Japan, Korea, India, China, et
cetera.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: All right. Thanks. And certainly you guys gave an upbeat outlook regarding the remainder
of the year. In Q3, we did see a little bit of an impact I guess from the Port of Baltimore being down. Could we actually
see volume growth accelerate in Q4 given the headwind that you face there?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah. Baltimore was impacted as I mentioned in the prepared remarks by the Japanese
earthquake and tsunami and steel production there. We anticipate demand coming back and it is coming back. So, we –
looking ahead, we do see Baltimore doing better as we move ahead.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: One of the constraints in terms of the fourth quarter, although it's very minor is we've
been doing a good bit of work on one of the loaders that Lamberts Point that's about to conclude and it shouldn't have
an impact but it won't lead to any acceleration.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Thanks. And as my follow-up, I guess on the comp and benefit, on a per carload basis, we
saw the productivity improve sequentially from Q2 to Q3. Could you talk a little bit about how we should be thinking
about that line item looking forward into Q4? Can we see a continued momentum on the productivity gains given the, I
guess, moderation in overall trainees that you guys have?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we – I think your point is a valid one. As Mark showed you, we will see some
moderation in hiring in the fourth quarter but at the same time, we are doing some hiring on the mechanical and
engineering side. Next year, we expect our overall T&E head count to be flat. We may see some modest increases next
year in engineering and mechanical particularly as we work through our comps and – as our – through our capital
programs. We'll also have to look at things like incentive compensation and some issues there in terms of where we
were in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: All right. That's fair. Thanks for the time, guys.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Great. Congrats on the great results and a solid quarter. Don, if we can dig in to Intermodal
just for a second, you talked about seeing increased retail activity. I just wanted to understand is that aided by the
Heartland Corridor or is that overall and you mentioned you expect it to grow greater than the economy. Is that despite
the loss of the Maersk business in 2012 or is it – I just want to understand what that comment entails. Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Ken, good afternoon. As well as I mentioned our domestic Intermodal business was up 13%
at the quarter and I also mentioned that's being driven from highway conversions predominantly in our Eastern network
and the corridors that I mentioned entail a lot of that growth.
With respect to the international market, that was up 7% in the quarter and that's based on some seasonal demand
increases that we've seen – we've described the fall peak in terms of being a fall mount as opposed to a fall peak and I
think that pretty much still falls into that category, but we anticipate Intermodal growth certainly exceeding GDP and
economic growth going ahead as we get into 2012 and beyond.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Okay, great. Thank you. For a follow-up, just on the – digging into the export coal for a
second, can you kind of divide up what is contract spot? Is this is all spot on the met side? I just want to understand, or

is it part of that April to March contract here? Because I just want to understand, at Baltimore, can you see a bounce
back in terms of those lost volumes because of the tsunami, hurricane, other impacts or is that just lost volumes? In
other words, can – I guess to the prior question, should we expect kind of make-up volumes?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, I don't think you will see make-up volumes for the balance of this year. I think as we
get into 2012, stockpiles will be such that as Japanese auto production and steel demand continues to ramp back up, we
will see demand commensurate for coking coal. So, I think there are two things that work going forward; we had a
flood impact that was about 2,000 cars coming into Baltimore during the third quarter. We may make a little of that up
in the fourth quarter, but I would say that the market side of this with respect to Japanese demand will see some
improvement, but it'll go – it will take some time to get that replaced.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you, gentlemen. Good afternoon. A couple of quick questions here, one on the
productivity side, I'm trying to parse out, sort of the drivers. Obviously, you're pricing above cost inflation here, but
also you have seemed to push a lot more freight onto areas like the Heartland Corridor which a lot is double stacking
and you're getting benefit there plus a lot of your trainees are coming online working. If you were to bucket them, could
you split it out for us sort of what's been driving the main productivity here at Norfolk Southern?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I think the productivity gains that we've been seeing are to some extent
influenced by the fluidity of the network which is much improved and that's largely a result of the new – the crews that
we've got coming online as well as some new locomotives that we've put into service. Clearly, the – we feel very
comfortable with our Intermodal network, with our stack capability. We're, I think, what, Don, 98% cleared right
now...?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We're 93%.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: 93%.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: When we finish Columbus and Cincinnati, it will be 98%.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yeah, we'll be 98% here soon. That's a big productivity driver on the Intermodal side.
But if I kind of look at where we are in terms of our productivity going forward, going back to the last question, we've
done a lot of catch-up hiring over the past 18 months as we've shown you. We've done a lot investment in assets and
some in – a good bit in infrastructure. And I think that's the long-term key to driving productivity.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay, now your – you said Columbus and Cincinnati is going to drive you to 98%. Is that going
to be in 4Q?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It'll be complete by the end of the year.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yeah.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: So, it's probably more of a 2012 impact for you then?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Correct.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay, fantastic. Gentlemen, thank you for your time.

<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Good afternoon, I was hoping to get some perspective on the recent Conway Yard
dispute. To the extent that that the disruption of the yard is likely to take place, and whether you have any sort of
visibility or idea as to the timing of a resolution to the dispute?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Actually, the dispute has been elongated somewhat as far as resolution with the
retarders and employees involved in what we call, skate operations and that looks like it's going to be pushed off for a
couple of months or so but as far as anything that is disruptive, we don't see anything in terms of disruption coming
from it. If anything, it prolongs the efficiencies that we hoped to gain down the road as a result of getting rid of these
things that have way outlasted their usefulness back in history.
So, we're just continuing to – we'll continue to do what we are required to do in terms of using individuals in the
operation that don't add as much value as we would like. And at some point down the road, we'll just have a more
efficient operation but it just gets pushed out a little bit further.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Okay. Can you just provide some context to this dispute? I mean are these types of
yard disputes, or disputes maybe by a local in a given location, are they common? Are these disputes that can take
place and take place with some frequency but have little disruption in the end or is this something that you have seen
more recently where the union might try to claw back some of the previous agreed upon arrangements of the
agreement?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No, this is very much a localized issue, and in terms of its magnitude, it's small. It's
important that we resolve it from a productivity standpoint. We want to be as productive at that particular yard as we
can. That's the only yard in all of our system where we are required by law to employ additional employees in order to
handle this particular function – it's the only yard we have. And so it's just from the system-wide standpoint, it's not real
material.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Great, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Don, you mentioned the coal stockpiles on the utility
network. I was just kind of getting curious about the order of magnitude if some of those kind of below targeted levels?
And then maybe if you could comment a bit about the difference between the North and the South? It looks like more
Northern utilities are below target than Southern utilities. But it sounded like that favorable benefit of going South is
going to continue on into the fourth quarter. Just curious, a little bit of color there, please?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yes. The stronger demand for Southern utility will continue. They have taken more coal this
year than the North with respect to a percentage increase. So, we're going to continue to see the dynamic of Southern
utility to Northern utility be there. And the stockpiles in the North are lower than the stockpiles in the South. And I will
tell you that, that's in terms of days, that's 28 days which is below the target.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: 28 days is the South or an average?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: On a combined average.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And just quickly on as far as the duration of this mix shift for
you, does this stick around until the first quarter or is it a little bit difficult to tell based on kind of how the volumes are
trending so far?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I didn't catch that question. Could you repeat it?

<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Sure. Just curious if this benefit of longer length of haul to the Southern utilities sticks
around for more than just the fourth quarter? Is it a comp issue as you look at last year or is it something that's a little
bit more difficult to tell based on the level of volumes we're seeing right now?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, the length of haul is going to be constant. Our utilities will have a longer haul through
the South just as they did this year. So, the year-over-year benefit in terms of RPU will be comparable.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Sure. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, I guess, Wick, you commented a little bit on
the head count kind of perspective for 2012. I'm just kind of curious, assuming we have a modest GDP level and Don's
outlook for GDP plus kind of holds the case, what are your thoughts about kind of staffing growth relative to the
attrition that you should see in the workforce naturally in 2012?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I would tell you that, as Mark said, our projections are that in terms of total T&E
head count, we'll level out about January and we'll see qualified employees continue to tick up and the number of
trainees to go down slightly. But we would anticipate that on the T&E side that that overall count that we're looking at
in January is good to handle our projected 2012 volumes and probably beyond.
I think I did mention that we're still reviewing our engineering and mechanical hiring. That's, to some extent, a function
of capital programs and, to some extent, a function of locomotive maintenance requirements. So, ex-attrition, we may
see some modest increase in those numbers but that's not determined completely yet.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Yes, thank you. I had two questions on Intermodal. I guess from a very simple or kind of conceptual
standpoint, could you just help me. I'm trying to think about profitability as this business continues to grow and gains
critical mass and moves from arguably one of your less profitable businesses from an industry perspective to something
that's a little bit more closer to corporate average.
What are the economics of running a double-stack train? And what I mean by that is, if you have 100 flats, your
revenue obviously is going to be what it'd be when you charge a certain rate. But what's the running cost or the unit
cost, variable cost for actually going from full single-stack to a double-stack configuration? What's the step up?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, Matt, double-stack is the most efficient mode in which to run Intermodal.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Right.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I would not want to get into the delta in cost, but I would tell you that it's our objective to
stack as much traffic as possible.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Right. That's certainly the objective. But you seem to be here now in terms of the quarter build-out.
Maybe if I were to take the question more broadly, what in terms of the articulated goals you had for traffic patterns in
your quarters, what – where are you running relative to those goals and maybe what percentage of your business
currently is single-stack that now could go double-stack?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, we – it's two – there are two things that work there, one is the 53-foot platform car
supply...
<Q - Matt Troy>: Yup.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: ...and the other is making sure we get the right box on the right car. We have initiatives in
place to address both of those and we do see an opportunity to improve stacking and that's within our internal goals.
But, Matt, you also have to keep in mind that our premium traffic which is growing as well is generally not stacked and

it's trailer traffic which will not be stacked. Not in the short run at least.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Right. But is fair to say then that given the investment with these quarters open 98% of the network
double-stack capable by year-end that we can almost think of this as an industry or Norfolk specific tipping point in
that profitability should move perhaps better than volume growth on a one-for-one basis as you've got critical mass and
the investments made?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Certainly density and maximizing stocks will help in that regard. And as I mentioned, those
are both objectives that we are pursuing.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Got it. I cheated and asked a third. Thanks for the time.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Just two quick questions here, first on – Wick, you mentioned a healthy
budget for your capital spend next year. When you look forward and perhaps, Don, you can chime in here, when you
look forward to your markets going into the year, what areas are you getting most excited about and you want to
allocate capital perhaps in a regional or more importantly on a segment basis? Where do you really want to put that –
those healthy dollars to work going into next year?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, as we look at our capital requirements next year in terms of asset investment, in
particular, I think we've talked for a number of years now about reinvestment in our coal fleet. We have a substantial
portion of our fleet that is life expiring over the next few years. We're going to be buying a significant number of coal
cars next year. We got investments that we're making – or we're planning on making in our automotive fleet.
Our Automotive business is good and we think the automotive industry is going to continue to head up. We are talking
a lot about investment in Intermodal. One of the things I would point out is that while we have – we'll end up with 98%
of the network cleared in terms of our Corridor strategy, we still have a significant amount of investment underway in
Intermodal terminals at Birmingham, Memphis, Greencastle, Pennsylvania. We'll be investing there. We're looking at
investments in some Intermodal equipment as well. What else from an equipment standpoint, Don?
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: I'm more zeroing in on sort of your growth areas where you really focus. What areas do you
see the most growth in 2012 that you want to allocate capital to?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we're going to allocate a lot in just what I call core system investments,
significant technology investments, more infrastructure investments which will open up all of our business. We're
clearly looking at the Marcellus Shale opportunity which has been very good for us so far in terms of possibly
additional terminals, additional equipment to make sure we can handle all of the growth we anticipate there.
It will be a wide range of investment opportunities. The other thing which I mentioned of course is that it'll be one of
the things that will – and this is perhaps unfortunate drive the robustness of our budget next year is a big investment in
positive train control.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Right. Second question, moving over to Jim, I guess, is looking at your share buyback was
pretty good, pretty healthy there this quarter. To what extent now that you've got just a cash balance running around
$250 million now, what extent are you going to dip into leverage now to fund a continued kind of – well, maybe you
could tell me what is a good run rate for your share buyback in a year and to what extent will you be using leverage to
fund that buyback?
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure. Well, Walter, our financial strategy has been to utilize cash from operations first for
reinvestment in the business, obviously, and then to pay our dividend at a target payout ratio of about a third and then
to use incremental free cash flow for buybacks along with cash on hand and we use both incremental free cash flow and
cash on hand but not incremental borrowing capacity in the third quarter to do the buybacks.

Now, going forward as EBITDA and EBIT and funds from operations grow, we'll have additional borrowing capacity
that we can devote to share repurchases without altering our targeted capital structure. So, we will have some flexibility
there to do additional buybacks as well.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: So, you don't see increasing your – the debt component of your capital structure?
<A - James A. Squires>: Well...
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: ...in a percentage basis. In a...
<A - James A. Squires>: No.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: No. Okay.
<A - James A. Squires>: We're not – debt to total capitalization was a little bit different. That may tend drift up even
as other credit market metrics stay stable. But our objective with respect to debt to EBITDAR, FFO to debt and the
interest coverage would be to maintain fairly stable credit metrics.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Perfect. Okay. That's my questions. Thanks.

Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Thanks, good evening. Is there anything in the contract or the pending contracts with labor that
addresses the healthcare cost inflation that seems to consistently be one of the areas where your cost is growing the
fastest?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: There's certainly some components of healthcare plan design changes in the UTU
agreement which, while they are I would describe from a dollar standpoint as relatively modest, they are nonetheless
meaningful in that they start to establish a plan in which people will start thinking more about the dollars they're
spending and hopefully make better decisions in terms of spending healthcare dollars.
That's a – that's a significant change and as well I'd say I think the economic impact will be modest certainly on our
employees to the extent that we have plans as we do with our management plan that have people start to think about
their own pocket as they think about healthcare. That's a meaningful change. And over the longer term, we would hope
that that would moderate some of these trends.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Have you given any thought, Wick, to maybe more meaningful changes? Let's say for as new
employees come in to the business, having a different type of program for new employees that maybe more resembles a
401(k) type style for healthcare?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, the issue – we have made and continue to make changes in the plan for our
non-agreement workforce with significant wellness incentives and I think a lot of good things. The issue with the
healthcare plan, the national plan which covers all of our contract workers, is it's a negotiated plan. And the rails cannot
unilaterally make changes. They have to be part of our labor negotiations and in fact, healthcare plan changes are a big
part of the current round. So, there's – if we could do things differently in terms of plan design, we would but we can't
do that unilaterally.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay, and then just one housekeeping item, do you have the pre- and post-tax dollar amounts
for the gain on the property sale here in the quarter?
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure, the one we mentioned, the sale of land in Ohio was $24 million pre-tax.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar, Inc. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. Can you comment on your Intermodal growth 13% domestic and 7%
international; is this in particular lanes, the domestic in particular industry verticals? Also is FedEx a material portion
of this or is that too early in the stage of development?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The growth on the Intermodal was pretty much across the network. The international was at
all of our ports; to and from all ports. We had a heavier increase or percentage increase in our local lanes in the quarter.
And and then with respect to the domestic business, as depicted on the corridor slide, we're seeing growth across those
corridors and across the network. It's fairly balanced growth. And our premium business, which would include UPS
and FedEx, continues to grow.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Great. Thanks, I guess the second then, we've asked a bit about double-stacking but I'd
like to ask about the other plane. Can you comment on train lengths or weights maybe year-over-year comparison, and
any actions that might extend this metric without comprising on-time delivery?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yeah. Let me give you a little bit of information on that. We are – if you look at our
Merchandise business, we are running train length wise just a little bit under what we did a year ago. And on the
Intermodal side, just a little bit over. So not a great deal of difference there, and the best part of it is we've got a plenty
of room. If you look at it on the average, we're in the 4,500 range merchandise and 5,500, 5,700 range Intermodal wise.
So, and not to say there aren't some big trains out there because there, are but plenty of room to grow in both of those
areas.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: And any actions that would extend those?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: More business.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yeah. All right. Thank you.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: And Don and his group are doing a darn good job of bringing it to us. So that's what
we're trying to do. And, you know, train length works in our favor but like we always say, it's all about velocity. So we
put a network plan together that maximizes our efficiency and allows us to get asset turns as high as we can get them
and to the extent we can do that and grow our train length at the same time, that's what we are working on doing.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Great, thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gary Chase with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Good afternoon, everybody. Wanted to ask a couple of quick ones, first, Jim, on the comp and
ben line looked quite a bit lower than what we had been expecting. Just wondering if there was stock comp component
in there that we should expect to reverse as we head into 4Q?

<A - James A. Squires>: Not stock comp, but incentive comp, yes. In the 4Q, we would be expecting higher incentive
compensation. And that mostly reflects last year's lower incentive compensation. So that one stands out, but not in the
third quarter.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: So when you say higher, were you referring to like year-on-year? I mean, absolute level
shouldn't be materially changed from period to period, is that fair?
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, no, I think we may see a little bit higher comp and benefits expense sequentially as
well in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Okay. And then just switching gears, wondered, Don, if you could give us a sense of – is any
material portion of the book now still trafficking on some of the older surcharges that we're at much lower triggers or
have you worked through the majority of that and you've got most of the book re-based at this stage?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It really varies and it depends on the contract duration that was in place. So, we have many
variations of fuel surcharge application.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Is there a way to characterize how many of them are close to the current tariff program you've
got and how much are still trafficking on say more than three-year-old program designs?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, we don't have that data here, handy.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Okay, thanks, everybody.

Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan and Company. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Thanks and good afternoon, guys.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Hi.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So, Don, just wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions on utility coal volumes. With
stockpiles at Northern utilities more below target, it makes sense or it seems logical that at some point, you'll see
volumes start to be better going to the North than to the South. And just wondering, what's the visibility on when you
think that inflection occurs? And then how should we think about that? Is there a way to think about how much longer
is it to the South versus the North? Or what's the difference in revenue per car to the South versus the North?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It's about a two-thirds differential on an RPU basis with the utility South being about a third
higher than the North because of the length of haul. And the first question, certainly it depends on the burn with respect
to winter weather. But we're already beginning to see weather turn that way in the North and you're absolutely correct.
We will see Northern utilities start taking more coal because of their stockpiles where they are.
But 36% of the Southern utilities still below target as well, we still expect that coal to move as well even though we've
seen a higher volume of that coal this year relative to Northern utilities.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: What's the split between Northern and Southern coal?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: In terms of the total book?
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Yeah.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: In terms of the overall volume, it is very close to being even in terms of the volumes
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And then just one quick one Intermodal, the corridor growth is obviously really
impressive. Can you give us a sense, what percent of the Intermodal book is included in these corridors and then kind
of what inning of this do you think we're in? Can you see a multiyear period of Heartland growing, doubling and

Crescent growing at a 30% clip?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: When you look at the corridor map, it's a wide net that pretty much reflects the primary
corridors over our railroad. So, we're seeing growth in that corridor network which essentially covers most of our major
network.
With respect to where we are in converting truckload business, I will tell you that – and as you probably already know,
the truckload market is well over $600 billion in the U.S. and we are just beginning the efforts to work with motor
carriers to place that business in the most fuel efficient environmentally-friendly service, which is Intermodal.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. Thanks for your time. Appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Wanted to just ask you a quick question on
resourcing. I'm really just curious whether you've made any tweaks to your resource plan in the context of a slower
economic growth outlook or whether you're basically seeing continued strength across your business and driving
forward with the plans you would have established at the beginning of the year?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I think it's safe to say that with the volume growth that we have seen already this year
and the outlook that we have for our volumes in 2012, that we're continuing to invest in a fairly steady and strong way
in our resources. Certainly, you've seen that in our hiring and you've seen that in our equipment acquisitions and in our
investments in technology. And we have – we don't see any reason right now to moderate our investment policy.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Okay, thanks. That's it for me.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Neal Deaton with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - E. Neal Deaton>: Thank you. Congratulations again on the quarter. Just wanted to follow back up on – someone
mentioned earlier about the Maersk contract going away in early 2012, just wanted to see what kind of an impact that's
going to have on your international Intermodal volumes. And I don't know if you're comfortable sharing what percent
of your total international business Maersk represents.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, Maersk is a good customer and will continue to be a customer of ours going forward.
We will continue to have a good relationship with them. And I will tell you that based on our projection for next year,
the impact will be less than 100,000 units of Intermodal business for us.
<Q - E. Neal Deaton>: Okay. That's helpful. And are you – what are you doing to prepare for that? Are you – are there
shipping lines that you don't already partner with that you're trying to forge a relationship with and if so, how that's
going?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The marketplace is always dynamic.
<Q - E. Neal Deaton>: Fair enough. Okay. Congratulations again.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Alliance (sic) [Sanford] Bernstein. Please go
ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: It's actually with Sanford Bernstein. But the revenue per ton mile on the coal traffic, the
quarter-to-quarter improvement there was around close to 2%, and if you think that fuel wasn't much of a change kind
of quarter-to-quarter, that looks like an 8% a year annualized rate of increase. Was there anything specific as far as
contract renegotiations on the utility side that might have helped add to that quarter-to-quarter rate of improvement on
the revenue per ton mile?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No. No significant contract changes.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Was there anything – was there any material kind of difference in the rate of increase
between the utility traffic and the export traffic as far as the rate at which the rates actually went up?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we had the 23% increase in volume and 25% increase in tonnage for our export
business, and our utility South, which has a longer haul, also was up. But as I've mentioned too, we had a 1% increase
in our domestic met coal for the quarter, which has a higher revenue per ton mile because of shorter haul.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. And then could you maybe talk a little bit about the rate at which Intermodal
train starts increased kind of year-over-year to accommodate the higher rate of carload growth?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We had, as far as our Intermodal operations, we had a – what's the percentage increase?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We've had about a 2.5% to 3% increase in crew starts on Intermodal against a much
higher volume increase.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Yeah, that's the ratio I was trying to get at. Thank you very much.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Well, gentlemen, great quarter. Most of all the good questions have been taken. So, I'm
going to ask you something a little more esoteric. I noticed gross ton miles continued to grow very nicely – gross ton
miles per train hour. And revenue ton miles per train hour did as well, pretty much lockstep, so it wasn't really mix.
Exactly how high do you think you can take that number? I mean, your damn near at 90, can you get to gross ton miles
per train hour, can you get to 95? Is 100 possible? Where are both GTMs and RTMs per train hour headed?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we would hope, as I ponder your more esoteric question, that they're headed
up.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Well, let's hope so.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I don't know that we have a specific number in mind, Don, but I will tell you that in
term – while our network is still far more fluid, we still have a good ways to go in terms of taking the velocity of the
network to where we want it to be. And clearly, velocity plays directly into that train hour metric. And on the other
side, as Mark mentioned, is that we still have substantial capacity particularly in our merchandise train network in
terms of length. So...
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: So, it's somewhat dependent upon mix?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: It is. To some extent it's dependent on mix, but even in Intermodal, we can do more.
So I'm not going to try to give you a specific example, or a specific number rather, but I do think that we have the
opportunity to take that number on up a good bit more.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Because I know the conversation I had with Deb Butler at the Altoona meeting, she was
laying out how 10% velocity over the next two years was possible just through the technology initiatives. That would

imply you could take gross ton miles per hour to 100 at some point in the next 8 quarters to12 quarters.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: And that's the way the math would work and I don't think it's out of reach to improve
our velocity by 10%. Right now, we're looking at train speeds in the 21.5 mile an hour range, a 10% increase there
without even adding length to our trains – tonnage to our trains, would take us up above 23 miles an hour and that's a
number we've seen before.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Yeah.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: So I think that's a very rational analysis.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Fantastic. Thank you very much and good luck in the fourth quarter.

Thank you. Our next question's from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kanchana Pinnapureddy>: Hi. It's actually Kanchana Pinnapureddy in for Jeff. I just had one question for you. I
wanted to know if you could put some numbers around the size of the potential frac sand opportunity, maybe in terms
of revenue or carloads?
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Frac sand.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Frac sand.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Frac sand.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The market in Marcellus Shale and in course Utica Shale coming after that which is just
beginning to develop with some – with a very few wells drilled, we see that continuing to ramp up, and our volumes are
up significantly in that area and we feel that will continue as the gas operations expand in Marcellus and Utica. I would
rather not cite the specific volumes associated with that.
