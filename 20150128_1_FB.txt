Mark Elliot Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. This has been a good quarter for Facebook and a great end
to the year. Our community continues to grow in size and engagement and we're very pleased with the growth of our
business. Overall, 2014 was a year of great progress for the Facebook community. 1.39 billion people now use
Facebook each month and 890 million people daily, an increase of 165 million monthly actives and 133 million daily
actives this year. Time spent per person per day across our services continue to rise during this quarter by more than
10% compared to last year. And that doesn't even include WhatsApp, which joined us late last year.
These milestones show that our community continues to get stronger. But, it's not just our community where we've
made a lot of progress. 2014 was also a year of big investments in our future. This year, we made big bets on the
next-generation of communication and computing platforms by acquiring WhatsApp and Oculus.
We focused on serving our community better across all of our products, raising the quality and relevance of content in
News Feed, improving our search and video products and improving the performance and efficiency of our mobile
apps. And we continue to invest in our employees and infrastructure, growing our head count by 45% this year and
opening our newest data center in November in Altoona, Iowa.
When you consider the progress of our community and our investments, 2014 was an important year for us and a good
sign of how we're thinking about the future. In the next decade, Facebook is focused on our mission to connect the
entire world, welcoming billions of people to our community and connecting many more people to the Internet through
Internet.org.
To serve the entire world, we need to build products that serve our community and allow people to share different types
of content with different audiences. We need to offer new services and infrastructure at greater scale and we need to
create new tools and innovate to solve fundamental challenges in the places we want to connect.
Doing this will take a lot of effort over the coming years and Facebook is going to have to evolve. Similar to our
transition to mobile over the last couple of years, now we want to really focus on serving everyone in the world.
Our mission has always been to make the world more open and connected. This is something we've been preparing for
over the last decade. Everything we've achieved in 2014 and over the last 10 years has helped us to build the foundation
for a future of greater scale. I'm excited for our progress in 2015.
Now, with that in mind, I want to talk about the things that we expect to execute on over the next three, five and 10
years. Over the next three years, our main focus is to continue to serve and grow our community by delivering better
services for people and businesses around the world. One sign of our continued growth and engagement is our progress
on visual and public content.
More than 2 billion photos are now shared daily across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Video grew
significantly this year to an average of more than 3 billion video views per day on Facebook. So, we now have more
than 2 billion interactions every week on Facebook between public figures and their fans.
Instagram is also growing and helping people share and consume the most engaging content in different communities
across the world. Instagram reached 300 million monthly actives, with more than 70% outside of the U.S. Average time
spent using the app continues to be very strong compared to other mobile services.

Across Facebook and Instagram, we've done a very good job on engagement, especially when it comes to helping
people find and consume content they like. In 2015, we'll continue working on this as well as developing more ways
for people to share even more of the moments they care about on Facebook.
Five years ago, most of the content shared on Facebook was text and some photos. Today, it's primarily photos with
some text and video. Over the next five years, we want to keep developing new products and features that help people
share the way they want.
When it comes to serving businesses, we've continued to help drive results for businesses of every size around the
world. Last week, a Deloitte report found that in 2014, Facebook created more than $225 billion of global economic
impact and 4.5 million new jobs. This is an important reminder of the big opportunity we have to create value for
businesses and why we're committed to serving them well. In 2014, we invested aggressively in improving our ad:tech
and measurement tools. We're going to continue working to provide new capabilities for marketers. Sheryl will talk
about this more in a moment.
Next, let's talk about our efforts over the next five years to build the next-generation of Facebook services. We expect
WhatsApp and Messenger to connect hundreds of millions of more people and become indispensable services for the
world as well as important contributors to our business.
Messenger and WhatsApp recently achieved impressive new milestones. In November, Messenger reached 500 million
monthly actives; and in the beginning of January, WhatsApp reached 700 million monthly actives with more than 30
billion messages sent each day. These numbers speak to the quality of both products and the size of the opportunity
ahead to help billions of people communicate and collaborate.
Search at Facebook is another important effort that we expect to create a lot of value over the next few years. In this
quarter, we launched updates to Facebook search to make it easier to find content and posts on mobile and desktop.
We're going to continue listening to feedback from our community and taking the time to build a really valuable
product here. We're optimistic about our ability to deliver value that only Facebook is able to provide.
Working with developers is the other part of our strategy. In this quarter, we continue to make progress with helping
developers build, grow and monetize their apps. In October, we rolled out our Audience Network around the world.
And since then, the number of apps in the network has nearly tripled, and impressions served by the network have more
than quadrupled.
In 2015, we'll continue to build upon our long-term goal of making Facebook a truly cross-platform platform that
allows its developers to share their work across every major mobile platform, and we look forward to sharing more
details at our next F8 event in San Francisco this March.
Finally, let's talk about our plans over the next decade to connect everyone to the Internet through Internet.org and to
develop the next-generation of computing platforms with Oculus.
Internet.org now has a lot of momentum and we've launched free basic Internet services in Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana,
Kenya and Colombia. More than 150 million people living in these countries now have the option to connect to the
Internet using Internet.org and we've already connected 6 million of them to the Internet, who didn't have access before.
We're very excited by Internet.org's progress and the level of interest we're seeing across industries, governments and
our community. 2015 is going to be an important year for our long-term plans and I expect us to share more updates
about our progress here over the coming months.
Oculus continues to make progress toward the future of immersive VR experiences that are part of daily life for
millions of people. This month, the team had another good showing at CES and developer interest in Oculus platform
continues to grow.
So, that's my update for this quarter. It's been a good quarter and a good end to an important year for us. I want to thank
everyone in our Facebook community and our employees, our partners and our stockholders for their support. Thanks
to you, our community is growing stronger every day and we're making progress towards making the entire world more

open and connected.
Thanks. And now here's Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Q4 was strong across the board, topping a great year. This is our first quarter with
over $3 billion in ad revenue and over $2 billion in mobile ad revenue. Our Q4 ad revenue grew 53% year-over-year.
Our mobile ad revenue was 69% of the total ad revenue and doubled in the past year. Our growth is strong across all
verticals and marketer segments. We also saw healthy growth around the world although growth rates outside the U.S.
were affected by exchange rates.
Looking back at 2014, our teams made great progress on our three main priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile;
growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant. We believe that the market
increasingly understands that we have the leading mobile ad product and are the only platform that delivers
people-based marketing at scale.
The shift to mobile is changing the way people consume video. As Mark said, video grew dramatically on Facebook in
2014, especially around global events like the World Cup and the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. In just one year, the
number of videos posts per person on Facebook increased 75% globally and 94% in the U.S. Today, over 50% of
people in the U.S. who come to Facebook daily watch at least one video per day. And globally, over 65% of Facebook
video views occur on mobile.
Marketers have followed this trend and are using video to help people discover and learn about their brands. In Q4, we
expanded autoplay video ads internationally during the holiday season with our many clients telling their stories
creatively through video.
2014 was also the year we began scaling Instagram ads. In Q4, we rolled out Instagram ads in Australia and Canada.
Marketers are excited to have access to the 300 million people who use Instagram and the creativity it inspires.
We're seeing beautiful, creative and great results from brand marketers across verticals, from insurance and tax to retail
and entertainment. For example, as one of our first Instagram video advertisers, Banana Republic developed a series of
videos to promote its new BR clothing line. The videos showed fashion sketches from the new collections and drove a
23 point lift in ad recall. While it's still early and we're being deliberate in our rollout, we believe that Instagram will
become core to advertisers' mobile brand-building efforts.
We also made progress growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Custom Audiences, our suite of
proprietary targeting products, has become an essential tool for segmenting current and potential customers.
Conversion tracking, a way for marketers to measure the impact of their campaigns online, is also seeing wider
adoption. We've made it easier for businesses of all sizes to plan and manage their ad campaigns and for small
businesses to use our targeting tools.
Travel company Thomas Cook recently used Facebook in Belgium to reach a broad audience and used Custom
Audiences to send targeted messages to existing customers based on the places they'd expressed interest in. They
reached 30% of the Belgian population in just one day and achieved a 3.85 times return on investment. Results like
these are attracting more marketers of all kinds to our platform.
Finally, we made great progress improving ad relevance and measurement. To do this, we made significant investments
in both our core measurement and targeting tools as well as ad:tech. Earlier in 2014, we introduced ad buying
capabilities based on reach and frequency metrics, which is similar to how brand marketers buy TV ads and therefore
enables better cross comparisons. We improved our Ads Manager product to give better insights into ad campaigns'
audience and impact.
In the fall, we re-launched Atlas to help marketers reach real people and measure results across multiple devices.
Omnicom was our first global client and this month we announced a partnership with Havas to further expand globally.

We also invested in Audience Network, which helps marketers extend their campaigns off of Facebook, and LiveRail,
which provides publishers with video tools to monetize their inventory more efficiently.
Heading into 2015, we're excited to build on the progress we've made with our core ad products, as well as with newer
areas like video, Instagram and ad:tech. It's still early days in all of these efforts. There's a lot of hard work to do and
we plan to invest aggressively.
Our ultimate goal is to be a critical business partner to our clients, providing people-based marketing at scale to build
their brands and move their products off shelves.
Over the past few weeks, I've had a chance to meet with many of our largest global clients and agency partners and talk
about how we can drive real business results for them, making every impression count and every dollar they spend
improve their bottom line.
Our clients are excited by the opportunity to use video, Instagram and ads on and off Facebook to reach the right people
with the right message. In turn, as our ads become more relevant, we provide a better experience for the people who use
Facebook.
Coming off our biggest year ever, I want to say a special thank you to the Facebook teams around the world. To our
global sales, engineering, product design and infrastructure teams, your accomplishments over this past year are the
reason our business is in such a great place.
To our entire company, I feel lucky to work with you as we stay focused on our priorities and work together to help
connect the world. And to our clients, thank you for your partnership and your trust in us. Heading into 2015, we have
big opportunities and a lot of work ahead. Thanks.
And now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 wrapped up a strong year for Facebook. In 2014, our revenue grew
58% to approximately $12.5 billion and we generated over $3.6 billion in free cash flow. We are very pleased with the
continuing growth of our network.
In December, the number of people using Facebook on an average day increased by 18% compared to last year, to 890
million. The daily number represents 64% of the 1.39 billion people who used Facebook during the month. Mobile
remains the primary driver of our growth. We ended the year with 1.19 billion people using Facebook on mobile in the
month. We also continue to see solid growth with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp recently crossing 300 million,
500 million and 700 million MAU, respectively.
Turning now to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. In addition,
as a reminder, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue in Q4 was $3.9 billion, up 49% or 53% on a constant currency basis. Given how significantly exchange
rates have continued to move, we anticipate that this currency headwind will increase in 2015. I will give more color on
this later in the call.
Ad revenue was $3.6 billion, up 53% or 58% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue in Q4 doubled to $2.5
billion, or 69% of ad revenue compared to approximately $1.2 billion, or 53% of ad revenue last year. Desktop ad
revenue was up approximately 1%, despite the fact that overall desktop usage was down.
In Q4, the average price per ad increased 335%, while total ad impressions declined 65%. Similar to last quarter, these
price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand column ads, which rolled out in the third
quarter.

Total payments and other fees revenue was $257 million, up 7%. Note that the growth was driven by revenue from
acquisitions made in the past year. On an organic basis, payments revenue from games, which represents the substantial
majority of our payments and other fees revenue, declined 10% compared to last year. As previously noted, we expect
this trend to continue as desktop usage declines.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q4 total GAAP expenses were $2.7 billion, up 87%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.6
billion, up 50%. GAAP expense growth was driven primarily by significant stock-based compensation and
amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition. Non-GAAP expense growth was driven primarily by
increases in head count-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
On a full-year basis, our 2014 GAAP expenses were $7.4 billion, up 47%, and our non-GAAP expenses were $5.3
billion, up 34%. We ended the year with roughly 9,200 employees, up 45%. Overall, we remain very pleased with our
ability to attract and retain top-tier talent.
GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion in Q4, representing a 29% operating margin, down from 44% last year, again
primarily due to expenses related to our recent large acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion in Q4,
representing a 58% operating margin, consistent with the margin last year.
Interest and other income and expense was a net expense of $19 million in Q4 versus a net expense of $3 million in Q4
last year. This increase in expense was primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic
re-measurement of our foreign currency balances during the period.
In Q4, we benefited from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Our GAAP tax rate was 37%, but would have been
approximately 42%, excluding the benefit of the tax credit. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 31% and would have been
approximately 32%, excluding this benefit. Q4 net income was $701 million or $0.25 per share, and non-GAAP net
income was $1.5 billion or $0.54 per share.
In 2014, we spent $1.8 billion on CapEx and generated over $3.6 billion of free cash flow. We ended 2014 with $11.2
billion in cash and investments and a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $4.5 billion.
Turning now to the outlook. Let me start with revenue. We are still in the early stages of building out many aspects of
our ads business and we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities. Looking at 2015, there are a couple of
things I want to note. The first involves how the recent movements in exchange rates might impact our 2015 revenue.
Assuming exchange rates were to remain constant at today's levels, we would expect that our total revenue in 2015
would be approximately 5% lower than it would be under 2014 exchange rates. Note this 5% represents the expected
reduction in 2015 total revenue, not the reduction in the year-over-year growth rate.
And second, we're reporting revenue from Atlas, LiveRail and the Audience Network on a net, not a gross basis. So,
the growth in those products will have less of an impact on our overall reported revenue growth in 2015.
Turning now to expenses. We are tightening our ranges modestly, given the better visibility into 2015 spending. We
expect that our full-year 2015 total GAAP expenses will increase 55% to 70% compared to 2014. We expect that our
2015 total non-GAAP expenses will increase 50% to 65%. A simple way of thinking about our investments is across
three categories; people, product and infrastructure.
On the people side, we entered 2015 with 45% more employees than we did a year ago, and we will continue to invest
in and grow the talent base throughout the year. In terms of product, we are investing to build great experiences for
people, marketers and developers, ranging from our existing products and services to newer initiatives such as ad:tech,
Internet.org, Oculus and WhatsApp. We'll also invest in marketing to support all of these initiatives, which, as I noted,
was a driver of expense growth in Q4.
Turning to infrastructure. We continue to build out our global infrastructure to enable billions of people around the
world to connect, message and share with each other. We will be investing in data centers, our network and servers to
grow our existing services and support newer initiatives such as video and our global connectivity efforts through
Internet.org. We anticipate our 2015 CapEx will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion.

We expect stock-based compensation for 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of
which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses for 2015 to be
approximately $700 million to $800 million. And finally, we anticipate our Q1 and full-year 2015 GAAP tax rate to be
in the mid-to-high 40%s, and non-GAAP rates to be in the mid-to-high 30%s.
In summary, Q4 capped off a great year for Facebook in which we executed well and also made some very important
investments for our future. In 2015, we are focused on continuing to execute on the business and investing in our
long-term mission and success.
With that, Courtney, let's open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is
open.
<Q - Heather Anne Bellini>: Great. Thank you. I just had two quick questions. Sheryl or Mark, I was just wondering,
from a brand advertising perspective, is there a way you could share with us how your conversations with these
advertisers have been trending over the past 12 months, how they've been evolving and how they're thinking about the
video opportunity?
And then, Dave, I just wanted to follow-up on your question about total expense guidance, because in the past you've
given a 5 point range, I believe, for total expenses and this year it's 15 point. Granted, you did tighten it, which we
appreciate. And just wondering, the parameters around how we think about the low-end versus the high-end?
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: It's a great time for the brand question because over the past few weeks I've spent a lot of
time kicking off 2015 with our largest agency partners and largest clients. And I would say that people remain really
excited about Facebook, but people are bigger believers because we've had an opportunity to do more measurement
over the past year.
I think there are two things about the Facebook Platform that are really exciting for brand marketers. The first is the
creativity and story-telling and certainly as you mentioned video is a big part of that, because video is a format that
marketers have used for a long time to build emotional connection to brands.
And the second is measurement and what clients want and what they should want is an ability to look at their ad spend
and see how effective it is not just in the brand lift metrics, even though those are important, but in moving products off
shelves, and over the past year-and-a-half the investments we've made in building out that measurement have paid off.
So, when I sit down with clients at the beginning of this year compared to last year, we have more actual case studies of
marketing we've done with them. We've been able to A/B test Facebook ads versus no Facebook ads and what the
effectiveness is on their sales.
And I think across the board, we're showing very healthy very competitive ROI. The opportunity and the challenge
now is to scale. Even for our largest clients globally, we still represent a really small part of what they do and so it's on
us to prove to them that the results we're showing them in these smaller tests can happen in more brands in more
countries with a larger part of their business.
<A - David M. Wehner>: Hi, Heather, it's Dave. So, just following-up on that, where we land in the range of guidance
on expenses will depend on a number of different factors. It's going to depend on how successful we are at hitting our
recruiting goals, how much we ramp in areas like marketing, how quickly we deploy our capital against our CapEx
plan, and then how we execute against our plan of ramping investments in new areas like Oculus, WhatsApp,
Internet.org, et cetera.

We feel good about where we are. We're going into 2015 on a high note, so I feel like we're making these investments
from a position of strength and excited about the opportunities to put more capital to work in 2015.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I wanted to follow-up on your comment around search.
It's early days, but what the company is seeing in terms of the way people are interacting with the new search
functionality inside Facebook, broadly? And then maybe tying it back to advertising, what that might mean for closing
the loop with some of your small and medium-sized business advertises, and maybe even the places initiative,
long-term? Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Sure. So, our view on this is that there's a lot of unique content that people have
shared in Facebook, a lot of personal content, recommendations from friends that you can get that you just wouldn't be
able to get through a traditional web search service or other app. And we're on this multi-year voyage to basically index
all the content and make it available to people and rank it well.
We started off by launching Graph Search, which I think included more than a trillion different connections in the first
system. And the second round of the search progress that we just started rolling out at the end of last year, was Post
Search, which now has indexed more than I think a trillion posts, which I mean, the sizes of these corpuses are bigger
than anything in a traditional web search corpus that you'd find, so it's an interesting and fun challenge to make this
work. We're seeing that the people immediately understand how they can use this and find content that they've seen in
News Feed before or that they've posted with just a few keywords. And we're excited about that, but there's a lot more
to do. So, I'd say, we're not really thinking about advertising in it yet.
On scale that our community operates, a billion searches per day is actually not that big compared to what we think the
opportunity here should be, and we're just continuing to keep on working on it, because there's just a lot of unique value
that people should be able to get from their friends on Facebook through search.

Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is open.
<Q - John R Blackledge>: Great. Thanks. I just wondered, if you could provide your view on Facebook as a video
platform, given that video views per day increased to 3 billion in December from 1 billion in September of 2014. And
how we should think about video content mix over the next couple of years. And same kind of topic, if you can give a
sense of user and advertiser feedback on the autoplay video ads, that'd be great. Thank you.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: I'll talk about the consumer products, and then Sheryl can jump in about ads. So, what
we're seeing, and I alluded to this a bit in my opening remarks, is that there's been this evolution of content on
Facebook over the last 10 years towards richer formats that convey more of the moments that people care about. So, if
you go back five years ago, a lot of Facebook was primarily text, right, and a little bit of photos. Now, I think the
primary mode that people are using to share is photos, and I wouldn't be surprised if in the future that shifted more and
more towards videos.
So, we're thinking about how to enable consumption first of the content that people were sharing. And this year an
increased focus on new opportunities around production, so it's easier for people to capture the moments that are
important to them, create higher-quality moments and pieces of content out of those, and increase their experiences
through that. So, there's a lot more to do here, and I think that this is going to be one of the big trends over the next
three years or five years, is the growth in video and richer content in our service.

<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: From a consumer and marketer feedback on video ads point of view, those two things
really go together. It's exciting that we've gotten to 3 billion video views per day, because that means consumers are
using video ads and enjoying them on Facebook and in News Feed. The way we think about our ads products is, we
want them to blend in with the consumer experience. And so, the fact that we have this much consumer video on
Facebook, means we have an opportunity to grow our ad business, and that's exciting for marketers.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. It looks like you did about $9 of revenue in the U.S. per MAU, which implies over a $30 run
rate, which is impressive. Sheryl, maybe first question to you. How do you grow that from here? Is it usage? Is it more
higher ad loads? Is it the mix of ads? Or is it targeting? Maybe some thoughts on how you grow from there?
And then, Mark, as you look at your other three platforms; WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and other things you
probably have in mind, can they monetize anywhere as well as Facebook, if you look out to your five-year plan? Thank
you.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: So, thanks for the questions. When you think about what's happening, certainly the growth
has been good, but it's still true that marketing dollars have not followed consumer time in the same percentages. So, in
the U.S., mobile gets 25% of consumer media time, but only 10% of the ad budgets. And to take one comparable
example, that means that for every consumer hour spent on print, marketers spend $1, and they spend $0.07 per hour on
mobile, which means that we have an opportunity to grow.
One of the most important ways we grow is not just bringing more marketers into Facebook, having them use more of
our ad products; but as you mentioned, better targeting. A more relevant ad is a better ad experience for consumers, but
also drives a much higher return for marketers. And since we're running an auction, as our ads get more relevant and
we provide higher ROI, we should be able to continue to grow.
I think we've done a good job over the last year making our ads more relevant, and I think people on this call would say
that you see more relevant ads than you used to a year ago. But, I still think some of the Facebook ads still have room
for improvement in terms of relevance, and so we see a lot of room for improvement there, both in the ROI we deliver
and in the experience we can provide consumers.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah. So, I'll add something to that, just on the side of how we think about value
through Facebook, and then I'll talk about the other apps. In terms of the product development that we do here, we have
four major groups inside the company. This is kind of how our company is organized, we have one which is focused on
growing the community; one which is focused on kind of increasing content consumption and people's engagement;
another which is focused on efficiency and helping people get the most value out of each moment that they're spending
in Facebook; and then the fourth group is our core business, which is focused on helping people to see the best ads and
basically make the most money per moment that people are spending at the lowest cost, and most efficiency in terms of
serving people.
And there's, I think, big upside in each of those four categories. I mean, our community is growing. I mentioned in our
comments upfront that time spent across our services grew by 10% year-over-year with per person, which is pretty
meaningful. Utility and efficiency are increasing, and of course, the ad business per person and the efficiency of our
services are both increasing as well. So, I'm pretty excited about that and think we're organized in a way where we can
continue executing against that.
The other opportunities, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, I'm really excited about, and I do think that they're
going to reach the level where they contribute to our business in a pretty big way. But, it's really important to get this
right and not rush it. And what I'd say around messaging is, we're pretty early in that cycle.

We're about where Facebook was in around 2006 or 2007, where at that point Facebook was really just a consumer
product. There were no businesses in the ecosystem and a lot of people were telling us, okay, go put better ads in. And
that felt wrong. I didn't think that that was going to be the right way to build the product or build the business.
So instead, what we did was we built pages, which was a way for businesses to interact for free in the system and start
creating organic interactions between people and businesses, so we could figure out what the people using Facebook
wanted from businesses within Facebook. And we built more tools for pages and businesses to engage. And our recent
success with advertising is really just built on some of those organic interactions between people and businesses.
And what you see in Messenger and WhatsApp now is, we're still at the early end of that curve, where the interaction is
still primarily people-to-people and businesses are starting to figure out, in the case of WhatsApp, much less in
Messenger so far, what the organic interaction is. But, we're going to have to go through a whole cycle of figuring out
how that works, before it really makes sense to start monetizing them in a big way. But, yeah, I mean, I'm a big
fundamental believer that these are going to be very big contributors to our businesses over time, but we just have to do
it right.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you. Two questions. Sheryl, can you talk about where we are in the North
American market versus your other regions in terms of advertiser maturation and acceptance of the Facebook Platform?
The growth rates in North America continue to be really impressive, despite it being your business when you look at
the ARPU trends. And compared to the other regions those seem to be moderating a bit.
And then I was wondering, Dave, if you could talk about the pricing growth which actually accelerated from Q3 to Q4?
Can you give us some color there? I know there were changes to right-hand rail, but anything else you would add about
why there was such a huge acceleration in pricing growth? Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: North America remains a really important market for us. And as you've said, we've had
growth we're very happy with. It's still true that for any client, no matter how big they are for us, we represent a really
tiny part of their ad spend. And we represent an under-investment in terms of where they can reach their consumers.
So, we believe by continuing to make these investments, we can really continue to grow. We get 20% of people's time
on mobile phone in the U.S., between Facebook and Instagram. We don't get close to that in terms of anyone's
marketing spend or the time they spend. What we say to our clients over and over again, is that we want to drive their
business, and that's sort of probably the most important thing we're doing for these large North American spenders, is
around the measurement work we've done. Two years ago, we were not able to measure all the way through to
purchase off the shelves, and now we can.
Yesterday, we rolled out a product we call lift, which is really the next iteration of our measurement capabilities, and
enabled large customers to go in and set up ads with control test groups, that they can A/B test, this group of people
saw a Facebook ad, this group of people didn't. And they can measure all the way through to conversion of whatever
they're measuring, whether it's an online conversion to a sale. We think the measurement out there online and digitally
is not particularly accurate. People don't have real people-based measurement through our investments in Atlas and
through our investments in the core Facebook measuring tools. We think if we can show the ROI marketers are getting
and we can increasingly do so, we can continue to penetrate the North America market.
<A - David M. Wehner>: Ben, it's Dave. So also just building on what Sheryl said, worth noting that the drop in the
value of international currency has impacted our results outside the U.S. So some of what you're seeing here is a result
of that. It reduced year-over-year revenue growth rates by 7% to 8% in the different international regions, so that's a big
reason why you see the U.S. doing much better as well as the fact that's just a more advanced market in what we've
done in terms of just building up the advertiser base and getting adoption of our best targeting products, as Sheryl was
talking about.

Going to your question on pricing grid, I just reiterate what I said in my comments. It's largely due to the right-hand
column redesign and then also the shift to mobile where we don't show right-hand column ads. So, that's really what's
causing the pricing shift.
Then fundamentally, we just continue to get better targeting. That drives better engagement, and as we get better
engagement, that drives better ROI for our advertisers, which ultimately, I think, as Sheryl commented on earlier, gets
reflected in better pricing for our ads. And that's a big opportunity for us and we are seeing that we're getting better and
better at driving engagement from the ad units that we have and getting the right ad in front of the right person. So
that's a big factor as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Douglas Anmuth, your
line is now open.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian W. Wieser>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First, I was wondering, if you could talk about the degree
to which, you think, premium video content, where it's not necessary to optimally capture budgets from advertiser that
might otherwise have gone to TV? You have a couple of initiatives around ABC and NFL. So, I was curious to hear
your thoughts on that.
And separately, among clients who are using Atlas, and especially those who are new to Atlas, do you get a sense that
their spending on digital media is changing? Or, if so, how? And, alternately, are they just happier with their campaign
management tools? Thanks very much.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: So, on video ads, what really matters is that consumers are using video on Facebook,
because that gives us an opportunity, one, to provide a great consumer experience, but, two, to have ads match that
consumer experience. If there wasn't consumer video on Facebook, video ads in your News Feed would be very jarring.
As a percentage of the videos you're seeing, video ads fit nicely into that experience. I don't think it matters as much
what the video content is. And so, while we're certainly exploring some premium content – as you said, we have an
NFL/Verizon test out there in the public eye, we're already seeing pretty explosive growth without that kind of
premium content in the system in large numbers. And so, we'll continue to figure out. We're certainly open to
increasing video content either way, but we haven't quite figured out what the mix needs to be and right now, the
growth is very strong.
In terms of Atlas, we just re-launched this fall and we're just seeing as deals get done in broad adoption, so I think it's
too soon for us to report that Atlas drives an increase in digital spend or an increase in any particular kind of spend.
But, here's what we believe really deeply, which is that Atlas is going to revitalize marketing by making the
measurement more accurate.
If you look at how digital ads are being measured, they're being measured based on a cookie-based world that assumes
that people have one device, largely, a PC, and that's just not true. Consumers have phones. They have tablets. They
have PCs as well. And the ability to understand that, that's one person, to serve an ad and measure all the way through
correctly, we think it's going to massively improve the efficiency in the system as it gets adopted.

There's a narrative out there we sometimes encounter that publishers are growing a bit concerned about the power you
guys wield, particularly as you push into monetizing off the platform. Thanks very much.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Our Audience Network efforts are still pretty new. We have a goal of serving more
relevant ads to people off Facebook, which will provide greater reach for Facebook marketers and also a better
opportunity to monetize for publishers.
We're seeing some nice results so Shazam reported that using Audience Network increased their revenue from ad
networks by 37%. We believe that working with publishers, if we can increase the value of their inventory by providing
more relevant and targeted ads they're going to be really happy with that opportunity and we're in the early stages of
finding those partners.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks. Thanks a lot. First for either Mark or Sheryl, on the subject of public video
content and what you guys are doing to increase the amount of video in the News Feed. Are there things in terms of
actors, celebrities, public figures that you can do to economically incentivize those creators of, let's say, the higher
quality user-generated content onto the Facebook Platform, be it a revenue share, what have you, are relative to the
economics for those types of folks on competing online video platforms?
And then just one quick one for Dave. You mentioned – I just had to ask, you mentioned you'd be shifting the
accounting for Facebook Audience Network and LiveRail for revenue to be net of TAC in 2015 versus gross in 2014.
I'm just wondering why the decision to do that? And is there anything you can help us with in terms of order of
magnitude of that shift? Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: So, on premium video content, we haven't figured out exactly how important this is to the
ecosystem or how much we're going to invest or what kind of monetization we're going to offer. Video is growing quite
nicely through the ecosystem right now.
We have made a lot of investments in public content working with public figures to use the Facebook Platform. We're
by far the largest social platform and increasingly you're seeing public figures, everything from news broadcasters, to
journalists, to public figures do a lot on Facebook and that's important to us because it provides a kind of sharing
people want.
People come to Facebook to share with their friends and family, but they also come to Facebook to connect with
everyone from politicians to journalists to celebrities they want to connect with and get news and we're definitely
seeing public content grow as a percentage of what people get.
We also had some nice wins with the Golden Globes this year. Other things we're doing to go deeper, doing some
partnerships, we did in Davos at CNBC to show how we can help content creators increase their distribution and reach
people directly on Facebook.
<A - David M. Wehner>: Yeah. And, Anthony, it's Dave. Just to be clear that net revenue recognition for those
products that's how we did it in Q4 as well. Those are all small today, but there's not a change in accounting in 2015.
That's how we accounted for those products in Q4. As far as the net versus gross, we just evaluated all the facts and
circumstances and made the judgment that net revenue recognition was the most appropriate treatment here.

<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks. Just following-up on the video concept, how important is it that Facebook host the
videos versus sharing clips from third-party players in the feed? And what percent of that 3 billion streams daily is
Facebook-embedded versus from other players? And are you able to monetize videos from third-party players today or
is there a way to work around that in the future? Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: This stuff that we shared, of 3 billion a day is all native on Facebook, so there are
probably other shares from other video services as well, but the way that those look in our services are as if they are
linked to other sites. And the reason why I think native video is so valuable for people using our service is that when
someone uploads a video to Facebook directly, we can optimize how it's delivered, right? So, we can make it autoplay.
We can find the right quality and bit rate to send down to the person based on their connection over time and optimize
all kinds of different things. So, what I think people are finding from public figures to everyday videos that people are
uploading is that the best experience that you can get is by uploading content native to Facebook which is I think a big
part of the growth that we're seeing here.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Great. Thank you. I wonder if it's possible to distinguish how much of the growth in
advertising revenues can be attributed to changes in organic compressions and how you balance the desire of business
partners to contribute content to feeds versus monetization? Thank you.
<A - David M. Wehner>: Not sure, I exactly understand the question, but let me see if I can take a crack at it, Colin. I
mean, we're seeing obviously great growth in DAU, which is up 18%. We're seeing good growth in time spent across
the network, up 10% per DAU. So, you've got those sort of underlying drivers of engagement driving growth.
We're also monetizing at higher rates, because we're able to get better targeting into the ads and get better conversion
for advertisers, so that's reflected in better pricing. So, there's a number of different factors that are coming into play,
but clearly driving organic growth and engagement is critical in the business, and we're seeing good success there.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: One thing that I'd just add to emphasize here, because I think there have been a
couple of questions to this effect is that our primary strategy for growing the ad business is increasing the quality of the
content, not increasing the number of ads per story that people are seeing on Facebook.
So, there are impacts like as people consume more content on Facebook, within the ratio of ads to organic content that
will show, they might see more ads; but overall, our strategy is much less about increasing the volume of ads and much
more about increasing the quality of the content and the quality of the targeting to get the right content to the right
people.
And this was a pretty controversial strategy internally and we weren't sure if that was going to work out; but for the last
year, it's really fueled our growth in a good way and we feel very confident that this is the right path going forward as
well.

mission-focused company and we wake up every day and make decisions because we want to help connect the world,
and that's we're doing here.
So, part of the subtext of your question is that, yeah, if we were only focused on making money, we might put all of our
energy on just increasing ads to people in the U.S. and the other most developed countries. But that's not the only thing
that we care about here.
So, I do think that over the long-term that focusing on helping to connect everyone will be a good business opportunity
for us as well. We may not be able to tell you exactly how many years that's going to happen in, but as these countries
get more connected, the economies grow, the ad markets grow, and if Facebook and the other services in our
community are the number one and number two, three, four, five services that people are using, then over time we will
be compensated for some of the value that we've provided. But, this is why we're here. We're here because our mission

<Q - Paul Vogel>: Great. Thank you very much. I'm just curious, given the impact that currency had on the quarter on
growth rates outside the U.S., is there any market you could call out, particularly, that were either better or worse that
might be masked by the currency swings, number one? And, number two, I'm just curious, if currency does stay where
it is, does it all impact your spending plans or how and where and when you'll invest? Thanks.
<A - David M. Wehner>: Hey, Paul. It's Dave. Sort of taking your second part first, we're not really making
investments' decisions on short-term fluctuations in currencies. So, I would say, in general, no, it's not affecting, not
affecting those decisions.
There are certainly big macro effects that are going on and part of those are what's driving a lot of the currency
fluctuation as well, so you have regions that are certainly growing more quickly and regions that are growing more
slowly. So from a macro perspective, the United States is doing better in terms of growth versus Europe versus Latin
America. You see those compounded in both currency and sort of macroeconomic conditions in those regions. So, I'd
say generally we've got more favorable market conditions in which to operate in the U.S.
Overall, I would say the business is driven by the fundamentals of us continuing to execute against our plan. So,
whether you're in a market that's suffering a little bit from a macroeconomic headwind, we still have the best mobile
product in the market, in that market and we're growing.
So I think at the end of the day, it's the fundamentals of our business that are going to drive our success and we're kind
of focused on that. But wanted to at least give some color around how the currencies might impact the 2015 results.

efficiency and ROI, so that, whether it be acquisitions or CapEx or even OpEx, how you look and see you're getting a
good return on that spend? Thanks so much.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Q4 is a really important quarter, in general, but it's a particularly important quarter for
e-commerce so it's a timely question. When you think about buy on Facebook, it's a small test in the U.S. we started
last quarter, it enables people to buy on pages. To be clear, you're not buying from Facebook. You're buying directly
from the merchant and it's really an SMB product to give them capability they haven't had.
We'll see what happens in terms of where people convert, whether it's on Facebook, but we think the opportunity to
connect consumers with the products that they then purchase is a really big one. Where we play in that most directly is
the time and attention consumers have, as well as the information to do very relevant advertising and we're going to
stay focused there.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Robert, I think the bulk of the investment that we're doing is really focused on the
capital and the OpEx to deliver against the core mission of enabling billions of people to connect and share. So for the
most part, we're looking at what we need to deploy to deliver against the mission to deliver against our overall financial
results. There are places where we can individually take out specific projects whether it be M&A or specific capital
investments and then we'll look at those on an IRR basis for a specific project, but you have to recognize that we're
basically one large business and we're operating against capital deployment against delivering against the objectives of
that business. So, that's the bulk of the spend that we do, but certainly we look at things on an ROI basis on individual
project basis as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.
<Q - Arvind Bhatia>: Thanks for taking the question. Just quickly on WhatsApp, I know the focus will be user growth
for a while. But in the future, as you do turn on the monetization engine, just curious what are some of the primary
ways that you're assuming growth will come from, it won't be advertising or games perhaps. And also, on WhatsApp
user growth, would you be able to call out where that's coming from? Is there any particular areas that are stronger?
And curious how that's doing in the U.S.? Thank you.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: So, you're right that the focus for WhatsApp is on helping to connect a lot more
people. Right. So, when Jan and the team joined us, one of the first things that we agreed on and why I think it made
sense for them to join, is that now they can focus for a few years on getting to 1 billion more than that and continuing to
scale beyond that. SMS is an incredibly global and universal product and I think WhatsApp just has a use huge
opportunity to serve billions of people.
In terms of what the business looks like, at the end of the day, it's a distribution business like Facebook and Instagram.
How you most effectively convert that into business opportunities for customers, whether that's through payments or
ads or other different kinds of structures, we'll figure that out what the optimal thing will be.
But the first-order thing to do is to help serve billions of people here, help continue to increase engagement, people are
spending a lot of time in WhatsApp, sending more than 30 billion messages a day which is really crazy when you think
about the volume there compared to the global SMS volume overall, and I think if we do that, there'll be a number of
opportunities.
People asked me this question a while ago about how we thought about games on Facebook as well. And I always
thought about our canvas business on desktop, even though it was payments, is actually the same thing as our business
on mobile around app install and engagement. What developers tasked for is distribution, and whether they're doing
that through payments or ads or whatever it is, it kind of is all the same.

The most important thing is to help people connect, help people and businesses connect, create business opportunities
and then you get a small amount of the value that you're creating on top. So, that will play out over the next set of years
and it's one of the intellectual challenges that I'm really looking forward to tackling.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Operator, we have time for one last question.

Your last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Great. Thank you. Sheryl, the size of the ad revenue that Facebook is generating and the
growth, these are large budgets that are shifting over to Facebook. Any commentary on where you think those budgets
are coming from? What are the source of funds?
And then I know, David, the engagement levels seem to be rising. There seem to be a little slip in the engagement
levels, that DAU over MAU ratio in Asia and the rest of world, at least sequentially. Is that just noise or is that a reason
to panic? Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: I don't think there's any single force of where the dollars are coming from. Certainly as
consumer time and attention is shifting to mobile, the marketer time and attention. We pay a lot of attention to the
market or segments we work with, so we're seeing strong growth from brand from direct response like e-commerce
from SMBs and developers, and we stay pretty focused not really on the force of where the money is coming from, but
what are the objectives people are spending against on Facebook, so that we can meet all the different objectives.
We understand that in order to continue to grow, we want to continue to grow, we're going to have to start multiple
objectives on the Facebook Platform and that's what we're focused on.
<A - David M. Wehner>: Mark, I think the simple stories we're really pleased with how we're executing on the
engagement front, 64% of people coming to Facebook monthly, coming on an average day is we think a great stat.
I think small changes are pretty much noise. I mean, we're really happy with it. We talked about things like the video
engagement. Mark shared some stats like how much photo sharing is going on across our properties. So overall, I think
engagement is a great story for us and we're really happy with it.
