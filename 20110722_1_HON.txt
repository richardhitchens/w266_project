MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Honeywell Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host
for today's conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elena Doom
Thank you, Javahn. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Here
with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. This call and
webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. Note
that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the
world and of our businesses as we view them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret
them in that light.
This morning we will review our financial results for the second quarter, as well as share with you our expectations for
the third quarter and the remainder of the year, and of course allow time for your questions.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.
David M. Cote
Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. As you saw from our press release, we had another outstanding quarter with
better than expected performance, reflecting terrific execution and continued momentum in our key end market,
yielding EPS above the high end of the range. While there's some accounting geography complexity because of how we
are required to account for discontinued ops and launch payments, and Dave will take you through all that, the overall
results certainly speak for themselves with sales up 15%, EPS up 40%, and guidance again raised for the year.

Now before we get into the financials, I'm pleased to report on the progress that we've made in the quarter on the CPG
divestiture. We have received regulatory clearance and anticipate the sale to Rank Group to close early in the third
quarter. Dave will take you through more details in a moment, but we've transitioned to reporting CPG in discontinued
ops. And we expect to smartly deploy the book gain and sales proceeds in the third quarter, which will deliver tangible
benefit in 2012 and beyond.
So our reported sales with the discontinued ops treatment of CPG were $9.1 billion, up 15%, reflecting continued
advancement in our new products, high-growth regions, continued strength in end markets, and growth from
acquisitions. Segment margins expanded 70 basis points to 14.3% in the quarter, including $80 million of payments
made to Aero BGA OE customers in the quarter.
We have very robust new product launches. So if you look at the Commercial and Business and General Aviation side,
whether it's Embraer, Gulfstream, or Dassault, we have a number of large platform wins with high content. We
generated earnings per share of $1.02, up an impressive 40% over 2010, and free cash flow of nearly $1 billion in the
quarter, reflecting 120% net income conversion. This really reinforces the quality of our earnings performance, volume,
leverage, and continued cost controls, while our maintaining our growth investment and our seed planting for the
future.
Given the strength of our first-half financial performance and positive outlook for the second half, we are again raising
our full-year guidance. We now expect earnings in the range of $3.85 to $4.00 per share, reflecting a 28% to 33%
increase in earnings over the prior year. We think this is top-tier performance amongst our multi-industry peer group,
and we're confident in our ability to generate strong earnings growth again in 2012.
The momentum we've seen our across our end markets is being supplemented by the results of our seed planting
initiatives throughout the portfolio. Aerospace's Commercial Aftermarket continues to see a robust recovery with
spares up 30%-plus, and R&O significantly outpacing flight hours. Further, we're seeing the resurgence of the
Commercial OE cycle, where we're smartly positioning the business to capture new business opportunities. That means
having the latest innovative new products and technologies like our recently announced joint development with Safran
to provide green electric taxi capabilities for new and existing aircraft, saving airlines millions in fuel costs and
slashing carbon and other emissions created during runway taxi operations.
Our short-cycle businesses including Advanced Materials, ACS Products, and Turbochargers continued to show a
healthy pace of growth, while our longer-cycle businesses like Process Solutions and UOP are starting to kick-in with
double-digit growth in the quarter. Further, our investments and focus in emerging regions continue to pay off. Sales in
China were up over 20%. Our strong quarterly performance and improved outlook for 2011 reinforce that our strategy
is working. Having great positions in good industries, the power of One Honeywell, our consistent focus on improving
every year in each of our five initiatives, it really makes a difference.
So with that, let me turn the good news over to Dave.
David J. Anderson
Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'm going to start on slide 4, and
I'm going to take you through the summary of the results for the second quarter. First, on a pre-disc ops basis, meaning
that we would have reported if CPG were included in our continuing operations, and importantly, consistent with the
way in which we guided for the quarter. So as you can see on slide 4, sales were up – sales, rather, of $9.3 billion were
up 14%, of course reflects the high-end of the guidance that we last communicated to you in early June. It reflects 7%
organic growth with greater than expected growth in every region. The Americas were up 4% organic, Europe and
Africa up 8%, and China, as Dave said, up 20%. Importantly, emerging markets remained very strong with growth
above 20% year-to-date on a constant currency basis.
Acquisitions contributed 3% growth, and currency yielded a tailwind of approximately 4% in the quarter. Segment
profit was up 20%; segment margins at 14.2% reflected margin expansion in every segment when you exclude the Aero

OE launch payments that Dave highlighted, and I'm going to take you through some of that detail when we get into
Aero. But very quickly, in the quarter Aero realigned milestones to better reflect Business Aviation, several Business
Aviation customers' platform development schedules. Now as a reminder, and this is important when you look at the
Honeywell financials, our Aerospace business does not capitalize payments to OE manufacturers to offset
pre-production costs.
Now as a result of the recognition of these expenses, we recorded about $80 million in the quarter, significantly higher
than we guided for Aero this year. And importantly and strategically, it gives the company more capacity for R&D
spend at a time when program funding, positive wins, et cetera, are a positive for the Aerospace business and the
growth outlook for the Commercial Aerospace OE cycle.
As I take you through the business highlights, you'll see that all of the businesses are doing a terrific job executing and
delivering on those commitments, and while continuing to invest for growth. We'll take you through each of those
business unit highlights in just a moment. Now as Dave referenced, earnings per share of $1.02 were up 40%, above the
high-end of the guidance range, and just to refresh, we've guided on a same basis $0.94 to $0.98 for the quarter. The
upside of the quarter was driven by robust Commercial Aero Aftermarket sales and another outstanding quarter from
Specialty Materials.
Now a couple of items to point out, in the quarter we recognized also $61 million in OPEB curtailment gains. These
resulted from the resolution of ongoing labor negotiations and plan amendments in the quarter. We also had $7 million
of net repositioning expense, which by the way, brings total repositioning to $51 million year-to-date, mostly covered
with gains. And of course consistent with our strategy to utilize one-time below-the-line gains, we're expecting to fully
deploy the third quarter CPG sale gain with re-positioning and other actions. And I'll touch on that a little bit later in
our review this morning.
Lastly, on the income statement, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.6%, roughly in line with last year. Free
cash flow, we were very pleased, $973 million, essentially equal to last year, and an impressive 120% conversion of net
income. And importantly, we absorbed higher CapEx investments, growth investments in the quarter primarily, as well
as higher cash taxes versus the same period last year. So in summary, another terrific quarter for Honeywell,
better-than-expected earnings performance driven by higher Commercial Aftermarket sales; better conversion,
primarily in Specialty Materials. And the below-the-line gains were more than offset by the recognition of the Aero OE
payments and the repositioning actions we took in the quarter.
Turning to slide 5, now let's look at the same results on a post-disc ops basis just quickly. We've recast both the second
quarters of '10 and '11 to reflect the discontinued ops treatment of CPG. So the net earnings impact of CPG has been
included in EPS from discontinued operations, and the core sales segment profit margin all reflect the change in both
comparable periods.
So in 2011, you can see $234 million of revenue from CPG; $22 million of segment profit has been removed and
reported as net earnings per share from discontinued operations of $0.02. Now CPG contributed roughly the same
amount of net earnings in '10 as '11, so there's no change to reported – and there is no change to reported free cash
flow. So when you exclude CPG, you can see sales increased 15% year-over-year, 8% organic, and segment margins
expanded 70 basis points year-over-year. And of course, going forward we'll be reporting the financial results for
Honeywell with CPG and disc ops, and recast prior periods to reflect comparable performance.
So now let's move to each of the businesses starting on slide 6 with Aerospace. For the quarter, reported sales for
Aerospace were up 6% to $2.8 billion. That would have been 9% in the absence of the increased launch contributions
made in the quarter. We saw strong Commercial Aftermarket growth partially offset by lower Commercial OE sales,
due to the BGA OE payments I referenced earlier. Now the Commercial OE sales decreased by 5%, but were up 11%
excluding the OE payments made in the quarter. We saw good growth from higher air transport OE build rates and the
continued uptake of airline selectables, along with the continued rebound in business aviation aircraft driven by our
strong positions in mid- to large cabin classes; think of that prominently as Gulfstream and Dassault. Going forward,
we expect Commercial Aero OE growth of about 25% in the second half of 2011.

Commercial Aftermarket sales were up 21% in the quarter, reflecting strong spares figures, higher aircraft utilization
rates, and also RMUs. Let me just take you through some of the details on the Commercial Aftermarket. Air transport
regional flight hours were up about 5.7% in the quarter, and we're still expecting flight hours to grow about 5% for the
full year, partly a function of robust delivery schedules as well as the increased utilization of the existing fleets.
Spares were particularly strong, up 30% in the quarter following a first quarter increase of 28%. In addition, we're
seeing the older aircraft, which need more repair and overhaul, return to service and to the shop floor. R&O was up
15% in the quarter, more than twice the rate of flight hour growth. Looking at the entire Commercial Aftermarket, the
first-half sales were up 17%, and we expect the second-half growth rates to moderate somewhat, but we still expect
mid-teens growth for the total Commercial Aftermarket in the second half of the year.
Defense & Space was up 1% in the quarter, and we're tracking ahead of plan year-to-date for D&S. We saw particularly
strong international spares demand, partially offset by program completions as well as anticipated program ramp
downs. We continue to plan for further U.S. defense budgetary pressures in reprogramming, and we reiterate our
forecast for low single-digit declines in D&S for 2011.
And again, while segment profit grew 2% in Aero, margins were significantly impacted by the BGA OE payments that
I referenced earlier that we recognized. And if you exclude the impact of these payments on a year-over-year basis,
margins would have been up 110 basis points to 17.1%. Now, again, what that analysis reflects is the difference
between launch contributions second quarter 2011 and the same launch contributions in the same period last year.
Let's now turn to slide number 7 in the Automation and Control Solutions business, ACS. ACS, as you can see, sales
were up 20% in the quarter reflecting five consecutive quarters of strong organic growth. Acquisitions, mainly Sperian,
added 8%. Foreign exchange contributed 6%. The ACS continued to be see good emerging market penetration, sales up
over 25%, led by China and the Middle East.
The ACS Products businesses, up 23% reported, 6% organic, reflecting growth across the portfolio despite continued
softness in the construction markets. Now we continue to see good growth in industrial; the PPE business, the Personal
Protection Equipment business; Gas Detection; Sensors Controls; ECC Environmental Controls. Further, the HVAC
Controls, Security, and Fire Products pieces of ACS saw meaningful improvements in June with an uptick in retrofit
activity, driven primarily by new product introductions, energy efficiency, competitive win, and code requirements.
The Solutions business were up 16% reported, 5% organic; double-digit reported growth in Process Solutions as they
execute on their large global project backlog. Building Solutions is expected to accelerate to mid- to high-single-digit
organic growth in the back half of 2011, as some of the large wins from late 2010 will begin to convert from backlog to
revenue. And by the way, the backlog in the Total Solutions businesses remained strong, up mid-teens organically in
the quarter.
ACS sales conversion was about 15%; segment margin up 40 basis points to 12.8%, reflecting strong volume increases
in productivity partly offset by inflation and the investment for growth across the portfolio. And significantly, you
recall the investments that we began to make in this business as we saw the resurgence in the second half of 2010.
Now lapping these investments and the Sperian close last year, the ACS expects higher conversion rates in the
back-half of the year, however, partially offset by the diluted impact of the recently announced EMS acquisition. We
now expect full-year margins for ACS to be up approximately 50 basis points over 2010.
Let's now transition to slide 8, Transportation Systems. Again, when you look at slide 8, CPG is no longer being
reported within the Transportation Systems segment. In the quarter, TS sales were up 26% driven by volume increases
primarily in turbocharger sales. Turbo sales continue to outperform the industry macros.
During the quarter, light vehicle production declined 3%, but importantly, European diesel penetration expanded 3
points compared to last year. However, Turbo unit sales were very strong, up high teens in the quarter. This
performance reflects the high win rate on both new gas and new turbodiesel platforms globally. To put it in perspective,
about a third of the growth that we saw in the quarter came from favorable industry macros; two-thirds of that came
from the benefit of successful new launches. Segment profit for TS was up 45% from last year. Margins expanded 160

basis points to 13% due to volume increases and productivity. These were partially offset by higher commodity costs.
Let's now go to slide 9, Specialty Materials, which obviously saw another terrific quarter; double-digit growth in both
UOP and Advanced Materials and high incremental sales conversions. Sales in the quarter for SM in total were up
12%. Segment margin was again very high at 20%. Now sales at UOP for the second quarter were up 12%. We saw
growth in services related to the ongoing front-end engineering and design work, or FEED, with Petrobras, as well as
higher licensing and refining catalyst revenues. We continued to see the recovery and benefit from the recovery in the
global refining, as well as the continued strength in the petrochemical industries.
UOP's book-to-bill ratio remains above 1, and we expect to see growth in UOP accelerate in the second half, driving
full-year growth toward the high teens. Now Advanced Materials sales in the quarter were up 12%. We saw strong
end-market demand and tight supply conditions still prevalent in many of our key segments. We saw strong demand for
caprolactam resins in Asia. [ph] Flooring products (19:42) were up 8% driven by seasonally strong demand for
refrigerants and tight industry supply conditions. And Specialty Products is also up an impressive 14% in the quarter
with above-market growth led by penetration of new product introductions.
Segment margin for SM continued to be high in the second quarter due to favorable prices over raw material spreads,
higher licensing revenues, and also continued productivity, partially offset by investments that we're making for
growth, as well as the continued investment in plant reliability and upgrades. And while we continue to expect a good
year from SM, the margins, as we've said before, we don't believe are sustainable at this rate, due to both seasonal
factors as well as supply-demand and commodity inflation factors, which we believe will adjust over the rest of the
year. Additionally of course, as a reminder, the acquisition of the phenol plant from Sunoco, which we expect to close
imminently, will be diluted to margin rates and will add $250 million of sales to the second half with little to no profit
this year.
So as a result of the better than expected conversion we again saw in SM, we're now planning SM margins over 18%
for the full year, excluding the dilutive impact of the phenol plant acquisition in the third quarter. And again, this
represents, this acquisition represents about 250 basis points of improvement – I'm sorry, the margin rate that we're
now forecasting for SM represents about 250 basis points of improvement over 2010, in spite of continued investments
for growth and plant reliability.
Now let's go to, having gone through the four segments for the second quarter, let's go to slide 10, talk about an update
for our end markets, what we're seeing and what we're expecting. Now given the pace of the strong second quarter
performance and the economic uncertainty that still lingers, obviously, we'd like to take just a few minutes to just give
you some more backdrop of how we're thinking for the remainder of the year.
Starting with Aerospace, the commercial spares in R&O continue to gain traction with total Commercial Aftermarket
up 7% sequentially from the first quarter. Airlines and business jet operators are catching up on deferred maintenance.
We've seen a moderate amount of restocking of inventory of the airlines. The Commercial OE backlog is robust and we
think will provide a tailwind for growth for 2012 and beyond. In spite of the expected declines in Defense, we're
planning for low single-digit declines there driven by further Defense budget pressures and reprogramming.
For ACS, we continue to see the positive impact of industrial recovery supported by increases in manufacturing
production; however, we're seeing growth moderate as we lap tougher comps in several businesses including S&C,
Scanning and Mobility, and ECC, where they're already at or exceeding pre-recession highs.
The developed market external indicators continue to show softness in the commercial construction end markets for
ACS, but we've seen some improvement in residential construction, but we're still planning for a soft and slow recovery
there. And in the emerging markets, we continue to see a plan for good organic growth. For the ACS Solutions and
UOP businesses, we're executing on large project backlog and obviously wins to-date. And these long-cycle businesses
will continue to experience positive multi-year growth cycle with book-to-bill ratios currently above 1.
And SM's Advanced Materials businesses is benefiting from the healthy global end market. The growth and
profitability, however, as I've said earlier, will moderate as supply-demand conditions and price are [ph] off-spread
stabilized (23:40) while volume growth will still be robust. And lastly, for the global automotive outlook, we see

production rates stabilizing after several initial adjustments from the Japan earthquake, which affected numbers earlier
in the year. However, we expect Turbocharger sales growth to continue to outpace the industry macros given the
success of new launches. However, we expect the rate of growth to moderate as production schedules and diesel
penetration rates level off.
So with that backdrop, that summary backdrop, let's go to slide 11 and talk about first-half to second-half comparisons.
What we're showing here in the bars are the actual and forecasted first and second-half 2011 sales growth rates for each
of the major businesses. These are intended to highlight the expected linearity in each of the businesses. We've broken
out the estimated impact also, as you can see, from acquisitions as well as foreign exchange, so you can see the organic
growth acceleration and deceleration across the portfolio.
And what stands out clearly on the slide is Defense & Space with the anticipated decline there; the continued strength
in Commercial Aero; continued good organic growth in ACS Products and Solutions; slowing growth, as we've talked
about, in TS in the back half of the year, with tough year-over-year comps; and finally, very strong growth planned in
UOP and Advanced Materials. And you can see for Advanced Materials, we've adjusted that for the phenol plant
acquisition in the second half to give comparability on a half-over-half basis.
Let's now go to slide 12 and talk now about translating that outlook in terms of the outlook for financial performance in
the second half. So we expect continued good organic growth in the range of 5% to 8% compared to 9% in the first
half, and total sales growth in the range of 9% to 12%. We expect a slight tailwind from foreign exchange with the euro
in the range of $1.35 to $1.40, and the favorable impact from net M&A. Now we had strong pricing and productivity in
the first half, growing segment margins 90 basis points over 2010 levels, and we expect the second half sales
conversion will be slightly lower due to tougher year-over-year comps, moderating price to raw spreads in SM, and the
dilutive impact of acquisitions.
Also, it's important to provide you with an update on our tax rate assumptions. You'll recall the first-half tax rate was
slightly higher than our usual ongoing rate of 26.5%, and there's always obviously variability from quarter to quarter.
But we're planning for about 26.5% for the full year, with the various planning initiatives yielding a slightly more
favorable rate in the second half. And lastly, we're well on our way to achieving our full-year target of 795 million
weighted average fully diluted shares. During the quarter, we deployed $500 million to share repurchases, and it puts us
on track to achieve the roughly $1 billion in share buyback that we're planning for the full year.
So with that framework for the second half, let's go to slide 13 to quickly review our third quarter sales outlook. In total
on slide 13, we're planning for company sales in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.4 billion, up 12% to 15% from the third
quarter. We've talked about many of the drivers for our businesses, including Aerospace and ACS and SM. Those are
all consistent themes. One item we're pointing out on this slide is we anticipate third quarter sales in TS to be
sequentially lower as a result of seasonal summer shutdowns at the European OEMs, which is consistent with our view,
also, of stabilizing diesel penetration and production rates. And you'll recall, last year in the third quarter we had
abnormally high production rates in the third quarter with lower than normal seasonal shutdowns at the European
OEMs.
Slide 14, the third quarter earnings guidance. Let's take a moment now to review our third quarter EPS guidance, which
we've reflected as a walk from our strong second quarter operational performance. So we'll start with the $1.02 for the
second quarter.
Layering on our normal seasonality and the continued growth we're expecting, we're forecasting $0.04 to $0.08 higher
operating earnings. Now as I mentioned earlier, we're also expecting pricing and seasonal headwinds from fluorines
products and normal summer shutdowns by the European automotive OEs affecting Turbo. This translates into
sequential, approximately $0.06 headwind. Depending upon the timing within the quarter, we think the EPS dilution
associated with the loss of CPG, as well as the dilutive impact of the EMS acquisition, third quarter will be in the range
of $0.03 to $0.04 compared to the second quarter. Therefore we'll arrive at an all-in third quarter guidance range of
$0.96 to $1.01.

So now let's go to slide 15 and now fold in the impact associated with the CPG sale. So consistent with what we've said
previously, we'll book a gain of approximately $150 million after tax associated with the CPG sale. Think of that as
$0.19, and we expect to fully redeploy that gain with repositioning and other actions in the third quarter. So for
reporting purposes the gain on the sale of CPG will be recognized in discontinued operations, while the redeployment
of the gain will be netted in continuing operations. So to ensure there's no confusion, what we've shown you on this
slide is both our all-in EPS guidance for the third quarter as well as our continuing operations EPS guidance, both
including and excluding the gain redeployment.
So moving to the right of the page, we're still planning to efficiently and accretively redeploy the proceeds of
approximately $950 million. About $400 million will be allocated to the U.S. pension plan or to the extent it offsets the
cash tax gain on the sale. This will bring our 2011 cash pension contributions to approximately $1.4 billion, and the
funded status to approximately 90%, which significantly closes the gap on future funding obligations. The remainder of
the proceeds will be directed to buybacks to continue to fund our share repurchase plan of approximately $1 billion for
the year. Again, as Dave said at the outset, we're very pleased with the progress we've made on this transaction and
expect it to close early in the third quarter.
So let's go now to slide 16 and talk about the full-year financial guidance there and some of the important updates, as
well as kind of the puts and takes, if you will, on that guidance. We've increased our sales outlook for the year,
importantly, to $36.1 billion to $36.7 billion, and again now assumes discontinued operations treatment for CPG for the
entire year.
So first is our prior guidance of $36.0 billion to $36.6 billion. We're now excluding roughly $500 million of previously
assumed sales from CPG. The revised outlook reflects an increase in core revenues of approximately $600 million at
the midpoint; an organic increase of about $150 million spread across all of our business segments; about $100 million
from favorable foreign exchange relative to our prior guidance, and again, we're using the range of about $1.35 to
$1.40, so think of that as the midpoint of that range; and about $350 million from announced acquisitions. We've also
shown the full-year split between continuing and discontinued ops with a gain residing in discontinued ops and the
offsets in continuing operations.
Given the first half performance, the momentum we're seeing in the businesses, we're ramping our full-year 2011
earnings outlook by $0.05. So the bottom of the range moves from $3.80 to $3.85, and the top of the range moves from
$3.95 to $4.00. It reflects a gross increase of $0.08 on the low end and high end, as we're now absorbing approximately
$0.03 to $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions that wasn't in our prior guidance. We're also confirming our free cash flow
outlook for the year in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion prior to U.S. pension contributions, cash contributions.
Now in our revised outlook for the year, we think that we've maintained a balanced view, given the uncertainties that
surround the global macro environment and the volatility in the commodity and foreign exchange markets. While we
expect UOP growth to accelerate further in the second half, due to the project nature of UOP and the lumpy shipment
timing, you could expect there could be some volatility quarter-to-quarter and project timing could delay. On the other
hand, on the positive side, we're encouraged by the rate of improvement and uptick on the Commercial Aerospace
markets. And if pricing holds, we believe SM could be even better than we've guided. So as we sit here today, we feel
we have a path to a high end of the outlook range, and we're also appropriately covered on the downside should the
economy slow and the euro move lower.
So just summarizing then on slide 17, obviously another terrific quarter for Honeywell, reflecting continued positive
momentum across the portfolio. The businesses are executing well, they're delivering on their commitments, and
they're continuing, very importantly, to invest for future growth. Our order rates remain positive, but as we experience
tougher comps in the second half of the year, the organic growth will obviously moderate. The Commercial Aerospace
recovery is clearly underway, and as Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to see exciting new opportunities across the
businesses to seed incremental growth.
We're also pleased with how the mid- to late-cycle businesses are firming up, with the growth in UOP and ACS
Solutions accelerating into the second half of the year. All in, it's shaping up to be a great year with every segment
contributing to top and bottom line. And as a reminder, the third consecutive guidance increase that we've made for the

year.
So in closing, just another backdrop to a positive quarter and outlook, we've just finished our strategic planning reviews
with each of our businesses. We came energized about the outlook for 2012 and beyond. We saw evidence of sharp
execution, the benefits from seed planting, productivity initiatives, tailwinds from the smart redeployment of gains we
think will add to that as we redeploy smartly the CPG sale proceeds. And we're encouraged by the quality of the
acquisitions that we've been able to complete and the accretion that those set up for us for 2012 and beyond.
So with that, Elena, let's turn over to you for Q&A.
Elena Doom
Thanks, Dave. Javahn, if you can open the line, we'll take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first on the line, we have Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Dave Anderson, could you give us a little more color on how exactly you're going to deploy
the gain through disc ops? What form of restructuring and other actions you're going to take? And how we should think
about payback on that as we look into 2012 especially?
<A - David J. Anderson>: Yes. Well, Jeff, we're still – one of the benefits obviously of the timing of the close is we've
got – have the opportunity for continued refinement in terms of the redeployment of the gain. And I think now that it's
kind of pure black-and-white so to speak, we're going to see the businesses, I think, really step up. We've had a lot of
good proposals and a lot of good suggestions in terms of repositioning suggestions, but I would submit, Dave, that
we're going to see a lot of continued recommendations in terms of opportunities to smartly redeploy the gain. My view
today, as we sit here today, is we're going to see most of this go into repositioning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes.
<A - David J. Anderson>: And, Jeff, I think it's going to be across most of the businesses. I think we'll see
redeployment of the gain across most of the businesses. Importantly, I think some of those actions are going to be a
little bit longer payback, because some of it is just some of the tougher stuff that inevitably, the size of the gain, et
cetera, the all at once nature of it will support. So my guess is that we will see something in the neighborhood of 20%
of that providing incremental benefit to 2012. And on the average, probably payback in the range of about three to four
years, I would think, in terms of what we'd be looking at for this. But definitely we'll see accretion in positive for 2012
as a result of the redeployment of the gain. The other thing to remind you...
<A - David M. Cote>: High IRR.
<A - David J. Anderson>: And high IRR projects. Thank you. And the other thing I think to point out – and by the
way, Dave makes a very good point, because the difference between book where we'll be writing off facilities,
potentially, and other things that have longer payback, and when you really look at the cash IRRs, Dave makes a very
good point in terms of high IRRs. The other thing I think to keep in mind is we've also got the tailwind of other
repositioning that we've done. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of total year-to-date, it's about $51 million, most of that
covered by gain. That'll also benefit 2012 and 2013.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: What is the – thank you for that. What is the prospect of additional OE payments? And I didn't
quite understand the comment that that's giving you more bandwidth, so to speak, to ramp-up the R&D? Could you
explain that?

<A - David J. Anderson>: Sure. Well, the way we look at it is this. Number one, the launch OE payments are really a
byproduct, as you know, of the significant platform wins that we've experienced, particularly in Business Aviation, and
we expense those as milestones are incurred. We do not capitalize those.
<A - David M. Cote>: Unlike most of our peers.
<A - David J. Anderson>: Unlike most of our peers. Right, good finish to that sentence. During the quarter, we
booked significant incremental launch contributions, Jeff, on a year-over-year basis. It represents about $36 million of
increased launch contribution, which translates to about a 110-basis-point impact for the quarter.
Now, importantly, what we were able to do is to reschedule certain milestones with our OEs to be able to recognize
those launch contributions in the quarter, which otherwise would have been, about $70 million or so of that would have
been 2012 expense.
From our perspective, what that does, it simply creates more on a same-earnings basis for 2012 for Aerospace. It just
creates more capacity for R&D spend against growth platforms. And given the very robust nature now of the
commercial OE cycle, and what we're seeing in terms of opportunity, but what we have in, if you will, portfolio today
as well as opportunity going forward, strategically this is a smart thing to do. So importantly, we wanted to just point
that out to you as well. And again, a smart redeployment of some of the positive below-the-line items that we're able to
manage to achieve in the quarter.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And just one last little, just kind of stylistic question. I think obviously people this morning are
kind of struggling with getting their head around the gain being in disc ops, and the cost and redeployment being in
continuing. The math is there; I think the dust has settled. But just stylistically was there any reason to put this in this in
disc ops? Why couldn't CPG have just stayed in operations until it was actually out the door?
<A - David J. Anderson>: Our controller forced us to do it.
<A - David M. Cote>: It's just the way the accounting works, Jeff. Believe me, we asked the same common-sense
questions that you are asking, but common sense doesn't prevail here, accounting rules do.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: All right. I'll pass the baton. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Good morning.
<A - David J. Anderson>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Hey. So thanks for the clarification on the CPG. That was a little confusing. Now I get it.
On the margin side, if you could dive a little bit further into the pricing experience in ACS, for example, versus the
material inflation? Maybe break that out, give us a little color there, that would be helpful, as you think about how that
is progressing going forward and pricing pressure overall across your businesses. Is it accelerating or decelerating?
<A - David M. Cote>: Pricing's doing well across all our businesses. We've had a constant focus on it for 10 years
now, and it really pays to just keep doing that. So we don't see pricing pressure affecting us all that much. And when it
comes to raw materials, priced in the other direction, that's something that we'd be anticipating. We're not seeing
anything that we didn't anticipate. I would say to Dave's point, one of the nice things we have seen is supply-demand
imbalance with Specialty Materials, which has helped us in a couple of product lines, when it comes to pricing, demand
exceeding supply. But I would say we're not seeing anything negatively [ph] untoward (42:55) in here. Dave, anything?
<A - David J. Anderson>: No, not at all. Elena, you've got some color, I think, on the...

<A - Elena Doom>: [ph] Frasius (43:03), sure. Steve, for [ph] Frasius (43:05) I think they saw roughly 100 basis points
of improvement on, you know, net price over raw spread. And when you net that against obviously their labor inflation,
they roughly offset.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. All right. So, and overall, because you talked about, I think, the equivalent is 210
basis points of volume mix and productivity versus the 280 headwind, so -- in Aero also. So on the Aero side, what
productivity numbers are you putting up there in terms of how much of the benefit's productivity?
<A - David J. Anderson>: Very good, [ph] correct. (43:37) I think productivity really offset inflation in Aerospace in
the quarter.
<A - Elena Doom>: Yes, and higher R&D investments as well.
<A - David J. Anderson>: Yes.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And you're expecting that to continue going forward in the back half of the year?
<A - David J. Anderson>: Yes.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Yeah. Okay.
<A - David J. Anderson>: Now, it could...
<A - Elena Doom>: In conjunction with favorable mix, Steve, from obviously the growth that's coming out of the
commercial aftermarket.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And just looking at the ACS Products versus Solutions mix in the back half of the
year, with Solutions growth picking up pretty significantly on that slide you've got, is the mix impact, how negative is
that, are you anticipating?
<A - Elena Doom>: About 50 basis points, maybe, in terms of the overall ACS margin in the second half of the year,
but it's not significant.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And then the last...
<A - David J. Anderson>: And you'll have some headwind obviously as we pointed out from the EMS acquisition in
the second half. But we'll see – I think we'll see, Steve, as I mentioned earlier, we'll see attractive margin rates and we'll
see attractive conversion, particularly as we progress through the remaining six months for ACS.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And just last question, you mentioned – you commented on residential construction seeing
some recovery in that, which is certainly a mixed bag from what we've heard elsewhere and other competitors, and still
being a soft market. Could you maybe clarify where you're seeing some kind of positive signs there?
<A - Elena Doom>: Yes, first, Steve, I think it's really specific not so much to the end market, because you're right the
data would suggest that it's in fits and starts. But where we are seeing obviously benefits in residential are more on the
retrofit side, obviously within ECC, HVAC, and also in our security products where we have a lot of new products, and
they're just executing well. And that seemed to come through more in the month of June.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: So is it replacement of control systems and things like that for energy prices?
<A - Elena Doom>: That's right.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay.
<A - Elena Doom>: That's right.
<A - David M. Cote>: Retrofits.
<A - Elena Doom>: Plus, when you add on the sort of lifestyle management aspect of the offerings.

Our next question comes from John Inch with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Hi. Let's start with Specialty Materials. How much did favorable spreads kind of on a
year-over-year basis benefit that business versus last year? And maybe you could just – if you could just maybe
identify the trajectory? Because I believe you benefited from favorable raw purchasing last year, if I'm not mistaken.
Just how does that play into kind of the first half versus second half?
<A - David J. Anderson>: Maybe if I could just introduce, just talk about that a little bit. What we saw is a number of
positives, John, including very importantly favorable pricing to your point. But we saw customers restocking inventory
in fluorines. We saw Asian customers converting to HSVs, think of that as 410A, soon rather than later. And also we
benefited because there was, on the supply side, still some bottleneck production, which created market tightness.
So all of those created kind of a terrific window for us in terms of positive in fluorines. We also saw very strong
demand, as I mentioned in my comments, for caprolactam, particularly Asian demand for caprolactam and of course,
again, we're the global low-cost producer there. So we saw a very good set of market conditions. We will continue to
see pretty good end markets, and interestingly enough, when you look at the acquisition-adjusted growth rate for
Advanced Materials in the second half, it's about the same as the first half of 2011.
But importantly, it's more volume driven in the second half, more price driven in the first half, because what we're
seeing now is evidence of more normalization, as I said to you, in terms of the supply-demand rebalance. We're seeing
more of the Asian production now on the fluorine side come online. So we'll still see very good end markets, we
believe, John, but it's going to shift in terms of the volume versus price contribution to that growth. As a result, we
won't see the same level of margins in the second half that we saw in the first half. That's the basic story.
<A - Elena Doom>: Let me try to put some of that in perspective on the numbers. So we actually saw, for example, in
fluorine products, prices peak in the April to May timeframe, and they've actually fallen off about 10% over the last
two months. So in terms of the numbers, in the first half Specialty Materials probably saw close to 500 basis points of
margin lift from positive price over raw spread. And that's going to moderate down to maybe 100 basis points in the
second half.
<A - David J. Anderson>: Right, right.
<Q - John G. Inch>: But you also saw very favorable raw buying, did you not? Or experience favorable raw buying
that also dissipates? Is that part of this sort of downshift in margins?
<A - David J. Anderson>: That's right, John. What we had was, you'll recall, smartly we pre-bought one of the
ingredients that's now in the fluorine side in the second half of 2010. That benefited us in the first half of 2011. That's
now pretty much worked its way through the system, so we won't have that benefit as well. So a variety of positives
that really led to very, very strong first-half margin performance, particularly in the Advanced Materials, a piece of SM.
We see good end-market conditions but less favorable supply-demand conditions, which will translate as I said to just
lower margin rates in the second half. To the upside.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yes. Dave, what kind of acceleration are you expecting at UOP in the back half? And does that
also sort of translate in terms of the volume contribution benefit to the margins there?
<A - David J. Anderson>: It does. We had about between 12% and 13% growth in the first half. We're going to see
much stronger...

<A - Elena Doom>: 20% to 25% in the second half.
<A - David J. Anderson>: 20% to 25% in the second half, John. So we'll see. As always, mix is a factor that will
influence that. We are seeing favorability in terms of catalysts, particularly catalyst reloads. So we're expecting a good
second half out of UOP. Now as I stated, as we put on the full-year guidance slide, on sort of the puts and takes, one of
the considerations would obviously be and always is, UOP timing. Will it be as robust? Potentially not. On the other
hand, we clearly have we think net upside, particularly on the SM Advanced Materials side and probably the Aero
Aftermarket. But UOP is very well positioned. We've got now a very strong book-to-bill. I think book-to-bill is at 1.3
now in UOP. So it's good numbers, and that's going to translate into a strong second half of '11 and strong 2012.
<Q - John G. Inch>: And do you think – I was going to say, that carries through to '12. And just to be clear, some
people may be thinking this is a function of the Petrobras win. That's probably not true. Is that accurate? It's broader
based than that?
<A - David J. Anderson>: It is broader based. Yes.
<A - Elena Doom>: Petrobras this year, John, think about that adding about half of the growth, so half of the, call it,
18% to 20% that we're expecting for the year is coming from the Petrobras contract.
<A - David J. Anderson>: And by the way, that book-to-bill, John, it's 1.0 at this stage. So it's built up to now 1.0 for
UOP.
<Q - John G. Inch>: I'm sorry, what was the 1.3? That was just a misstatement?
<A - David J. Anderson>: That was an error. 1.0.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. And then, just was curious on your European businesses. Some companies have talked
about Europe, I'm presuming, because of the impact of some of these non-northern, Nordic countries slowing things a
bit. I mean, are you – kind of what are you guys seeing overall? I know you'd never planned, necessarily, for Europe to
be all that great. I'm just curious, are you seeing business sort of decelerate at the margin? And all else equal, I mean,
would the focus of some of this restructuring be in Europe just because, obviously, the trajectory there could be a lot
slower over time than it has been?
<A - David M. Cote>: Actually, our businesses have been growing pretty well in Europe and better than we had
expected. I would say the dichotomy you could point to is that northern Europe tends to be much stronger for us than
southern Europe. And when it comes to restructuring possibilities, we'll be looking at that across the world, so it's
probably too early to say where we might do something or not at this point.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. Just lastly, where was Defense better and is that sustainable? Or are you still thinking the
down numbers kind of come back in the second half?
<A - Elena Doom>: John, you're referencing -- Defense & Space was up 1% in the quarter.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yes.
<A - Elena Doom>: We are still forecasting a low single-digit decline in Defense for the year, and the strength really
came from the international affairs business.
<A - David M. Cote>: That's another one, John, where I'd say we've done better than we expected, but we think the
smart way to plan for Defense is to assume that it's going to decline. It's just everything that's going on with the debt,
deficit, it's hard to imagine it doesn't get affected somehow.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. But just so I'm clear, the international affairs, that was – why is that better? I mean, I guess
the question is – I mean, I realize what you've sort of described in the outlook, but obviously Defense faces longer-term
structural headwinds. I'm talking the industry, not necessarily Honeywell. So is this kind of a short-term benefit to still
what's a long-term kind of slow bleed? Or do you think there's some other opportunities here that maybe cause you're
thinking to change a little bit?

<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say you were correct in what you were saying in terms of how we're looking at the year.
However, I think internationally, there is going to be something more for us there as we've said in the past, just
because, quite honestly, we didn't pay that much attention to it. Now that we are, it's surprising the opportunities that
we're uncovering for ourselves. You could argue we should have grabbed it years ago, but we didn't. It's certainly
coming at a good time now, though, when we're looking at how do we offset the anticipated U.S. Defense declines.

Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - David J. Anderson>: Hey, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: So just to clarify, so on the $80 million, that hits the same in the revenue and the profit
line right? For the launch costs?
<A - David J. Anderson>: Yes.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. So I mean, that's a pretty big number, $80 million, I mean, what was the number
for all of 2011?
<A - Elena Doom>: It's about $100 million and – in terms of 2011, Shannon?
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: I'm sorry, 2010. What was it last year?
<A - Elena Doom>: Yes, I think it was about $110 million.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Right. So what happens to launch costs in the second half given that that was such an
unusually large number in 2Q?
<A - David J. Anderson>: Well, it's going to be a lot lower, obviously. I mean, I think the full-year number we're
looking at, Elena, is probably in the $100 million to $110 million range again, for this year.
<A - Elena Doom>: That's right.
<A - David J. Anderson>: So it's going to be a lot lower in the second half, and importantly, Shannon, as we talked
about earlier, it not completely, but significantly clears the decks then for 2012. So we think that's a very smart thing to
have done. The geography is a little bit complicated, as you point out, because it is a net deduction, reduction in both
revenue and operating income segment profit for Aero in the quarter. But I think people see through that. They
understand the purpose and the benefit of doing it. And the fact that we've been able to offset it in the quarter.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: How should we think about, I mean, incrementals, I guess? And what's your new sort of
Aerospace target for the year? What are you thinking for the back half, because we've had this big item? You're talking
about some offsets from R&D, but ex the business jet launch costs, your Aero margin would've been like 18.4%.
Obviously, you don't have no launch costs in the coming quarters, but that's a big number to offset with R&D. So I
mean, do you expect – what's a range of margins you're now expecting for Aerospace as we look from here?
<A - Elena Doom>: The range, it's roughly about 17.5% at the midpoint for the margin rate for the year, Shannon. And
the way I would think about the conversion, obviously the second half would be higher than the conversion rate we saw
in the first half. I think on an adjusted – and so if I adjusted for the Aero launch contributions in the quarter, it would
have done about 22% from an incremental sales conversion rate in the second quarter. So, it will get better in the
second half and we're on path to that 17.5% for the year.

<A - David J. Anderson>: Yeah, think of the first half segment margin as around 17.2% on adjusted basis for
Aerospace versus the 16.7% reported. So obviously, to Elena's point, we've got lifts in Aerospace segment margin in
the second half into the 18.2%, 18.3% kind of range to be expected, arriving at that 17.5% for the full year.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. That helps a lot. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. I have two, and I'll try to keep it there. One, Dave, every time I turn around I
seem to be seeing biofuels on every commercial aircraft, and more and more places, especially in Europe. What are you
doing in terms of – I know you've been at the forefront of this, but it is a big deal and it looks like it's becoming bigger,
faster?
<A - David M. Cote>: I think it's a brilliant idea, and it's one where, unlike the biodiesel that everybody always talks
about, biodiesel is very corrosive to engines, pipelines, dispensing devices. So it'll – you can't blend it to more than
10% or 15% with petrol fuel. The stuff we have is also made from second-generation feedstock like camelina, jatropha,
algae and can be used as a drop-in replacement in cars, trucks, ships, that kind of thing. When it comes to aviation, it
has to be blended to 50-50 because of the aromatics that you need from the petroleum products. But at the end of the
day, our stuff's been used extensively, and we've even flown jet fighters at supersonic speed, as you know. So the stuff
works.
I think it's something that I always thought was going to proceed pretty slowly, just because there's infrastructure
required when it comes to how do you gather up the plants to be able to generate the oil. The process works great, but
you still got to be able to get the oil. That being said, it's accelerating a lot faster than I expected, largely because of pull
from the aviation industry as they start worrying about carbon footprint, and how do they reduce emissions, and all that
kind of thing. So we're not counting on it for a lot and we haven't, because when you have a new technology like this,
sometimes it can be slower to adapt than you might expect. But I'd say the way everybody's starting to pull on it now is
quite encouraging.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: No, that's fine, I appreciate that. And then second, I think in the release, you talked about
organic growth being good, and then I thought about the fact that you talked about you just finished sort of your
strategic planning. Could you share with us a little bit of what kind of marching orders you gave to your businesses in
terms of the organic growth targets you'd like to see out of them for the next 12 to 18 months?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, this is going to sound kind of boring to you, Howard, because it's going to be pretty
consistent with what I always say. I think when it comes to, can you really forecast on out within 2 or 3 percentage
points what your growth, organic growth is actually going to be, is an exercise in futility because you just really don't
know. The thing you want to do is make sure that you've set up all the dynamics so that you will take full advantage of
whatever markets do occur, and that you can gain share in those markets.
Interestingly, you've have heard me say a lot, consistent strategy, execute day-by-day, quarter-by-quarter, and that's
pretty much what the message was to everybody in our strategic planning discussions. The plans they have make a lot
of sense. They are, we'll say, 90% consistent with what they said the year before and the year before that. There's
always some tweaking you do. But largely, the message to all of them was just keep doing what you're doing, and do
what you said in this plan, and things will be great.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you.
<A - Elena Doom>: Javahn, we have time for just one more question.

Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Thanks. Good morning. I have a question on the ACS lower margin guidance. How does
that split-up between the acquisition impact and maybe higher growth investment that you've ramped into the system?
<A - David J. Anderson>: And, Chris, are you talking now about the full-year guidance in terms of the segment
margin guidance for ACS?
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Yes, I am.
<A - David J. Anderson>: Yes. So we're looking, Elena, I guess somewhere in the 13.3% to 13.4% range, for ACS?
<A - Elena Doom>: Yes, that's right, with margins up about 50 basis points year-over-year.
<A - David J. Anderson>: And the EMS acquisition impact?
<A - Elena Doom>: It's probably in the 40-basis-point to 50-basis-point range. And obviously, in terms of the growth
investments, those, because they're weighted more to the first half, they affect the first half more, Chris, than they will
in the second half. So you'll see, again, conversion in ACS dramatically improving in the fourth quarter once we've
lapped both the Sperian closing dates from September of 2010 as well as those growth investments that were made late
last year.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Okay. And then the licensing revenues at Specialty Materials, I believe it's straight
drop-through. And just wondering how recurring that is, and if there's really an expanded run rate of that business
there?
<A - David J. Anderson>: Well, it's a lumpy business when you look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Annually it
tends to operate pretty close to what we guide and what we plan. The long-term trajectory is very positive, because
what we have is continued growth outlook in terms of major projects. And, Chris, obviously, is a very significant
player in the global refining and petrochemical industries. We're going to win a meaningful rate of the both projects
and catalysts for those new projects. But I think you just have to look at UOP as a growth business, and as we said,
about 13% during the first half, probably 20% plus in the second half.
So I think that just underscores, in that 1.0 book-to-bill that I referenced, it really underscores the long-term growth
rate. There's going to be a distribution between licensing projects and products, other products, catalyst equipment in
terms of the mix. But all of that portends very positive. It's basically structural and market forces portend strong growth
outlook for UOP.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Okay. Thanks, Dave, Elena.
<A - David J. Anderson>: Thanks.
<A - Elena Doom>: Thanks, Chris.

All right, I'd like to hand the call over to Dave Cote for any closing comments.
David M. Cote
Well, we're very happy about the results for the quarter and what we can do for the year. And we're going to continue to
deploy those gains smartly to make the businesses even better going forward, as we have historically. As I was saying
to Howard earlier, our consistent strategy constantly deployed day-by-day, quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year, it does

continue to propel us to just great places.
We'll continue to do the seed planting in new products and services, geographic expansion, process initiatives, and
restructuring that continues to build just a great future. We are wrapping up our strategic planning process now, and
we're excited about where all that seed planting is taking us. So thank you for listening today, and we hope you enjoyed
the quarter's results, and have a good summer. Thanks.
