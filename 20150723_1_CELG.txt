Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Patrick. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.
Having shared our preliminary results with you last week, we appreciate the opportunity to more fully discuss our
second quarter accomplishments this morning. Across the board, the results were outstanding. Our teams around the
world delivered exceptional near-term performance and advanced strategic initiatives, significantly enhancing our
medium and long-term growth potential. Peter, Jackie, Scott, and Mark will review the numerous accomplishments of
the first half of the year and how they position us to meet or exceed our objectives for the remainder of 2015.
Strong revenue and earnings growth reflect the positive operating momentum in our businesses across franchises and
geographies. Accordingly, we have raised our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.75 to $4.85,
up from our earlier target of $4.60 to $4.75. This updated guidance includes the dilutive impact of all of our business
development activities this year.
We've also made excellent progress advancing the potential of our portfolio. In the first half of the year, we achieved
six approvals in major markets for our key products. We're only beginning to see the returns from these regulatory
actions.
We do not often have the opportunity to highlight the progress of our early-stage pipeline. But thanks to the work of
our research teams and collaboration partners, we've already filed four new INDs and progressed five new candidates
into the clinic this year. Over the next 12 to 15 months, together with our partners, we expect to file at least five
additional INDs, continuing to add to our deep and diverse pipeline.
During the quarter we identified several opportunities that can materially enhance and diversify our long-term growth
drivers well beyond 2020. Our transactions with AstraZeneca and Juno broadened our immuno-oncology pipeline by
leveraging the strength of our hematology and oncology franchise.
The Receptos acquisition, targeted to close in the third quarter following Hart-Scott-Rodino review, is aligned with our
strategic imperative of building a leading immunology and inflammation franchise. Ozanimod is a key addition to our
portfolio of innovative and disruptive oral therapies targeting sizable and evolving immune-inflammatory markets. We
look forward to welcoming the Receptos employees, who have done an outstanding job advancing their programs, to
the Celgene team once the transaction closes.
It's a very exciting time at Celgene, and we remain committed to achieving our full potential.
Let me now turn the call over to Peter.

Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone.
We are pleased to report exceptional results across our portfolio in both the second quarter and the first half of 2015.
Our business grew strongly. The pipeline has progressed well. And with eight new approvals over the last 12 months,
our outlook continues to improve.
While delivering exceptional operational results, as Bob discussed, our team has been determined to build an
increasingly strong future by investing in innovative and disruptive technologies that contribute to growth in 2020 and
the next decade. To that end, we increased our top line and bottom line 2020 targets to greater than $21 billion and
$13.00 per share respectively.
These strategic investments have additionally been paired with an ongoing focus on shareholder returns. Our execution
of the Celgene capital allocation strategy continues to return near-term value to our shareholders in addition to the
important strategic investments. Through midyear, we have repurchased over $2 billion of Celgene shares.
Now turning to our second quarter results, total net product sales grew 22% to approximately $2.25 billion. The growth
was driven by strong performances by REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID. ABRAXANE continues to grow
nicely in pancreatic cancer, and OTEZLA's launch remains on track, achieving the desired pre-biologic position, strong
adoption, and is well positioned for future success. Once again, volume drove our revenue growth. The 21.7 percentage
points of the volume growth accounted for vast majority of our 22.2% top line performance. Modest price gains were
largely offset by a negative 2% ForEx impact of approximately $38 million.
REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID posted strong year-over-year increases. These products are performing quite
well in the marketplace, and Jackie will talk more later about the market dynamics. ABRAXANE continues to grow,
especially outside the U.S., where we are now seeing the impact of the September 2013 pancreatic cancer approval in
Europe. OTEZLA had nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter growth. The drug is still in the early phase of its European
global launch. Scott will provide additional color on the underlying product dynamics.
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.23, a 37% increase over prior year, and this result includes a $0.06
equity gain due to the acquisition of Flexus Biosciences by Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Looking at the P&L line items for Q2, year over year the adjusted operating margin improved 100 basis points to
51.3%. While there was some natural leverage from our outstanding top line performance, you can see the effects of
our quarter-over-quarter launch investments in SG&A. And we stepped up our OTEZLA DTC launch campaign and
continued building our commercial I&I EU organization for future launches.
Earlier this year, we indicated that we expected the pace of R&D spend to increase as our pipeline and clinical trial
activity grew. We continue to invest strongly in R&D. And through the first half of 2015, we have invested almost $1
billion.
Operating income was our major driver of bottom line results, accounting for $0.23 per share of the year-over-year
increase in adjusted EPS. And we ended the quarter with nearly $7.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, roughly
in line with our balance at the beginning of the year.
As I mentioned, during the first half of 2015 we have purchased over $2 billion in shares. We have reauthorized an
additional $4 billion for share repurchases, leaving us with an ongoing authorization level of $5.1 billion. So while the
Celgene team has made significant investments in innovative and disruptive technologies in the first half of 2015, we
have also continued our philosophy of returning excess capital to shareholders through our strong share repurchase
program.
In completing our financial picture, we assess return on invested capital both with and without cash in the capital base.
Through Q2, our ROIC performance continues to be outstanding.
So in summary, our financial and operating results in Q2 and the first half of 2015 certainly established strong
momentum for the second half of the year. We are well on track to achieve our net product sales guidance of $9 billion
to $9.5 billion. And absorbing the dilutive impacts of our strategic deals, we have actually raised our adjusted EPS

guidance to $4.75 to $4.85.
It was indeed a very active first half. Celgene announced important investments across our portfolio with AstraZeneca,
Quanticel, Agios, and more recently with Lycera, Juno, and Receptos. Accordingly, we feel it has been a very strong
first half strategically as well, and we are excited to be driving the company towards its very bright future.
Thank you. Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone.
The Hematology/Oncology team delivered outstanding results in Q2 and continues to build on the strong momentum
created in Q1. Our growth is accelerating, and our first half results put us in a great position to deliver on our targets for
the full year.
Our commercial and market access teams around the world are executing extremely well, and our launches are meeting
or exceeding our expectations. Our clinical, medical, project leadership, and regulatory teams are also hitting their
milestones and setting us up to be able to continue to generate strong growth for a long time to come.
In addition, as Bob and Peter mentioned, we invested further for the future during Q2, in particular with our
AstraZeneca-MedImmune durvalumab partnership and our collaboration with Juno. The clinical development plan for
durvalumab has been approved by the collaboration's joint development committee, and we will initiate the first trials
under the program by year end.
REVLIMID's growth accelerated significantly in Q2, and quarterly revenue surpassed $1.44 billion.
Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, REVLIMID's year-over-year growth in Q2 was 21% and was
mainly volume driven, as the favorable impact of U.S. price increases is largely being offset by price declines in
Europe.
Our newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma launch dynamics are very strong in both the U.S. and Europe, as our country
teams execute on a well formulated global launch plan developed by our global marketing team. In the U.S., we hit
all-time highs with both total Rx's and new Rx's in Q2. In Germany, our launch metrics are strong, and in Europe we
expect to have all top five country reimbursement approvals by around Q1 of next year. Market shares are strong across
all geographies, as are duration trends.
We continue to further REVLIMID's geographic expansion. We have finalized federal reimbursement in Russia and
made important progress towards regulatory approval and reimbursement in both Brazil and Mexico.
During Q2, data was presented at ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] that added further support for
REVLIMID's position as the backbone in the emerging myeloma triplet regimens. The details of the FLASH analysis
presented at ASCO, EHA [European Hematology Association], and ICML [International Conference on Malignant
Lymphoma] support durable complete response as a surrogate endpoint for PFS in follicular lymphoma, where our
RELEVANCE trial is fully enrolled and should read out on 30-month durable CR in the first half of 2017. Other data
presented at these congresses further enhanced Celgene's strong positions across hematology, and we are now looking
forward to a successful international myeloma workshop meeting in September.
POMALYST/IMNOVID's growth is excellent in the markets where we have launched, and the product grew 18%
sequentially and 46% year over year. Advancing the product's geographic expansion, we achieved reimbursement
approval in Japan during Q2 and began launching there in June. Both share and duration metrics are positive across our
major geographies. And we still have important EU and other country reimbursement approvals ahead of us, approvals
that will fuel the product's growth for a long time to come.

On the regulatory front, POMALYST's U.S. label was updated for overall survival during the quarter and our U.S.
approval made final. We are in the early days of the label update, but initial market reaction to that update is positive.
On the clinical front, trials studying pomalidomide [pom] in several combinations regimens are enrolling. We saw early
interesting data presented at ASCO for pom/dex [dexamethasone] in combination with cyclophosphamide, and we
expect to continue to see pomalidomide triplet data emerge and evolve.
ABRAXANE posted strong 9% sequential growth and 13% year-over-year growth, driven primarily by the ongoing
launch of pancreatic cancer across Europe. We have also launched ABRAXANE in non-small-cell lung cancer in the
early access markets in Europe. We expect solid future growth in Europe for ABRAXANE, as we continue to achieve
reimbursement for the pancreatic indication and as the launch of non-small-cell lung cancer ramps up. ABRAXANE is
also now approved for pancreatic cancer in Japan, and our partner Taiho is launching that indication there.
Multiple trials are ongoing studying ABRAXANE across a variety of indications in immunotherapy combination
regimens, and some of these programs were highlighted at ASCO. We continue to be excited about ABRAXANE's
future prospects in this space. In addition, we expect data from our internal trials to start to read out beginning next
year, with breast and lung data coming first and adjuvant pancreatic later.
In summary, my Hematology/Oncology franchise colleagues around the world produced outstanding results yet again
in Q2 across all of our teams. Our near-term execution is excellent and our long-term strategy is robust and designed to
produce strong growth for many years to come as we invest for the future. In addition to our very positive operating
momentum, we will also see a steady stream of new clinical data across our products and indications starting in 2016,
and we look forward to sharing that data with you.
Thank you, and I will now hand over to Scott.
Scott Andrew Smith
Thank you, Jackie.
Q2 was a great quarter for Celgene I&I. During the quarter, we saw significant acceleration of prescriptions and
revenues for OTEZLA in the U.S. and strong initial uptake in the early launch countries internationally. We also made
progress on indication expansion for OTEZLA, advancing a global Phase III program in Behçet's disease and Phase II
studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. Additionally, we made significant investments in our next-generation
growth drivers by initiating the early stages of the pivotal program for GED-0301 in Crohn's disease, and last week we
announced a potentially transformational agreement with Receptos.
Now turning to OTEZLA, we are seeing a substantive uptick in revenues and demand in the U.S. Total prescriptions far
outpaced the recent launch analogues in the I&I space and currently measure over 4,500 TRx's per week based on the
latest data. Revenues for the quarter grew to $90 million worldwide, and we are tracking well in line with internal
plans.
We are very encouraged at the progress we are seeing outside of the U.S. both in Canada and in early launch countries
in the EU. After only five months, we are outpacing all recent launches in Germany. It's still very early in the launch,
but this initial success helps reinforce the global value proposition of OTEZLA and the need for novel approaches to
the treatment of I&I disease.
The trends in the U.S. are supported by positive launch metrics. While the PSA launch continues to make strong and
steady progress, the launch of the psoriasis indication has fueled much of the recent acceleration. Access to new
therapies is a critical component of success in this market, and it's important to note that over 70% of OTEZLA
prescriptions in pre-biologic patients are being approved on first pass.
Total U.S. patient share for OTEZLA in psoriasis surpassed STELARA some months ago and passed ENBREL overall
patient share in June. The source of business in psoriasis continues to be heavily weighted towards the pre-biologic
sector, with 75% of patients coming to OTEZLA from topical therapy or no therapy at all over the past 12 months.

We are very pleased with this early OTEZLA launch success and we are focused on continuing execution in the U.S.
and around the world. At the same time, we're working to build a strong and diversified portfolio.
Anchored by early OTEZLA success, we expect to see a series of blockbuster launches beginning in 2018, with
ozanimod in multiple sclerosis, quickly followed by GED-0301 in Crohn's disease and ozanimod in UC. These
launches have the potential to transform the treatment of these serious and difficult to treat diseases as well as setting
the foundation for significant revenue growth in 2020 and beyond. We are strongly focused on executing on all aspects
of the GED-0301 development plan. The endoscopy study, CD-001, is actively enrolling and should fully enroll this
summer. The large pivotal treat-through program will initiate in Q3, and we are working towards initiating a Phase II
study with GED-0301 in UC by the end of the year.
Earlier this week, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for treatment of pediatric Crohn's and look to
initiate that study later this year or in early 2016. This is a large and diverse late-stage development program, and we
are very, very excited about the potential of GED-0301 across a variety of patient types.
As stated earlier, Q2 was a quarter full of advancements in Celgene I&I. The balance of the year should also be full of
major milestones and accomplishments. We are focused on continuing to accelerate the strong U.S. OTEZLA launch,
including expanding our DTC program and on the successful launch of OTEZLA in key geographies outside of the
U.S.
Advancing the pipeline is also critical in 2015, and led by the development of GED-0301 in IBD. Additionally, we plan
on moving other key clinical programs such as CC-220 and sotatercept forward through important milestones. We are
also very excited about the announced transaction with Receptos. Upon completion of the merger, we look forward to
working with the talented people of Receptos to accelerate the development of ozanimod.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Alles
Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to provide additional perspective on our
performance before opening the call for your questions.
We started this year with excellent operating momentum and clarity on the significant opportunities for our products
and our company. We established ambitious goals and set high expectations. Clearly, our second quarter results
demonstrate that our teams are executing well and that we are achieving the milestones and adding important new
drivers to accelerate growth now and well into the future.
In hematology, our multiple myeloma portfolio continues to define the standards of care for all segments of this
incurable blood cancer. While still early into the global launch of REVLIMID for newly-diagnosed myeloma, we are
encouraged by key indicators of success in the United States and in Europe. The recent addition of overall survival data
to the POMALYST approved product labeling in the United States adds an immediate and important commercial
advantage.
Pivotal clinical trials testing REVLIMID and diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphoma continue to advance. Our
strategy to establish durable complete response as a key clinical and perhaps regulatory endpoint in follicular
lymphoma was significantly strengthened by the FLASH meta-analysis presented during ASCO. Optimizing the
potential of REVLIMID in lymphoma is one of our most important corporate objectives.
In collaboration with our partners Agios and Acceleron, we continue to advance the development of high-potential and
unique agents, with pivotal trials planned for the treatment of subsets of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, beta
thalassemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes. With the International Myeloma Working Group meeting set for
September and our plans for ASH in December, we expect our hematology franchise to continue to gain momentum.

Since the formation of our Immuno-Oncology Research Center of Excellence just 12 months ago, we have rapidly and
strategically evolved and are shaping the future direction of the field's renewed partnerships focused on T-cell
checkpoint inhibitors and engineered T-cells and other unique platforms seeking to direct or activate the immune
system to fight cancer. Our significant progress in this relatively short amount of time makes us optimistic about our
potential to develop and deliver blockbuster products in this increasingly important approach to the treatment of cancer.
Our I&I franchise made outstanding progress during the second quarter. OTEZLA is gaining strong momentum in the
U.S. The marketing approval for OTEZLA in Europe coupled with positive results of the PSOR-011 study to support
registration in Japan firmly established geographic expansion as a new growth driver, and key studies supporting new
indications are in development or are ongoing.
Once completed, the acquisition of Receptos adds ozanimod to our cornerstone products OTEZLA and GED-0301 and
vaults us into a leadership position developing and commercializing therapies for dermatologic, rheumatologic, and
inflammatory bowel diseases, with an important opportunity in multiple sclerosis.
We are encouraged and energized by our year-to-date progress and accomplishments. Our teams are committed to
achieving key second half goals and understand the significant promise of our products, pipeline, partnerships, and now
and well beyond 2020. Above all, we are focused on improving our operating performance and on developing and
commercializing therapies with the greatest potential to help patients and their families.
Thank you, operator. Please open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Your line is open.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Jackie, if you don't mind, can you provide
a little bit more clarity on the initial trajectory for REVLIMID launch in first-line myeloma, especially in Germany?
For example, do you expect ultimately you will achieve the same market share like in the United States?
And then secondly, on a high level, can you guys comment? Obviously, you have been very busy on the deal front,
including Astra, Juno, and then the acquisition of Receptos. Does that change your thought on potential settlements on
IP for REVLIMID with Allergan? Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi there, thanks for the question. So yes, we're seeing – it's a little bit early because we
just got the approval in February, but we're off to a really great start in Germany. We've seen rapid gains in share. The
uptake is quite good. So we're very happy with where we are. We think it bodes well for other markets.
In terms of where this share should be able to go, we would see it – there's no reason why it shouldn't go in the same
direction that it's gone in the U.S. But every country is a little bit different, so the rate at which that happens and just the
different product positions in the different markets just gives you a little bit of variability there. But we're extremely
excited about it. All of the feedback we got from EHA is very consistent and positive, and we're quite happy with how
things are going.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: And on the intellectual property front, we really view the prosecution or the defense of our IP
estate completely independent from any other actions, so we really view our strategy as very clear on what we're doing
there and unrelated to any of the business development activities that we've undertaken.

<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask
you a little bit on ABRAXANE. I know you have Phase IIIs in lung and triple-negative with PDL one ongoing, but the
growth drivers from here in the U.S. -- maybe just help us with what we'll see. Are you gaining share, additional share
in pancreatic? Are you expanding the market in your older indications, if you want to call it that, in the case of breast
and lung? Thanks a lot.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Geoff. This is Jackie; thanks for the question. In pancreatic, we have been gaining
share. The share in the impact patient population is right at 50% now. And once you jump up, it's a slower trajectory in
terms of the share gains, but we continue to see nice position there. Lung and breast are quite competitive, so I would
say we're holding our own in that regard. We will see globally, I think, a nice acceleration as we continue to ramp the
launches in Europe for pancreatic and lung. It's still early days with those. We still don't have approval in all major
markets for pancreatic, for example, so we've got France still to go there, and only recent approvals in countries like
Spain. So the trajectory's still well ahead of us for pancreatic in Europe. In the countries where we are launched, we're
doing quite well.
So in terms of the other programs that we have, we are quite excited about what's going on in the immuno-oncology
space. But in addition to all of those trials, some of which are being run by other companies, our own programs are
going to start to read data out beginning in 2016 across the ABOUND program in lung, which is four trials, as you
know. Adjuvant pancreas will be a little bit later in the second half of 2017 in triple-negative breast data from Phase II
tnAcity trial. So we're very excited about the data flow to come.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Okay. Thanks, Jackie.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
<Q - Odysseas D. Kostas>: Oh, hi; this is actually Odysseas Kostas sitting in for Mark this morning. The questions I
have -- one of them has to do with the guidance for full-year EPS that was given. I guess that was last week, the
increase to $4.75 to $4.85 despite the expected dilution from the acquisition of Receptos. I'm wondering if you could
talk us through how you end up getting there.
And then the other question has to do with, again, the acquisition of Receptos and the $4 billion to $6 billion that you
have said about expected sales. Just wondering in terms of what kind of label that $4 billion to $6 billion assumes.
Does that assume that ozanimod does not get a class label? And then also on that $4 billion to $6 billion, maybe help
us: are those probability-adjusted sales numbers? Thank you.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Good morning; this is Peter. Let me take the first question regarding the guidance; then I'll
pass it to Scott for the questions regarding the Receptos transaction. So on the guidance for this year, clearly as you can
see, through the first half of the year we've got great business momentum, and I think we have covered that. You can
see the full P&L. So quite frankly, what has been very nice is that as we anticipate the closing of this transaction and
having the Receptos operation as part of our company, we do include the R&D burn for the stub of the year in the
second half of the year for the important clinical trials that are going on. And as well, we will be taking out debt, as we
talked about, until we've incorporated the interest expense. So those are the two items that will be added to our P&L
from an expense standpoint.
What we have highlighted is that we actually have very good business momentum. We're able to absorb those items
and still deliver the EPS that we originally anticipated, and in fact, if the momentum is so strong, that we're both
absorbing that additional R&D and interest expense and actually increasing the EPS. So it's actually just a reflection of
very, very strong operating performance in many ways thanks to the global Hem/On team, Jackie, really great
performance, and it's a real luxury to be able to do a transaction and raise guidance in the same situation.
For the second question, let me turn it over to Scott regarding the revenue outlook for peak sales.

<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thanks, Peter, and thank you for the question. Our base assumptions around label is that
there would be some class labeling that we had, but there would be an opportunity to have data in the label. We can't be
definitive on what the exact label is going to look like. It's a matter of getting the data and having discussions and
review with the FDA. So we believe that the data, particularly around cardiovascular and hepatotoxicity, looks quite
different than you see for GILENYA is quite differentiated.
Relative to the second part of that question, the $4 billion to $6 billion are non-probability adjusted, but they only
include the two lead indications of multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. Did not include any revenues for other
potential indications, including Crohn's disease, psoriasis, or lupus, specifically SLE.

Thank you. Our next question comes Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Great, thanks very much for taking the question. Nice product volume growth here in the
quarter, and in particular, I wanted to ask about REVLIMID in the U.S. given the better than expected performance.
And Jackie mentioned specifically growth in the new prescriptions as well as the total. I believe that you guys used to
say that with the approval of REVLIMID in the U.S. for newly diagnosed that you could capture an incremental 10 or
15 share points in the U.S. Now that you have a quarter-plus under your belts here, is that 10 to 15 point gain still
looking realistic? And do you think that could even be conservative considering that some other cancer drugs can get
up as high as 70% – 80% penetration. I guess what would be helpful is if you could give us an update on share trends in
the U.S. and, to the extent you can, an update on duration of therapy since that is also a driver of the volumes. Thanks
very much.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Matt, thanks for the questions on REVLIMID. We're extremely pleased with
REVLIMID's performance both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. The early indications in Germany, as we said, are very
strong. So we are gaining share in newly-diagnosed, particularly in that non-stem cell transplant population. We I
would say are holding steady in second-line. That is where we see carfilzomib coming up a little bit, but we've been
very pleased with the Rx trends. And now that we're several weeks into the launch and seeing those record numbers,
we think those reflect share gains as well as duration trends when we look between the new Rx's and the total Rx's. So
duration continues to be positive in terms of the trajectory and now in the U.S. for first exposure is about 16.5 months
or so, so we continue to see steady gains there.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Great, and can you put any parameters around where you think you are in terms of share in
the various segments of front-line?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Remember that in, for example, post-stem cell transplant maintenance, our share has
always been quite strong. It's been over 80% for a long time. We continue to hold there. And we continue to gain in the
front-line, particularly as I said, the non-transplant eligible, and I think we've still got a ways to go in terms of the share
gains there. We like the position that we're in with respect to backbone therapy and the emerging triplet regimens, and
we think that's going to help as well. So, gaining share with more gains still to come, and it's going to be a steady
process, I would say, in the U.S. In Europe, I think we'll see the uptake be pretty steep as we get into the launches in the
different countries across Europe.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Great, thanks very much and congrats.

<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So my question is for Scott, so a couple things.
You mentioned that a lot of patients or many patients for OTEZLA are allowed to take the drug without having to take
a biologic. But what percentage of patients really have no problem, like if they write a script, the doctor is going to fill
out a form to argue that the patient can't take a biologic? What percent of patients have it very easy and what
percentage of patients do you think there's still some hurdle where there's paperwork ahead of getting a script?
And then regarding the European launch, can you give any color on anything you're seeing there as far as trends,
differences versus the U.S. in the launch, those types of things?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thank you, Robyn. It's a little bit difficult to get the exact data from your first question.
But what our feel is, is about 50% of scripts go through without any additional paperwork and other things. And then of
the other 50% that requires some paperwork, a letter of medical necessity or other minor paperwork from the office
goes in with the script and gets filled on first pass. So about 70% of them are getting filled first pass, whether it's
immediately or with a letter to help accentuate and quicken that process. And one of our key goals throughout the
course of this year is to continue to move positively in the access situation for the drug. But so far, we're pleased and
it's in line, but we have some ways to go to continue to make sure the product is made available generally as much as
possible and has the best access positions possible.
Relative to the second part in the EU launch, it's early. I think as Jackie was saying relative to newly diagnosed, the
approval was late in January and the launch was in February. But we're very, very pleased with the launch dynamics.
When you take a look at market share and where the source of business is coming from and some of the early launch
metrics, it looks very, very similar to what you see in the U.S. I think on a per patient basis, Germany actually may be
ahead of those strong trends that we saw in the United States, so we're very pleased there. Other countries coming
online. Some still aren't online with reimbursement and others have just received reimbursement decisions over the past
couple months, so it's too early for me to really project on those. But Germany has had four or five months now of
relatively unrestricted access, so it's very, very positive.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Terrance Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi, thanks for the taking the question, maybe two for me. I was wondering, Peter, if we look
at the SG&A, I think it came in a little bit ahead of what we were expecting. I'm just wondering. Is that the new level
we should expect as we head into 2016?
And then the second question was just maybe for Mark on REVLIMID for lymphoma. I know you guys are highly
focused here, any update on the timing of the two key studies there? Thanks.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Hi, Terence. It's Peter. Let me start off. So for the SG&A, yes, in many ways what we've done
is we've really in the first half of the year really done a lot in terms of the build-out of the I&I franchise, getting ready
for the European launches. We've continued to launch out some of the POMALYST and ABRAXANE markets. So in
some ways, our running rate through the second quarter is what you should think of going forward. SG&A will go up a
bit in Q3 and Q4 as well, but really the growth, the increase is going to slow down. We're going to start getting
leverage now that we've built this infrastructure and so forth as we continue moving forward in 2016. So I think SG&A
will not grow as fast as revenue in future years, and we're going to see some real nice P&L leverage from that, which
will be really helpful to our P&L.
I would just also highlight that we kicked off some DTC in the U.S. for OTEZLA in the second quarter, and that will
continue. And so that also stepped up a little bit the SG&A. So we feel very good about those investments. But clearly,
as we indicated before, we'll start seeing some leverage off of that and we'll keep powering ahead on the R&D line.

<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Terence, it's Jackie. I'm going to take the REVLIMID lymphoma question. So as we
all know, there are five Phase III trials up and running. Two of those are fully enrolled, being REMARK in diffuse
large B-cell and RELEVANCE in follicular lymphoma, and then we have three other ones that are enrolling. The first
data read-out we would expect should be for the REMARK trial late in 2016, sometime in the second half. And then we
would expect the RELEVANCE trial to read out on that 30-month durable CR endpoint in the first half of 2017. And
then we've got the other trials reading out in the second half of 2017 and out into 2018, depending on the trial.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for the question and congratulations on the progress. Peter, I wanted
to follow up on your comments about SG&A and revert to R&D. Could you give us a sense of how much of your R&D
pro forma spend this quarter was for external milestones?
And then secondly, related to that, you've taken on a lot of major obligations for 2016 and 2017 between Receptos,
Juno, the PD-L1, et cetera. So are you confident at this stage that your R&D spend will not grow faster than revenue, or
are you prepared to allow it to grow faster than revenue for a couple of years? And could you lastly give us some sense
of where you think net debt should be after you get through all this activity? Thanks.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Hi, Geoff. Listen, I think that in the second quarter we actually had a lower level of
milestones. This quarter we had a couple small ones, but relative to some quarters in the past, this is probably lower, so
not a big item.
Your point about taking on some of the additional pipeline opportunities with both Receptos and also the
AstraZeneca-MedImmune deal and so forth, you're right. That is an important part of building our future. And so I
don't have a number to guide exactly on R&D as we go into 2016. But you should see, as I mentioned earlier from the
Receptos transaction, we're going to be pushing forward with the trials they've got underway and continuing developing
those drugs, so that will increase R&D.
Likewise, interest expense will go up. We indicated that in the financing of this deal, we would have an incremental
roughly $5 billion of debt, and the rest would be using our own company cash. And on an ongoing basis, obviously, we
continue to maintain an efficient capital structure, which does imply having a certain amount of leverage and a strong
share repurchase program. All of that was taken into account when we indicated on the announcement that we thought
that for 2016, we would have a dilutive impact of about $0.40 per share in 2016, but we'd start working that down to
$0.25 in 2017 and be breakeven in 2018, so we took a very ambitious approach.
One thing I would highlight though, is although we're investing in R&D, and that is so important for our future and it's
so important to have these collaborations and business development deals, our operating margin net-net when you look
through all of this is continuing to increase. We are actually anticipating about 52% in 2015. And if you go forward on
a longer-term view, we see that operating margin continuing to grow really nicely. If you take our 2020 guidance,
really the math would imply that we're going to have our operating margin in the high 50%.
So while we're making the important and necessary investments to create the growth drivers for the next decade, we are
also at the same time really pushing hard to have great productivity in the organization, great operating efficiency, and
to have, over time, it may move around a little bit, but over time we're setting very ambitious goals for having
improved margins and really great strong operating performance throughout the company
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Great, thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask on an update or a little more details on GED-0301. Specifically, the
endoscopy study almost finished enrolling, and then the start of the Phase III efficacy studies. I just wanted to
understand the gating factors to starting the efficacy studies. What's going on there? What are we waiting for in terms
of the endoscopy interim and what you can say there? Should we just be looking for the start of the efficacy studies?
Maybe give a little more color on what's going on with GED-0301. Thanks.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thank you for the question. The endoscopy study, CD-001, is ongoing. It's enrolling right
now. It should be finished enrolling by the end of the summer. It's a 48-week study, so we should be getting results 48
weeks after last enrollment. It's enrolling online. The larger treat-through program will initiate in Q3, this current
quarter. And we're very excited about it. We're involved in study startup right now, getting everything done. It's a big
global complex development plan, multi-center, multi-country. So there's a little time to get it set up, but it's not gated
on anything. It's just we're just going as soon as that's up and ready. And we're very excited to get that going, and that
will be happening this quarter. So we're very, very excited about where the program is and looking forward to moving
it forward.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Okay.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Ian Somaiya>: Thanks, just one question just related to the ozanimod development strategy in RMS and IBD. If
you could, just compare that to Novartis's strategy with siponimod in secondary progressive MS.
Then a couple of questions related to that; one, do you plan to pursue secondary progressive MS? And second, is there
anything to read through from Novartis's decision not to evaluate the drug in relapsing-remitting MS? Does it imply
anything in terms of what generic GILENYA impact might have?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: So relative to the second part of the question, I can't speculate on why a program was
moved forward or not by Novartis and what their particular strategy is relative to MS. We're focused on RMS at this
point in time. Secondary progressive is not an indication that we're going for right now. We'll take a look at it,
understand the fullness of the data. I think the strategy would be to fully execute that Phase III program, large Phase III
program in RMS, take a look at that data, and then figure out if we wanted to get into secondary progressive at that
point in time.
<Q - Ian Somaiya>: And if I could just ask a related question, does obviously potentially having a neurology sales
force, does that open up the company to more corporate development activity in that area now, or would you wait for
the Phase III data before making that decision?
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Yeah. It's Bob. I think we're very happy with the portfolio, where it's headed, and what we
have. I think we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that we're clear what our strategy is with MS, as Scott outlined.
So I don't think you'll see something from us in the near term. We going to evaluate our options, chart our course, and
then execute over the next couple of years

to the U.S. price that we should start to focus on for Europe?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Eric. Thanks for the question. I don't think you can really say that. Every country is
very different in Europe, at least in the hem/onc space. What I would say in terms of our experience so far with the
newly-diagnosed reimbursement approvals -- they are going in line essentially with our expectations, maybe slightly
better. So we had all along expected that we related to the newly-diagnosed approval in Europe would have a little bit
higher average price decline in 2015, particularly than we've seen on average in the past, and we are seeing that. It's
already built into our forecast, and I would say we're coming in where we thought we would.
I would also say if you look back at the situation with ABRAXANE for pancreatic cancer, as an example, we got the
regulatory approval in September of 2013. Even for a high unmet medical need disease, we still have a major market
where we don't have reimbursement approval yet, that being France, and we only recently got it in Spain. So it's not an
easy process. I think I would just reiterate that. We've got great people that have built up a lot of experience over time,
so we're coming out in line with or maybe slightly better than our own expectations for how we would do, but it's quite
a difficult environment.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: It's always a difficult environment, Jackie. I would say our strategy in the I&I space
specifically for OTEZLA is virtually identical to the strategy we have in the United States. That is a modest discount to
average biologic pricing to accentuate utilization in the pre-biologic space. From what I showed earlier, you can see the
majority of our use is for patients coming off topicals or nothing and not coming off biologics. So we believe that
strategy is working in the U.S., and that's exactly our strategy in Europe as well. The differences is there are slightly
different price points between the markets that you see in Europe and in the U.S. But strategically, we will come into
Europe with exactly the same framework, which is a modest discount to biologics.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about
your recently announced collaboration with Juno. After working on CAR-Ts in a pre-clinical setting for the last couple
of years, what was it that you saw in Juno's approach or capabilities that was differentiated and led you to sign this
pretty sizable deal? Thanks.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Thanks, Cory. I think a couple people may have a perspective on it. We've obviously followed
the whole T-cell space for a long time. And being an immunology company for a long time, we've had good
experiences with lots of different people. Here we really did feel that the long-term strategic vision about where this
whole T-cell biology could take us, not just with the CAR-T as it exists today, we thought there was great strategic
research alignment as to what the potential was with the people that we're working with at Juno. We just think the team
itself they have in Seattle, the collaborators they have, the whole infrastructure they are building is really consistent
with our view of what the longer-term potential is here.
And I think the strategic corporate governance vision about what's needed to have mutual success for both companies
was something that was also very aligned here, in what they see as their corporate future, how we see working together,
the two of us together are really going to build a team that is going to do great things. And so the combination more of
the strategic vision, our own view of where the science is heading and that alignment, and that's what led us to looking
to have a very strategic collaboration with them.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great, thanks for taking the question. I have two that I just wanted to ask, so one just
related to Receptos. If you could just talk a little bit about what your thoughts are on indications outside of MS. And the
reason I ask is obviously we've seen a handful of PML cases with GILENYA. And I'm just wondering how you manage
that risk in indications outside of MS and how you think about that with the Receptos molecule.
And then second, maybe just back to ABRAXANE for a second, can you just talk a little bit about – obviously, we seen
the growth slow in the U.S. You're pointing to some studies next year, and then obviously combinations with PD-1,
PD-L1. Can you just talk about the confidence you have in the longer-term guidance that you've given for
ABRAXANE? Thanks.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thank you for the question. Specific to ozanimod and indications, focusing on MS first
and then IBD going forward, et cetera, from a PML risk perspective, what we're seeing from GILENYA when we take
a look at it, a small handful of cases. All those cases, to my understanding, have involved pre-treatment with TYSABRI
and oftentimes with other agents which have shown to generate PMLs. And so there has been no link made between the
F1P mechanism and PML at all. So we don't think there's any problem with indication expansion beyond that.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Matthew; it's Jackie. Thanks for the ABRAXANE question. So yes, we feel very
confident in our guidance for ABRAXANE. Just as a reminder, the 2017 range is $1.5 billion to $2 billion of revenue.
What I would say at the moment is it's a very competitive space, particularly in breast and lung. We're quite happy with
our positions in the U.S., and we continue to grow. It is a daily fight though in the commercial environment, including
working through pathways in the U.S. with payers and things like that. And we're extremely pleased with what we've
achieved in pancreatic cancer, becoming standard care in a relatively short period of time.
We see a lot of potential in Europe over the next – from now out for the next few years as we launch there and ramp up,
so that's going to give us very solid growth. And then as I mentioned, between our internal trials and then the
immunotherapy trials reading out, we're extremely confident in where ABRAXANE is going to shake out with all of
this. And I think on a regular basis, you're seeing companies talk about their programs and coming data read-outs from
those various trials. And we're hearing a lot of anecdotal positive feedback in terms of how people see ABRAXANE's
potential for the long term in that space. So we're quite confident in where we're going to get to.

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Newman of Canaccord. Your line is open.
<Q - John Newman>: Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. The question is on OTEZLA, and then I have a question
on the Juno collaboration. On OTEZLA, would you expect the DTC spending to continue to increase in the United
States at the same rate going forward, or would you expect it perhaps to accelerate? I'm also wondering if within your
strategy, you have considered negotiating with the plans in order to ensure that patients have to step through OTEZLA
before biologics, or if you believe that's necessary.
And in terms of the Juno collaboration, I'm wondering if there are any specific plans to look at CAR-T technology in
multiple myeloma? There have been small amounts of data there that suggest there might be something interesting, but
I'm just curious if you've thought about that possibility. Thanks.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thank you for the question. We have a DTC program for OTEZLA for the course of this
year, 2015. That DTC initiated on June 9, so we're still in the early days. We'll take a look at how that rolls out and the
effect and the return and the ability that DTC program to continue to drive patients to lots of different sites. And so
we'll evaluate more as we get towards the end of the year whether that stays the same or accelerates or what that looks
like, based on the effectiveness of that particular program.

Certainly, we do consider negotiating with plans. We do have with a relatively small number of plans but growing,
have negotiated a place where patients would step through OTEZLA before going to biologics. The clinical profile
certainly supports that in a good portion of patients. And so that's something that we don't see a lot of that in the U.S.,
but we're starting to see some plans come that way. And I think that is a good long-term goal for us as we move
OTEZLA forward is to bring more and more plans with the step on OTEZLA before heading to other biologic therapy.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And on the other question about myeloma CAR-T, we are very encouraged and committed to
our program with bluebird for the BCMA target myeloma in that space. So we're very encouraged looking forward to
accelerating the clinical development there. And specifically to myeloma, it's such an important disease to us that we're
committed to all the patient subtypes of myeloma. High-risk disease, all other areas of disease, and whatever modality
could provide an advantage and opportunity for patients there, we will invest in investigating the opportunity to really
treat myeloma even more effectively than it is today.
<Q - John Newman>: Great, thank you.

Thank you. Our last question comes from Mara Goldstein of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Thanks very much for taking the question. On ABRAXANE, I'm wondering if we could just
go back for a moment and speak to the dynamic in the U.S. I know earlier in the year there was some discussion or
maybe rounding out last year about competitive issues in the breast cancer space, but sales have been in that
single-digit area. Where should we think about that as a continuation in growth, primarily ex-U.S. from the countries
you have discussed, or is there something particular in the U.S. that might be that focal point to change? What's going
on there?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Mara, thanks for the question. So just to be clear in terms of the near-term relative
contribution to growth, Europe will be the bigger component. We do continue to grow we think in a solid fashion in the
U.S. Breast is probably the – lung as well to some extent, but breast is a quite competitive indication. And what I would
say on the positive side is we will have the Phase II TENACITY triple-negative results read out, as I already
mentioned, in the first half of next year. We've got the GeparSepto data in the neo-adjuvant setting, and we are
expecting that there will be an update on that at San Antonio Breast. So there is some data coming that will be
supportive of our position in breast and help us continue to compete effectively and maybe get a little bit of momentum
behind that indication as we go into next year
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Okay, thank you.
Peter N. Kellogg
So that's the last question. This is Peter. I'd just like to finish up by thanking everybody for their support and interest.
This has been an incredible first half of the year and a really tremendous second quarter both operationally, as you can
see in our financial numbers, strategically in terms of the deals we've done. And really we've reflected that in the
increase in our 2015 guidance. We've increased our targets for 2020, a reflection of the increased potential of this
pipeline.
We have a big Q3 ahead of us. We intend to wrap things up in terms of some of the transactions we've announced. We
look forward after that to really welcoming the organization of Receptos into the Celgene family. They're a great team,
and we're looking forward to having them carry forward with the trials they've got. So overall, we are very proud of
what we've done, but we remain ambitious for the rest of this year. We've got a lot on the agenda and very excited to
drive this forward. So thank you very much for your interest.
