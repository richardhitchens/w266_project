Devon achieved another high-quality operating performance in the second quarter, building operational momentum in
our U.S. resource plays and accelerating efficiency gains across our portfolio. These successful efforts resulted in
record-setting well results that drove our U.S. oil production above guidance expectations, with a capital investment
that was 17% below our budget year to date. As a result of this strong capital efficiency, we are lowering our full-year
capital outlook by $100 million, and importantly we have not made any changes to our planned activity levels in 2017.
For more details on our very strong performance for the quarter, I encourage every investor to read about our Q2
operations report.
With this momentum, we are highly confident in our ability to deliver value and returns on our investment plans over
the next few years as we navigate industry conditions. For 2017, our capital plan remains on track to reach 20 rigs
running by year-end, and we expect to maintain this operational momentum in 2018. Importantly, nearly all of this
planned drilling activity is concentrated within our STACK and Delaware Basin assets, which are two of the very
best-positioned plays on the North American cost curve, delivering attractive returns even at today's strip prices. To be
clear, we are not chasing production growth with our capital programs and remain keenly focused on maximizing our
full-cycle returns. With this disciplined approach to the business, I can confidently say that this drill bit activity is a
very appropriate level of investment for Devon in this environment.
Providing additional certainty to the execution of the business plan is our strong financial position. With a disciplined
hedging strategy, we have stabilized our cash flow stream by locking in roughly 55% of Devon's estimated oil and gas
production for the remainder of the year at rates well above market levels. Additionally, we are steadily accumulating
our hedge position in 2018. With this strong hedge book, we remain on track to invest within cash flow during 2017.
Coupled with our investment-grade ratings, no significant debt maturities until 2021, $2.4 billion of cash on hand, and
the expectation of $1 billion of non-core divestiture proceeds over the coming year, we absolutely have the financial
capacity and flexibility to execute our business plans.
Given our ability to organically fund capital requirements, Devon is uniquely positioned to maintain and build
momentum in the future as we advance our development programs in the STACK and Delaware Basin. The quality and
size of this world-class opportunity set is unmatched in the industry. Between the STACK and Delaware Basin alone,
we have exposure to over 30,000 potential drilling locations concentrated in the very best portions of these plays. This
premiere asset base provides Devon with a sustainable, long-term growth opportunity with the lowest breakeven
economics of any repeatable resource play in North America. Additionally, as these assets shift to full field
development, we fully expect to enhance returns as we reached significant efficiency gains from our multi-zone
manufacturing work and further optimized our best-in-class operational performance with cutting-edge predictive
analytics and artificial intelligence efforts.
Looking to the end of the decade, Devon's differentiated investment story only gets better. Our resource-rich STACK
and Delaware Basin development programs will be in full-blown manufacturing mode, and a massive upside potential
within these franchise assets will be further defined. As these strategic objectives are successfully met, we expect to
take additional steps to further high-grade our resource-rich portfolio. In fact, as our business evolves over the next
several years, we see the potential to monetize several billion dollars of less competitive assets within our portfolio in a
very thoughtful and measured fashion. Potential proceeds from these portfolio rationalization efforts would be balanced
between accelerating the development of our highest rate-of-return inventory and debt-reduction activities.
With this exciting multiyear transformation, we expect to emerge with a highly focused asset portfolio, and our
profitability would be dramatically enhanced as we transition to a much higher margin barrel. We also intend to have a
fortress balance sheet with net-debt-to-EBITDA target of 1.0 to 1.5 times by the end of the decade. These winning
characteristics will allow Devon to deliver consistent, competitive, and measured growth rates, along with top-tier
returns on capital employed.
So, in summary, before we move to Q&A I want to leave you with a few key messages from today's call. First, Devon
is consistently delivering best-in-class drill bit results that reflect our premium assets and operational excellence. With
the quality returns we are achieving in the STACK and Delaware Basin, coupled with our outstanding financial
position, we are on track to reach 20 rigs by year-end and expect to maintain our strong operational momentum in

2018. And lastly, as our massive resource set in the STACK and Delaware Basin shifts to full field development mode,
we will continually high-grade our portfolio by divesting assets.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Scott.
Scott Coody
Thanks, Dave. We will now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow up. If you have
any further questions, you can reprompt as time permits. With that, operator, we'll take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Thank you. Good morning, Dave. Good morning, everybody.
<A - David A. Hager>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Couple questions, Dave. I guess the first one's kind of a housekeeping issue on Canada. Can you
just walk us through just the issues in the most recent quarter and the trajectory as we move through the back end of the
year? Just trying to get a handle as to what do you think the sustaining production capacity is in the oil sands at this
point? And I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - David A. Hager>: Great, Doug. And I'm going to let Tony answer the details. Obviously, we did encounter what
we consider to be a one-time maintenance event that is impacting our production. We've actually – in July, we've
actually moved beyond that. That's fixed, that issue is. But Tony can give you the details on that. And I can tell you the
asset in general is performing outstanding. We just had a one-time maintenance event that's in the rear-view mirror as
we sit here today, and things look outstanding from this point forward. So, Tony, you want to follow up a little detail on
that?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Yeah. Good morning, Doug. Doug, at J2 we have these very large skim tank vessels there that
are really a large-diameter vessel that's got baffles in it. It's designed to move water and oil through a last stage of
separation and extend the retention time in those vessels. What we found was we have a pretty sophisticated leak
detection system in our Jackfish projects. And we recognized that we had a small leak in the J2 skim tank area. So we
got in there and recognized that – what we suspect is through vibration of the flow into those baffles that we wore down
the bolt and bracket system, causing some of those brackets to drop. One dropped and punctured the bottom of that
vessel. So after we got in, cleaned the tank out, and took a look at it, we knew exactly what the problem is, so we
remedied that on J2.
You know we also just did a turnaround in J3. We suspected this issue in J2. So we've been in two of those skim tanks
in the last 30 days, 40 days, and we'll be in the third at J1 within 12 months from now. So really it was an isolated event
that's now behind us, and thinking we have the solution remedied. And if you look at the forward look, just like Dave
mentioned, we have production at all three of these Jackfish plants really operating at nameplate and above. In fact, J2
and J3, the two that we just took down, they're already ramped back up in excess of the nameplate capacity, and expect
both of those to be back in the mid-40,000 barrels of oil per day. So when we get into Q4 with a clean quarter, we'll be
back into that 140,000-barrels-of-oil-per-day range. And, again, a long-life project in front of us. So this is just one
event that's in the rear-view mirror now, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I appreciate the color. Thanks for that. I guess the follow-up is – not quite sure how to ask this
question efficiently. So, when you look at the third quarter guidance, I think at least versus the [ph] dump sale (11:08)
side, it was a little bit light, but the full year hasn't changed, which I think kind of speaks to the potential lumpiness of

moving to these very large developments that are going to characterize the production profile I guess going forward. So
I just wonder if you can help us navigate that a little bit in terms of what that trajectory you've laid out with all these
very large-scale, full field developments going on, what that could look like as we go into next year and how ratable
you expect that growth to be. And I guess there's multiple pieces to that, but I'll leave it there and let someone else jump
in. Thanks.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah. Yeah, and if you look at the issue that happened with probably maybe a little bit light
guidance compared to what some people expected in Q3 on the U.S. oil side is we had a large number of completions
in the Eagle Ford in Q1. And that caused a really strong performance compared to guidance in Q1 and also carried over
to some degree into Q2. But those wells, obviously, fall off fairly quickly. When we originally put the budget together,
had we anticipated a little bit more balance on the completions in the Eagle Ford and have some of them more in Q2
that would cause a little built higher production in Q3 than where we ended up. So in essence we completed those wells
early, caused strong performance, Q1. Q2 – we had no Eagle Ford completions in Q2 because we got them done early.
And so that caused the Q3 Eagle Ford to fall off a little bit more than was originally anticipated.
But, again, extremely economic wells. Some of the best in the portfolio. We just moved the production forward, is what
it boiled down to. As we get more into the full development, what's going to happen is that we are going to have
multiple numbers of these multi-zone developments going at any one given time. And certainly in any individual one,
you can say there will be lumpiness, but we think there will be enough of those that it's not going to cause extreme
lumpiness in the overall production profile for the company.
And keep in mind also that, even as we're moving into these, that the bulk of these are going be smaller to start with.
And as we get further on into the development, they'll grow in size, most likely. But by then we'll have even more
going. So certainly there'll be some lumpiness it to. But we anticipate with the number of developments we have going
on that the lumpiness will not be too magnified.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Appreciate the answer, Dave. Thanks a lot. I know it's a tough thing to discuss.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah. And let me just emphasize, too, we're still on target to grow our U.S. oil production in
2018. So there's no change to that guidance at all.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great stuff. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - David A. Hager>: Good morning.
<Q - Evan Calio>: One of your STACK developments scheduled for next year, Coyote, it's in the far northwestern
area of your acreage. Just any color – I mean, do you consider that to be part of your acreage that's de-risked and
matured for development? Or is that dependent upon Coyotes? And maybe more generally, if you could just discuss
rock quality, well performance, or expected well performance difference between your focus areas in Showboat,
Horsefly. And what do you expect around the northwest Coyote?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Well, Evan, this is Tony here. I'd just describe to you that we have broken down our footprint
in the STACK prospect here into several different what we call appraisal areas. And of course Showboat is really an
appraisal area, one where we've had a lot of success. We've reported on that. But we've also been in the process, both us
and industry, of de-risking our next couple of appraisal areas. And so the Coyote project will be in one of these top
couple of appraisal areas that we have been de-risking.
So the way we look at this is we've got great understanding in the Meramec 200 and the Meramec 300. You're starting
to see results come in across the board in the Meramec 400s, some from Devon but some from industry. We've seen

some in the west from other operators that have not performed up to the same quality of results that we've seen in the
200 and the 300. None of that was unexpected, I think, from us.
And I guess I've got to remind everybody on the call, Evan, that this commitment that we have to being highly
data-driven, we think, is really laying us out to be the premiere operator in the field. Number one, we've got what we
think is the best footprint in the play, but really we have this commitment to being data-driven and have acquired
substantial amount of subsurface data. We've built that into the three-dimensional earth models, and that's really the
basis for all the design work going forward.
So when you look at some of the results we have over there, industry's doing a good job right now of piloting different
ideas from spacing and lateral intervals to vertical connectivity type testing to just simply appraising different horizons,
and we're moving into what we think are going be the sweet spot of each of these intervals that we're in. So we're
expecting a good performance out of the Coyote project.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great, thanks. And maybe a second if I could. Jacobs Row was downsized. It's not a surprise given
the commentary from your partner. How do you redeploy freed-up capital from lower non-op activity in 2018? And
could you provide us some color on how you'd compare Cana-Woodford full development returns versus your STACK
Meramec or your Delaware program? And I'll leave it there.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah. Well, obviously we look at our portfolio across the entire company, and we allocate our
capital to those that on a risk-adjusted basis provide us the highest return. And so when we look at redeploying capital
such as that, we will look across the entire company and see where the best place is. I can tell you in general that we'll
be redeploying any capital there back into the Meramec development or into the Delaware Basin development. Those
are very good returns that we think we're going get there, but we think we have – they're probably a little bit less, on
average, we'd say, than we can get from our Delaware and Meramec program, but not significantly less. But there is
obviously less condensate production on those than the other plays we're pursuing. So that's where the capital would be
redeployed.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. Good results, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great, thanks. Maybe on the – well, a question on CapEx. If we look at the CapEx reduction that
you announced for the full year, what were the primary drivers? And how do you see those trends as sustaining or
evolving over the course of the year?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, the primary driver for the CapEx reduction is just the increased efficiency that we've
been able to achieve across the entire asset base. I'd say one big factor in that is our supply chain initiative, where we've
decoupled much of the completion activities, where we're supplying our own sand, our own diesel, and we see
significant savings from that. We're also, just through the use of our advanced predictive analytics, artificial
intelligence work, we're finding that not only is it helping deliver best of any operator on 90-day IPs, but it's also
driving our costs lower as well. So we feel really good about where it is.
We're very confident, obviously, of the $100 million reduction. There may be some upside to that. We'll have to see
how the second half goes. We do anticipate there may be some increased inflationary pressure in the second half of the
year, and so that may drive our costs a little bit higher than they were in the first half of the year. We'll just have to see
how that goes. But we decided it's appropriate at this point – just take what we're sure of, which is a $100 million
reduction, and then see how things evolve in the second half of the year.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: So far, the early takeaways, which I think – I think the Hobson Row was some of the first kind of
larger scale unbundled efforts that you had made on supply chain management. The takeaways have been a little bit
better than expected. Is that fair?

<A - David A. Hager>: That and the efficiencies across our entire portfolio of just drilling wells more effectively, et
cetera. Yeah.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: That's great. Thanks. And then maybe one follow-up question on the Meramec. You have some
comments in there about results that you've seen of cum production results to date that you're seeing in your spacing
pilots in the Meramec. I think there's been some noise and confusion around some of the pilot results that we've seen
across the play from some of your peers in the basin that's caused some concern. So any thoughts that you can share on
what you've seen so far across the spacing pilots, and views on what this means for kind of full field developments in
the Meramec?
<A - David A. Hager>: I'll kick it off, and then we'll have Tony – I'm probably just going to repeat what Tony did,
maybe with just slightly different words here. But if you look at it, our operated spacing tests have been very, very
successful. We have seen on some of the outside operated spacing tests, there has been some very successful ones, but
some have had mixed results. When we look at those tests that others have done, we can't say for sure why they tested
exactly what they tested, but the results are not a surprise to us. Without going through the specifics of each one,
sometimes we've seen that they've been testing zones that we know would be thinner and wouldn't have the kind of
productivity as other zones that are in the same geographic area. Why they tested that – they were probably just trying
to get an idea of the productivity of a secondary or tertiary zone, we suspect.
In other cases, we know that they've been drilled on the fringe of what we consider the key part of the play to be. In
some cases, we think that they use completion designs that are not as sophisticated as what design that we are using.
And we've talked a little bit in a press release about the proprietary completion design. So to our viewpoint, there's
nothing that's surprised us with our tests, which have been very successful, or some of these others that have had mixed
results. And it just affirms we have the best position in the play, and that we understand what's going on here. So that's
kind of an overall view.
And I'd also say that it is very early on in the play. And I suspect – and we don't know for sure – but I suspect in some
of these cases, these companies may be testing the limits of certain things, and then they learn from these. And as they
go into full field development, it will be better results. And so I'd be very careful about extrapolating the results from
any early experimentation that may be taking on in the play, say this is the way it's going to look on the full field.
Because I suspect they knew what they were doing. We don't know exactly all the reasons they're using it. We suspect
they knew what they were doing, and they were just testing the limits of certain things to see if it would work or not.
But again it's no surprise us to at all, in any of the results we've seen.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Thanks. Good morning. And I'm just going to reference the slide – I think it's 15 in your
deck – just the Rattlesnake area. Can you just give me an update of kind of how – it looks like this development pattern
changed from maybe what you had been thinking. Can you just give us the latest and greatest thinking as far as it
relates to – I guess we'll just focus on this area and realizing every area is different, but can you just update us on that
as far as development patterns and how many wells per section, et cetera?
<A - Scott Coody>: Well – and, Dave, this is Scott. And absolutely the schematic changed slightly, yes. I think we
added one or two more wells from last quarter, and we got a little bit more specific with regards to the landing zones. I
think this time around we included the XY because that's the common nomenclature in that area. And obviously we're
doing an appraisal well in the Lower Wolfcamp A as well. But maybe Tony could speak to just what we're trying to
accomplish with that particular pilot, which we call the Seawolf pilot.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: David, as Scott mentioned, the well that we reported on here in the lower portion of the Upper
Wolfcamp A was just below the highlighted Rattlesnake area there. Gives us a little bit of upside thought process on

the lower portion of the Wolfcamp.
But if you go back to the last quarterly call where we reported the results of the Fighting Okra well, it's just
immediately south of the spot on the map that says the word Seawolf. And so there, you saw the outstanding results
that we had there in the upper portion of the Upper Wolfcamp. And this Seawolf is really going to be what we call our
first multi-zone development in Rattlesnake. And we've got a substantial amount of locations that we've highlighted in
our resource play. Starting right here with this, we'll spud the 12-well program in the Wolfcamp. And as we work that
off, we'll just move those three rigs from that location, start moving to the east, and fully delineate that Rattlesnake
area.
So what we don't show on this is a lot of industry activity that's been around us, and there's been some boomer wells
there. We feel like this particular portion of not only of our play but this particular portion of the Delaware Basin is
perhaps the best column in all of North America. So we're expecting a very robust long-term development just in this
Rattlesnake area.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Okay. And I just noticed the B maybe versus the prior, the Wolfcamp B, is no longer part
of that plan. Can you talk a little bit about – I know others have done the same – if you'd just talk about your thinking
there.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: There's not been a lot of data points that have come through in the lower portion of the
Wolfcamp A or the B. There's been some other nomenclatures, Wolfcamp 300 and 400. There's been some data points
out there, few and far between. Some of those have been in fact a bit disappointing, so we know there's a very rich
hydrocarbon column here. A lot of oil in place. We think it come with time, but we also think we can maximize our
present value by focusing on the upper portion of the Wolfcamp. And we know that we can come back and drill back
through that zone and get to the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, which, frankly right now, we're not prioritizing in our
development because we just have not de-risked it. We don't see the activity from industry really showing us the
results, either.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Okay. And thanks for all that color. And then, Dave, can I actually ask one about your
decision to sell the Barnett, or a portion of the Barnett? And I can imagine what your answer's going be, because we've
talked about it in the past. But I'm just thinking about, in terms of returns and generating cash flow, historically this has
generated a lot of free cash flow. It doesn't look like you're going need that over the next couple quarters to cover that
spending gap. Or can you just talk about your decision there?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah. Well, you're right. We don't need it for the shorter term. What I tried to paint in my
prepared remarks at the beginning of the conference call here is where we see directionally we are going by 2020. And
that is as we're moving into full field development in the STACK and the Delaware that we will become a more
streamlined company, eventually. And we see in the billions of dollars of asset sales that we may accomplish over that
timeframe in a very measured way as we balance our cash inflows and our cash outflows.
Certainly, there are several different areas that we can consider, and I'm not going to go into detail on any decision
regarding any specific area or asset that we have that we may consider for monetization. But, in general, I mentioned
that we would certainly most likely be divesting several billion dollars of assets. We see using some of that to further
development activity in the STACK and the Delaware Basin. And also repaying debt with a portion of those proceeds
to build an extremely strong balance sheet with a net-debt-to-EBITDA on the order of 1 to 1.5.
So we think that financial strength is going to certainly position us with a great deal of strength in any commodity price
environment. And we think that's really the key for a top-performing E&P company is to have – we have franchise
assets, we're executing very well on those assets, and we will further streamline the portfolio, and we will have one of
the best balance sheets, if not the best balance sheet, in the industry when we're finished with this total transformation.
And so certainly the Barnett or some other assets can figure into that equation. Again, we're making no decision on that
today, and certainly no announcement on that today, but we certainly have a lot of flexibility about how we go about
accomplishing this strategic objective, but that's where we're going.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Good morning, Dave, and to the rest of your team there.
<A - David A. Hager>: Good morning, Charles.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: I'd like to ask two questions on the Delaware Basin. First on the Seawolf development, can
you talk about what, if any, lessons you were able to bring from your multi-zone, high-intensity development plans
over in the STACK to the Delaware Basin and to that development? Or is it more of just a blank slate and there's not a
lot of portability of lessons from one to the other?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Hey, Charles. Thanks for the question. We do find the ability to transfer learnings between
our Delaware and STACK teams. In fact, we've been on this multi-zone design for about two years now, had some
really thoughtful work that has gone on with our technical teams in both areas. They meet with each other. So we
transfer learnings quite easily here. We're all centralized in this building, so it makes it real advantageous from that
perspective.
One of the things I think's unique about the Delaware is really the federal permitting aspects. It's little bit more
complicated than it is in STACK. And I think in the last conference call we talked about receiving our first master
development plan, which was – believe it was a 162-well permit that we received in Cotton Draw. And we feel like
we're very close to having three more of those master development plans approved by the BLM, which will set us up
for about 600 to 750 potential locations left.
And the benefits we see from this multi-zone development concept is just much more efficient, not only permitting
exercise that we're going through as I just described, but really we lay out the integrated surface facility concept for
each of these areas. And in that we're able to use the centralized production facility, not just by one pad or two pads
but, in our planning there, when we start looking at the Gantt chart and laying out all of these different projects, we
continue to use these surface facilities for a given area.
So for instance in Seawolf, while that'll be the first 12-well project we'll drill, we'll continue to run additional projects
producing through that centralized production facility for some time to come. So we'll maximize the rate capacity in
that facility for a while. We also feel like there's tremendous ability to increase the efficiency of our operations. And
just to give you order of magnitude of that, when we put in and park about three rigs in a half section or quarter section
type area and don't have to really move those rigs from location to location, we'll knock out about three days of rig time
out of what is normally about a spud to TD time of about 10 days. So the more we keep our operations centralized
there, we can continue to think of things in terms of batch operations.
So we'll have the flexibility to use spudder rigs to get the surface hole drilled, and then come back behind it with our
conventional rigs for the production stream. We'll also be able to do simultaneous operations, and we'll actually have
some frac operations ongoing in some of these projects while we drill and produce. So tremendous amount of present
value uplift by thinking a little bit differently than the industry has thought of in the past. And we're incorporating the
same concept throughout the Delaware and the STACK developments, Charles.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Got it, Tony.
<A - David A. Hager>: The only thing I'd add to that, Charles, the only thing I'd add, I think he had a really strong list
of a bunch of stuff there. But one thing is, we probably have as much experience as anybody out there in the industry in
what we would call the parent-child relationship in any given area. In other words, a relationship between the first well
and a section, and what the ultimate down-spacing might be and what kind of completion designs optimize recovery
given that. And so that's something that we've obviously studied from the Eagle Ford to the STACK and in the
Delaware. And we feel we have a really good understanding. You have to actually drill the wells in many cases to
know the absolute results, but we have a pretty good understanding, I'd say, of what is going to optimize the overall

recovery for the highest returns around that. And that comes from experience and drilling in a number of different areas
and transferring those learnings from one place to another.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Right. That's great color, Dave. And you guys certainly are pushing the envelope within the
industry on that kind of concentrated development. And that actually leads to my second question. You guys have
highlighted the Seawolf development, but I couldn't help but notice that just to the north you've got this Medusa
development that's just maybe a little bit behind on schedule with actually more wells. And so maybe can you give us a
little more color on what the plan is there?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Charles, we've laid out I think what we show here to be really the projects that'll be initiated
through the latter part of 2017 and into the early part of 2018. So we've got a Gantt chart that actually goes beyond that
with additional projects there. But as you – the focus for what we call the Thistle area is really largely going be the
Leonard and a little bit of Bone Spring type work and some Wolfcamp work there.
So it's just another – the project that we've talked about in the last operating report and the one that we mentioned in
this, the Anaconda, is really a three-interval test on the Leonard, that we're completing those wells and starting to bring
those online. We'll have operating results of those in Q3. But at this point, we're looking at those as very favorable
results. So Medusa is just really just a continuation of the development of that column.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Got it. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Yeah, Dave, I wanted to see if you could elaborate more on your thoughts on this longer-term
vision, perhaps this leaner and meaner Devon, with the focus on the STACK and the Delaware Basin? I'm just trying to
get a sense of how we should think about how other assets fit into the Devon portfolio as you're thinking about maybe
deleveraging through asset sales, in particular Canada.
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, thanks, Arun. We obviously have a number of strong assets throughout our portfolio. It
appears that those that have the greatest development opportunity are going be the STACK and the Delaware Basin,
and then, to probably a lesser degree in the anticipated price environment. And, again, we're going to thrive $45 to $50
world. We're not counting on higher prices, so we are building a company here that's going to succeed and be one of
the top companies in the current price environment. And, in that world, it looks like STACK and Delaware are
probably going lead the way as far as development opportunities while a number of the other areas will have some
development, such as the Rockies, and others are going be providing more cash flow to the company.
So we're on the cusp of really moving into full field development in the STACK and the Delaware plays. And when we
do, these plays are going be able to absorb and generate very strong returns. And, again, I want to emphasize again, we
are a returns-oriented organization. We're not just growing for growth's sake. But we think we can generate some very
strong returns in those plays in this price environment. If there's any question about the quality of the wells that we're
drilling, again, I'd refer people back to page 6 of the operations report, where we show we have the highest 90-day IP in
the industry. So you can talk 24-hour, you can talk 30 days, all that, but when it comes to 90-day, we're the leader, and
we can generate strong returns from that.
So, as we do, we do see that some of these other areas could potentially provide divestiture opportunities that would
allow us to further our development in the STACK and the Delaware Basin. And I'm not going to go as far as saying
which specific ones, because that's going be – we're continuing to look at that, and we will continue to look. It will be a
measured, a very thoughtful process. We'll be balancing our cash inflows and cash outflows, as I said, and we're going
use some for debt repayment to build this fortress balance sheet also.
So beyond that there's no, at this point, no further discussion. But obviously we're going to look at all the key criteria
when making that call, but it's a great position to be in, where we have a very strong asset base. We're executing now, I

feel, very well on that asset base, and we are going to continue to increase the focus of the company.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay. That's great. And just my follow-up, Dave, in a $45 to $50 world, we had been thinking
about Devon, based on your previous kind of commentary, of kind of balancing your internally generated cash flows
plus the EnLink distributions with your CapEx. Given how you may be embarking on this asset sale program, beyond
the 20% sale in the Barnett, is there comfort perhaps to spend above that amount with asset sales kind of plugging the
delta there?
<A - David A. Hager>: In essence, yes is the quick answer to that. Now, again, we are driven by returns first. And we
only do it if we feel we are – can generate good returns with the capital that we're deploying. We are confident, in that
price environment, that we can generate good returns in the STACK and Delaware Basin plays. And so, depending on
the circumstances, we'd certainly be open to using a portion of divestment proceeds to further development of those
plays and then a portion of that to pay down debt to build this strong balance sheet as well.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Great. Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go
ahead.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on Jackfish 1.
Do you expect similar skim tank issues and inspections ongoing and potential downtime?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: David, we could. We saw a little bit of evidence of the bracket issue in J3's skim tank. We
have no leak detection at this time at J1. You also have to remember, we've already been in the skim tank at J1 in a
previous turnaround. So we're really not expecting it to be an issue, but we'll certainly make the same type of proactive
repair work that we did in J2 and J3 while we're in the tank.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Okay. And then, just on the Hobson Row, you highlighted that in your 2Q ops report.
Can you talk at all about what the current production is and how it actually contributed to the volume? I'm just trying to
get an idea of how those 39 wells are actually producing.
<A - Scott Coody>: Well, obviously, the Hobson Row is the key driver behind our growth in the STACK this year.
We've advanced STACK production by about 20%, and that's largely driven by just the success of the Hobson Row and
what we're seeing there. And maybe I'll hand it off to Tony, where he can talk about just what we're seeing from the
type curves, and more importantly how we're going to deploy that success to the Jacobs Row. Tony?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: David, I don't have a whole lot to add to that. We reported a little bit of the results on the last
operating report. The work that we've done so far in this particular quarter has been type curve type results, so we didn't
really highlight it individually. But I'll tell you, we pumped 500 million pounds of – near 500 million pounds of sand in
that work. And from an execution perspective, the team did outstanding results. And there's a great partnership between
the operating guys and the supply chain guys that we have there. As I think Dave mentioned earlier, this is the first area
that we decoupled, great success there, and we think we dropped about 15% of the cost of that work out of the system
just through that operating efficiencies there.
We're very excited about extending the work from the normal lateral work that we've historically done into the long
laterals. We've got all the wells completed now. They're all starting to flow back. We'll be able to report on those
results in the next quarter. But, again, when we start looking towards the future in this and understanding what the
value of the long lateral will bring, we think the returns for this development are as competitive as much of what we
have in the portfolio.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: And just on that cost savings, how do you think that'll flow through to your future
development costs reported in your reserve reports? Should we expect a downward trend in Devon's future
development costs as you kind of lock in the decoupling of services and just trends of positive well costs?

<A - David A. Hager>: Well, I think that certainly is a positive driver towards – yeah, towards lower F&D now.
Obviously, as you pursue more oil-oriented plays, as you well know, David, those tend to be a little bit higher F&D
type plays in general, but that element would help mitigate that absolutely.
<A - Scott Coody>: And one other thing to add on that, Dave, real quick is just ultimately as you start heading towards
those multi-zone developments, where the majority of our capital is going to be concentrated going forward, that's
going be another tailwind as well. So very concentrated capital programs combined with the supply chain, we would
expect to show very well in this metric in the upcoming years.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Thanks, guys.

Well, I guess – it looks like there's no one else in the queue, so we'll wrap up the call today. We appreciate everyone's
interest in Devon. And if you have any other questions, feel free to call the IR team at any time, and that consists of
myself and Chris Carr. Have a good day.
