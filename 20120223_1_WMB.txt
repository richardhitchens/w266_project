MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams Companies Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference
Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell,
Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell
Thank you and good morning, everybody. Welcome to the year-end 2011 call. As always, thanks for your interest in
our company. As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday afternoon after the market closed. Also
yesterday, Alan using a few slides, had some commentary about the results, our new guidance and growth
opportunities. That audio commentary and the slides are available on the website. So on the website, williams.com, you
should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon: the earnings presentation with the audio
commentary by Alan; our normal data book with the usual information we make available each quarter; the press
release of our results and our analyst package.
As usual, because we had the commentary yesterday, this morning's call should be fairly brief. And we'll get very
quickly to your questions. In a minute Alan will – Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will make some brief
comments, after which we'll open the lines for questions.
Be aware as always, all of our business unit heads are here and will be available to respond to any questions after
Alan's remarks. With me here this morning are Rory Miller, who oversees Midstream and Randy Barnard, who heads
up our gas pipelines as well as Don Chappel, our CFO.
On yesterday's presentation and in the data book there is a disclaimer on forward looking-statements. This is important
and integral to our company, you should review those. Also there are non-GAAP numbers included in the various
presentations. These have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation

schedules are also available.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Good morning. And thank you, Travis. First of all, we certainly had very noisy results from the EPS as we spun
off WPX but really boiling it down and looking at the continuing operations, you will see that our adjusted segment
profit versus our third quarter guidance came in right in between our midpoint and high that we had given you for
guidance there. So our continuing operations performing very well in the fourth quarter and throughout 2011.
As we look forward, a tremendous amount of new growth, and you will see that built into both our guidance and
capital, as well as our opportunity pipeline that we continue to project. And one of the -- probably the biggest area of
change that we had in that opportunity pipeline was a large number of increases coming from our gas pipe segment as
major expansions particularly on Transco and to a little – to a lesser degree on Gulfstream really start to present
themselves as the industry and – power generation industry look to take advantage of continued low natural gas prices.
So very excited about the way we're positioned in that space and our opportunity pipeline certainly demonstrates that.
On guidance, you will note a raise in guidance for both 2012 and 2013, and this is an improvement, in our adjusted
segment profit, plus DD&A of $40 million in 2012 at midpoint and $120 million in 2013. In 2012, the drivers there are
slightly higher NGL margins, the addition of Laser to our guidance, as well as some offsetting impact of lower volumes
in some areas due to lower gas prices and our expectation of slowed drilling in some of those areas. So overall, an
improvement in 2012 though.
In 2013, you will see even lower NGL margins than we had previously in our guidance there, and I will speak to that in
just a moment, but those are offset in 2013 by higher ethylene margins in our MC&O area. So a nice raise there for
2013 and I think it really shows the strength of our portfolio and a big part of that strength is the growth in fee-based
revenues that we continue to see in 2011, we are going to see in 2012 and we certainly are going to start to see present
itself in 2013.
Speaking of commodity prices and our changes there, what you will note there is, very high crude to gas ratios
reflecting kind of what we're seeing in the current market out there. We've got gas now at $3 for 2012 and $3.75 for
2013, and we've got crude holding steady at $100.
However, despite that very high crude to gas ratio, much as we usually see when we see that ratio blow way out, we do
not see the NGL components keeping pace with that big separation. And so you will see a very low NGL to crude ratio
in our forecast of about 45% and that has us have our NGL margin declining from 2011 through 2013 of just a little
over 15%. But as I said earlier, we are projecting our ethylene business, particularly in 2013, starting to take advantage
of those lower ethylene prices.
So – but despite what I would say is a very conservative outlook in the NGL margin space, we continue to show very
strong cash flow growth and very bullish about the way our continued cash flows from both WPZ and our Midstream
Canada and Olefin segment is going, and I would just remind you, as you're looking out there amongst our peers,
making sure you're looking at it on an apples-to-apples basis. We feel like we've got a pretty good insight into the
commodity prices but I think what's impressive is we've got continued nice strength in our growing cash flows despite a
15% decline in our NGL margin and think a lot of our peers would be hard-pressed to show that kind of resilience and
strength in a lower priced environment.
So with that we will turn it over to questions.

[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Hi, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Morning. A couple quick questions. It looked like the Geismar Olefin volumes were perhaps
down a little sequentially in fourth quarter. And I was wondering if you could discuss if that's accurate, what's driving
that, and prospects for the volume growth ahead of the expansion of the facility? And also where you see potential
weakness geographically in terms of gas processing and Midstream as producers pull back in this environment?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: I'll take that. This is Rory. We had a 10-day shutdown at Geismar. We had a problem with the
missed pad there. And that accounted for the lower volumes there in the fourth quarter. So that's something obviously
that we're not planning for in '12, so shouldn't put too much stock in that.
Prospects for volume growth ahead of the expansion of the facility, I expect – or I suspect there you're talking about the
major 600 pound expansion that we've announced. We do have some furnace upgrades that are ongoing. Those are
being done one at a time. And so we will see some very slow volume growth across the period as those furnaces are
reconfigured and brought back up. But the big jump will come in 2013 when we bring up the major expansion.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Will we see some down time ahead of that to prepare for that?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. We have a turnaround planned, and our intent is that we would coordinate the activity
as much as possible to limit any additional downtime associated with the expansion.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. Thanks. And any slowdown geographically you could discuss in the Midstream area?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. Good question there. I think any of the slowdowns that we're seeing I think we already
have priced into our guidance. I'll just note that upfront. Out west we're not seeing massive pull-backs of drilling, but
we are seeing some moderation in the drilling out there. We've got one rig that we've just heard of that's being laid
down in Wamsutter, but everything else is still moving ahead. Generally speaking, say from quarter-to-quarter, we're
seeing a little softening in the drilling, but I guess one point I would make is, if we do see fewer well connects for the
year, we'll also see less well connect costs. So we think at least from a PZ standpoint, any slowdowns near-term ought
to be DCF neutral to PZ, and, of course that impacts WMB directly as we get those distributions.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Sure. Thanks a lot.
Operator
And we'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi, good morning. Just wondering if you could talk about maybe the cash flow contribution from
the Laser acquisition and how you anticipate the cash flow to ramp up over time.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: The Laser System acquisition which I'm sure you heard has closed is being look at as what
I call an integrated system. I think we're – in fact, we're going to be disallowed from using that name shortly. But one
of the big values from Laser is it's coming into our complex up there to be operated and run as part of an integrated
holistic system, and so we'll be referring to that area up there as the Susquehanna supply hub. The project was – I
would say was – the purchase price was more like what you would typically see on acquisitions in the midstream space.
If you're looking at guidance just for PZ, that's probably going to contribute about $25 million of segment operating
profit in 2012 and about 50 in 2013. That's the net impact. There's a little other noise in there, but we see that as being a
nice driver overall in terms of improving segment profit, and a big help just in general to that overall complex in the
area.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Great. That's helpful. And I guess turning to the constitution of the JV with Cabot, if you can
maybe talk about the potential investment in terms of dollar cost and the expected returns for that project.

<A - Randall Lee Barnard>: Hello, this is Randy Barnard. I'll be happy to answer that question. Sorry for my voice. It
got a little froggy this morning.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: That's okay.
<A - Randall Lee Barnard>: The stated investment for that project is around $700 million, actually $701 million.
Eight eights if we build the 24-inch version. We've got an open season on that project, now that may end up leading to
up-sizing on that project to 30-inch that would raise the capital by another $22 million or so. The joint venture between
us and Cabot, us being Williams Partners, would be 75% owners, so that would be our share of the overall capital
depending upon which version the 24-inch or 30-inch is built. Does that answer your questions?
<Q - Sharon Lui>: And then maybe just the expected initial returns on that project.
<A - Randall Lee Barnard>: Well we have negotiated rates for the project. They would be I would just say consistent
with regulated pipeline returns.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
And we will go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks. Just thinking about the pace of the dividend raise here it sounds like with what you're
going to hit for 2012, you are going to be above the midpoint of your range, the 12.5%.
I'm just wondering if you are thinking you can hit the high end of the range maybe now that you're adding more of the
fee-based earnings from WPZ with Laser and some of the new pipeline projects, or are you still thinking the midpoint
is a reasonable way to think about the raise?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Ted, this is Don Chappel, again. We'll stand with the range we put out, but certainly our
bias is to target the high end of the range.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. So the mix shift, I'm assuming TZ is going to be moving more fee-based here given that
you're fairly call it conservative on your NGL margins. Does that change your thinking at all?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I think we look at the whole portfolio, and clearly the fact that WPZ is building more and
more fee based business gives us more confidence in support for distribution increases, so I think we're on the same
page there in terms of we think the outlook is very strong.
I think as Alan said, the business prospects have never been better. So we're adding a lot of great assets and Rory spoke
to Laser, and that's kind of the early innings for Laser. We think that 2014 and beyond are even brighter.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. And then just sticking with dividends, and I realize it's a little early to think about it, but
do we have potential change in tax law here coming at the end of the year. How does that inform your thoughts about
capital allocation, whether it's dividends, buybacks, things like that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I think it's way too soon to think that the tax law is going to be changed. We certainly are
mindful of the possibilities. We certainly are educating those that make those decisions, but I don't know that we want
to speculate on what we might see or what we might do. Again I think at this point we think it's pretty low probability
that anything happens.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. You mentioned a little bit about expecting the stronger ethylene margins. Can you just
talk about what you're expecting for 2012 and 2013 there, and then is it a function more of lower ethane prices, or is it
just increases in ethylene prices or maybe a combination?

<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Well, I would say a couple of things here. One, most of the driver in 2013 from our previous
guidance is lower ethane prices. So that's a big chunk of that. For 2012, I would just say the current experience that we
have out there is that because there are outages, and that's driving – on the cracker side that is driving some of the lower
ethane prices, but it's also increasing ethylene prices because those crackers are out as well, so we're on both sides of
that coin. And but I would say generally most of the driver that we're seeing is in a longer term despite this kind of
current that we're in with high ethylene is really driven by lower ethane prices.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.
Operator
And we will go next to Bradley Olson with Tudor Pickering.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Hi good morning guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: I think my question is really kind of a follow-up to Ted's. It looked as though the NGL pricing that
you have in the February slide deck has declined over 20% at the midpoint from the November NGL pricing, and at the
same time, the bump-up for segment margin in MC&O in 2013 seems relatively conservative. Is there any of the, I
guess, ethane price decline that – or anything about the contractual structures that you guys might have with ethane
suppliers that would prevent you from realizing all of the favorable impact of a decline in spot ethane prices?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: I'll take that. This is Rory. If you look at 2013 and focus on that, we're down about $0.11 on
our ethane assumption and up about $0.04 on our ethylene, which is driving about a $50 million increase in segment
profit there. That's kind of the long and short of it. I don't know if that's helpful, but we...
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Yeah. That's helpful. And then there's nothing in terms of contractual structures, it's reasonable to
think about segment margin in the olefins business as really being determined by just – by spot prices?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. I think the good news there is if, and I'm not going to get into a lot of contractual detail
on our off-take agreements, but right now we have a pretty high percentage of our agreements that do have collars on
them, and so we're not getting full exposure to that fewer spot market margin, which today is around $0.40, maybe
even a little more than $0.40 a pound. Most of those are rolling off. And so we'll have contracting flexibility in 2013
and we'll – we haven't made those decisions yet exactly how we're going to play that, but at the end of the day you want
exposure to that margin, and you want certainty of takes, so that's the trade-off there.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay. Great. And I guess just as far as why the 2012 MC&O margin didn't move, that's more
associated with the collars that you referred to?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: That's definitely part of it. We've got a much smaller percentage of our off-take that's purely
exposed to that spot margin without some kind of limiting collar.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great. And just one question on the Midstream side of things, as you think about the current low
ethane price environment, when you think about some of your customers in the Piceance specifically, but in kind of a
variety of Rockies plays in the Green River in the Piceance where maybe you see anywhere from one to three gallons
per Mcf on average, so not extremely liquids rich. Do you think of those rigs as being in danger of being laid down as
you think of perhaps ethane prices on the Gulf Coast not being high enough to justify shipping ethane all the way from
the Rockies down to the Gulf Coast and incurring those transportation costs versus just selling that -- the BTU locally
as methane?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, it certainly doesn't help. The Rockies barrel does have a fairly decent percentage of
ethane in it. But I think what I would say, generally speaking, the lack, or the slowdown in drilling that we expect to
see we've already got in our guidance. I think that impact has already been accounted for. I think the uptick or the
strengthening that we're likely to see for ethane in the second half of '12 will help, but I think generally speaking, we've

got that impact and that effect already dialed into our guidance.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: And you don't think that will affect utilization on the new capacity on the parachute plant coming
on-line in 2014 or kind of similar deep-cut processing facilities?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: I think in the Piceance basin in general there will be some drilling slowdown there. I think
WPX in particular has already made some comments about that. The good news I think there is we do have some
Mancos acreage under contract out there, and that's kind of where I see a lot of the back-fill coming, and some of the
interest building out there. There's some rich gas windows and possibly even some crude oil windows in the Mancos
and the Piceance. And if we do have any slowdown here on the front-end, I think we've got a chance to back-fill that
eventually with Mancos rich gas production.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great, thanks a lot.
Operator
And we will go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A lot of my questions have been hit. Maybe just a few others
if I could, though. And maybe Randy on the pipeline side, and going back to constitution, just noting that it's – it
looked like it was sort of an in-service date for early 2015, and I would think 120-mile pipe that could kind of be done
in one season. Is there a reason why that's taking that long, or am I not perhaps thinking about it correctly?
<A - Randall Lee Barnard>: Well, the timing generally speaking is the whole permitting process and FERC
certification process. This would be a interstate regulated pipeline, so we have to go through all the pre-filing public
meetings, all the environmental studies, all the FERC certification, and that generally chews up a year and a half to
even sometimes two. So the actual in-service date that we're quoting on the project is fairly aggressive, believe it or not,
from the perspective of the development cycle, typical development cycle of regulated pipe.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. So it's really all of the regulatory issues, not necessarily waiting for more contracts, for
instance.
<A - Randall Lee Barnard>: No, sir. The Cabot commitment to that pipeline is sufficient to anchor the construction of
that pipe.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: No, that's great. Thank you. And then just a question maybe on the further investment potential in
Transco on the gas-fired power generation, and I guess Alan even mentioned to a lesser extent Gulfstream. So as we
think about that, and you guys have your wedge pie charts over the next five years, do you see that sort of developing
as far as perhaps leading to announced projects, something that might be nearer term or the first half of that five-year
outlook, or is it more in the back half? Is there any sense of color on that?
<A - Randall Lee Barnard>: Maybe I would cop out by saying about the middle half. [indiscernible] (24:47) Transco
in particular is pursuing over 20 projects right now that are largely driven by power gen growth, and it's up and down
the eastern seaboard. There's a slide in our pack that I'm trying to find so I can direct you to it.
Slide 57, it's in the data book. We've just touted some future potential expansions on Transco largely either along the
Leidy line or in the Southeastern U.S., and in Gulfstream as well. All of those is because of our view of potential power
gen growth, and some of it would be actual growth, and some of it is driven by coal plant conversion. There's over 30
gigawatts within – of potential either conversion or new power build within 50 miles of Transco, and we could see – we
are pursuing about the equivalent of 3 Bcf a day or about $2.5 billion of investment associated with – close to Transco
right now. Now, I'm not saying we're going to get all that. We're in competition for that. But it's a pretty positive
outlook for Transco.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: That's great. And then maybe one final question, if I could, either for Rory, or maybe for Alan.
And this kind of turns up to Canada and just thinking about Williams 10 years ago. You guys had a pretty large

Midstream presence at Canada. You obviously have a growing oil sands franchise right now. There's been a lot of
shifting landscape up in Canada, claims to BP assets, Pembina/Provident et cetera. I guess my question is do you guys,
with all of the liquids-rich structures that they're finding out there, do you guys see an opportunity beyond the oil sands
franchise, or is it more just to kind of develop that key area?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. That is a great question. I would tell you that first of all, first and foremost, we are
going to make sure that we monetize – we take full advantage of the great competitive advantage that we have in the oil
sands area first, and I would tell you there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to not only capture that existing
business, but to grow that business further and be able to optimize the value of those streams even better. Our BB
splitter that we did in August in 2010 is a great example of that, where we're further optimizing given the value of those
streams.
I would tell you that from our vantage point that a lot of the oil sands operations are fairly immature in terms of
optimizing the value of those resources. And so things like hydrogen that is in big demand up there will continue to be
in big demand.
[ph] Delium (27:50) transfer. We think there's a lot of services up there that we have a lot of room to grow that business
in. And so I would tell you we're going to seek out those areas where we have the largest competitive advantages and
provide us the highest return. And I would say some of those more competitive areas are going to have a hard time
competing with those opportunities.
Having said that, we certainly will keep our eyes open if we think that some of those projects could demand a return
that's competing with our other opportunities that we have, both in the U.S. and in Canada.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. Thanks, guys.

[Operator Instructions] And we will go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
<Q - Becca Followill>: For you, one, on the gathering side, there's lots of moving pieces with the acquisition of Laser
and the Springville lateral coming on line and some declining volumes elsewhere. Do you guys have guidance for us on
percent change in volumes in that segment in 2012 and 2013?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Hang on just a sec. Let me check on that.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. And then, while you're looking, you want me to ask the next one or you want me to
wait?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: You can go ahead and ask another question, we'll see if we can find the answer.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. The other is on NGL markets. You guys lowered your NGLs as a percent of crude. What
was – we all know that prices are low right now. So, is it a function of what you're seeing today, or is there something
else that's changed in the market that caused to you to change your guidance?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I'll take that second question, Becca, while Rory is gathering his info for your first one. I
would say that certainly the current environment has got us a little bearish on that, but also tell you that if you just look
historically, if you look at the gas to crude ratio, or crude to gas ratio, and you realize how high that is relative to
historical, there is an inverse relationship generally that occurs between high crude to gas ratio and that NGL to crude
number. And so even though it seems a unprecedented low number on that NGL to crude, we also are unprecedented
crude to gas ratios as well. And so if you look at the overall margin, I'm not sure that it's that far out of line. And so –
but certainly the current environment, the very warm winter that we're having certainly is impacting propane storage
and propane is just as exposed to that as natural gas is. And so that could be a hangover, certainly in 2012. I think 2013
it's a little early to call, frankly. And we may be a little bit conservative at 2013. But I think as we look for both ethane
for the balance of this first half of 2012 and propane for the balance of the year, that we could see some pressure there

just because of what we're seeing in storage volumes on propane right now.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Great. Thanks, Alan.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Becca, just getting back to your question, and you stated it real accurately, that there are a lot
of moving parts up there on Laser and Springville, and the way that they're priced it gets a little confusing, too, but I
think the thing that we have given some guidance on is kind of where our total capacity is going, with Springville right
now we're in the 300 million cubic feet range. We'll be going up to 625 million cubic feet, 650 million cubic feet over
the course of the year on Springville. Laser is going to be up around 1.3 billion cubic feet a day of capacity.
And then Randy talked about the 500 million cubic feet a day constitution project. And we also have about 500 million
cubic feet a day of interconnectivity with Tennessee Gas Pipeline in that field. So that kind of adds up to that three Bcf
a day of take-away capacity. And maybe what you ought to keep in mind is that that is one of the limitations out there,
so producers are out scrambling to get take-away capacity and then drilling to fill that.
Evidenced by Cabot's willingness to take the full 500 million cubic feet on the constitution project. So it does take time
to build. I think we exited the year just say on our Springville assets, for instance, in 2011, at around 600 million cubic
feet a day. That will be going up by well over 50% by the end of 2013.
And the Laser, the whole Laser story is one that's unfolding. It obviously just started up, so volumes are building there.
The earning potentials in 2012 and 2013 are just a shadow of what they're going to be. So we've got a real strong
producer group right now behind those assets, and they're going to be ramping up quickly. Cabot I think has been pretty
transparent about their plans. This is one of WPX's key areas, and they've been having good results out there, and the
Carrizzo volumes are backed by a drilling carry from Reliance. So we're very excited about the opportunities up there,
and I think you will see these producers working hard to take advantage of that take away capacity.
<Q - Becca Followill>: But no specific number for 2012 and 2013 on percent changes?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, we haven't offered that up.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. And just one more data point on the 1.3 Bcf a day capacity on Laser, where is it now,
just so we can get some kind of sense of how we can ramp it up?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, it's a little under 100 million cubic feet a day now, and that's a pretty dynamic number,
but we're obviously in the early days of starting that up.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Capacity, though.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Oh, did you say the capacity of that?
<Q - Becca Followill>: No, no, the current throughput. I think you answered it, what I was looking for.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Okay. Okay.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Great. Thank you so much, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Becca.

Okay, great. Well, thank you very much. As we said, we think we continue to have rock solid growth, and it's certainly
not dependent on a rising commodity price environment, and if we get some of that, and we start to see that at the back
half of 2012 and 2013, we certainly will improve beyond these numbers considerably that we've got in guidance, but
we're very comfortable with what we have out there, and we think this is great growth in both the cash flows and the
dividend that we can continue to produce. And so we're excited about what we have before us, and it's going to be a
matter of prioritizing all of these great opportunities to continue to make sure we're executing as well as we have to
date. So thank you again for joining us, and we'll look forward to talking to you in the future.
