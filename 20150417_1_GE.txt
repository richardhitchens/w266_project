Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Matt. GE had a good quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. Just to give you an economic read
from the world of GE, we see the U.S. getting a little bit better every day, Europe is slightly improving, overall China
remains good for GE, resource-rich markets are mixed, we expect to have positive revenue in places like the Middle
East, Latin America and Africa, meanwhile, Russia and Australia will be tough. We're seeing the world that we
planned for.
Industrial EPS grew by 14%, despite having $0.03 of uncovered restructuring. Operating EPS was $0.31, excluding the
impact of the capital announcement. Organically, orders were up 1% and revenue grew 3%. Industrial segment profit
grew by 9%, or 12% organically, with margins up 120 basis points. Oil & Gas had a solid first quarter. Organically,
they were positive in orders, with revenue flat. Profit was up 11% organically. The oil and gas market remains volatile
with some segments under pressure however, our diversified Oil & Gas platforms delivered in the first quarter. We're
on track for our targets in 2015.
We're running the company well. We spent a bit of time last week discussing capital allocation. I would only reiterate
that we were in full execution of our GE Capital plan. All of our CFOA targets and capital allocation goals are in line
with our framework. We remain on track for Industrial EPS of $1.10 to $1.20.
Orders were up 1% organically and we finished the quarter with $263 billion of backlog. Again Oil & Gas orders were
up 2% organically as they closed a few big subsea deals. Orders pricing declined slightly. Service orders were up 3%
organically with broad-based strength. Aviation spares grew by 31% and remain robust. We remain on track for strong
orders in predictivity in 2015.
New install orders for Healthcare, IT grew substantially in the first quarter. We launched asset performance
management in the manufacturing space. Orders for Transportation, software, and solutions are planned to be up 50%
for the year and we expect consistent growth for wind power up and AGPs for the year.
We saw some encouraging signs in the quarter. Aviation remains very strong recording $800 million on LEAP orders.
The LEAP has won 79% of all Neo and MAX orders. LEAP engines for Neo and C919 are flying and the LEAP for
Boeing is in the test plane and flying soon. The engine is ahead of schedule. The LEAP engine has been one of our
most successful product launches in history.
Healthcare equipment orders grew by 5% in the U.S. Transportation continued to record global wins and they received
$350 million order in Angola. Power Conversion grew orders by 10% and we have solid orders performance in China
of 54%. We expected Power to have tough comps in the first quarter. In addition they saw several orders slip into the
second quarter. But overall we see good demand for units in North America, Japan, Saudi, North Africa, Mexico and
Brazil, and we anticipate a strong power orders recovery in the second quarter. Our orders support our organic growth
target for the year.
Our business has executed well in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was up 3%. Geographic growth was balanced.
U.S. was up 2% and growth markets are up 6%. We saw strength in China up 6%, Middle East up 19%, Africa up 11%,
and Latin America up 13%. From a business standpoint we had organic growth in six of seven segments and we have
forecast organic growth of up 2% to 5% and remain on track for that.
Margins continue to be a good story with growth of 120 basis points. We have targeted 50 basis points of gross margin
expansion for the year and we hit 90 basis points in the first quarter. We had favorable mix, value gap, and productivity
in the quarter. Meanwhile, simplification continues to drive good results and we're seeing more benefits ahead. One of
the goals for 2015 is to expand margins in both equipment and service. We grew our equipment margins by 120 basis
points and service by 70 basis points in the quarter. We're making progress on margins as a company.
Industrial CFOA was $900 million. It was less than expected. Our shortfall was driven by some Aviation supply chain
disruptions and Power & Water orders timing. We will recover this in the second quarter. At the half we plan on CFOA
to be significantly higher than a year-ago and we're on track for our CFOA goals for the year. Our balance sheet
remains quite strong. In the future we will continue to look at ways to achieve a more efficient balance sheet.

From a capital allocation standpoint, Alstom remains on track for a second half close. We always expected that this
deal would get a second look in the U.S. and Europe. Alstom is impacted by similar volatile market dynamics as GE.
But we continue to see this as a good strategic and financial fit for us and we intend on completing a deal that is good
for investors.
Now, over to Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the first quarter summary. As we discussed last week we took a significant day-one charge
related to the exit of the non-vertical assets of GE Capital. On this page I will start with the underlying financial
performance of the company, excluding those charges and then on the next page, I'll walk you back to our reported
financials.
We had revenues of $33.1 billion, which were down 3% in the quarter driven by GE Capital, which was down 7%.
Industrial sales of $23.8 billion were down 1%. Operating earnings of $3.1 billion were down 5% on lower GE Capital
earnings. Operating earnings per share of $0.31 were down 6% with Industrial EPS up 14% and GE Capital EPS down
21%. Continuing EPS of $0.27 includes the impact of non-operating pension and net EPS includes the impact of
discontinued operations.
As Jeff said, CFOA for the quarter was $1.3 billion. We had Industrial CFOA of $900 million and received $450
million of dividends from GE Capital. Industrial cash flow was lighter than our expectations, driven by timing on
progress collections particularly in Power & Water and the impact of an Aviation supply chain issue on inventory.
These timing issues will reverse in the second and third quarter and our expectation is that the Industrial cash flow will
be stronger in 2Q and will be up substantially for the first half versus last year.
The GE Capital exit significantly impacts our tax rates for the quarter. As a result, we're providing both the reported tax
provisions and tax rates on the bottom left side of the chart. The GE tax rate for the quarter was 23%, in line with
guidance we provided. The reported GE Capital tax rate is not meaningful as the charges to shrink the company caused
there to be a $6.2 billion tax expense while there is a significant pre-tax loss. As we noted previously, GE Capital will
have a higher tax rate going forward and we expect variability in the tax rate as we transition the business through the
next few years.
On the right side you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and up 3%
organically, reflecting about four points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was approximately
$940 million drag on the Industrial segment revenue and about $120 million impact on op profit. Despite this
headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 9%. GE Capital earnings were down 21%, primarily driven by
lower Synchrony earnings due to the minority interest and lower assets.
I'll cover the dynamics of each of the segments in a couple of pages, but first I want to walk these results to our
reported financials. Starting with the first column on the left and working down, as we said Industrial operating
earnings were $1.6 billion, up 14% and GE Capital earnings were $1.5 billion for total operating earnings of $3.1
billion. Including non-operating pension, continuing earnings were $2.7 billion. We had an approximately $80 million
benefit in discontinued operation associated with the sale of our Consumer mortgage business in Australia to bring net
earnings to $2.8 billion.
The next column is the impact of GE Capital exit announcement as we reviewed with you last week. As we discussed,
we took a $14 billion charge associated with classifying businesses and assets as held for sale in a $6 billion tax charge.
We also took a $2.3 billion disc-ops charge principally reflecting the real estate transaction. After adjusting first quarter
operations for these items, the reported amounts are shown in the third column so $2.8 billion of operations net
earnings offset by $16.4 billion of GE Capital charges works to the reported $13.6 billion net earnings loss for the first
quarter, or a loss of $1.35 a share

As we move through the execution of the plan we shared with you last week, there will be adjustments and we will
continue to keep you updated on progress and the impact of those actions.
Next on Other Items, we don't have a long list this quarter. We had $0.03 related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and
other items as we continue to take actions to improve the cost structure of the company. This was $422 million on a
pre-tax basis with about one-third of that related to restructuring Oil & Gas. As we discussed before, we're taking
aggressive actions to reduce our costs' footprint given the challenging environment and Lorenzo and the team are laser
focused on execution.
For the year, we'll continue to execute on restructuring projects with urgency. As you're aware, we are expecting some
gains this year from Appliances and Signaling transaction. In the profile on the bottom of the page, we've assumed that
Appliance gain in the second quarter and the Signaling gain in the second half, but both are subject to regulatory
approval. Although there will be quarterly variability in gains and restructuring time, we expect gains to equal
restructuring for the year on an EPS basis.
Next I'll give an update on Power & Water. Orders for the quarter were $4.5 billion, were down 21% driven by
equipment orders down 29% and services down 15%. Orders were lighter than expected due to financing delays and
timing of agreements but not competitive losses. For example, we signed a deal for two 7F gas turbines this week that
we expected to sign in the first quarter. Our framework for wind and thermal orders has not changed for the year. We
expect second quarter orders to be up double digits.
In the first quarter, we booked 21 gas turbines versus 31 a year-ago and 376 wind turbines versus 422 turbines in the
first quarter of 2014. In terms of H technology, we booked another order for a 9HA in Latin America and this brings
the backlog to 16 units. In addition, we've been technically selected on an additional 37 units and are bidding an
incremental 50 units beyond that. Distributed Power equipment orders were down 53%, driven by nine fewer turbines.
We expect Distributed Power turbine's orders to be roughly flat for the year. Gas engine orders were lower by 39% in
the quarter, driven by softer demand in gas compression. Overall, DPE will continue to be soft for the year.
Service orders were down 15%, with PGS down 20%, driven by no repeat of a large upgrade in Japan a year-ago, and
lower new unit installs. AGP orders were 16, down one year-over-year. No change in outlook for AGPs or services for
the total year. Revenue of $5.7 billion was higher by 4%, but was up 9%, ex-foreign exchange. Equipment revenues
were up 1% on very strong thermal volume. We shipped 39 gas turbines, versus 17 a year-ago. That was partially offset
by Distributed Power down 37% and Renewables down 30% on lower unit shipments of 15 and 174, respectively.
Service revenues were higher by 7%, driven by higher upgrades, including AGP upgrades, 21 versus 17 a year-ago.
Operating profit of $871 million was down 2%, that's flat ex-foreign exchange, driven by higher volume, offset by
negative productivity in supply chain and engineering associated with the H ramp, and negative product mix due to
lower Distributed Power. Value gap in the quarter was a positive $12 million.
All profit margins were down 90 basis points in the quarter. We remain on track with the outlook we provided, and we
expect 100 to 105 gas turbine orders and shipments this year with a good pipeline of activity. We still expect wind
shipments of around 3,000 to 3,200 turbines and AGP upgrades remain on track and Distributed Power will remain
pressured throughout the year.
Next, I'll cover Oil & Gas. Oil & Gas orders of $4.3 billion were down 6% reported, but up 2% organically. Equipment
orders of $2.2 billion were down 10%, flat organically. Service orders were down 27% on a weak North American
activity, and TMS orders were down 23% with no repeat of two large LNG orders we took in the first quarter of last
year. It was still a decent orders quarter for TMS, which booked more than $700 million of new orders in the quarter.
Subsea and drilling orders were up 74% on large deals we booked in Ghana and Brazil. Service orders of $2.1 billion
were down 3%, but up 4% organically. Surface was lower by 21% and TMS was down 8%, largely due to foreign
exchange. Subsea was strong, up 21%, M&C was down 1% organically.
Revenues of just under $4 billion were flat year-over-year, organically, and down 8% reported. Reported negative V%
includes seven points of foreign exchange and one point of disposition. Equipment revenues were down 13%, with

TMS down 9% reported, but up 22% ex-foreign exchange. And subsea down 8% reported, but up 6% ex-exchange.
M&C was down 8% organically in the quarter, and service revenues were down 2% reported, but up 4% organic, with
surface down 23% and M&C up 11%, organically. Operating profit was up 11% organically, down 3% reported, driven
by negative FX, offset by strong productivity on both base cost, and product and service costs. Price was a $5 million
drag in the first quarter, but the business delivered positive value gap.
Margins improved 50 basis points reported and were 120 basis points better ex the impact of exchange on earnings.
This will be a challenging year in Oil & Gas, but the team has been aggressive on remaking the cost structure of the
business, and we believe that we remain within the scenarios that supported our total year Industrial guidance of $1.10
to $1.20 a share.
Next, I'll cover Aviation. Air travel continues to be very robust. Global passenger kilometers grew 5.3% through
February 2015 versus the same period last year, with the Middle East up 8.8%, Asia-Pacific up 7.3%. Through
February, freight traffic grew 7.5%, compared with a year-ago, with very strong double-digit growth in the Middle East
and Asia-Pacific. Orders in the quarter of $7.5 billion were up 36%. Equipment orders of $3.9 billion were up 64% on
higher commercial engine orders of $3.3 billion, up over two times versus prior year. This was driven by $1.2 billion of
GE9Z engine orders, up 10 times versus last year from Kuwait Airlines, Emirates and includes a GE9X order for
Cathay. GEnx received $360 million in orders, up three times, and we also recorded $800 million of orders for LEAP,
up three times.
Our total win rate for the LEAP, since program launched for the next gen narrow body aircraft is 79%. Commercial
engine backlog was up 35% year-over-year. Military equipment orders were down 61%, driven by no repeat of two
large orders from Sikorsky and Qatar Air Force from the first quarter of last year as expected. Service orders were up
14% on strong commercial spare parts, which were up 31% at $38.9 million a day, and military spares were down 11%.
Revenues of $5.7 billion were down 2%. Equipment revenues were down 8%, with commercial equipment revenue
down 1% on lower GEnx shipments. We shipped 19 fewer units than last year, 51 versus 70, and 29 less units than our
plan, as a result of a supply chain disruption. Military equipment revenue was down 32% on lower shipments and
service revenue was up 4%, with commercial spare parts up 28% and military services up 3%.
Our profit was up 18% on very strong value gap, variable cost productivity and favorable GEnx mix, partially offset by
lower volume and higher R&D. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter. The impact of the lower GEnx
shipments improved the margin rate by about 90 basis points. This is net of some costs to remediate the disruption.
We're working the issue and we expect to ship most of the delayed units in 2Q, and be back on plan for the full year of
275 to 300 GEnx units.
Aviation had another strong quarter, growing equipment and service backlog by 23% and 9%, respectively. The
business continues to execute on new technology introductions, service offerings and cost out. Aviation could perform
better than we outlined at the December outlook meeting.
Next, Healthcare orders of $4.2 billion were down 1%, but up 4%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw a
continued growth in the U.S., up 5%. Europe was down 4%, but up 11% ex-FX. Japan was down 18%, down 6%
ex-FX, the Middle East was down 43%, driven by Saudi, and China was down 4%. Healthcare system orders were
down 5%, flat, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. U.S. imaging and ultrasound was up 7%, with strong growth
in MR, up 41% in the quarter, partially driven by the new PET/MR release in December. This was offset by softer
orders in Japan, Russia and the Middle East.
Life science orders were up 10%, up 17% excluding foreign exchange, driven by strong Bioprocess orders. This was
offset with core imaging down 3% and services. Revenues of $4.1 billion were down 3%, but up 2% ex-foreign
exchange. Healthcare system revenues were down 6%, flat organically, and life science revenues were up 4%.
Operating profit was up 3% with 80 basis points of margin expansion driven by strong cost execution, partially offset
by lower price.
Looking forward, we expect similar market dynamics. We believe we're gaining share in key modalities in the U.S.,
and we expect the market to continue to improve. While China has slowed, we expect orders growth for the remainder

of the year in China. Life science growth will persist and the business team continues to execute on its cost-out
programs.
In Transportation, North American carloads were up 1.8%, with intermodal traffic up 2.1%, which was impacted by the
West Coast port's strike. Commodities have seen broad-based increases, with agriculture up 4.6%, and chemicals and
petroleum products up 3.2%. Coal volumes were down 2.5% in the quarter. Transportation orders were down 38%,
with equipment orders down 56%, and services were higher by 13%. Equipment orders were lower driven by
locomotives, primarily due to not repeating the large South Africa deal we had in the first quarter of last year. Revenues
in the quarter were up 7%, driven by strong equipment growth. We shipped 215 locos in the quarter, versus 178 a year
earlier. Overall, mining continues to be soft, down 23%. Operating profit in the quarter was up 11% on higher
locomotive volume, material deflation and cost productivity. Margins in the quarter expanded by 70 basis points.
We now have 16 pre-production Tier-4 units out with our customers running on the rails. They are performing in actual
operating condition as part of our validation process. We had about 1,200 Tier-4 locos in backlog at the end of the first
quarter of 2015 and we expect to ship about half of those this year.
In Energy Management, orders of $2.1 billion were down 3%, and up 2% organically. Power Conversion orders were
up 10% in the quarter. Industrial Solutions was up 4% and Digital Energy was down 38% from no repeat of a large
domestic meter order from last year.
Power Conversion saw a strong growth in Renewables vertical, up two times on solar inverters and the Marine vertical
was up 15% on the large Canadian propulsion dynamic positioning deal in Canada, offset partially by softer Oil & Gas
orders. Backlog for our Energy Management business grew 3%. Revenues were up 1% and up 8% organically, driven
by foreign exchange with Power Conversion up 6%, Digital Energy and Industrial systems were both about flat.
Our profit was $28 million, up from $5 million last year on a reported basis. The business continues to benefit from
restructuring with strong base cost productivity driven by SG&A reductions and positive value gap offset by
unfavorable foreign exchange. Margin rates in the quarter were up 140 basis points. We expect program execution and
margin rate improvement to continue throughout 2015.
And then finally, Appliances & Lighting. Revenue in the quarter was up 5%. Appliance revenues were up 8% driven by
strong volume. Industry core units were flat with retail down 1% and contract up 4%. The industry volume was well
below the first quarter expectation of plus 8% due to the harsh weather across the U.S. We believe GE increases our
share by two points in the first quarter.
Lighting revenues were down 3% on lower traditional product demand, which was down 18%. This was partially offset
by continued strong LED performance, which grew 76% in the quarter. LED now makes up 30%-plus of Lighting
revenues and that's up from 17% of Lighting revenues in the first quarter of 2014. Our profit in the quarter was $103
million.
Now in GE Capital, before we start with the GE Capital results, I'd just like to take a moment and highlight the
incredible work done by Keith and the GE Capital team. Keith led an enormous and complicated effort in a very
challenging window of time to get the company to this very important strategic pivot. This is a transformational change
for our company that will create real value for investors long-term.
As I've covered the impact of last week's announcement is reflected in GE Capital's first quarter reported financials. On
the page we have provided a walk starting with the earnings from our vertical businesses, which generated $352 million
for the quarter. Operating earnings from the remainder of our businesses and continuing operations amounted to $1.1
billion, which was more than offset by $14 billion day one accounting adjustments related to last week's announcement.
Earnings from continuing operations amounted to a net loss of $12.5 billion. Discontinued operations generated
additional losses of $2.2 billion, which reflect the charges associated with our commercial real estate business. Overall
GE Capital reported a $14.7 billion loss including $6 billion of tax expenses. We ended the quarter with $303 billion of
ENI excluding liquidity.

Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter at $76 billion, including $14 billion attributable to
Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remained at $25 billion and we had $8 billion of long-term debt issuance
for the quarter. As discussed last week, we do not anticipate additional issuances over the next five years and we expect
GE Capital CP balance to decrease to $5 billion by the end of the year.
Starting this quarter we are transitioning the capital adequacy reporting from Basel I to Basel III in line with industry
practice. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 10.6%, inclusive of the day one charges. We expect this ratio to
improve as we dispose of risk-weighted assets over the course of the year. As I mentioned last Friday, we will operate
through the transition in a safe and sound manner, working with our regulators in determining the appropriate capital
level.
Going forward, the team will be very focused on executing the portfolio transformation. As we discussed last week, we
have signed deals on close to 50% of the planned ENI reduction for the year and we are receiving very strong inbound
interest on many of our portfolio since the discussion last week. We are prioritizing transaction in a way that allows us
to maximize franchise value and as I said last week, we will be very transparent as we execute through this process.
Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team delivered a strong operational quarter in line with our prior guidance and are
now fully focused on delivering on the portfolio transformation that we shared with you last week.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Jeff. We remain on track for our 2015 operating framework but we will adjust our guidance milestones to
reflect last week's announcement on Capital. Industrial EPS is on track for $1.10 to $1.20 and we're running our
businesses to the high end of that range.
We're generating solid organic growth and margin expansion. Corporate costs are being well-managed with gains equal
to restructuring and Oil & Gas is performing to our expectations. We continue to invest in Industrial growth. Between
research and development investment and plant equipment and information technology and the potential for bolt-on
Industrial M&A, we'll invest $10 billion to $15 billion each year in our Industrial growth. We can do this and still
return significant capital to investors. The GE Capital verticals are tracking to $0.15 per share and as Jeff said we're
focused on the verticals and will keep them top of mind.
We've set a target of $90 billion in asset sales and this is part of our guidance. We already have approximately 50%
announced and have a robust pipeline to achieve this by year-end. Again, we will update this at EPG. Free cash flow
remains on track to $12 billion to $15 billion. Dispositions and CFOA are on track and we expect GE Capital to
dividend between $500 million and $7 billion, in line with what we talked about last week and we will update this as
we go through the year.
We will continue to drive investor-friendly capital allocation. The dividend remains a top priority. We're still expecting
the Synchrony split to return $20 billion to you in the form of a share exchange and as you saw last week, our board has
authorized a $50 billion buyback based on the proceeds from the GE Capital sale. So between Synchrony, the buyback
and dividends, we can return $90 billion to investors over the next few years.
The company is executing well operationally and strategically. Our compensation plans have aligned us with investors
and we expect to have a solid second quarter and total year.
Matt, now back to you for some questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hi, guys. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: I was intrigued by a couple of comments that you made, but Jeff Bornstein, the comment you
made on incoming interest into the asset sales. I mean, give us a sense of – I think the question really is, give us a sense
of your availability to sell those assets quicker than you laid out in your timetable, meaning are the books out, do you
have – if the sovereign showed up tomorrow could you hand them the keys and a few months later it's you can get the
deal done, or is there some gating factors that could limit the timing?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, I would say, Scott, the amount of inbound interest has been incredible, in both
non-banks and banks, both domestic and international interest. So I think that we're buoyed by the demand that we see
so far. It really depends on the platform and the type of transaction we're talking about. And we are organized to be
able to do this as quickly as possible. Our goal is to monetize these assets, these platforms as fast as we can. There will
be some gating challenges on getting ourselves in a position to, as you described, to get all the books together, et cetera,
et cetera, but we're going to go after this as fast as humanly possible and I think the positive point here is the level of
interest is really quite incredible.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. That's good. And then Jeff Immelt, you made a comment in your prepared remarks
about wanting to get to an efficient balance sheet, or something in that regard. And I hadn't really heard you mention it
in those terms before. I mean, how do you think of an efficient Industrial balance sheet? Is there some sort of a range of
leverage, or some way to measure that?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think, Scott, in the near-term I think you have to think about us as safe and secure and
marching through this process with GE Capital and things like that. Over the long-term, I think our desire is to have an
Industrial looking balance sheet, and how fast that goes again depends on Jeff's answer earlier on GE Capital assets and
things like that, but our goal is to have over time to have investors look at GE as an Industrial company and have a
balance sheet that lines up more or less with our peers in that space.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. And then last just a clean-up item. What impact on margins was currency in the
quarter? Did you have a benefit from hedges in the margin improvement?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: No, actually, FX was a drag in margins in the quarter.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: As I talked about in the Industrial segment margin, we had about $120 million FX drag
and hedges were a very small offset to the total impact. We actually had negative impacts all in.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great, Scott. Thanks.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. Just can we go to that $1.10 to $1 framework. I heard you say that you're running
the businesses to the high end of that range. Maybe an idea of what does that mean and also how much – can you just
remind us, how much of that is Alstom?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Again, Steve, the way to think about that is we have an AEIP plan, a compensation plan and
that lines up with how the internal business plans work. So I think we talked to you guys, Steve, at the year-end
meeting and at EPG about the comp plan we have the team to. So when you look at the AEIP plan that frames
compensation for the leadership team, that's what I referred to. And it's really the same comment I made in January
about how we, how we're running the place. I think with Alstom, Steve, we're counting on $0.01 for the year. So not
really much impact in 2015 and more so in 2016.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: So maybe just sticking on that then and maybe this is to Jeff Bornstein on this one. How
are you – if we just walked our way from again this $0.31 and given the trending of Oil & Gas, just maybe – I think
having just a little challenge given the weakness we're seeing in other companies bringing down guidance in Oil & Gas
and related areas. What gives you guys the confidence of getting to that over the next three quarters and a more than
sequential second-half ramp and things like that?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, listen, I think that the scenarios that we shared with you at year-end we updated
again in the first quarter call, I'm sorry in the first quarter on the fourth quarter call. We evaluated a number of different
scenarios around Oil & Gas. As we communicated to you all of those scenarios we felt were within the range of $1.10
or $1.20. We've got the team, Lorenzo and the team are executing like crazy on a substantial cost plan. They are right
on track, actually slightly ahead of schedule. They're going to take out close to $600 million of costs this year, both
base cost and product and service costs.
So when we take a look at where we ended here in the first quarter with Oil & Gas and how we think about the balance
of the next three quarters and very importantly with all the restructuring that we're doing, the benefits of that largely in
the second half of the year, we feel like today based on everything we know that those scenarios and that guidance we
gave you remains intact.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, I would add to what, let me add just a little bit to what Jeff said. I think he framed this
year well. I think at the quarter the guys are actually probably a little bit better than what we had anticipated. But you
see all the volatility in the market and this is going to, it's just going to be something we have to continue to evaluate
quarter-by-quarter.
But at the same time I think one of the advantages we have at GE is we can look at other businesses that have the
potential to do better and over the context of the company we've got a framework that we're confident in even if other
scenarios in Oil & Gas take place. So I think that's one of the strengths for GE. You've seen the way Aviation got out of
the gate and that – some businesses get a chance to provide some upside maybe during the year.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And then just lastly on this topic, the 1.4% order pricing, negative order pricing in
Oil & Gas again, that is really – how should we think about that in terms – are these additional – is there any additional
renegotiation or existing backlog happening, or is this new and where are you seeing the weakness on that front?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, so when you look at order pricing, Steve, that 1.4% is almost entirely associated
with the Ghana subsea order we took.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So it's not broadly across the portfolio. We have not renegotiated any prices from existing
backlog. So that's where we are today.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. I will hand it on. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yeah, maybe I'll let others ask questions on Oil & Gas. Let's focus a little bit elsewhere. As I
look into 2016 and what about Renewables? And I guess I won't touch on Oil & Gas, what about subsea because the
industry timing on subsea suggests that orders will be very strong this year. But what does it mean for 2016 in Power &
Water and Oil & Gas given the specific regulatory dynamic and industry-specific dynamic in these two sub segments?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So I think with Renewables, again, what I would say, Andrew is we always think about
the U.S. in the context of the PTC and there's nothing we see today that indicates that the PTC is not going to get rolled
over in some capacity. So that kind of keeps the U.S. at a kind of let's say steady-state. And then when you look around
the world you see growth. I mean, I think if you look at Brazil, if you look at places in Europe, if you look at even
Africa and Middle East, China – we see pretty good growth in wind globally.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah, I think we're thinking we'll do another 3,000 turbines is our current estimate in 2016
as well. There is a shift. It's going to be more international than domestic as we move forward, no question about that,
but roughly the same kind of volume.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I think the way to think about subsea is on an incoming order standpoint each project is
going to get a ton of scrutiny whether it's the Ghana project that we signed or Bonga in Nigeria or projects in Australia
or things like that. But once the project is going it's unlikely that it will be stopped. In other words, you already have
the fixed costs and when it gets into the production mode it's unlikely that it's going to slow down, so we still think
subsea in 2015 and 2016 are going to be okay within that context.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just to follow-up a little bit shorter term looking to the second quarter you highlighted some
delays in Power & Water and Aviation. So if these two segments recover actually into the second quarter, what does it
imply for organic Industrial growth in the second quarter?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, I think at the moment here, we've given you guidance for the year. We expect
organic growth will be 2% to 5% for the year. We were at 3% here in the first quarter. I think that's generally the trend
we expect to be on throughout the year.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: But directionally they would imply that ex-Oil & Gas there should be some room for
acceleration in the rest of the business, right?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Again, we see those segments getting better in the second quarter but again, we just don't
want to do organic revenue quarter-by-quarter, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Okay I tried.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We're comfortable in the range and we'll leave the rest to you.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: I tried. Thank you very much.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Thanks.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Shan.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. So maybe just on the equipment margin improvement, 120 basis points, pretty
impressive. It looks like some benefit from mix in the quarter. As we go forward, I mean, assuming you can't count on
that mix every quarter, value gap, cost productivity and some of those things Jeff Bornstein and Dan Heintzelman are
working on, does that ramp as quickly as sort of 2Q, 3Q and maybe just a little expectation on how you see that
equipment margin playing out through the year?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We expect that the initiatives that the teams have going and that Dan and I are working
with the businesses on will gain momentum as we move throughout the year. As you saw on Jeff's page when he
walked through the margins, we had 60 basis points of mix. I think what we talked about at year-end when we talked
about the year was mix that probably wanted to be hopefully would be something more neutral. So I would expect us to
gain momentum on the costs line, in the product service costs line and we'll see where mix plays out but I would
assume for the year that mix will be roughly neutral.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And any segments so far as you're kind of attacking that cost structure, any segments
that you're particularly encouraged by the opportunity you've seen?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I think every single one of these business have enormous opportunity. I mean, when you
look at the first quarter results, particularly around equipment margins, just about every business had improvement with
the exception of Power & Water and Oil & Gas. So I think it's not unique to any one business. Every one of these
businesses has an enormous opportunity to get product and service cost at another level.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then just maybe on Alstom, Jeff Immelt, you mentioned some of the
difficult trends in the market that Alstom would be facing that you are also seeing, obviously. Can you still get to sort
of the plan there even if the markets are a little tougher? And then any update in terms of the regulatory process and
how some of the concerns of the European Commission around heavy duty gas turbine concentration might be
remedied?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah, I would say – let me answer the second piece first, Shannon. I would say there's
nothing really that's been a big surprise as we go through this. So we always thought that there would be a second
request or that process would take until the summer. And so I would say so far nothing really is a surprise. I think on
the financials we still look for a high-teens return and $0.16 accretion in 2016, so we still feel that is achievable and
synergies are quite robust and we like that. And the last thing I'd say is look, at the end of the day just like every deal,
we have always reserve as we do these transactions that we will only do deals that are investor-friendly and that
achieve good returns. And so I think we've established that in this case and I think we're optimistic about how Alstom
fits with GE.

Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hey. Just a question on Power & Water. The services orders were down a decent
amount, sales though were up. So maybe give a little bit of color around what's going on in the thermal services
business in particular by region because it does seem as if the orders are softer, AGP as well, and sales are still okay.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So Julian, I'd start with orders were softer year-over-year largely because we had a very
large upgrade in Japan last year that we just didn't repeat this year. Secondly, the number of new unit installs that the

services business worked on in the quarter were fewer year-over-year. So that's most of what we saw in softness in
Power Gen services. AGPs were about flat. We told you we think we'd do about 100 for the year. We will do 100 for
the year. I don't think we're changing any of the outlook there. So I don't think there is a broad theme here, even
geographically, around Power Gen services.

Our next question comes from Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.
<Q - Barbara Noverini>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good morning, Barbara.
<Q - Barbara Noverini>: So is predictivity growth tracking your expectations since you spoke about your plans back
in the fall? And can you talk about which of your operating segments are driving the most demand for predictive
analytic solutions this year?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah, so we see again, I would say 30% to 40% growth pretty consistently across the
business in software and predictivity. I just had a review with all the businesses last week, and so there is a variety of
different initiatives. I'd say clearly the power and power upgrade, things like power up on the wind turbine side, we've
got 10 installs but really another 100 behind that that's quite exciting.
As I mentioned the rail business has got an expectation to grow orders about 50% for the year, so we're seeing both
from a software and things like movement planner side growing. The radiology IT piece is up 13% in terms of new
bookings in the quarter, so some pretty good activity there. We've kind of launched what we call asset performance
management, APM, in Oil & Gas, so we're seeing an original service funnel in that activity.
So I'd say macro kind of in the 30% to 40% range with strong double digits in each business as we look at software and
predictivity for the year.

Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Hey. A couple of questions on the Aviation side, that spares number being up 31% really jumps
out. And do you see changes in airline behavior? Is this coming through because of lower fuel and how sustainable is
this through 2015?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Well, I think you heard the revenue. The volume numbers are pretty good. Revenue
passenger miles are very, very strong. There is no question that most of the forecasts are that the Aviation industry
globally will probably have its most profitable year in history this year. I think IATA was estimating almost $25 billion
of profit, and the airlines are no question stocking inventory. You'll recall that 2012 there was a really large destocking
that went on and since that destocking in 2012, spares have improved each of the last couple of years. So it may be that
the airlines based on the profitability to operations are more aggressively replenishing some of that destocking that
happened a few years ago, but very strong.
Now we don't expect that rate of 31% to persist for the year. I think we talked about double-digits and we're probably
talking about mid-double digits, mid-teens maybe. But it's not going to be 31% for the year.

Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey. Good morning. Just wanted to kind of circle back around to Alstom. Given that there was
kind of such an abrupt change in strategy around capital and you're achieving kind of your business mix goal kind of
through subtraction largely, how do you actually feel about Alstom here? Is that really the right asset? Is there a way to
back out of that if the EU is a little too demanding?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Well, I would take that in two pieces. I'd say the premise for the deal, Jeff, is relevant today
as it's been in the past, which is very complementary products, opportunity to drive excellent synergies, good return on
investments. And we feel at the kind of four times EBITDA post-synergies is a pretty attractive entry point into an
investment like that. So high double-digits returns and in a market we really know.
And then look, I think just like every – I would back up and say the company's gotten probably 100 deals through
Brussels in the past decade, something like that. So I think we know how to approach this and know how to get these
things done. But just like every other deal we've ever done if this one ever would become unattractive, we wouldn't do
it. So that's no different than any other transaction we've ever done as a company.

Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.
<Q - Robert Paul McCarthy>: Hi, good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Rob.
<Q - Robert Paul McCarthy>: Hey. It looks like we've reached the lightning round of the call so I've got one
question, so I'll make it count. In any event, just in terms of the timing of the divestiture of a large part of these GE
Capital assets, obviously the inbound call volumes were encouraging but at the end of the day given the size, scope and
nature of a lot of these businesses, you're going to be dealing probably with a lot of large, SIFI-like institutions. I mean,
how do you reconcile the need for kind of speed killing in terms of getting to these divestitures versus getting the right
price? And how are you thinking about those decisions and do you think the timeline is practical?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, I think that the plan that Keith laid out with all of you last week, we laid out a plan
that spanned a couple – two-and-a-half years here roughly. But that we thought that the bulk of this work would be
done by the end of 2016. Now we're going to try to outperform that there's no question. I think that when we think
about the risks associated with this including price and value, speed is the single biggest mitigant. We have a market
today that's incredibly receptive to these kinds of assets and so we need to be able to capitalize on that.
There is no question we've got to balance from an execution standpoint the nature of the buyer and the size of the
transaction to the extent that we're relying on maybe a back-end regulatory approval by the buyer with doing smaller
transactions that maybe, maybe not, maybe better from a price perspective than doing several large big bulk deals.
But I think my guess is that Keith and the team will run almost a parallel process there where we'll evaluate on both
tracks, platform-by-platform, portfolio-by-portfolio the level of interest there versus a couple several maybe much
larger deals that try to sweep up many of those platforms simultaneously. So we're completely aware of exactly what
you're asking and we have a process and we'll make sure that we evaluate in those lights, but speed is the key.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Rob, I just want to say that the lifetime achievement award winner, JoAnna Morris, is
working the phones this morning. So don't blame Jeff Bornstein or me for any of this activity. And I want to echo just

what Jeff Bornstein said, which is you've got to think about each one of these assets having multiple options for what
we do. So it's not like for any one of these there's only going to be one game plan. There is going to be multiple for
every platform.

And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve. How are you?
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: It's been a while. So just to be clear, is the – the Oil & Gas guidance, what is that now
for the year? I'm not sure there was like an explicit comment on Oil & Gas. And then if you could just opine on the – a
little more clarity around what happened with the Aviation supply chain? There has definitely been a lot of noise from
maybe sub suppliers and stuff like that around that supply chain, so just curious as to how you guys are kind of fitting
into that puzzle?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We didn't change anything in our guidance on Oil & Gas, Steve. So I think what we said
is it's down 0% to 5%, probably closer to 5%. We evaluated scenarios beyond 5%. All those were considered in the
guidance we gave you at $1.10 and $1.20. We've got the team executing to a plan that supports the $1.10 to $1.20. As
Jeff talked about, he's incented the team and our targets internally on the higher end of that range, not the lower end of
that range so no change to anything we've shared with you in the two calls previous to this.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And then, I would say, Steve, the production is ramping in 2Q and getting back on schedule

Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Thanks, JoAnna, and good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: The first question – I guess first and only question is really on the order of priority on the
asset sales. Can you just discuss a little bit both on CLL and consumer? And I guess specifically as it relates to U.S.
versus international, how you're thinking about the order of priority because I would imagine that given your goal to
de-designate the non-bank SIFI I would imagine would be focused on the U.S. assets. So any color there would be
helpful.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah. So what Keith and the team are focused on first and foremost are those platforms
where we might be more concerned about the franchise value itself, where the people are a big component of the value
creation process. So he has prioritized the focus based on that first. You're correct, I would say the second order of
priority would be we think in the U.S., our ability to execute quickly and in scale is very favorable today and it is a big
part of the discussion around the SIFI status. So having said that, it's not as though we're not going to do anything
outside the U.S. We're going to be working the international platform in parallel here as well.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Hey, so Jeff, I think you're going to win the prize for most bullish CEO this quarter. The $1.20, I just
wanted to kind of divine what you mean by working towards the high end because right now consensus is close to
$1.10. So are you encouraged enough to raise our numbers and if so, do you see a path to 5% organic, or is it primarily
midpoint to low point but offset by margin? So any comments there would be helpful.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think Nigel, this is the exact same comment I made back in January that just centers where
the internal incentive plan sits, and the internal incentive plan sits towards the high end of the range and we were
transparent about this at year-end and we were transparent about it in January and I'll be transparent about it in April.
Again, I think the value of a portfolio is that you've got a series of businesses that are doing well, and you've got
markets that are still volatile out there, and we just want to see how that continues to evolve. Like I said earlier, like
Jeff said, we're pleased with where Oil & Gas finished in the first quarter but that market is extremely volatile right
now and we just want to see how we continue to progress, what happens in the marketplace, and let's see what happens.
There's plenty of chance to make other changes as the year goes through but let's see how we do quarter-by-quarter and
beyond that, look, I think we've got a good diversified set of businesses that are doing well in the industries they're in
and we need to see how the world continues to evolve.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Okay. A couple of announcements before we wrap up. Next Wednesday, we'll hold our Annual Shareholders Meeting
in Oklahoma City. On May 20, Jeff will present at EPG, and on June 16, we'll hold our Paris Air Show Investor
Meeting. And as always, we'll be available later today to take your questions.
Jeff?
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Great, Matt. Thanks. Thanks, everybody. We announced a lot last week on really positioning the company for the
future. We're excited about that strategic change, that strategic pivot. The underlying performance of the company, both
Industrial and GE Capital, is per our expectations for the year. We continue to make progress. We're pleased by the
execution of the team in the first quarter, and we look forward to the rest of the year. Thanks, Matt.
