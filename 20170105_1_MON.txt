MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings and welcome to the Monsanto Company first quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call and R&D
pipeline update. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow
the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Ms.
Meyer, you may begin.
Laura J. Meyer
Thanks, Christine, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, Chairman and CEO; Brett
Begemann, President and Chief Operating Officer; Pierre Courduroux, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer; and Dr. Robb Fraley, our Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me from the
Investor Relations team are Priyal Patel and Ben Kampelman.
Today we will provide our annual R&D pipeline update on this call, as led by Dr. Fraley, as well as an overview of our
first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast,
supporting slides, and the replay at monsanto.com.
We've provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer
to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both
of which are on our website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because
these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual
performance and results may vary – may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking

statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-K and in today's press
release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any
obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me review our first quarter results as shown on slide 4. As shown on our reconciliations, we delivered as
reported earnings per share of $0.07 in the first quarter, which included $0.19 of pending Bayer-related transaction
costs. On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $0.21 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior
year ongoing loss of $0.11, driven by the expected strong start to our business in South America, and improved
currency.
With that brief overview, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.
Hugh M. Grant
Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line.
As we move into the second quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to remain focused on two things, continuing to
deliver on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones and working closely with Bayer on the necessary
steps to close the deal, which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017. Let's begin with an update on the deal as
shown on slide 5.
First, we're pleased to see the strong shareowner support for the proposal to combine with Bayer with approximately
99% of the votes cast in support of the combination. With the vote behind us, our team is working with Bayer on the
required regulatory filings and continued key stakeholder outreach. The Hart-Scott-Rodino filings have been made in
the U.S. along with several filings in other jurisdictions, and we anticipate submission of the required filing in the E.U.
in the first calendar quarter of this year. We continue to expect the transaction to close by the end of 2017, and our
confidence stems from the fact that these are two different but highly complementary businesses with limited overlap.
Where those overlaps do exist, however, Bayer anticipates and is committed to undertake a certain level of divestitures
as required by the regulatory agencies. Also both Robb and I have been personally involved in extensive grower
outreach as well as discussions with key policymakers and politicians sharing our views on the innovation
enhancements that we envision from this combination.
Innovation is the foundation of the industrial logic for the combination with Bayer just as it was with the consolidation
that we led in the industry back in the late 1990s, and innovation creates jobs and it creates opportunities for both
consumers and for our growers. This deal takes what we've been doing for the last 15 years to a whole new level, with
St. Louis as the heartland for seeds and biotech research for the new company worldwide.
15 years ago we were spending roughly $550 million a year in R&D. This year we'll spend approximately $1.5 billion
in R&D, and we look forward to the combined levels of R&D that we anticipate investing and innovation for growers
through the combination with Bayer. Growers seek this innovation opportunity because they recognize that resources
are finite, demand is real, and productivity improvement is the key to their success.
The USDA demand figures have indicated that over the past four seasons, world demand for corn grew by over 4
billion bushels while soy demand in the same timeframe grew by over 2 billion bushels. The December WASDE
[World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates] report indicated continued strength, with corn demand for the
current marketing year growing by over 1.4 billion bushels and soy demand growing by over 500 million bushels. In
fact, as seen on slide 6, meeting that trend line demand on a relatively stable footprint over the next decade would
require a twofold increase in the rate of yield gain for corn and a fourfold increase for soybeans.
So the innovation that we expect to deliver with our leading technology platforms, as shown on slide 7, will be
necessary to increase productivity to meet this projected demand, and we expect the combination with Bayer to amplify
that rate of innovation.

It all starts with our industry-leading seed and trait technologies, which reach approximately 400 million acres today as
a result of our broad licensing approach, which Bayer has indicated that they will continue. This footprint serves as the
foundation for future germplasm upgrades, new trait technologies, seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with
Novozymes, and finally our unique and rapidly expanding Climate FieldView platform.
To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we continue to expand our capabilities in genome editing, including a
new agreement with the Broad Institute. Our desire to expand this strong innovation core also stems from the myriad of
game-changing opportunities that we see on the horizon. We're very clearly entering a new era in agriculture. Hundreds
of new entrants invested more than $4.5 billion of venture capital in agriculture in 2015, which is more than 10 times
the investment from just five short years ago. More players than ever are seeking to provide new technologies to
growers to enhance productivity both profitably and sustainably. This is for good reason. Demand requires it, and we
are pleased to see the investment to spur this needed innovation.
Our shared vision with Bayer is to harness this wave of innovation and more optimally integrate it into a format that's
usable and insightful to growers, primarily through our Climate FieldView platform. By pairing Bayer's exceptional
crop protection portfolio with our seeds and traits and Climate FieldView platforms, we expect farmers to benefit from
accelerated innovation, expanded geographic and crop offerings, and optimized integrated solutions from science-based
recommendations. An investment space that secures a sustainable food supply needs and deserves this improved rate of
innovation. So today Robb will expand on these examples as well as on our own pipeline update.
So we look forward to updating you on the status of the deal as we move through this year. Until then, we're committed
to operate as an independent company focused on delivering our plans for fiscal year 2017 as well as our key business
milestones. With growth in our Q1 results and outstanding demand for our new soybean technologies, we continue to
expect a return to earnings per share growth for the full year. As Pierre will elaborate, we're reconfirming our full-year
ongoing earnings per share and free cash flow guidance with a small increase in our as-reported earnings per share
outlook.
So with that brief summary, let me pass it to Brett to elaborate on our operational path to delivering 2017. Brett?
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone.
Let's begin our operational outlook for fiscal year 2017 with corn, as shown on slide 8, where we continue to expect
corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, genetic share gains, and acreage momentum in South America. In
the first quarter, we saw a greater than 25% increase in planted corn acres in Argentina and more than a 10% increase
in corn acres planted in Brazil. This was accompanied by double-digit price increases in corn germplasm in local
currency in both countries.
In the U.S., the early read on the order book supports our intention to grow genetic share yet again. We've priced the
majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly, with our new hybrids at a premium, maintaining our premium
pricing compared to our competition. Demand for year one hybrids remains exceptionally strong and we are now in a
sold-out position. Also, SmartStax remains a steady percent of our overall portfolio. In addition, we're prepared to
respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics, but we've not seen any unusual levels of discounting to
date.
In soybeans, we expect to reach several significant milestones in 2017, as shown on slide 9. We're off to a good start
and still plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro soybeans in South
America, as shown on slide 10. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. In Argentina, we've seen
continued progress toward maintaining a reliable value capture. Recent renewal of the government resolution that
enables a testing and invoicing protocol was positive, and we continue to work with the industry coalition to secure a
seed bill that encourages and rewards investment.

Continuing with soybeans on slide 11, we're well supplied for more than 15 million U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2
Xtend soybeans, and our order book reflects the overwhelming pent-up demand for this technology. With the EPA
approval for in-crop use of dicamba in hand, and as of this morning we've now already received nearly three-fourths of
the necessary state approvals for both soybeans and cotton, which covers the vast majority of the acres, and we expect
to have the rest before planting. We are conducting extensive training on the use of XtendiMax and the Roundup Ready
Xtend crop system, delivering multiple training opportunities and tools to provide customers with an excellent
experience with the technology.
Moving to our cotton business, we had a strong start in the first quarter with increased acres in Australia. And in the
U.S. we now expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton area to exceed 4 million acres, including a per acre trade
premium. Additionally, this season we will have an introductory release of Bollgard III XtendFlex cotton, with a
full-scale launch planned for 2018. This is the first cotton product ever to combine three modes of action for both insect
and weed control. Finally, we expect 2017 to be the third consecutive year of share growth in U.S. cotton, coming on
the heels of more than eight points of branded and licensed share growth in 2016.
In Ag Productivity, we're focused on the launch of XtendiMax herbicide with VaporGrip technology. In addition,
generic glyphosate prices have continued to trend favorably over the course of the last several months, and our strategy
to price just above generics with our glyphosate-based herbicides has already led to some small price increases in the
U.S. We also saw a nice uptick in glyphosate volumes in our first quarter. However, we did experience the expected
glyphosate pricing headwinds and anticipate those will continue into the second quarter as the current global pricing is
lower than the prior comparable period.
As a partial offset, we just recently signed an agreement to sell our Latitude wheat fungicide business for $140 million.
Subject to the closure, we expect to receive an EBIT benefit of approximately $85 million in this segment in the second
quarter. This sale is part of our continued efforts to focus and optimize our product portfolio and put the asset into the
hands of Mitsui, who has more potential to drive a greater level of value out of the asset.
And finally, Climate FieldView, as shown on slide 12, continues to see major advancements as the business and the
platform continues to evolve. We released four new product enhancements for 2017. And these upgrades, together with
outstanding demand for FieldView Plus and Drive, have us well down the path to our goal of 25 million paid acres.
Simultaneously, we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year and continue to grow
geographically with expansion expected in the U.S., Europe, Brazil and Canada this year and in addition to plans to
launch in Australia, Argentina and South Africa in the next few years.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?
Pierre C. Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone.
Let's start with a review of the first quarter. As expected, ongoing results came in better than the prior year on the
strength of our Southern Hemisphere business. Our soybean gross profit is up by approximately 50% in the first
quarter, with 6 points of gross margin improvement led by Intacta penetration and currency benefits. Corn gross profit
grew by more than 30% due primarily to double-digit price mix leap in local currency in both Brazil and Argentina and
from a strong growth in acres planted in both countries.
Finally, total operating spend decreased with reduced restructuring expense more than offsetting increases from the
pending Bayer transaction costs, currency and growth in commissions in South America.
Our Q1 free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion reflects strong U.S. cash prepayments and includes the payment of
the previously accrued PCB personal injury settlements.
Let's move ahead to our full-year outlook on side 13. On an as-reported basis and as shown in our reconciliations, we
expect our fiscal year 2017 EPS to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.45. These earnings are expected to translate into $1.4

billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows.
On an ongoing basis, our fiscal year 2017 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90,
reflecting the growth we expect for the year.
Despite the fact that the year-over-year change in currency rates was modestly favorable for us in the first quarter of
2017, we continue to assume that the change in rates will have a relatively neutral effect on a full-year basis, given the
recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several currencies.
Our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit is still expected to increase mid-single digits as a percent year over year,
with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%, driven by new trade penetration and anticipated
cost of goods sold reduction.
In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains and global germplasm price mix lift in local
currency that we expect to be flat to up low-single digits in terms of percentages. We expect global corn acres to be
roughly flat for the full fiscal year with declines in U.S. corn acreage, offset by the early increases in South America.
Shifting gears. Our Ag Productivity gross profit is now expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million,
reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides in the first half of the year, offset partially
by the benefit of licensing opportunity and expected higher volumes.
The adjustment to our gross profit outlook is simply reflecting the fact that the approximate $85 million benefit from
the sale of the Latitude business was ultimately recorded in other income for the segment as opposed to gross profit, as
originally anticipated.
Finally, we expect roughly $100 million of gross profit from strategic licensing deals towards the end of the fiscal year,
roughly split between the two segments of the business.
Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives remain on track, as shown on slide 14, and the estimated costs to deliver
those actions and initiatives is now down slightly to approximately $1 billion. We continue to see the opportunity to
deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings in operating expenses and cost of goods at the close of fiscal year
2017 as compared to fiscal year 2015.
However, overall operating expenses in fiscal year 2017, setting aside the pending Bayer transaction costs and
restructuring expenses, are expected to increase slightly, with inflation of the costs associated with the return to growth
of the business more than offsetting our savings. The expected tax rate for the year remains in the range of 25% to 28%.
If we narrow the view to our second quarter, we expect as-reported earnings per share and ongoing earnings per share
to be roughly $0.20 to $0.50 better than the prior year. Beyond the continued momentum in our corn and soybeans
businesses, the expected first half earnings improvements reflect the benefit from the sale of the Latitude business and
the absence of significant portion of the Argentine peso devaluation.
Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect roughly $0.40 less in EPS benefit from strategic deals versus
the prior year, plus a more challenging currency environment than what we experienced in the first quarter. However,
with a strong start in the first quarter and our continued focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, we
remain confident in our outlook for fiscal year 2017.
With that, I will now pass it to Robb to share the update on the pipeline. Robb?
Robert T. Fraley, PhD
Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, everyone.
So this update is something I look forward to every year. It's a chance to share an overview of the truly unparalleled
science that my team is bringing to farmers around the world. I believe our science and our pipeline are stronger than
ever. In fact, not only is this the fourth consecutive year of more than 20 pipeline advancements, but our advancement

class of fiscal year 2017 also brings a record 14 projects advancing to commercial launch.
As I think about what our teams have accomplished, the most notable highlights are summarized on slide 3 of the
pipeline update deck. What I think is just as impressive as the 28 advancements is the remarkable balance of the
advancement class. It showcases the depth and the breadth of the pipeline, and this marks the sixth straight year where
projects have advanced across all of our R&D platforms, whether it's breeding, biotech, biologicals, crop protection or
digital ag and climate.
Climate has made incredible progress this year, and the digital ag pipeline is now the most robust in the industry with
more than 35 projects in R&D, including six advancements to commercializations that are all part of the paid elements
of our platform. So, what does this all translate to? Basically, our core pipeline is expected to deliver up to $25 billion
in peak net sales with additional upside if we include our newer platforms like climate and biologicals.
And frankly, I believe the story gets even more exciting with Bayer. We truly see the opportunity to accelerate
innovation, optimize integrated solutions and expand offerings. And this translates to significant benefits to farmers.
And I'll bring this to life with a few examples later on.
But first, let's take a look at what our customers can expect from our leading hybrids and varieties shown on slide 4.
Starting with corn, DEKALB continues to deliver the industry's best performance, marked by 11 straight years of
outperforming competitive products. And the margin is significant, as we see a consistent 7 to 10 bushel per acre
average yield advantage. Soybeans have outperformed for the seventh consecutive year with a greater than two bushel
per acre average yield advantage, and cotton continues this trend as well.
Deltapine cotton is again outperforming the competition for the seventh consecutive year. So across the board, our
breeding engine is delivering results that our customers can count on. That industry-leading germplasm performance is
being protected by next-generation versions of insect and weed control traits.
Moving to slide 5, the story here is really around delivering wave after wave of upgrades for corn from additional
modes of action to expand the spectrum for insect and weed control. We have significant insect control products
coming in SmartStax PRO as well as Trecepta corn.
And in weed control, our third-generation product in Phase 4 offers tolerance to glyphosate, dicamba, and glufosinate
to offer growers maximum flexibility in applying the herbicides that make the most sense for their operations. Longer
term, the fourth-generation insect and weed control traits get even better, and this is really remarkable progress towards
developing new products for farmers.
Moving to soybeans on slide 6, we have the opportunity to extend our leadership with insect and weed control
solutions. There's a good reason why we expect Intacta to land on between 45 million and 55 million acres in South
America this year. The technology really works well, and the next-generation technology is going to work even better.
It has multiple modes of action that not only improve the durability of the platform, but also expand the insect spectrum
across the broader range of tests that growers care about, and that product is already in Phase 4 along with the third
generation of weed control. Again, much like in corn, the next-generation insect and weed control traits further enhance
durability and spectrum, providing new solutions for growers.
Let's now move from the technologies that have been core to our strategy for years to ones that I think could be
transformational in the years ahead. There's a huge opportunity with genome editing, and I've talked recently about the
number of deals that we've inked in this space. We're now using these tools to develop the next generation of products
that will populate our pipeline in coming years. The deal with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard that Hugh
referenced is an advancement that has the potential to enable more complex gene edits at an even greater efficiency,
and that adds to our growing portfolio of capabilities. So with the tools we have at our disposal, we believe we've
established a path for developing and commercializing crop improvements based on genome editing.
Our story in biologicals just continues to get better based on our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, as shown on slide 7.
We're especially excited about Acceleron B-300 SAT and think it could have a fit on more than 90 million acres, and
farmers are going to get their first look at this product this year.

Further, we had another year of outstanding results for our Nemastrike technology, with approximately two bushels of
yield advantage demonstrated in soybeans and seven bushels in corn, and we remain on track for a 2018 launch of this
blockbuster nematode-control product.
Let me focus now for a few minutes on how the pending combination with Bayer would further accelerate our pipeline
and innovation in agriculture as shown on slide 8. I've talked a lot about the benefits that this combination will bring.
And I think the bottom line is this deal is an innovation catalyst, and we expect it to benefit farmers by optimizing and
expanding R&D investment and allowing us to really up our game. It will accelerate the pace of scientific innovation
and our ability to provide integrated seed, trait, and chemistry solutions. And finally, it will allow us to expand our
technology platforms into new crops like wheat and geographies like Asia and Africa.
The combination with Bayer is transformative. It's about putting a complementary pro forma R&D budget of
approximately $2.7 billion together to solve the challenges that farmers face and that our industry and society has an
obligation to meet.
Let's start with an important example of accelerating innovation based on combining the highly complementary
portfolios from Bayer and Monsanto on slide 9. Today, herbicide tolerance is a cornerstone consideration for farmers
making seed purchase decisions across a number of crops. The R&D challenges that sequential development of first,
the herbicide, and then the accompanying biotech trait takes a long time.
So the opportunity lies in developing both trait and chemistry on parallel paths, and doing so can shave years off the
delivery timelines of a new herbicide tolerant system, and the accelerated earnings can be invested into additional areas
of R&D. We're pursuing this route with PPO tolerance in our agreement with Sumitomo today, and we've got the
opportunity to do even more with Bayer's next-generation herbicide candidates.
A second example on how the combination with Bayer enables better integrated solutions for farmers is shown on slide
10. Giving farmers information to select the best combination of seed, trait and crop inputs enables them to make better
planting decisions to drive productivity, profitability and sustainability on each field.
For example, by knowing exactly which portions of a field need immediate attention, being able to precisely identify
the exact pathogen and then quickly determine which fungicide is optimal can help mitigate developing crop disease
problems. The detailed knowledge of crop genetics, agronomic practices and local weather, combined with climate
imagery, full season sensor data and machine learning algorithms to identify specific diseases, can alert and guide
farmers to make faster and more informed decisions to protect yields from fungal diseases. So this is where the future
of agriculture is heading, and these examples are just some of the possibilities that we see.
So in summary, on slide 11, it's been another terrific year for the team. We've made a phenomenal R&D progress that is
balanced across the portfolio. In breeding, we're maintaining the performance advantage that our customers have come
to expect. In biotechnology, the story is really about protecting the platforms with newer and better next-generation
seed, next-generation insect and weed control traits. And our new innovation platforms are developing cutting-edge
products like B-300 SAT and Nemastrike technology, along with the six new products we've launched in our Climate
FieldView platform.
Our strategy has been focused on optimally integrating these leading platforms, and the combination with Bayer will
allow our two companies to accelerate the pace of innovation and bring new products to farmers faster through our
shared vision.
So with that, I'll pass it on to Laura for Q&A.

Christine, I think we're ready to take questions from the line.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Vincent S. Andrews>: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Robb, maybe a question for you. The USDA in
recent years has become – from a regulatory perspective, things seem to have taken longer. And obviously, there's a
change in the administration coming. So I'm just wondering if you have any view on whether some of the extensions in
the regulatory process – at least, from a USDA perspective, how transitory those could be as we head into the new
administration and whether regulatory lead times might mean revert back to where they were previously?
<A - Robert T. Fraley, PhD>: Thanks and Happy New Year. I would say that, from a USDA perspective, I would
actually give credit to the administration that Secretary Vilsack has in the last several years sped up the USDA part of
the process. Obviously, we're delighted to have gotten our approval for Roundup Ready Xtend through the EPA, but
that was a six- or seven-year process.
And I like the conversation that's going on about improving and streamlining the regulatory process, not only here in
the U.S. but I think around the world and that would certainly be a tailwind going into future years.

Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Don Carson>: Yes. Thanks. Hugh, a question on the earnings growth outlook post 2017. I mean, your guidance
this year implies a return to mid-single digit earnings growth. I know both at the Whistle Stop and in some recently
disclosed long-range plan progressions you've talked about an acceleration post 2017 to the mid-teens. So I'm
wondering, is that still the case? And is the driver there really the internal innovation, as highlighted by Robb's pipeline
review, or are you banking on an improvement in agricultural fundamentals?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Don, thanks for your question. I'll maybe ask Pierre too to say a few words as it relates to our
somewhat early projections. But quite frankly, we are more focused on delivering in 2017 than looking out beyond that
at the moment. But the kicker when you get beyond 2017 is more based on innovation and unlocking growth in our soy
and corn platforms more than the anticipation of rebound in the ag economy.
But, Pierre, anything that you would add from a planning on an assumptions point of view?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: No, I think the key message, Hugh, is – or Don, is we're not changing our views
regarding the future compared to what we shared at Whistle Stop. So as Hugh was mentioning, although we are
actually still very bullish about the future of agriculture and based on the demand and the demand growth that
continues to happen in both corn and soybeans, I mean, the key growth drivers, as we shared at Whistle Stop, are based
on innovation and we see that in our first quarter with the success of Intacta. But our soybean technologies ramping up
in the next two years are going to be very important.
And from a corn perspective, we strongly believe that there is definitely room for the germplasm improvements to
continue to see growth into the segment. So no changes, Don, compared to what we shared at Whistle Stop.
<Q - Don Carson>: Thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: In Latin America, you had double-digit pricing growth in the quarter. Maybe this was driven by
the weaker real a year or two years ago, but the real has strengthened now. And does that mean that you lose some of
this pricing power going forward?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Brett, you've recently been there. I think, P.J., the headline on this is we're delighted with the
fact that we could compensate with double-digit price increases in Brazil and in Argentina. You will see some of that
smoothing. But, Brett, maybe a little bit more color?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Thank you, P.J., and good morning. I think it's a couple of things. Definitely, the change in
the currency relationship created part of the opportunity to reach for some of the pricing improvements around double
digits. And by all means, even double-digit did not bring back everything that we lost from the past with the currencies.
So there is potential opportunity as we continue to look to the future there.
At the same time, what I think is just or more important is the continued performance of our products down there.
Intacta continues to do incredibly well. As Robb talked about in his update, we have the son of Intacta right behind that.
So we're looking before the turn of the decade of launching the second generation of Intacta. Our corn portfolio
continues to do extremely well down there. We have those next generations of insect control coming there and then,
germplasm performance, as Pierre mentioned.
So all of those things combined set up nicely to be able to continue to look into the future and see incremental value as
we deliver incremental value to the farmer. Currency being a piece of that, but also the performance of the products.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: And secondly, keeping with R&D theme, a question for Robb. Robb, what do you think the
CRISPR technology will do for you in terms of genetic gains? And when do you see commercial products out of
CRISPR? Thank you.
<A - Robert T. Fraley, PhD>: Sure, thanks, and it's a great question, P.J. So maybe just a little bit of background on
the gene editing commentary. So I think, first of all, as you recognized, there's a variety of gene editing tools. There's
protein-based, there's nucleic acid-based and, just in the last few weeks, there's been a couple of publications on two
brand new gene editing systems that have been discovered. In any case, what these tools allow you to do is to go in and
precisely change basically any base pair or any gene in a crop. And so they're a very powerful tool for making precise
changes.
I think the other thing that's important to highlight is you still need a world-class breeding engine, a testing network in
order to identify and evaluate the best combinations. And those gene editing traits are going to be introduced into corn
and soybean and cotton, stacked with the biotech traits that are defining the marketplace today. So we see them very
complementary to the breeding and trait engines that we have developed, and I think they will allow us to further
accelerate that rate of gain.
And I think the fact that we've now concluded licensing agreements with some of the major players and innovative
technologies puts us in a great position to take advantage of these products. Some of the first gene editing products and
some of the smaller crops are working their way through the regulatory system. As I indicated in my comments, we're
now fully utilizing these tools. And certainly, by the beginning or middle of the next decade, we will see these gene
editing products work their way into the marketplace. Really an exciting technology, and I think we've created a strong
position moving forward into this space.

Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: When you generally reconcile what Brett's team is asking for from customers in the
field versus Robb's R&D initiatives for his team, how do you generally feel your overall long-term strategy is paired
and also versus your peers? And then also what were the one to two most pleasant surprises in terms of R&D
advancements over the last 12 months? And are there even maybe one to two areas which you believe will require
additional focus over the next 12 months? Thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: So, Chris, thank you. I'll maybe ask Robb to cover the second piece on pleasant surprises. It's
always nice to talk about pleasant surprises at the start of a new year.
In terms of the balance between what our customers are asking for and what R&D is producing, you never get complete
certainty on that, but I think over time we've done really well in two areas. One is anticipating what growers need.
Robb made the point that Xtend took seven years to get through the EPA. And that's been a frustration where the limits
haven't been great science. The limits have been the regulatory pace, and we sincerely hope that that's going to change.
And then I think the other great thing that we've been successful and in this balance that you refer to, Chris, is having
second, third, and then sometimes fourth-generation products sequentially developed, so that as we are growing acres
and meeting demand, we've got the next product in development and ready to move through. So I would say those are
probably two of the certainty elements but, Robb, pleasant surprises?
<A - Robert T. Fraley, PhD>: I think the only thing I'd add, Hugh, to the comment that you made in terms of how do
we make those decisions and trade-offs, I think one of the things that's always been a hallmark of our portfolio process
is that from day one we integrate our R&D and our commercial thinking together, and so we're trying to bring all of
this together to make the right solutions happen for farmers.
Chris, I think your core question on what have been the pleasant surprises, maybe the hardest question I get this
morning because we've had some terrific results across the platform. You saw the breeding results; they're great. And
with the genome-wide sequencing, with the expansion of our testing facilities that we'll have in the southern U.S., to do
more of that work in the greenhouse, we expect to see breeding gains accelerate.
We're in a privileged position with building on the fourth and fifth generation of traits. If you had a chance to go
through our tour this summer, we've discovered more new insect control genes in the last year than the industry has
discovered in its entire history. So that's a great surprise.
I flagged the progress in Climate. To have now 35 projects in their pipeline, they're hitting on all cylinders. And when
you go to our new innovations area, we're probably talking about being able to launch the largest microbial product
ever with B-300 SAT. The gene editing tools have really matured quickly in our hands, and I think the Nemastrike
product is going to be a blockbuster product in our portfolio. So it's hard to pick favorites. There's been some really
exciting progress this year.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Great detail, thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you, Chris.

<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Brett, looking at pricing this coming season, what's your level of confidence that what
happened last year in terms of the discounting will not reoccur this growing season?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Looking specifically at the Northern Hemisphere and narrowing it down to the U.S., given
that we're already in the early days of January, I feel somewhat better about that because it's limited opportunity at this
point in time. We're prepared. We're watching every day to make sure that we maintain our position in the marketplace.
But as the days and weeks go by here, the risk of that deteriorates pretty rapidly. Most farmers are well through their
path of that decision-making and what they intend to do and making those final purchase decisions, so the opportunity
to influence that becomes more limited, and I think the industry understands that.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christopher Evans>: Good morning. This is Chris Evans on for Bob.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher Evans>: Again, we're seeing headwinds from glyphosate pricing. Could you describe maybe when
that could find a bottom given that I think in previous quarters you mentioned that some of these exporters might be
operating near breakeven?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I'll maybe ask Brett just to put a bit of color on timing. I mean the good news, Chris, is we've
seen an uptick on Chinese pricing as we referred to in our prepared remarks, and we made a small move in the U.S.
But, Brett, if you look at the season coming and the spring through early summer timeframe, maybe just a little bit of
color on how price could play out in that timeframe?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Sure, Hugh, and good morning. I think the key thing about as we look at the first quarter,
what transpired in the first quarter with glyphosate's very consistent with what we expected. We expected our pricing to
be less than the comparable period to last year. That being said, we do see really positive indicators, as Hugh noted,
with the asset prices starting to move in China in the right trend line or a positive trend line; we're seeing that starting to
show up in the generics. That's what gave us the opportunity to make the small adjustment in our price to the positive
side in the U.S.
We continue to watch the rest of the markets around the world and we'll continue to look for those opportunities, and
my anticipation at this point is we'll continue to move in that direction for the reason that you noted; it's not been an
exciting business for many of them. The other point that I would make is not only did we see some improvement in that
area, our volumes were really strong in the first quarter in our branded business. So I feel really good about our position
in the marketplace and how we're priced, and the trend lines are favorable at this point.
<Q - Christopher Evans>: Thanks, everyone.

<Q - Steve Byrne>: Yes, thank you. I'm just wondering whether you think you will likely commercialize Xtend
soybeans down in Argentina if that country promulgates a seed law as currently drafted that has some limits on royalty
payments to three years or fewer. Is that commercially viable for you?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: We've been – so first of all, we're really pleased to see progress in Xtend, and hope to see it
spread out across Brazil and Argentina. But we've been watching the development of this very, very closely. I mean,
Brett, maybe a little bit of color on our stance and the position that we've taken there?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Sure, and good morning, Steve. I think it's really important when we think about Argentina
that we step back a bit and look at – put a little context around it. We've been at this for some time now, working with
the farmers and the government to get a system in place; and we had one but that got disrupted. But the good news was
last summer, in about June, there was a resolution that put it back in place where we can have mandatory testing as well
as invoicing. That resolution has been extended, so that gives us an opportunity for the next growing season, not just
this one but as we think about the next one.
The coalition is working extensively with the government to build a new seed law. The previous seed law that you
referenced with the three-year for the industry is a non-starter. I mean, three years compared to the rest of the world
with the teens years of intellectual property protection is a non-starter. So that would not encourage us to bring any
additional technology to Argentina.
At the same time there is receptivity within the government and in conversations to look for a seed law that addresses
their concerns and the industry's concerns and get to a place where it encourages investment in agriculture, and to do
that you need to reward those that are driving innovation. So we're prepared to continue to drive the innovation, as
Robb noted, in our soybean portfolio; most of those products have a great fit in Argentina. But until we see an
improved situation and have more confidence around the value, we'll stick with just working with Intacta right now and
then we'll look to others as the situation evolves.
<A - Laura J. Meyer>: Christine, this is Laura. We have time for questions from one more.

Our final question will come from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John Roberts>: Thank you. With ChemChina buying Syngenta and DuPont Pioneer working more closely now
with Origin Agritech, can you give us an update on your relationship with Sinochem and what your thoughts are on
China?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah. John, thanks for the question. So we've had a relationship with Sinochem for a long
time. It's a good relationship; it's a strong one. We've been working jointly on a corn business in China. So we see an
opportunity in China; I think it's long-term, I think it's going to take a while and we anticipate that the first biotech traits
that have commercialized in China are probably going to be Chinese. So it's a patient game. I don't think that it's some
– one of the early questions was growth beyond 2017 and the acceleration and growth beyond 2017. We don't see
China being a major contributor to that in the next two, three, four years. It's going to take a lot longer I think.
<Q - John Roberts>: All right, thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you very much.

So to Laura's point, I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to join us this morning, and for your support. Going
