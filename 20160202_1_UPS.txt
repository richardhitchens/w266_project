Good morning and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our
CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron
Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.
Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are
forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the
company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2014 Form 10-K
and 2015 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS investor relations website and from the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
Before we begin, I would like to make you aware of a few adjusting entries that impact our reported results. UPS
recorded a non-cash after tax mark-to-market pension charge of $79 million. The charge resulted from lower asset
returns that were partially offset by higher discount rates. Investment returns on planned assets were negatively affected
by the overall market performance. The impact of the shortfall was mostly offset by increased interest rates used to
calculate the planned discount rate.
In the prior year period, the company reported a non-cash, after-tax charge of $692 million. The charge related to
pension mark-to-market was $670 million and the amount of the healthcare liability transfer was $22 million. More
details on mark-to-market accounting are available in the presentation that is on the IR website. Excluding the impact
of these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2015 were $1.57 and GAAP earnings per
share were $1.48, while fourth quarter 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.25 and GAAP earnings per
share were $0.49.
In our remarks today, all quarterly and full-year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition,
we will discuss UPS's free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call, along with
the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results are available on the UPS investor relations website. And just a
reminder, as on previous calls, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Now, I will turn the call over to David.
David P. Abney
Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Our results make it quite a good morning here at UPS. I'm pleased to report a
very positive fourth quarter, capping our strong full year performance. A year ago, we laid out a plan for successful
peak 2015. This year, through the extraordinary efforts of UPS's around the globe, we delivered the high quality service
that customers deserve and the financial discipline that shareowners expect. This was the fourth consecutive quarter
that UPS exceeded financial expectations and this quarter we expanded margins and produced double digit operating
profit growth in all three business segments.
That's worth repeating. All three segments demonstrated excellent operating profit growth. In fact, the International
segment achieved its best quarterly and full year results ever, exceeding $2 billion in annual operating profit. UPS
ended 2015 with record fourth quarter earnings per share and the highest operating profit ever reported. Full year 2015
diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $5.43, an all-time high.
Although the industrial side of the economy has slowed, the explosive growth of ecommerce continues to create great
opportunity. I want to spend some time discussing how we capitalized on our peak season opportunity by managing the
challenges it creates. I can sum it up in three words: collaboration, control, commitment.
Expanded collaboration with customers combined with key investments were central to our success. We worked
together with a shared interest in fully utilizing UPS network capacity, while simultaneously maintaining excellent
service. UPS implemented certain pricing controls and maintained disciplined operating plans to ensure our peak

package volume did not jeopardize the overall integrity of the network and could be delivered on time.
For example, we optimized available capacity during the weekend prior to Christmas and collaborated with customers
to tender shipments ahead of the original schedule. This moved our peak day up to December 21 and smoothed volume
for the rest of the week, ensuring our customers' packages reached their customers' doorsteps before Christmas. This
year, our customers worked more closely with us than ever, and I want to thank them for making adjustments in being
flexible. Together, we delivered a successful peak season. Again, working closely with our customers, we delivered a
successful peak season.
Turning to control. Our actions to tighten dispatch, reduce special sorts, and implement just-in-time hiring resulted in
significant cost benefits for UPS as we exercised more precise control over the network. We also expanded capacity,
opened more than 8,000 UPS Access Points in the U.S., and completed several automation projects across the network.
These investments provide year round benefits. In fact, our automated air facilities were essential in servicing nearly
13% growth in U.S. Domestic air volume during the quarter.
The flexibility of our integrated network also gave us the control needed to seamlessly move volume between air, rail
and ground to maintain excellent on-time service. This year, we again implemented a management process called the
control tower in the U.S. and expanded it to Canada and Europe. We handled customers' unplanned volume surges by
efficiently utilizing available UPS network capacity. Our goal was to find a solution that worked for our customers and
UPS. Working together, we were able to service more than 90% of these last-minute requests.
Another aspect of control is managing outside transportation cost, which spikes dramatically during this time of year.
Our recent acquisition of Coyote Logistics helped manage this expense. They played an expanded role this peak season
and provided truckload brokerage service for UPS and its customers. Coyote's synergies remain on plan.
The final C is commitment, exemplified by the actions of our employees to deliver on-time service during a period
when our volume nearly doubles. There are numerous examples of UPSers going the extra mile every day for our
customers and they, again, demonstrated that commitment this peak season. I want to take a moment to say thank you
to all the UPSers around the world whose enthusiasm and extraordinary efforts during the holiday season produced
these great results. I am proud of their determination, dedication, and hard work.
While peak season 2015 helped drive strong fourth quarter results, we've turned our attention to 2016. Our business is
more diverse than retail in peak season. Customers continue to choose UPS because of our broad portfolio of solutions
across many industries, like healthcare, aerospace, high tech, and manufacturing. We will continue to capitalize on
opportunities within these market segments by further expanding our network, improving operational efficiency, and
focusing on high growth in adjacent markets.
Looking at the global economy, conditions remain uncertain, with the first half of 2016 continuing the mixed economic
trends from the last half of 2015. Across Europe and Asia, GDP growth was modest in 2015, however, slight
improvements are expected this year. At the same time, we continue to see challenges in emerging markets in 2016.
Global macroeconomic conditions reinforced the need for nations to continue making progress on free trade
agreements such as TPP and TTIP. While the U.S. GDP growth outlook is muted for first half of 2016, it is expected to
gain strength in the second half. Further, the U.S. remains dependent on a consumer-based economy for growth, while
industrial manufacturing continues to be held down by a strong dollar and lower global demand.
Through this uncertain backdrop, UPS will continue to implement our investment in growth strategies in 2016. Our
strong execution of these strategies will enable UPS to continue to create excellent shareowner value. Now Richard will
give you more details.

Thanks, David, it's good to be with you this morning and report on an outstanding fourth quarter. All three segments
performed better than expected. They achieved solid results by focusing on revenue management and operational

execution. These efforts expanded operating margins and increased shareowner value.
Total fourth quarter revenue was up slightly to $16.1 billion. On a currency neutral basis, it was up 2.4%. Changes to
currency and lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue by more than $600 million. Overall, UPS produced fourth quarter
earnings per share for 2015 of $1.57, up 26% from last year. Full year 2015 earnings per share were $5.43, a 14%
increase over 2014. These results included discrete tax credits of about $0.07 for the quarter, and $0.10 for the year.
Excluding these on an annual basis, earnings per share grew more than 12%.
Now, turning to details within the business segments, in the U.S., we had a great quarter. Revenue was up 2.6% to
$10.3 billion. Lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue growth by about 250 basis points. Average daily volume
increased 2.4%, led by Deferred Air products up 15% and Next Day Air up 10%. Clearly, UPS customers are choosing
the value of our air products to meet their customers' expectations.
Both business and residential deliveries grew in the quarter with B2C outpacing B2B 2 to 1. E-commerce continues to
drive higher residential shipments. In fact, in December, more than 60% of our deliveries were to consumers.
Revenue per package increased slightly, as strong base rates and product mix improvements were somewhat offset by
lower fuel surcharges and changing customer mix. Operating profit jumped 18% to more than $1.3 billion and margin
expanded 170 basis points to 13.1%.
Solid execution of the peak operating plan and our network investments led to productivity gains. Average daily direct
labor hours declined about 1%, while package deliveries increased 2.4%. Some of the best results we've produced. The
growth of ecommerce continues to increase delivery stops in our network. During the fourth quarter, delivery stops
increased 5.1%. That's more than twice as fast as our volume growth.
Technology investments such as ORION are enabling us to reduce the cost of residential stops. As a result, we held
package delivery miles flat and reduced cost per piece. These results demonstrate our ability to adapt. We're bending
the cost curve and the U.S. team is delivering high quality service while improving efficiency and cost.
Looking now at the International segment, we had a record setting quarter and year, achieving a 16% improvement in
our fourth quarter operating profit to $624 million, delivering greater than 10% profit growth every quarter in 2015.
Our results are driven by two efforts. First, rate actions that began late in 2015 resulted in losing some low yielding
accounts, predominantly affecting the International Domestic volume; and second, network management improvements
continue to contribute to bottom line results as we modified International block hours to match volume and trade lane
demand.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion. Base rates increased across all regions, although they were offset by
about a 350 basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges. Total export shipment growth slowed, reflecting the execution
of previously mentioned pricing initiatives, along with varying market growth rates around the world. Imports from
Europe into the U.S. were strong for the fourth consecutive quarter, aided in part by the appreciating U.S. dollar. The
International business continues to demonstrate the ability to adjust in an unsteady economic environment.
Turning to the Supply Chain & Freight group, operating profits grew more than 11%, with an expanded operating
margin. Overall revenue growth increased 6% with the addition of Coyote; however, organic revenue growth declined
due to two factors: First, ongoing weakness in both forwarding and U.S. LTL markets and secondly, the continuation of
our targeted revenue management actions.
Both the forwarding and UPS freight units are executing initiatives that are driving change into customer mix to
improve profitability. The forwarding unit improved operating margins as the group held firm with rates, achieving
their highest buy/sell rate spread in the last few years. In UPS freight, LTL revenue per hundredweight improved 2.1%,
with a drag of about 550 basis points from lower fuel surcharges. However, market conditions continue to challenge
UPS freight as they saw tonnage decline about 12%. The Distribution unit saw double digit revenue growth from
targeted industries: healthcare and aerospace, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe.

Now let's turn to our cash flow. Throughout 2015, UPS continued to generate healthy free cash flow, producing over $5
billion after $2.4 billion in capital investments. Once again, we returned more than 100% of net income to shareowners
as UPS purchased 27 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion and paid out another $2.5 billion in dividends, up
9% per share over last year.
Looking at our tax rate, as previously mentioned during the quarter, UPS resolved a few outstanding tax items.
Together these resulted in $63 million of discrete credits, or about $0.07 per share. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to
be 35.25%.
Now, I'll cover the rest of our guidance. We expect 2016 to be another good year at UPS. Revenue should increase
between 6% and 8%. Looking more closely at the segments, in the U.S., the Domestic segment average daily volume
should increase about 2% to 4%, driving revenue up 4% to 6%. Operating margin is forecasted to expand and operating
profit should grow 5% to 9%.
In the International business, shipments per day are projected to increase 2% to 4%. Growth rates will be held down
during the first half of the year, due to the revenue management actions we discussed earlier.
We anticipate a drag of about 150 basis points from non-hedge currencies and lower fuel surcharges. As a result,
revenue will grow at a similar pace as volume. Operating profit is expected to be up 8% to 12%, with some margin
expansion. In the Supply Chain & Freight segment, revenue should be up 15% to 20% with Coyote added for the full
year. The segment's organic revenue growth is projected between 3% and 5%.
Operating profit growth is forecasted between 6% and 10%; however, first quarter growth will likely be down about
8% to 12% from last year due to the continued softness in the LTL, freight brokerage, and freight forwarding markets.
As a reminder, the West Coast port strike provided some benefits in 2015.
Operating margin for the Supply Chain & Freight segment should be around 7%. For the total company, we expect our
2016 operating profit distribution by quarter to be very similar to 2015. From a cash flow perspective, investment in the
business remains our first priority, with CapEx expected to be about 4.5% of revenue, or $2.8 billion. Next, we remain
committed to paying a strong dividend. Finally, we have about $2.7 billion in share repurchases planned. As we
mentioned in the past, we will continue to follow this framework and make necessary adjustments if new opportunities
arise.
Overall, we expect 2016 to be a solid year for UPS. We will continue to execute on our investments as planned, and the
network improvements we are making are producing financial benefits. As a result, we are projecting diluted earnings
per share to increase within a range of $5.70 to $5.90, a growth rate of 5% to 9% and excluding the 2015 tax credits,
our growth rate is 7% to 11%.
In closing, despite the unsteady economic climate, we are well-positioned to make significant progress again in 2016.
Thank you for your attention. I will ask the operator to open the lines so we can take your questions.

Our first question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yes, good morning and congratulations on the strong results and the special peak season.
Let's see I wanted to – I guess it's one question but it's really focused on your volumes within fourth quarter in
Domestic Package. I know you've had a spread of strong year volumes driven by e-commerce but it seems that spread
versus Ground widened out. I was wondering if you could give a sense of what were some of the key drivers of the
Domestic Package volume and that spread in fourth quarter, what was B2B like in Ground, what was the impact of
your controls to have a peak, was that an impact on the softer ground and was there weakness of any kind, what were

some of the key drivers within that Domestic volume? Thank you.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Hey, Tom, this is Alan. Yes, certainly it was a solid peak season. We delivered more than
612 million packages over the peak period. It's the most in the company history, up about 7%. And as you said, the air
volume was well above our expectations in the quarter, with the Deferred growing almost 15% and Next Day at 10%.
The Ground volume, yes, was a little bit below our estimates. Certainly the soft industrial production that David
mentioned and certainly some of the revenue management action on some of the low yielding accounts earlier in the
year and for peak had some impact. Our B2B growth was positive, if you remember last quarter, it went negative, but it
rebounded last quarter and as Rich mentioned our resi grew at about a 2 to 1 ratio to the commercial. Thanks.
<A - David P. Abney>: Hey, Tom, this is David. When it comes to volume, I think it's worth taking the time to look at
over the two years, the stacked volume for the fourth quarter and if you compare 2013 to 2015, you will see that our
total volume was up 9%, and our Ground volume was up 7.6%. So when you look at it over a two-year period, what
you see is that 2014 had a tremendous increase in Ground and then we added to that, but the two-year stack gives a
pretty good picture of where we've been in the last couple of years. Okay?
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks, good morning guys. So one quick housekeeping question and then one broader
question. Is there anything in the fourth quarter or the guidance related to this spot rate pension accounting that a lot of
companies are doing?
And then just bigger questions on the volume growth outlook. So forecasting and acceleration volume growth, and I
think you kind of said it will be more back-end loaded, should we think about the – I guess what gives you confidence
in that re-acceleration in volume growth in the back half of the year? And should we expect the earnings growth then to
also be back-end loaded?
<A - Joe Wilkins>: This is Joe. Just before we get started, we're just going to do one question because we've got a lot
of people, but we'll take this dual part question now, but Richard, why don't you.
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Sure. Scott, so the question you asked around pension is that we currently use a
mark-to-market. It's on the deck presentation on our website that explains the mark-to-market and we use a quarter
approach for that. And I think that goes through the process and we've done that each year, the last few years whenever
we make an adjustment. This year, it was a much smaller adjustment and I think once you go through that, if there are
questions we can handle that appropriately.
In terms of the volume and the guidance on volume, we did have solid top line growth this year. In fact, it was 5%
growth this year and we really see 2016 as a continuation of what we did in 2015. It does have some cycles through the
quarters, obviously. We talked about each quarter kind of looking similar to the previous year, and so when you think
about how our volume grows our revenue and our profits, I would point you back to that. But we feel real good about
where we're at. We think it's not just what's happening outside externally in the macro environment, it's also all the
initiatives and the things that we're doing inside UPS right now that are gaining traction and are actually the reasons
that the results were so good for the fourth quarter and for all of 2015.
<A - David P. Abney>: And on the volume, just a little bit more on that. In 2015, we said all along, due to peak costs
and to other costs that we were going to have to focus on yield, which we did. And for 2016, we just want to make sure
that we have the right balance and I am absolutely confident that the team will, between maintaining yield and
increasing our volume. So with the initiatives that we have, I feel comfortable that we're going to maintain the air
volumes the way they are and feel like we will improve the Ground volumes.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Thank you, guys.

<Q - Kevin Wallance Sterling>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on a nice quarter and
outlook in a challenging environment. My wife thanks you for a successful peak season. Real quick on ORION, how
much more do you have to implement across your driver network and is it possible to quantify the cost savings in Q4
from ORION?
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Good morning, Kevin, it's Myron.
<Q - Kevin Wallance Sterling>: Hi Myron.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: During the year we increased the deployment for ORION from 45% in 2014 up to 70% by

extremely pleased with the results that we're getting today

Operator
The next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I was curious a little bit just about
the Coyote acquisition, in terms of how that's progressing so far and where are you seeing the most benefits in terms of
how you utilize that in terms of moving some of your own package freight throughout the network in the fourth quarter.
And, also too in terms of just kind of seeing that business organically in terms of still working with their kind of core
customer base.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, Nate, this is Alan. Coyote certainly performed well during peak and we're going to
continue to expand that role. They were certainly one of the difference makers. They're playing a crucial role in our
ability to manage our outside transportation services and cost certainly year round but very integral during the peak
season. So they provided the flexible capacity to meet the demand surges and they also helped us to improve our
capacity utilization. On an overall basis, as David said in his opening comments, the synergies are on track. I would
also say that we are getting some good purchase transportation procurement benefits and those are exceeding our
expectations. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. And I echo a great job through the peak season. Great to see.
But, I think you mentioned that you turned away 3% of volumes, given the control tower. I just want to understand
some of the economic commentary as you look ahead to your outlook. Ground volumes remain up pretty slight. So, are
you still seeing a trade up to Next Day Air and Deferred, just given the strength there, or is this just an economic
difference of ecommerce versus what you are seeing on the ground side?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, first of all, we didn't turn away 3% of our volume – 3% of volume with the control
tower. The control tower was an absolute success this year from both a customer and a UPS perspective, and I'd also
say from an ecommerce retail and also a year-round customer perspective, all the other industry segments that we
serve. So, a real success. And the primary goal there was to optimize the network capacity and find solutions that

worked for our customers and UPS and, in fact, between Cyber Week and Super Weekend, we were able to
accommodate all the customer requests and during those final few days, there was a few that we needed to turn down,
but even then, some of those were some dual source customers who chose not to make longer term business
commitments to UPS. So, we thought it was a resounding success. We had a very disciplined approach to the volume,
the capacity, and managing the yields to produce the excellent fourth quarter that we had.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great. I'm sorry, and the trade up down commentary?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, I think the air products are resonating really well with our customers, and certainly,
the just in time nature. So our – our Deferred was up 14%, and the Next Day Air Overnight products, mainly the Saver
was up about 10%. And I think customers are choosing the services that they need based on the time in transit that they
are looking for.

<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Thanks, good morning. Jim, maybe this question is for you. I'd be curious on your perspective
on business inventories generally from customers. There's been a lot of discussion on some destocking, whether that
has taken place in the fourth quarter. I'd be curious on your view of the International side what you are hearing as it
relates to inventory destocking during the fourth quarter, any planned destocking in 2016 and then any perspective that
you can provide on the Domestic side would be helpful as well. Thanks.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, this is Alan. I'm going to take that first and pass it over to Jim. Certainly, what is
happening International has a broad impact on the U.S. But as you probably all know, the U.S. inventory sales ratio has
come down slightly but it still remains elevated. Certainly indicating we got a continued overhang of inventories in the
economy, and customers are obviously attempting to work them down. We expect the strong U.S. dollar to continue to
influence the trade lanes, and I guess the last thing I'll say is that our omnichannel ecommerce strategies, like ship from
store enabling retailers to burn some of that off effectively.
<A - James Jay Barber, Jr.>: I guess, Ben, I would add a comment probably from the forwarding perspective because
that tends to be the front end of some of these inventory moves. If you look at about the last year, what we've seen is a
continued gap of demand and capacity, but I would say in the last two months of data, what we start to see is some load
factors turning up. So, as that moves forward, now we also have Chinese New Year coming on us right now. So, that
will give us our second read but from that perspective, I think as some of the guys mentioned earlier, the buy/sell
spreads, which is reflective of capacity and demand, have been at its widest point through 2015. But early indications,
there's a little bit of turn towards the end of 2015, but we don't see anything that spikes in a great way just yet, but that
will lead us to further evaluation of the inventory. So appreciate the question.

Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Richard, great to hear the
guidance on the Domestic margin expansion but I have a question for you on International. How much are we, how
much are you guys seeing a benefit from the currency gains in the fourth quarter? How should you expect that sort of
hedge gain to play out in 2016 and then should there be a cliff on the hedge roll off in 2017? We've gotten a lot of
questions about how that interaction will play out over the course of the year in terms of reported gains on the currency
hedge.

<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Sure. You know, we use a currency hedge program that really is about protecting our
profits, but when you separate that out, right now we do have protection for all of 2016, and at different points through
the last few years we've gone in and made the necessary adjustments. But when we looked at the operating margin, it
has improved a little bit because of the hedge, and it's about 200 basis points, or just over 200 basis points in the margin
that you should be thinking about that's really driven because of the hedge program that's really meant to allow the
operators to look at the business and step away from what's happening with the currency and concentrate on growing
the business. I'm actually going to ask Jim to talk a little about the record setting year that International has had.
<A - James Jay Barber, Jr.>: Okay. Thanks, David, and thanks, Rich. I think, with respect to currency, that's going to
work through in the hedges. As Rich pointed out, is how we manage it. I do want to point you back to what we consider
to be a very solid year in International a couple of obviously record breaking points, but I think the key for us is to
continue to lean into the networks. We talked to you in late 2014 at the investor conference about efficiencies and
continuing to invest in the network specifically, up to about $2 billion in Europe. We continue on that path. Our Europe
team continues to execute. We get the revenue management initiatives that go with it. So all that really keeps us at the
really end of the story, which is industry leading margins in the International business. And we'll manage that and
currencies will do what they'll do and we'll continue to grow the business internationally and manage to the top of the
industry margins. So I appreciate the question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: So just to kind of clarify, should we then be expecting that 200 basis points of margin to
roll off in 2017 or are you guys making progress on mitigating that impact?
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: It's a little early to start guiding you on 2017, but there are certain actions that we are taking
on. And as it becomes more appropriate to cover and things are more complete, we'll give you a better story on that.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. Thanks very much for the time and [ph] great press (37:30).

Our next question will be from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning, thanks. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question on pension, and if you
could provide or quantify what's embedded in your guidance in terms of the year-over-year expense tailwind or
headwind?
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Sure. Thank you, Allison. When we look at the pensions overall, we're expecting our
expense to actually be flat this year with 2015, and that's what's embedded in the guidance. You know, the activities
around pension are an important area for UPS. We continue to actively manage that area, and as I said, for the year it's
going to be flat so there won't be any increase in expense for 2016.

Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Great, thanks for taking my question guys. So I guess just to focus here on Amazon for a moment,
we saw several media reports late in the fourth quarter that the company is planning to lease a number of 767s and
perhaps 737s to operate in both U.S. and Europe. If this is indeed the case what impact do you think this move will
have on the competitive pricing dynamics in the Domestic and European express market?
<A - David P. Abney>: Okay. This is David, and first let me make sure and express that Amazon's a good customer of
ours. We have a mutually beneficial relationship. And our goal with Amazon or any other big customer is to continue
to show our value through the integrated network and through our technologies, and to have a value proposition that's
difficult to match. We do add capacity, and for large customers, such as Amazon, we do it. Though, we ensure that we
have the proper economic return. And at the same time, we also ensure the integrity of our network for all customers by

planning and forecasting our volumes. So, I didn't read anything in the last quarter, that we felt like is in – on any kind
of substantial basis – is going to affect our pricing, our pricing in the market. We just believe we need to continue to
focus on our values, stay on our strategies and our technologies and we feel that we'll have another good year this year
as far as the return to investors.

Next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Hey, good morning guys and congrats on the better outcome this year. Totally different
from 12 months ago. But can I just ask you, what's your general perception of industrial exposure in your Domestic
Package network? Because if I look back historically when we saw IP contracting I think it's been very difficult for
UPS to get earnings. So can you talk to some of the risk that the outlook has if the industrial economy keeps
weakening? And then maybe some of the counter proactive or positive things that are happening in the network that are
giving you this positive outlook?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, hey, Brandon, this is Alan. Look, I think the story with industrial production has
been happening now for quite a while. Certainly it's trending more negative than it has been. Our business today is – as
Rich said, even at peak season, we were up to 60% residential. So about half of our business is – is on the retail
ecommerce side now. And, I think we are going to be able to manage through that real well. I think the value
proposition that we have in place for both retail and the other industry segments, including industrial manufacturing,
high tech and health care bode well. So we feel pretty good that we've embedded these trends into our 2016 plans, and
are very confident in achieving those results.
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: And this is Richard. Just a few other things that I think is important to think about when you
think about what's embedded in our guidance, is that the volume is not just based on what's happening externally. It's
also what's going on within UPS. And so we start out externally and look at various scenarios of what we think could
happen, and so embedded in the range is different volume assumptions and that's why there's a range. But also, it's the
story about the economies that we are getting out of the ORION project and the adjustments we are making in the air
network. You bring all of that together, and that's why the range is, as we put it out there. So, we feel very confident
that what we're putting out there is the expectation based on both the external and the internal efforts that we're doing
here at UPS.
<A - David P. Abney>: Just a last – and this is David, just a last comment on industrial production. If you would
looked at our results five years ago, I think there was a tighter correlation. Now, of course, with our ecommerce and the
residential business growing as fast as it is, I think that maybe it's not quite as direct. And if you look at the fourth
quarter, industrial production was down all three months of the fourth quarter and we had record results and I think part
of that is was because consumer confidence is still high. And, so I wouldn't draw too much of a connection there, if I
was you. But thanks for the question.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Thank you. Hey, thanks for taking my question. I hope I get this out appropriately or word this
right. I think you touched on this a little bit but obviously ecommerce is going to continue to grow at a very rapid pace.
And it seems to me that as we move forward you're going to have more and more difficult decisions during peak with
regards to having to potentially turn away business. How do you think about that decision-making process going
forward and how do you balance all of your customers' needs?

<A - David P. Abney>: This is David. I will start that question and then I will hand it over to Alan. The key to
remember this year, though, is our focus was not on capping or turning away customers. With the control tower, our
focus is to pull volume in, work with our customers and find ways to utilize sources or areas of our network that aren't
tapped, such as we were very successful in pulling volume into the weekends. That's how we were able to actually
move up peak pay from the 22nd of December to the 21st.
So, one of the ways that we address what you were just referring to is the way that we do manage [ph] to the peak
(44:55). We also add substantial capacity this year for peak and from our CapEx plans that's going to continue. And the
increase in technology, ORION that you heard Myron talk about, over 70% utilized and Access Points and other
technologies like that. So, I don't think we have a future of just seeing how much volume we can cap. It's just the
opposite of how we can increase our capacity and how we can increase our effectiveness. Alan from a customer
standpoint.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: I just say, look, we've talked for awhile now about bending the cost curve and David talked
about some of the things we are doing there with ORION. But UPS My Choice, Access Points, SurePost Redirect, and
SurePost this year, we redirected over 35% of our SurePost packages back into the network where we were able to
create a two-piece stop, our omnichannel strategy, so on and so forth. And all these things are working in concert to
help us be able to manage peak at levels today where this year our peak volumes were almost double what they are
during the remaining part of the year.
Keep in mind that as we work with these, all of these projects here, a lot of them are focused in on delivery density and
one-tenth piece per stop increase creates about $200 million of operating profit improvements. So, we feel like the
things that we are doing to our network now are going to enable us to handle bigger and bigger peaks.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I want to ask a question about pricing. I wanted to get a sense of
maybe on the domestic side how the core pricing looked and maybe how mix looked at whether or not we saw some
acceleration into the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense if during peak is pricing stronger or are there other
mix offsets that we should be thinking about? Thanks.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Hey, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. Certainly, we had strong base rate pricing
improvements throughout 2015. The fourth quarter was no exception. We came in at the higher end of the 2% to 3%
long-term target range. It's really, the GRI, the dim weight, some of the tactical pricing decisions, as well as disciplined
and prudent revenue management. For 2016, our expectation is to achieve, again, within 2% to 3% of the range for base
rate improvements going forward.

Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes of RBC capital markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Barnes>: Hey, thanks. Let me echo my congratulations as well. Nice quarter. Real quick, you talked a little
bit in your guidance about some revenue management actions you've taken in Europe. It seems like LTL volumes
continue to be a little bit weak there. I'm just kind of curious, are there any other revenue management areas that you
are attacking right now? Is LTL one or is this isolated to Europe? Can you elaborate on that just a little bit?
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Sure, this is Richard. And John, I think the last few quarters we talked about the revenue
management initiatives and David mentioned improving the yield in some of his comments. And the thing to keep in
mind, it's really broad based. We are doing it in a small package. We are doing it in the International Air Freight market
and the LTL. And it's really about making sure that we have the right customers and the right yield in each of our
networks.

We have a question from the line of David Ross of Stifel, please go ahead.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Yes, good morning gentlemen. A question on the peak season volumes. The last couple of years
in 2013 and 2014 the peak period was about 72%, 73% over a normal week period or a normal period. Alan said it was
nearly twice this year. So was that 75%, was that 95%? And in addition to that what can you do in 2016 to make the
network run even better during peak than it did this year? Thanks.
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Sure. And this is Richard again. When you look across peak, obviously peak is a little
different at different weeks of it. But when you go across the entire peak period, it was slightly elevated from where it
was last year. And we moved the peak day up by one because of available capacity over the weekends and the
customers collaborating with us made the necessary adjustments. I'm going to ask Alan to talk a little bit about
specifically, but what's going on with volume, Alan?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, look. My point was that during peak we handle almost double on any given day, but
the spike occurs in an ongoing basis between Cyber Monday and Christmas Day. Throughout the quarter our volume
between October and November was softer and December on a secular basis continued to rise.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Alex Vecchio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexander Vecchio>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the LTL environment.
Broadly speaking it's been several quarters now that volumes have been challenged, not just for you but for the entire
industry. And I guess I want to get a sense from you guys to the extent to which you're seeing increasingly competitive
or aggressive pricing behavior from your peers. Are you starting to see any of that or would you kind of characterize
the industry as still broadly holding discipline on price?
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Alex, this is Myron. If you go back to the fourth quarter of 2014, each corresponding quarter
we've continued to see softness in the market and it's adversely affected each of the carriers in the market. However,
base rate improvements have remained steady and we're not seeing any adverse actions to the negative that are being
taken by any carriers and we would expect it to remain that way moving forward.
Operator
The next question will come from the line of Matt Troy of Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I just had a pretty straightforward inquiry on
CapEx. I was wondering if you could talk about your CapEx budget for 2016. I know you guys have a lot of irons in
the fire in terms of optimization and modernization programs across the network. So just wondering what the capital
budget is for 2016 and what are some of the major projects or allocations from the budget we can expect you guys to
make progress on in 2016? Thanks.
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Sure, Matt, this is Richard. Our CapEx, as I mentioned in my talk, is expected to be about
$2.8 billion right now. The model that we built at UPS and the network is very unique. And we're continuing to make
the necessary adjustments and automating our Tier 1 buildings, but we are doing it at a measured pace because we also
have to make sure that we continue to provide the service that our customers expect. In fact, in the last few years we've
actually doubled the spend in our buildings and facilities and we expect that that will continue and that's probably the
area where we'll be spending the most money next year. But the results of this quarter were really driven by the
investments we've made the last few years and that's helped us to achieve the margins and the profit level that we got

Our next question comes will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. I just wanted to think about the differing macro
outlooks throughout the world. And can you give us a sense of how much of your revenue you would estimate touches
the U.S. at least at one end, so whether it's generated domestically or imports or exports? And then also maybe if you
could give us a similar estimate for Europe as well?
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Yeah, Kelly, this is Richard again. When you think about the total company, obviously the
U.S. is a very large piece of our business, and we've talked about the importance, not only of the U.S., but also both
imports and exports coming into and leaving the U.S. And today, of course, the imports into the U.S. are stronger, and
that's really something we've seen because of the strength of the dollar. So exports coming out of the rest of the world
coming to the U.S. are much higher. And we've talked about in the past, that Europe is a very large part of our
International. It's about 50% of the International business. So together, those two are a very large part of the company,
but the other pieces of the network are important because the customers are sending packages all over the world back
and forth.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Is there any way to kind of quantify 75%, 80%, whatever the number is, percent of your
revenue actually touches U.S. in some way, shape, or form?

Our next question will come from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for squeezing me in here. With regard to the margins
in Q4, U.S. Domestic Package got back to in-line margins for the full year. And I think it's a testament to a lot of the
internal initiatives that you guys are calling out as well as the strength on pricing. How are you guys thinking about
margins looking out next year and a few years out within Domestic? Are the internal initiatives enough where we'll
start to see fourth-quarter margins again be better despite the greater concentration of home deliveries and B2C
shipments? Or should we think about it roughly in line with the broader full-year overall margin in U.S. Domestic
Package?
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Rob, again, this is Richard. I think you have to look at 2016 and David actually made a
comment earlier that this is going to be a balanced year. So, there's both volume growth and making sure that we align
the revenue with the resources that are used in UPS. That's very important. As well, for the last two years, we've been
down this road of improving our internal operations. You saw that because for the first time, you actually see stops
growing twice as fast as volume, yet your cost per stop came down. And that's a testament to the technology and the
U.S. operations that had a good quarter. And I will actually ask Myron to comment on that.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: So, Rob, let me begin by thanking the thousands of UPSers who helped execute on a
well-designed plan. We will continue to deploy technology, tighten our direct labor hours, and add capacity where
necessary to take advantage of this expedited growth in residential deliveries. Deployments like ORION that helped us
control our miles, actually, they were flat in the fourth quarter. Our direct labor hours were down from last year, and

Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - Helane Becker>: Thanks very much, operator. Hi gentlemen, thank you also for the time. As you guys think
about the CapEx you're spending on improving the technology in the buildings, are you actually able to grow without
adding additional head count? And I think, Myron, maybe just started to address that question with respect to
improving margins without increasing either head count or salaries that much.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Yeah, I think our automation strategy will allow us not to add head count and our automation
strategy moving forward is to either deploy technology in the existing footprint that we have, when we build new
buildings or where we may need to add capacity that will help us reduce handles. In the fourth quarter, our direct labor
hours were flat. Now we hired what we expected in terms of people at 90,000 to 95,000, but because of this
automation, we were able to bring them on much later at peak, and our actual hours were down 8%. So, we don't see a
need to add head count. Thank you.
<Q - Helane Becker>: Thank you.
<A - David P. Abney>: Yeah, this is David. Just to put a recap on that. Each of these automated facilities, we see about
a 20%, 25% efficiency. So, that gives you an idea of what they mean to us. Thank you. Next question.

your line is open. We'll move on to our next question from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in here, guys. Just taking a step back, if you are going to
design a parcel network from scratch to serve ecommerce customers levered to residential deliveries, can you talk a
little bit about how it would be different from the network that you have today?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Look, I think that the network that we have today, the air and ground integrated network, is
second to none and the enhancements we're making to that network, whether it's the operational efficiencies that Myron
talked about with ORION and hub automation or whether it's some of the customer-facing technologies that we're
putting in place that also help reduce cost and make us more efficient and make us attracted to both consumers and
retailers is really the best network in the business. And, again, when you think about this ecommerce ecosystem that we
are putting in place with our base ground and air package network adding on the UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point,
the Synchronized Delivery Solution, the SurePost and the SurePost Redirect, our returns portfolio, i-parcel, combining
that with some of the efficiencies really makes the UPS network the ecommerce network of the future.

business was positive all year with the exception of a slight dip in the third quarter growing at or about half the pace of
the B2C. And like we said, it rebounded back in the fourth quarter, but mainly driven by retail. Certainly on the Supply
Chain & Freight side of our business, the vast majority of our business is, in fact, B2B. And in the International
business, a much larger preponderance of our business is B2B, so the growth you're seeing in there would impact – also

the fourth quarter, the four consecutive quarters of 2015 where we exceeded expectations are all evidence of our
execution. We are carrying this momentum into 2016. We feel good about the year, even with a little less certain
environment around us, and we expect once again to deliver strong earnings growth this year. Thank you for your time
and see you next quarter. Thank you.
