Jeffrey Jacobson
Good morning, and welcome to Xerox's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will
provide an update on our financial progress in the fourth quarter, as well as our expectations for 2017.
On January 1, Xerox began a new chapter building on our heritage of innovation and customer centricity, while
evolving to meet the changing dynamics of the market and the workplace. The new Xerox will capitalize on our market
leadership positions and innovation capabilities to deliver more value to our customers and drive revenue
improvements over time.

The 35,000-plus members of Team Xerox are excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Our customers are
welcoming and encouraged by our renewed focus on what we do best, helping them communicate and work more
effectively. I feel really good about our business, our strategy, our leadership team and how we are positioned for the
future.
We have a strong, attractive business model. We participate in an $85 billion market and have leadership positions in
key segments. Our business is 75% post-sale based, which provides great stability. We have loyal and longstanding
relationships with our current customers and we are adding to our client roster as we cultivate relationships with
customers.
We continue to be relentless on cost and productivity initiatives, and we are very good at our operating this business.
From 2013 through 2015, we delivered $300 million to $350 million of productivity each year. With our Strategic
Transformation program, we are driving for more transformative change that will bring even greater productivity. And
we are on track to deliver an annual average of at least $500 million of cost savings from 2016 to 2018.
We are disciplined in our approach, and our ability to deliver productivity will mitigate the impact of revenue decline
until we change our revenue trajectory. Our productivity efforts are providing a solid financial foundation to support
strong cash generation, margin expansion and the ability to reinvest in the business.
The market we play in has both growing and declining areas. The growth opportunities range from low-single digit to
double-digits, and we have a concrete plan to capture these opportunities in our Strategic Growth areas.
These areas include, first, Document Outsourcing, especially Managed Print Services and the small and medium
business, or SMB market. Our emphasis will be on the M of SMB. Second, entry products, where pages are moving
from single-function A4 size printers to higher value A4 multifunction printers where we are better positioned. And
finally, the production cut-sheet color and emerging production inkjet markets, an area where we are historically strong
and are making investments in the newer technologies.
To pursue these opportunities, we have realigned our go-to-market models and we are expanding our channels to
increase our reach and strengthen our relationships with our customers. And we're building on successful product
launches in 2016 to expand our portfolio and taking things to a greater level in 2017, with the largest product launch in
the history of Xerox.
Finally, we are a company that continues to focus on delivering attractive shareholder returns. That is at the core of our
mission. We know investors and shareholders expect it; and it is also important for employees and customers who want
to be associated with a vibrant, successful and innovative business.
We have the strategies to get there. We also have the foundation of an investment-grade credit profile and the strong
free cash flow that supports investment in the business, as well as attractive returns to shareholders. I am confident we
are well-positioned for success in the coming years, and our accomplishments in 2016 provide examples of our ability
to deliver. Let me share with you a few highlights.
As you know, on December 31, 2016, we successfully completed the spinoff of the Business Process Services business,
which is now an independent company named Conduent Incorporated. This was a significant undertaking on a very
short timeline.
The organization was heavily involved in completing the necessary work of separating vendor, partner and customer
contracts, implementing over 160 information technology projects and managing the transfer of several thousand
employees between entities. My thanks to all those involved. They worked tirelessly and late at night and many
weekends to complete the transaction as planned.
In addition to completing the separation, we also initiated our Strategic Transformation program. I'm very pleased with
the progress made during the first year of the program. We exceeded our 2016 target by delivering $550 million in
gross savings. To ensure we stay on track, we have embedded a rigorous process within our operations to identify,
implement and track initiatives. I'm personally involved, as is the full executive team. The entire organization is

engaged and focused on delivering on their commitments.
Just as important as the financial impact of the program are the changes we are making to the way we work. We're
simplifying, standardizing and automating processes throughout the company. Here are a few examples.
In our service delivery operations, we are advancing the use of automation, including marked increases in the usage of
automation, supplies replenishment and remote solve, which enables us to resolve break/fix issues on our products
without dispatching a technician to customer locations.
In our sales operations, we are enabling better pricing and sales tools, including a digital deal-scoring tool to describe
optimal pricing recommendations. And with our supply chain organization, we have further globalized our operations,
from regionally and functionally siloed organization to a global organization and we made progress consolidating our
warehousing footprint.
As we prepare to launch the new Xerox, we designed and implemented a streamlined operating model simplifying our
go-to-market approach. By creating global processes and deploying them at the local or country level, we will take
advantage of our global scale while strengthening our relationships with customers and our local geographies. We also
delayed the organization to expedite decision-making.
We have pulled teams together to improve the return on our investments. Combining research, development and
engineering resources will accelerate the process of moving from innovation to product. And uniting our business
groups and sales support functions will ensure we have the right products delivered through optimal channels using the
most efficient processes to drive revenue improvement.
We have put in place a high caliber leadership team that combines seasoned Xerox veterans, such as Herve Tessler,
President of international operations; Chief Commercial officer, Kevin Warren; Chief Delivery Officer, Yehia Maaty;
and our Chief Technology Officer, Steve Hoover, who's formerly the CEO of PARC, with talented external hires,
including our CFO, Bill Osbourn; our General Counsel, Sarah McConnell; and our Chief Strategy and Marketing
Officer, Farooq Muzaffar; and two others, Mike Feldman, President of North America Operations; and Darrell Ford,
our Chief Human Resources Officer, who, like me, joined the company within the last five years. We are an energized
team committed to our strategy and focused on driving strong results.
In 2016, we continue to apply our innovation capabilities to strengthen our portfolio and bring additional value to our
customers. In the production area, we added to our high-end portfolio by bringing two new inkjet presses to market, the
cut-sheet Brenva HD and the continuous feed Trivor 2400, laying the groundwork for further expansion into the
growing inkjet market.
We were honored to receive two InterTech Technology Awards from the Printing Industries of America for our
Versant Press and Metallic Inks. These awards honor the development of technologies, which are predicted to have a
major impact on the graphic communications and related industries.
For the office, we introduced the ConnectKey-enabled i-Series multifunction printers, MFPs, which are equipped with
ready-to-use apps to speed up paper-dependent business processes and make it easier for users to collaborate and work
more effectively. Our Xerox App Gallery, an online portal where customers can select and download MFP-resident
apps adds functionality, enhances convenience and increases productivity. Buyers Laboratory recognized the 2016
ConnectKey technology platform with its outstanding achievement and innovation honors.
In Document Outsourcing, we were pleased that our efforts in Managed Print Services were recognized once again as
we were named the market leader by all of the top industry analysts. In this Strategic Growth area, we brought
automation solutions to market that simplify how our customers work so they can be faster, more efficient and effective
in the services they provide to their clients.
For example, we introduced a Workflow Automation Solution for retail banking that provides bank employees with a
consolidated view of all content within a specific account, simplifying the process of on-boarding a new client and
improving customer satisfaction. In higher education, we have an automation solution to streamline the admissions
process by automating the capture and routing of documents, increasing both the quality and the speed of the process.

These are just a few examples of the value we are bringing to our customers as we extend the power of our technology
into processes that bridge analog and digital workflows. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention all of the work
that was done in 2016 to prepare for the largest product launch in our history, which is coming later this year. We will
refresh our office portfolio by introducing a new technology platform and building on the successes of the i-Series
approach to apps and workflows.
With that, I will move to our fourth quarter results. The financial results we will review today are those of the
continuing operations of the new Xerox. In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share.
Revenue of $2.7 billion was down 7% year-over-year or 5% on a constant currency basis.
While post-sale revenue declines were stable at down 3%, equipment revenue was soft, somewhat owing to the timing
of product launches, but this is an area of focus to drive better results. This is why pursuit of our Strategic Growth areas
is so important and will be featured in our commentary going forward as we drive to improve our revenue trajectory
over time.
Adjusted operating margin was strong at 14%, up 70 basis points from the previous year, driven by our Strategic
Transformation initiatives. So very good results that helped offset revenue decline and allowed us to enhance operating
margins. For the full year, our margin was 12.5%, at the top of the range we expected.
We delivered seasonally strong cash flow from operations of $462 million, and we ended the year with a cash balance
of $2.2 billion. We plan to use $1 billion of cash for the repayment of maturing senior notes in the first quarter of 2017.
Bill will provide additional color when he walks through our cash flow in more detail.
Overall, our results demonstrated continued progress in our productivity and cost savings initiatives and our ability to
generate strong cash flows as we work to change the trajectory of our revenue.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Osbourn. Bill joined Xerox on December 5 from Time Warner Cable, where
his 13-year career culminated with him serving as co-CFO. Previously, Bill spent 14 years at PricewaterhouseCoopers,
Bill?
William F. Osbourn
Thanks, Jeff, for the introduction. Glad to be here and excited to join Xerox at this time when there is such great
opportunity before us. To me it's simple; we have a strong market position and brand, margin support and investment
room from our Strategic Transformation, along with strategies with reasonable expectations to improve the revenue
trajectory over time, which are supported by our announced product launch.
In the same breath, I'd say we've got lots of work to do to execute on the plan and build a track record of consistent
delivery. I've been extremely pleased to find such a strong finance and accounting team here at Xerox and which
meshes well with my background, which is rooted in public accounting.
Together, my team and I are committed to driving continued financial rigor and clarity in reporting. Before I walk
through the Q4 numbers, it's important to mention again that Conduent's financials are not included in our continuing
operations results. And as stated earlier, their results will be included in our discontinued operations when we file our
10-K at the end of February. So I do not plan to comment on Conduent results.
So let's get started. Our adjusted results, as a reminder, exclude from an EPS perspective the following. Non-service
retirement-related costs, as these obligations are predominately legacy in nature and the costs can be significantly
impacted by changes in debt and equity markets, so not operational in nature. Restructuring and related costs, as these
have significant variability and aren't reflective of future operating performance as they are expected to yield future
benefits. And lastly, amortization of intangibles, as these are non-cash and associated with past acquisition activity.
Revenue of over $2.7 billion, as Jeff described, was down 7.2% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. When
we look at equipment and annuity, which includes contracted outsourcing services, equipment maintenance services,

consumable supplies and financing amongst other elements, the equipment decline was greater, down 10.1% at
constant currency, while annuity post-sale revenues declined 3.2% at constant currency and was consistent with the
full-year results.
Equipment is the more transactional revenue stream, and the higher decline reflected two main drivers. First, timing of
product launches in the Workplace Office product area. As announced at our December Analyst Day, we'll be
launching 29 new A3 and A4 products in this product segment, predominately beginning in Q2. So we're starting to see
a bit of a slowdown in sales in anticipation of the product launch.
Second, high-end equipment revenue was weaker reflecting a mix down, as entry production products drove the unit
growth while higher-end sales were lower, driven by iGen. From a geographic perspective, Europe was broadly
weaker, U.S. was overall stable and developing markets improved.
Largely offsetting the decline in revenue was the higher margin, as adjusted operating profit was down only $9 million
on a revenue decline of $212 million. Gross margin improved, and spend was lower in both the selling, administration
and general expenses and R&D areas.
Our adjusted operating margin, in which we are including equity income from our 25% interest in Fuji Xerox on the
profit side to better align with what we previously referenced as segment margin, was 14% in the quarter, up 70 basis
points year-over-year with the absolute strength reflecting the normal Q4 seasonality and the year-over-year
improvement driven by the cost savings we're seeing from our Strategic Transformation program.
Offsetting the good news in operating margin was other expenses net, which was higher year-over-year by $25 million
as Q4 2015 benefited from gains on the sale of surplus property. Tax rate in the quarter was 21.1% on an adjusted
basis, which was lower by about a point year-over-year driven by a higher foreign tax credit benefit in 2016.
To round things out, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.25 for new Xerox, which compares to $0.27 in
the prior year and GAAP EPS was $0.17. These are difficult numbers to give context to as historical Xerox guidance
was not on that basis as it included Conduent. Overall, I would summarize quarter four is mixed, improvements in
margins offsetting revenue declines and resulting in continued solid cash flows from operations as I will discuss
shortly.
As we think about new Xerox following the spinoff, I'd like to take some time to cover the trends we're seeing in the
business, as well as the key metrics that drive the business. Starting with a high-level view of revenue and margin
trends.
Total revenue in 2016 was down 4.3% in constant currency, modestly better than the 4.6% in 2015. It is fair to say the
declining revenue trends in the business have been generally consistent in recent years. As a leader in this market, we
need to improve upon these trends, which is why the separation and our ability now to direct all of our resources
towards the digital printing in Document Outsourcing business, as well as the Strategic Transformation program are
such key enablers to helping improve the top line trajectory.
It is important to remember that any meaningful improvement in recent trends will take time as we should start to see
some equipment benefit in the second half of 2017, with resulting post-sale benefits in 2018 and beyond.
We're seeing progress on our transformation and productivity initiatives. As shown on the previous slide, adjusted
operating margin in Q4 was 14%; and for the year, we ended with a 12.5% margin, which was at the high-end of the
range we gave at the December Investor Conference.
There is seasonality in the margin, so we expect Q1 will naturally dip down to below our full-year guidance range,
especially when we factor in the investments we're making in the launch of our new products, as well as currency,
which I'll now spend a moment on.
Currency is a variable to both revenue growth and margin. The strong dollar over the past couple of years has pressured
revenue, and we expect about 2 points of unfavorable translation currency in 2017, which will impact profit by
approximately $20 million.

The strengthening yen, relative to other currencies, has also been an increasing headwind over the past couple of years
given the product and supplies we source from our partner, Fuji Xerox. We anticipate this headwind will continue into
2017 with approximately 100 basis points or $100 million of additional margin pressure at recent rates and factoring in
our hedging and currency risk sharing with Fuji Xerox. So, in total, we're looking at about $120 million negative
pre-tax profit impact from currency at recent rates.
Turning now to our key performance metrics, the metrics on this slide are a mix of those we've traditionally provided
around Installs and signings, as well as some new metrics around Strategic Growth areas and transformation. They
align to what we discussed at our December Investor Conference. As we move into 2017, we will evolve our metrics
reporting with the objective of providing transparency into the trends in our key business drivers.
As Jeff referenced, our Strategic Growth areas comprise Managed Print Services and Workflow Automation, a subset
of Document Outsourcing, A4 multifunction printers and production color, and are areas where the overall market is
expanding. We have growth initiatives to go after each of these areas that leverage our Managed Print Services
leadership, our high-end strength, as well as the opportunity to further perpetrate the SMB market.
For full-year 2016, Strategic Growth area revenue comprise 38% of total revenue, which was a 2-point increase year
over year, and overall Strategic Growth area revenue was up 2% at constant currency. As a percent of our total revenue,
we expect to see an approximate 3-point increase annually as we rollout our growth initiatives.
Turning to Installs, as expected, color growth rates were stronger than black and white. Overall, Q4 was softer than the
full-year figures and follow the comments I made on equipment revenue. 2016 was a lighter product launch year in
Workplace Office. And as we've highlighted, 2017 is planned to be our largest product launch year in history, with
most of our new products available by the end of the first half. So we are looking for improving trends as we move into
the second half of 2017 and beyond.
Document Outsourcing signings, while at the highest level of the year, were lower than Q4 2015. And for the full year,
signings were down 5% on a trailing 12 months' basis at constant currency; not as strong a close to the year as we
would've liked. Overall, our pipeline is growing, but we are impacted by more lower new business signings in 2016,
driven in part by increased price discipline, but also by what we believe was insufficient new logo sales coverage and
some A4 product gaps that will be resolved with our upcoming launch.
As communicated at our December Investor Conference, part of our Strategic Growth area focus is Managed Print
Services. So we're taking actions and making investments in this area to drive improving signings trends as we move
through 2017. Also, note that we don't capture the higher growth Partner Print Service signings within our figures.
The last progress area I'd like to cover is Strategic Transformation. This is a critical program to drive both expanding
margins and enabling investments to improve the revenue trajectory. We gave a fair amount of detail at the Investor
Conference on these areas of focus and initiatives, as well as our three-year targets that accumulate to over $1.5 billion
in gross savings over three years. You can also see here how the three-year program savings break down by area.
In terms of 2016 results, we exceeded our gross savings objective and we are maintaining our objective of $600 million
for 2017. There are headwinds related to revenue declines, as well as currency that partially offset these savings. But
net-net, we anticipate continued margin expansion for the full year in 2017, as I'll detail in a moment. We'll work to
continue to refine our key performance metrics, and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the
year.
Another critical element to our business model is our cash flow, which I'll cover now. Operating cash generation
coming from continuing operations in the quarter was $462 million and resulted in $1 billion for the year. Free cash
flow was $423 million in Q4 and $880 million for the year. So strong results on both metrics.
Some of the key drivers of the continuing operations cash flow for the full year are as follows. Pre-tax income totaled
$568 million. Adding back non-cash items, pre-tax income was about $1.3 billion. Other notable sources and uses
included, restructuring payments of $118 million, which was less than the charge in the P&L, a reflection of the lag
between when charges are taken and payments are made. Pension contributions were $178 million and is an area like

restructuring, which will be higher in 2017, as I will discuss in a moment.
Working capital was a source in the quarter for normal seasonality, but overall a use for the year driven by accounts
payable related to both lower level of payables, as well as timing. We see this as an area of improvement opportunity in
full-year 2017. And lastly, change in finance assets was a source for the year reflecting less originations on lower
financed equipment sales, as well as the dissipating drag from the finance receivable sales of a few years ago.
Investing cash flows were a use of $59 million in Q4 and $146 million for the year, largely reflecting our CapEx spend,
which was $39 million in the quarter and $138 million for the year. We are not presenting cash flows from financing,
as they are presented on a combined, continuing and discontinued operations basis and are not meaningful on a new
Xerox basis, as financing activities were primarily related to the Conduent discontinued operations.
Turning to our capital structure, there are a number of dynamics to cover, especially with the spinoff of Conduent. We
ended Q4 with $6.3 billion of debt, which is lower than the $7.4 billion we reported at the end of Q3, as $1 billion
earmarked for the term loan repayment that came due upon separation has gone to discontinued operations.
Of our $6.3 billion in debt, $3.7 billion is allocated to financing debt calculated by applying a 7:1 leverage to our
customers' financing assets of $4.2 billion, which are comprised of $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $475 million
of equipment on operating leases. This financing debt is adjusted out in one form or another by rating agencies when
calculating our core leverage.
As finance assets have come down over time, we have lowered our total debt to maintain our core leverage within our
target range. The $2.6 billion remaining after backing out the financing debt is core debt. We show that pro forma core
debt will be $1.6 billion and cash balance will be $1.4 billion, taking into account our plan to retire $1 billion of senior
notes that are coming due in quarter one.
As we communicated at our December Investor Conference, as a smaller, less diversified company, we will need to
carry less core debt. Thus, this reduction, as well as further anticipated debt reductions in 2017 are targeted at
maintaining our investment-grade credit profile and will give us more financial flexibility in the long run.
I'll now take a moment to walk through our guidance for 2017. Beginning with revenue, we are guiding to mid-single
digit revenue declines at constant currency. Also, based on recent rates, we anticipate approximately 2 points of
currency headwinds during 2017. We anticipate equipment sale revenue trends will improve as we move into the
second half of 2017 as we begin to benefit from new product launches and our growth strategies. Although, due to the
timing of the launches, the revenue impact of the new products will have a greater impact in 2018 and beyond.
Also contemplated in our guidance are two specific headwinds. One related to the Communication and Marketing
Services, or CMS business, that came from Business Process Outsourcing business, where our focus on exiting
low-margin contracts is resulting in higher near-term revenue declines. And the second from our OEM business, which
as we highlighted at our Investor Day has been declining at higher rates due to less volume from one of our major OEM
customers.
CMS in 2016 had about $225 million in revenues and OEM had about $350 million in revenues. And we anticipate
both will decline about 20%, which equates to over a point of impact to total revenue, which is about 60 basis points
higher than the impact on the prior year.
Moving onto operating margin. We are guiding to a range of 12.5% to 13.5% for the full year, an expansion from the
12.5% we reported in 2016 driven by Strategic Transformation cost savings, offsetting ongoing revenue declines and
the negative impact from currencies that I highlighted earlier.
Turning to EPS. On a GAAP basis, we are guiding to $0.44 to $0.52 of full-year earnings; and on an adjusted basis
$0.80 to $0.88, which compares to $0.88 for full-year 2016. Revenue declines, currency headwinds and a higher tax
rate are more than offsetting margin expansion and lower interest expense. Just as we expect, improving equipment sale
trends in the latter half of the year, we also expect improving trends in EPS as revenue declines lessen and cost
transformation accelerates.

We are not giving quarterly EPS guidance, as I believe we should be focused on the full-year achievement. With that
said, while Q1 has historically represented about 20% of full-year EPS, we expect Q1 2017 results will be somewhat
lighter given currency pressures and timing of our product launch. I should also note that our GAAP guidance assumes
approximately $225 million in full-year restructuring, of which $125 million is expected to be incurred in Q1.
Finally, turning to cash flow. We had a very strong cash flow in 2016. As we communicated at the Investor
Conference, we anticipate lower cash flow in 2017 and are guiding to a range of $700 million to $900 million of
operating cash flow from continuing operations.
The decline year-over-year primarily is driven by higher restructuring payments of $215 million and higher pension
contributions of $350 million, partially offset by improvements in working capital. Note that the year-over-year this
assumes restructuring payments will increase by $100 million and pension contributions will increase by about $175
million.
Before I hand it back to Jeff, I'd like to close by walking through our capital allocation plans. From a sources of cash
perspective, we will be using both our 2017 operating cash flow as well as cash on the balance sheet to fund our cash
uses. As noted on the previous slide, we expect operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2017 to be in the
range of $700 million to $900 million. We will have some carryover separation payments of approximately $100
million that will come through operating cash flow from discontinued operations.
We also highlighted that we have a pro forma cash balance after paying off the Q1 debt maturities of $1.4 billion,
which is about $400 million above what we are currently targeting as our 2017 ending cash balance. Thus, combining
our expected operating cash flows with the available cash on the balance sheet, we'll have between $1 billion and $1.2
billion in cash available for capital allocation, which is planned as follows.
We are anticipating in doing an additional $300 million in debt repayment to bring our leverage in line with our targets.
As far as dividends, considering our annualized $0.25 common dividend and the preferred dividend, we anticipate
paying $280 million in dividends during the year. We have a fairly light capital business model and plan on spending
approximately $175 million on CapEx, which contemplates some incremental IT investment. And we're currently
targeting approximately $100 million for M&A.
Which leaves somewhere between $145 million and $345 million to be deployed opportunistically and according to our
capital allocation priorities to maintain our investment-grade credit profile by reducing debt and/or pension liabilities as
well as investing in our business to drive higher shareholder returns.
While return of capital is an important priority, given the attractive dividend yield we are intending to pay, we believe
the best use of cash for 2017 is either to bolster our credit profile or fund growth and thus do not plan for any share
repurchases this year. It is important that we take the opportunity in 2017 to more efficiently structure our balance sheet
and manage our business, which will enable greater investment and shareholder returns in the future.
With that, let me hand it back to Jeff to wrap up prior to Q&A.
Jeffrey Jacobson
Thank you, Bill. We are a new Xerox, a company that is building on its long history of improving the way work gets
done. We will bring the best of the legacy Xerox and combine it with a focused, streamlined and simplified
organization that more easily adapts to meet the needs of today's markets while delivering solid returns to our
shareholders.
In 2016, we laid the foundation for the future. The launch of our Strategic Transformation program will support strong
cash generation, margin expansion and the ability to reinvest in the business. We defined our strategy and have solid
plans in place to capture opportunities in our Strategic Growth areas to change the trajectory of the company's top line
and outperform the market over time.

2017 is all about execution. My team and I are singularly focused on the operational performance of the business to
ensure we successfully execute upon our strategy and deliver on our commitments to our customers, our employees and
our shareholders.
We will now open the line for questions. Jennifer?
Jennifer Horsley
Thanks, Jeff. Before we get to your questions for Jeff and Bill, let me point out that we have a number of supplemental
slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial details to support today's presentation and complement our
prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to
everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Jeff for closing comments.
Operator, please open the line for questions now.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line
is now open.
<Q - Matthew Cabral>: Yeah, thank you. So on the equipment revenue, you touched on this a little bit in the prepared
remarks, but it looks like the pace of decline accelerated to end the year. So I was wondering if you can just touch upon
your view on the health of the industry at large and how much of the slowdown you think was Xerox-related, given
some of the upcoming product launches, versus more of a market-wide slowdown that we're going through. And then,
kind of related to that. I noticed in the press release that you called out Europe as being particularly weak. Just
wondering if you could expand a little bit on what you're seeing there.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah. Hey, Matt. How are you? This is Jeff. Thanks for the question. Yeah. So as Bill
alluded to in his remarks and you mentioned, in terms of versus full-year, our North American business was stable, the
trends were very stable. Developing markets actually improved versus their trends and we did have a worsening in
Europe. As a matter of fact, it was probably – where they were low-single digits, it went to above the average in decline
and it was really due to a few things.
The entry mid-sector was lower really due to the advent of the new products we have. If you think about our European
business, just a little less than 50% of the European business is our channel business. So they're preparing their supply
chain right now for the new products coming in. So that was part of it.
Also, if you were to go to last year in Europe, in the high end, we had the iGen 5 introduction in the second half of the
year. Europe did a really great job with that. If you go back to Q4 of 2015, they had a very tough compare there. So we
think it was that. The market overall has been relatively stable.
Certainly, in North America it's been stable developing market, as I mentioned. Relatively stable we think in Europe.
Brexit, we hear a little bit about some of the uncertainty there, could that have been part of the causal. But where we
think that we're going to see the benefits now as we start rolling out the new products and almost all of them will be in
our supply chain in the second quarter of the year, which will start benefiting us in the second half of the year, we think
we'll start seeing stabilization there for sure.
<Q - Matthew Cabral>: Got it. And then, on the cost transformation program, obviously you're only a year into the
plan, but you're already executing above the targets that you've laid out. Could you just talk about the levers that you
have to potentially deliver savings beyond the $1.5 billion plan that's in place through 2018? And just thinking more
philosophically about your approach, if you were to see some upside on your cost savings targets, how are you viewing

the tradeoff between using those to accelerate some of the reinvestments that you've talked about versus dropping those
through to the bottom line and starting to show some operating leverage in the model?
<A - William F. Osbourn>: Yeah. I'll hit the cost transformation first and then hand it over to Jeff about thoughts
about additional cash available for other investments. As we said in our prepared comments, we're very pleased with
what our results were for 2016, exceeding the $500 million, achieving $550 million. We've targeted $600 million.
Despite overachieving last year, we still believe we can do $600 million for this year.
The levers, we described the various areas, but one of the levers is clearly restructuring. And we're purposely timing a
significant part of our restructuring, $125 million of our planned $225 million for the full year in the first quarter. So
we get more of the benefits within the year. So as we said, we are very committed, very pleased with our results and
still believe we can achieve $600 million in 2017.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah. And, Matt, just to supplement it. We do have a very diligent process. We guided that
we thought we'd get $500 million of gross productivity in 2016. We were very aggressive. We're able to pull people
some things earlier, which got us to the $550 million. We're still sticking to the $600 million.
In terms of how we're going to use it, one of the things I want to emphasize is we have a very strong return of capital
strategy, and every free dollar of free cash flow we have fights for the best return on investment. A big part of this
strategy we have to remember as we rolled out at our Investor Conference, is that these cost productivity programs, we
want to drop some to the bottom line, we want margin expansion, but it's also all about how do we change the revenue
trajectory. We're not pleased where we were at 3.9% and 4.6% and then last year 4.3%. This year, you heard our
guidance for the year, but it's all about 2018 and beyond how do we begin to change that revenue trajectory.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Great. Thanks, Matt. Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks for the question. Just a couple of clarifications. On the revenue decline this year,
you're saying mid-single digits and then the currency impact's about 2 points. And so, I think you're guiding for maybe
a 7% revenue decline on a reported basis. Is that what we're thinking about now? And the reason why I mention is, I
think previously you'd said the revenue decline would be comparable in 2017 to what you saw in 2016.
So has there been any change in your visibility or view in revenues for 2017 over the last couple of months since the
Analyst Meeting? That's my first question. And then, also linked to that, it sounds like revenue year-on-year declines
are worse in the first half and they get better as we get through the end of the year?
And the final question I have is just on cost reduction. You keep saying that you're going to do more than $1.5 billion
long-term in this program, in the Strategic Transformation program. Can you give us – is there a point at which you
will maybe inform us how much more that's going to be? And is it going to be materially more? Is it maybe $100
million or $200 million only? If you can give us some sense in terms of how much more – given as you go through this,
how much more you could potentially save? Many thanks.
<A - William F. Osbourn>: Yes, this is Bill. You were breaking up slightly, but I think we pretty much got your three
questions. First of all, regarding the revenue guidance down mid-single digits. As background, there's lots of detailed
analysis and buildup coming to that. But when I take a step back and think about it at a high level and giving that
guidance, the company historically hasn't had a great track record; meaning, its constant currency revenue guidance.
You also factor in the Q4 that we are down 5% on a constant currency basis, and that in 2017 the expectation is with
the new product launches in the second quarter towards the latter part of the first half of the year that the improvement,
relatively speaking, will be more in the back end of 2017.

Page 11 of 16
So that combined with – specifically I mentioned in my prepared comments – two parts of our business, the OEM
business and the CMS have been declining in recent years at a much higher rate than the overall company as a whole,
but even are accelerating year-over-year to really add about 60 basis points in additional declines. So that 4.3% you
were looking at last year is, relatively speaking, you're starting at like 4.9%.
All those things factor together – like I said there's a lot of detailed analysis also that underlies it – gets you to
mid-single digits as far as revenue guidance at constant currency with improvements in the latter half of the year versus
the first half, which I think answers your second question, first half versus second half. And, yes, we would expect
better improvements or lesser declines in the second half versus the first half as a result of the new product launch.
As far as the cost reduction...
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah. And, Kulbinder, if I can. This is Jeff. I just want to supplement Bill. Also, one thing
when you look at our revenue model as you know as well as anyone, 75% of our revenue is annuity. It's been fairly
stable at declines of about 3%. One of the advantages we have, of that 75% of annuity about 62% of it are bundled
contracts which is different from a lot of the industry. So we have a lot of stability from that standpoint.
We certainly don't rest upon it. So the real key for us is changing the trajectory in the equipment sale revenue. Because
if we can start showing improvements there, getting more machines in the field, burning more pages, that will leave
healthy annuity even more, but obviously it'll bring down the drag of the equipment sale revenue.
With regard to the costing, we don't want to give 2018 guidance on cost. What we said at the Investor Conference, we
would be at $1.5 billion plus. We feel very good that we got to $550 million. We feel equally as good that we're
guiding to $600 million. It's not in the bank yet. We have to drive it very hard. It's a lot of heavy lifting. But when we
achieve that and if we can achieve that we'll be, let's call it, $1.150 billion; and then, we'd be able to update our
guidance as we get to 2018.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Kulbinder.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Operator, next...
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you. I have two questions. The first is just, Jeff, can you talk a bit about how you're
thinking about accelerating growth or improving what's going on within the Document Outsourcing business. If you
can talk about specifics, how, I don't know, maybe some of the weaker signings is carrying forward right now. But just
there was a mention I think in the script about walking away for some lower-profit deals. So are you seeing more
pricing pressure in this segment? Just any color you can give would be great. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Shannon. Yeah, so the comment about walking away from low-pricing
deals is probably more in Europe where there were a couple of very large deals where we just sit from a margin
standpoint, not something as the leader we really wanted to participate in. When I look overall at our Document
Outsourcing business, as you know, we're very well-positioned here as the industry leader from a market share
standpoint. If you took number two and three, they just about equal our market share.
Our pipeline actually is up. So the way I look at it, I said, our growth was 1% in Q4, it was up 2% for the year. Our
signings for the full year were down 5%. The renewals were up double-digit. It was the new business signings that were
down. We're going to attack that. And let me also add in terms of the new business signings being down, if you think
about it, we're really just reporting new business signings in the enterprise. For our Xerox Partner Print Services, we
don't report the signings there.

Page 12 of 16
So in the enterprise, it's a $6 billion Managed Print Services market, growing about 2%. We have just a little under a
50% share there. So we would expect to see somewhat of a little slowing in new signings there. But to counter that,
what we're doing is the new product launch will help us a lot. And let me touch on the new products, why will that help
us?
We've always been the leader in A3, A4 from a cost standpoint. We perhaps were not as competitive as we could have
been or should have been. From a functionality standpoint, these new products will have a tablet-based user interface.
They'll be mobile enabled, cloud connected, app centric, with benchmark security which is so important to the market
today and there will be fleet coherency between A4 and A3.
So we think with those new products and we are going to hire what we call new logo or new business hunters, who will
do nothing but focus on that percentage of the business in the enterprise we don't have. And then, if I just factor over to
Document Outsourcing where we have even a better opportunity for growth in the SMB market of Managed Print
Services. That's a $7 billion market growing at 7%, and our share is under 10% there.
So if I just compare and contrast the shares we have in the enterprise versus the SMB, again with the focus on the M,
and we started putting the focus there and we did grow at 12%, that's where we're looking for the growth opportunities.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. Thank you. And then, if you can talk a little bit about how you think about use of
cash? And it was covered in the script to some extent, but I'm just curious if you're sitting, I don't know, six months
from now or nine months from now and you've got a pile of cash, how are you thinking about it in terms of internal
investment versus acquisition? Are there areas where you think you should be developing things internally and
leveraging Xerox PARC versus opportunities to go out and buy?
And then obviously balancing that against share repurchase, which I understand is not on the table this year, but then
also debt paydown. Just you're going to end up with some cash. You clearly will have cash next year net of the return
program you put in place. So how do you as the CEO sort of balance these opportunities?
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah. So perfect, Shannon. Thank you. So let me address, and then Bill could certainly
supplement it. But we distinctly in purpose – we're very purposeful for saying the $145 million to $345 million. I
wanted to keep and the team wanted to keep our powder dry right now. I don't think it's any secret when you look at the
percentage of cash we generated in this side of the house over the years that in a two-division structure, some of that
certainly went over to the services side of the house.
And what we did is, we had a strategy to manage our business certainly for margin, for cash. We will continue to do
that. We'll always do it. And we'll be prudent and judicious with any investments we make. But we are going to look at
investments to accelerate the trajectory in the top line, and again revenue is very hard as we all know. These things
won't come quickly, but we're going to align it to the growth strategy, Shannon. So what can we do in Document
Outsourcing, is it professional services?
What can we do in Workflow Automation and the SMB channel? Obviously, we've had great success with Global
Imaging. We'll continue to do that. We'll look at some of the same things in Europe. In the production side, from an
inkjet standpoint, we know we have some work to do there and we'll continue to make investments there. And as you
saw in our recent Brother Dominic commercial about Set the Page Free, the technology today is not just about printing
on paper, but what can we do in packaging, what could we do from a technology standpoint? Printing on plastics,
printed electronics.
So we are going through that internal debate of what perhaps could we commercialize ourselves, which will obviously
take more time. What could we do with partnerships or what could we potentially do in M&A? So that's the way we're
looking at it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Paul Coster>: Yeah, thank you. I'll build a little bit on the questions that Shannon just asked. First of all, with the
dividend. Should we think of it as contingent on the cash flow each year? Or are you in a position to commit to
dividend growth knowing that once pension fund payments are out of the way you'll be in a much more robust position
from a free cash flow perspective?
<A - William F. Osbourn>: Yeah. I mean as we said in our prepared comments, as Jeff just went through, we are –
clearly, return of capital is an important priority, whether from share repurchases and from a dividend perspective. And
as we said at the Investor Conference, over time on an annual basis we would expect to be returning in one form or
another greater than 50%. As far as committing to dividend growth versus share repurchases right now or in the future,
we're not going to give guidance on that. But just know that we are committed as a company to returning on an annual
basis greater than 50%.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: And again, as I said before, we do have a strong return of capital strategy, and every dollar
fights for the ROI and is compared against the return of capital.
<Q - Paul Coster>: Got it. Okay. And then, on the acquisition front, can you just talk just a little bit about the
philosophy both in terms of accretion, market share gain, growth trajectory? What criteria are you using these?
<A - William F. Osbourn>: A couple of things, just to supplement what Jeff was saying earlier. First of all, our
acquisitions will be in areas that we're clearly experienced with, that are close to our knitting, areas that we understand.
And one of those areas historically has been in the GIS, or Global Imaging Services area, where we buy multi-branded
resellers and essentially convert them over to more of a mono-branded reseller being Xerox. And historically we've had
very good returns in that. We've paid a multiple in the range of one times revenue, and we look to the extent that they're
the right opportunities and doing those type of acquisitions in 2017 and beyond, not only in the U.S. but internationally.
And then as far as other types of acquisitions, whether in more in the Workflow Automation, whether software or
technology types, we would probably pay a higher multiple just depending upon the specifics of the potential deal.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah. And Paul, we're looking for things that will get us into those markets where perhaps
we can't address well today. So if you were to look at just production color, we say it's a $5 billion market growing at
5%. There's a market that's probably 12, 13 times that that's called commercial offset print and packaging, where if we
can have technologies or get into that space that would help us a great deal.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Paul.
<Q - Paul Coster>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you very much, and thanks so much for the details. On your annual EPS guidance, you know,
this is you guys' first opportunity to really come out and set a watermark and set your goals and lay it out. Yet, I think
one would be remiss if they don't realize the political and economic environment, the past 30 to 60 days has been
probably more uncertain than ever. So for your guidance, does it incorporate kind of a risk-adjusted weight of all that?
Or is it a stretch EPS goal? Is it conservative? How should we think about that as it's really you guys are setting up your
reputation at risk here. Is it conservative? Is it prudent? Is it a risk? Is it how you see things? Because we're just trying
to figure out how your company is guiding versus the old Xerox.
<A - William F. Osbourn>: Yeah, this is Bill. I'll start with that question, and as you know, we gave a lot of detail in
the prepared remarks and everything. But from a high level, what I think about is we came in at $0.88 on an adjusted
EPS for 2016. When you factor in known differences up front, whether the lower interest expense, the higher effective
tax rate, more foreign currency headwinds, you effectively have a net $0.10 off of that $0.88, and you're starting at

$0.78.
And then you look through just the various cost transformation initiatives to help fund potential future growth, and
based upon our detailed analyses we believe that gets us to an additional $0.10 upside which gets you to an $0.80 to
$0.88. So at a high level, that's the way we think about it. We think it's an appropriate and reasonable guidance range
based upon what we know at this time. With that said, just as I said in the prepared comments about Q1 being 20%
typically, but a little bit negative impacted this year by foreign currency and the timing of the product launch, the
full-year guidance is also dependent upon a successful product launch, both from a timing perspective and customer
demand. But based upon everything we know now in our detailed analyses, we believe it's a reasonable range.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah, and, Jim, our leadership philosophy is if something were to get worse in the external
markets, we're just going to do more. And just go with the productivity even harder to make up for it. We started the
year, we looked at the guidance originally months ago, we didn't know we were going to have $120 million of currency
headwinds, and that's why you're seeing the productivity initiative so high.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you very much for the details.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Jim. Operator, next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Going back to the Transformation savings program, can you
outline what the sources of upside were in your savings of $550 million in the year compared to your $500 million
target? And how your views on 2017 savings have changed at the increment, acknowledging that you're for now
sticking to your original $600 million savings target?
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: I'm sorry, George, we missed the last part. Could you repeat that please? We just want to
make sure we heard you right.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Yeah, just how your views on your 2017 savings have changed at the increment?
<A - William F. Osbourn>: It comes from a lot of different factors, but as I said, one of the big things is that we're
clearly, first of all, last year the whole program started in the February timeframe. We have the benefit of being up and
running and it starting as of the beginning, it'll be the full year. But we also purposely are front-ending a lot of our
restructuring initiatives and expect to get benefits within the year from a lot of that. So that will have an incremental
impact. That alone.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah. And again when you look at the de-layering of the organization, we've gone from
about 11 layers down to seven layers. If you look at the things we've been doing in technical service, those things are
starting to hit now. Obviously, as we discussed, we have $225 million restructuring. We're going to do a lot of that in
the first quarter, $125 million of the $225 million, so as Bill mentioned, we have a head start versus last year, we've got
runway, we've got wraparound benefits from 2016 flowing into 2017, and George, we're hitting it pretty hard.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, George.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Got it. That's helpful. And for your upcoming product launch, can you elaborate on your
2017 and 2018 timeline in terms of the cadence of when those products will come out? And what the margin mix
impact could be based on your mix of new products and entry made in the high-end?
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah, so the vast majority, almost all of them, George, should be into our supply chain. I'm
going to underline into our supply chain, by the end of the first half of the year. Then they obviously will start flowing
into our resellers' supply chains and to the direct users in the second half of the year. And that's why Bill commented
we'll see the equipment sale revenue benefits year-over-year in the second half and the flow-through of the post-sale in

From a margin standpoint, as we all know in this industry, A4, obviously you mix down the entire industry when you
sell the A4. You lose money on the hardware; you make money in the post-sale. We've contemplated that mix in terms
of what we're doing from a Strategic Transformation on the cost side to offset that. Additionally, as we're selling more
into the SMB markets, we would expect the margins there to be healthier than they would be in the enterprise. So
net-net we should be okay, and we've contemplated that in our guidance.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, George. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Yes. Thanks. Good morning and I appreciate the details and the crisp messaging today. Two
questions if I could real quickly here. Can you remind us how we should think about the strategic growth initiatives in
terms of how they compare to your legacy business from a cash flow perspective? Do you get better cash attach for
these new initiatives? Or do you have to sell more installs?
And then secondly is more tactical. The conservatism around the first half of the year, I know you're not giving explicit
guidance, but your guidance you did provide around the contribution for earnings for the first quarter, is that related to
conservatism just post-split? I know it's two different companies, but HP, Inc. kind of hit an air pocket when they kind
of misread their P&L replenishment post their split a year-and-a-half or so ago. Is there any sort of dynamic you're
trying to brace for there? Or is it just more of the aforementioned factors around the high-end versus low-end in the
new product launches? Thank you.
<A - William F. Osbourn>: Yeah, I'll address the second part of the question regarding conservatism. The comments
regarding Q1 and the relative history, being about 20% of the total and the headwinds are what we're seeing, is our best
estimate right now. I think your question is getting to, is the any distractions as a result of the recent split? And really
we're not – we don't see any. We're not factoring any of that in really as far as the first quarter. It's really just what we're
seeing as far as our buildup and what sort of headwinds we see.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah. And, Mark, we don't envision the margins or the cash being any different in our
strategic growth areas. If you look at them, it's Managed Print Services and Workflow Automation where we've been
operating the business for a long time; production color, where we're a leader, and certainly in the A4 MFPs. Those will
be going into the channel where we've been working with, and as we said, the margins and the SMB business to some
extent should be better than they are in the enterprise. So net-net we should be okay.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Mark.
Jennifer Horsley
That's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. Jeff, anything more to wrap up?
Jeffrey Jacobson
No. Thanks, Jennifer. And thank you all for your questions. As I said earlier, we are a new Xerox and we really are
excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We have a well-defined strategy to pursue the growth areas of the market
while we continue to advance our Strategic Transformation program. This combination will provide the headroom we
need to enhance margins as we invest for growth to change the trajectory of our revenue. Our team is very focused and
we're confident in our ability to meet our commitments. We look forward to updating you on our progress and I want to
thank you all for joining our call today.
