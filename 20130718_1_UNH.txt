I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group,
Stephen Hemsley.
Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning. And thank you for joining us this morning to review our first half 2013 and the longer-term future we
continue to build at UnitedHealth Group.
The performance of the quarter and the first half of this year reflect many of the themes we are focusing on with
intensity across UnitedHealth Group: growing by serving more people with higher and more consistent quality, with
compassion and a better more modern and personal consumer experience; making healthcare more affordable by
enabling the healthcare consumer, the care provider and the system itself to become a more effective system of health
and wellness; advancing the performance and value of this enterprise for fiscal shareholders through operating and
capital disciplines in both growth and strategic diversification as well as dividend and share recapture.
We see several of these elements in our first half performance in a number of ways such as the consistent, broad-based
growth across each of our market-facing business groups, medical cost trends that have remained in check and will help
to keep health benefits affordable, the increasing pace in product innovation and adoption as nearly 6 million
consumers now embrace our incentive product designs and our rapidly growing portfolio of consumer tools. The rapid
acceleration of deeper and more integrated performance-based payment providers that will reach above $25 billion by
this year-end, and the increase in our dividend to more than $1 billion annually, even as we sustain $3 billion in share
buybacks.
We have a great deal more to do. We are far from performing to our potential. Although we are seeing steady
advancements on many fronts, we are redoubling our commitment to consistent execution in the core fundamentals of
our businesses. We are determined to accelerate the pace of innovation and the adoption of simpler and more modern
approaches and technologies and ever-better approaches to consistently delivering higher quality care and access and to
make healthcare more understandable and affordable for both the individual consumer and for our society.
Our performance in the first half of 2013 was characterized by this growing business momentum, continued service
expansion and diversification across the enterprise. In the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned $1.40 per share,
up 10% year-over-year with revenues over $30.4 billion, up 11.5% year-over-year. As expected, the consolidated
operating margin decreased slightly year-over-year by 30 basis points as the consolidated medical care ratio increased
20 basis points to 81.5%, reflecting our continued strong growth and diversification into government benefit programs.
In accelerating growth from our services, international and fee-based businesses produced a 90 basis-point rise in the
consolidated operating ratio to 15.9%. The level of services growth has become so meaningful that it continue to
outstrip steady efficiency gains from our multiyear initiatives enhancing quality, simplicity and system wide
productivity as well as our concentrated focus on cost management across UnitedHealthcare, Optum and UnitedHealth
Group.
While this ratio has increased, it remains largely a reflection of the ongoing growth and diversification across
UnitedHealth Group. Cash flows from operations were $1.5 billion in the quarter and $2.5 billion through six months.
We decreased our debt-to-total capital ratio by 160 basis points during the quarter to 34.6% at June 30 and ended the
quarter with $1.2 billion in available cash.
Last month, our board increased our dividend by 32% to an annual rate of $1.12 per share and renewed our share
repurchase program with a fresh authorization for the repurchase of 110 million shares. These decisions reflect
confidence in the strength and consistency of our underlying earnings and cash generation capacities into the future.
In the current quarter, UnitedHealth Group continued its pattern of steady, consistent growth and market share gains.
And we see more growth to come in the next few years in areas such as commercial and consumer benefits, through
public and private exchanges, Medicare Advantage, state Medicaid expansions, Medicaid long-term care, dual eligible
MMEs, military and veteran benefits and services, the emerging Brazilian market and the continuing maturation of

Optum's broad range of services for consumers, care providers, payers and other participants in the health system as a
whole.
Let's review second quarter business results starting with UnitedHealthcare where the story remains one of remarkable
growth and continued market share gains. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has been the fastest growing
health benefits company, increasing the number of people served by more than 9 million. This includes more than 2.9
million people in TRICARE and another 4.7 million people from Amil in Brazil, both new markets for us.
Overall growth has been driven by offering distinct and innovative consumer benefits and services shaped to respond to
local market needs and affordable price points for consumers. UnitedHealthcare has designed a comprehensive system
of capability that aligns modern incentive-based benefit designs with easy and convenient consumer empowerment
tools that engage effective clinical care and wellness programs, which in turn channel naturally into incentivized
performance-based care delivery access. This aligned system leverages better informed and incentive consumer and
care provider behaviors to produce sustainable costs and performance advantages and deeper, more innovative
relationships with consumers, care providers and plan sponsors across all market segments.
Effective incentive alignment with consumer benefits through to care provider rewards is a critical component to
sustainably improving broader accountability and effective payer to care provider integration. We are the market
leaders in consumer value plans with nearly 6 million high deductible or consumer incentive plans in force. We are
leaders in consumer transparency tools with innovative mobile applications that enable effective use of information
specific to each consumer. We're further along in value-based care provider contracting than any other company and
our pace is accelerating with more than $50 billion in accountable care performance contracts expected by 2017 if not
sooner. These programs offer varying levels of integration with care providers, depending on their ability to affect
health outcomes and assume financial risk. Year by year, these programs are helping transform how healthcare is
delivered, paid for and rewarded.
This quarter, UnitedHealthcare's organic growth was led by the initiation of services for TRICARE in the west region,
for 2.9 million members in the military and their families. This is the first time this contract has moved to a new service
provider in more than 15 years, and we encountered challenges as we engaged in this complex and massive transition.
We have learned from these initial challenges and regret any disruption this may have caused the men and women we
are privileged to serve.
And we're deeply grateful for the collaborative working relationship with the Department of Defense, the TRICARE
Management Activity, the TRICARE Regional Office – West and the Surgeon Generals of the respective services, the
military treatment facilities and their fine leaders. Having quickly advanced from these initial challenges, we remain
committed to consistent excellent service and the value of innovation going forward for these programs.
UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual business added a net 235,000 people year-to-date and is performing
strongly across the board. Growth continues to be strong across the government benefit markets as well. Through the
first half of the year, UnitedHealthcare remains the largest and once again fastest growing Medicare Advantage
participant and Part D and Medicare Supplement both continue to perform strongly.
Medicare Advantage products have grown to serve 355,000 more people through the first six months and our full array
of Medicare product offerings has grown to serve over 1 million more seniors this year. Medicaid growth stands at
110,000 people through the first six months despite a divestiture impacting 60,000 people earlier this year.
Care for chronic, complex populations remains a distinctive capability for this business and a major forward growth
driver, with recent awards to serve long-term care of dual eligible beneficiaries in Arizona, Florida, New Mexico, New
York, Ohio and Washington state.
For the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare generated operating earnings of $1.9 billion with solid contributions from all
businesses. The commercial medical care ratio improved 10 basis points year-over-year. We are performing slightly
better on outpatient costs despite the continued migration of clinical services from inpatient settings. We continue to
experience lower hospital inpatient usage, as we expected, and inpatient costs are in line with our projections. Overall,
2013 full-year commercial cost trends are tracking in line with our initial projections of 5% to 6% with unit prices

remaining the core driver of the increases.
UnitedHealthcare's results include Amil, which is now 90% owned. With Amil, our international business has grown to
serve 260,000 more consumers in the first half of the year, remains solidly ahead of its growth and financial plans for
the year and it is well positioned to continue growth and market share gains driven by its distinctive market offerings
and clinical engagement model.
We continued to be gratified by the growing response to Optum's market-leading offerings and capabilities. Each of
Optum's businesses posted double-digit top-line gains. And overall Optum revenue rose 21% over last year. Operating
margin expanded 170 basis points to 6.1%, despite the increasing mix of pharmacy services revenues. As of today, we
are more than halfway through our pharmacy migration. And since January 1, OptumRx serves a total of about 8
million new consumers, including these migrations and new business.
For the first six months of the year total Optum operating earnings rose 80% to just over $1 billion. Optum's strong first
half 2013 performance is proving that the broader health system and its constituencies create a natural end market for
services, a market we have sized at more than $500 billion annually. Historically this market has been fragmented and
served primarily by smaller single-point solutions. We see the opportunity to bring together the services and
capabilities we offer and provide broader, more integrated solutions to larger, more diverse clients while continuing to
deliver even more effective standalone products and services to our traditional customer base.
We are focusing our investments on roughly 10 product families and freeing up resources through this more disciplined
focus and the related productivity gains to fund further development and innovation on behalf of the clients and
consumers we serve. These actions are driving stronger and more consistent margin performance across all Optum's
businesses.
The collective performance of our diverse UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses ultimately comes through in
UnitedHealth Group's strong overall results. As we indicated earlier in our commentary, UnitedHealth Group
consolidated revenues grew 11.5% and net earnings grew 10% to $1.40 per share in the second quarter. We expect full
year 2013 net earnings in the tighter range of $5.35 to $5.50 per share. Our second half earnings performance will
benefit from the timing of Part D earnings and contributions and Optum's continued performance gains.
Our balance sheet is strong, and our cash flows from operations are expected in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion
this year. We already targeted returning up to $4 billion of that to shareholders and our recent dividend increase now
puts us at an annual dividend payment pace of more than $1 billion.
Looking forward, our outlook remains consistent, strongly positive in the long term with familiar near-term challenges
coming in 2014 and 2015 as we indicated last quarter. We expect pressure on the pace of revenue growth next year,
given both rate and membership pressures in Medicare Advantage. We see further business and product integration
advances, further medical affordability gains an intense focus on driving lower operating costs to improve and sustain
our competitive positions, serving key health benefit markets and continuing strong cash flows.
The next phases of the Affordable Care Act should be growth and expansion in the Medicaid business as well as to
Optum and some meaningful financial challenges as well. For instance on the Medicare side, the challenges intensify
meaningfully and include nondeductible taxes combined with the continued significant underfunding of Medicare
Advantage. We remain committed to Medicare Advantage as the most valuable and fastest growing Medicare benefit
offering available to American seniors. By 2016, Medicare Advantage will in effect be reimbursed at parity with
original fee-for-service Medicare. And at the same time, it will continue to deliver better benefits at lower costs because
of effective medical cost management and far better consumer focused services and technologies, none of which are
present in the current Medicare fee-for-service system.
2016 should represent a final baseline pivot for Medicare growth for years to come, and America's demographic trends
are compelling. Well more than 3 million people will enter Medicare each year and UnitedHealth Group is uniquely
positioned to emerge as the market leader. These long-term growth trends informed our approach to our 2014 Medicare
bids, which will remain under review by CMS through the summer. Our decisions for 2014 focused on balancing
program sustainability, margin protection and cash flow generation of our MA business, measured on a long-term

multiyear basis. We are aggressively and consistently addressing the operating and marketing costs of our Medicare
programs without compromising the exceptional support and services we offer to the seniors we are serving through
these important benefits.
The depth of the underfunding of these benefits to seniors is causing us to exit certain market areas, reduce the number
of plan offerings and reduce benefits in the majority of the local markets we serve, commensurate with our view of the
competitive position and long-term sustainability of our services for each individual market. We are shaping our
networks to ensure we are delivering healthcare with local care provider partners who deliver high quality care and
provide a sustainably low medical cost structure and who increasingly share in the results of collaborative efforts to
bring greater quality and consistency of care to seniors including the most elderly and those with chronic conditions.
These steps can be expected to moderate member growth in 2014 in contrast to our strong growth experience over the
last few years. We will engage our members further by increasing our use of in-home health reviews and in-home
services. Even with these actions, we expect pressure on 2014 Medicare Advantage margins. The severe underfunding
of the MA program for 2014 combined with the ACA tax impacts and continued sequestration effects are too
significant a burden to ask seniors to bear alone and still expect this important franchise to remain attractive to them.
Beyond Medicare Advantage and some remaining unknowns focused around ACA implementation in the individual
and small group markets, we expect the general narrative of UnitedHealth Group's performance for 2014 to be largely
the same as 2013. Our commercial benefits, international, Medicaid and military businesses should all continue to
perform well. Optum will continue to grow strongly and contribute comparatively more of our overall performance as
virtually every Optum business and product line is growing and performing well and is expected to continue on that
path.
We will continue to be good stewards of shareholder capital, continuing to balance investments across our businesses
and returning more capital to shareholders in both dividends and share repurchase. From 1999 through the end of 2013,
we have returned more than $40 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, even as we have
grown and enriched the capabilities, the market positions, the value and the forward potential of this enterprise.
We remain optimistic about our capacity to serve society and to create value for the people and customers we serve as
well as for the health system at large. We look forward to an expanding discussion of our strategy, growth and
performance at our investor conference, which this year will be on December 3 in New York.
As usual this morning, we have a full complement of leaders here and would ask the operator to open the call to our
questions, holding one per speaker, please. Thank you.

We'll take our first question from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Hi. Yes, thank you. I wanted to just ask a bit little more about Medicare Advantage. You
made a comment, if I heard it correctly, about final baseline EBIT in 2016 as a base for growth once – once we're at –
fully at parity. Did I hear that correctly? Do you – are you implying that EBIT is – in Medicare Advantage is down
from – on a downward slope in 2014 and 2015 and then normalizing in 2016 and growing from there?

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, well, I'm glad you asked the question because I don't think that – if it went out that
way, that's not what our intent was. Basically, continued funding pressures – some of the mechanical impact of the
ACA and so forth will continue basically to get the funding mechanisms for Medicare Advantage to be at parity with
fee for service.
Once that funding is leveled at that basis, the programs are thought to then be neutral to each other from that
perspective and therefore, one could expect, given the strong performance of the Medicare Advantage program, that the
growth could even accelerate from that point because you've got this significant demographic trend. You have a very
attractive program and the Medicare Advantage program will still have meaningful advantages in terms of benefits,
medical management capacities, consumer engagement and relationship capacities that the fee-for-service system
simply doesn't have right now.
So that's why I think that our outlook on Medicare Advantage in the long term is so positive because, in essence, we
have to navigate through these next couple of years where some of the mechanical funding actions will take place. But
even in those periods, and those have been, in my view, in effect, Medicare Advantage has continued as a broad
national program to prosper and grow.
So I don't know how it will play out in 2014 and 2015 as these elements play out in the funding, to get funding in
essence to neutrality. But from 2016 forward, that neutrality should then baseline this program, and it will be Medicare
Advantage with its, I think, compelling advantages compared to the fee-for-service system. And we think the prospects
for growth after that are quite compelling. That's really why what we tried to get across.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Yeah. That makes sense. You also characterized in terms of next year that the impact
would be to moderate member growth for 2014. Do you imply by that, that you do expect growth but it's just at a
slower rate?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, we really didn't comment at that direction. What we were intending to say is that
actions that we are taking to make sure that program is competitive and viable and in as many markets as we can
possibly continue to advance it. So along those lines, we outlined a series of steps we're taking, and maybe Jack Larsen
wants to comment on that.
But again, we are focused on operating that program to its maximum potential and serving as many of American
seniors that we can through that program and making sure that it continues to perform in terms of growth, margin
protection, cash flow attributes, et cetera. And to maximum the performance of the program, recognizing the funding
pressure that is on and recognizing that there might be limitations to how much seniors can actually bear of the
underfunding actions that are being taken with respect to the program. Jack?
<A - Jack Larsen>: Thanks, Steve. So I would just add maybe a bit of an exclamation point on some of the changes
that we're contemplating for our business next year, and I think Steve went through them well. We're looking at
benefits. We're going to be adjusting our planning – some market withdrawals I think at the more modest end, perhaps
5% or so with most of those members having an opportunity to enroll in another UnitedHealthcare plan. We'll be
narrowing our networks consistent with achieving better costs, better outcomes and better management of our stars.
And you know, Matt, we haven't really seen how our competitors are taking to all of this too.
So I would say at this distance, I think the only thing we can really say is that our performance at the membership
growth line is likely to be more moderate compared to the last couple of two or three years where we have grown very
well.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Justin Lake>: Thanks. Good morning. First, just wanted to check and see if there's any updated view you can
share with us on 2014 EPS growth overall.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, Justin, we thought that question might come up. We don't really comment on next
year's guidance in the current mid-year quarter. I would say that with that said, earnings growth is clearly our focus for
2014, and we are intense about that. But we have to recognize that there is a great deal in front of us to achieve that. As
we just mentioned, certainly strength think Medicare Advantage given the significant 2014 funding shortfall and the
steps we need to take to make sure that program continues to be vital is on the front of the list of that.
There's also ongoing work in the commercial markets with pressures on our own Individual business, the continued
market migration to lower price point insurance products and fee-based conversions. And those are all occurring kind
of in the backdrop of a normal competitive dynamics intentions. We remain respectful of medical cost trends, despite
the success in keeping trends in check, and particularly given the measured economic recovery.
We need to make continued investments in Optum, in the emerging categories of private exchanges, Medicare risk and
revenue cycle, house calls, ever larger and longer-term care provider relationships, Optum Cloud products. And in
general, we are committed to continuing to fund ongoing innovation and adoption.
And then lastly when I think about headwinds, in investment income we'll see probably short term pressure as current
portfolios actually turn over and transition from kind of capital gain realization mode into higher yielding portfolios for
the longer term.
So with that series of headwinds in front of us, experience has taught to us to be somewhat cautious and to be sure we
consider and respond to these headwinds before we offer a sense of 2014. So we are not prepared to do that, but I
would say we are intensely focused on solid earnings growth for 2014. But we have to work our way through that as we
stand really in the mid-year of 2013.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Great. And then my actual question was more just a follow-up on Medicare Advantage. Just to
make sure I'm clear on what you're – what you've laid out here is. You feel like 2014 and 2015 are looking like a
obviously – are going to be under pressure. So but by the end of 2015 going into 2016, do you expect that 2016 growth
to reaccelerate and you feel like you'll still with – after all this pressure given what you're doing from a cost perspective
and managing, you're going to have – you feel like the benefit that you still have left out there for seniors after these
costs will still be enticing and you expect growth to be in line with what you've seen over the last couple of years and
potentially even accelerate? Was that the correct takeaway?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think you generally have it correct. I think you may have a more precise notion of it than
we would, having to operate the program. So I can't tell you that on January 1, 2016 that there will be some kind of
light will go on, et cetera. But you have exactly the direction of our thinking on this program correctly that as we
navigate through the next couple years and the pressures that I think are well acknowledged on the program, we intend
to operate it in such a way that we are maintaining the vitality of that program, protecting its margins, maintaining the
vitality of its benefits and its distinctions to consumers to seniors that need these programs and that we think that as you
reach that point of neutrality, which is about 2016, that the growth dynamics of that should accelerate, yes.
<Q - Justin Lake>: And, Steve, do you think the program will be bigger than it is today or smaller than it is given
what's facing you when you get to 2016? And that's it for me.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: That's the third installment of your single question. Obviously, Justin, from that discussion
we expect in the long term that the needs of American seniors and what the values we can bring to the Medicare
program suggest that is a very strong long-term growth platform.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Great. Thanks.

And we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: Good morning. I just want to follow-up on Medicare Advantage again and make sure. I
understand what you're talking about on reimbursement and the pressures in 2014 and 2015. But when we think about
the business near term, particularly fourth quarter this year and how you market to seniors, will you take your foot off
the accelerator somewhat in terms of marketing or do you think have you to accelerate the spending this year to
maintain what you have and potentially grow? And if you could give us any context on how the spending might change
year to year, that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, I might offer and take it at my level that how we're going to approach and deploy
resources in the market from a marketing point of view at this point in time is really I would say a level of competitive
intimacy that I'd rather not share. I would say that our commentary was more along the lines of the fact that we are
going to be shaping networks to be more focused, to really focus on the high-performance assets as it relates to seniors,
that the benefit reductions that are fairly broad-based. Those are the elements that I think will play into more
conservative growth prospects for 2014. I think that getting into what our marketing plan is might be a little bit more
than we would like to get into this morning.
<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure.
Operator
And we'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Thanks. Maybe I'll switch gears a little bit. There has been some developments obviously around the
ACA since we last had you guys on the conference call. The employer mandate delays, some documentation delays and
then we've also gotten information on the exchanges in some states. I know you've said you'd be opportunistic,
particularly around the exchanges. Can you comment about, A, does any of those developments that have occurred in
the last few months change your perspective on those opportunities that are available to you maybe looking out next
year and beyond for the ACA?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: You know, I think I'll have Gail and then Jeff Alter kind of comment on that. I would say
again like to calibrate the perspective we're bringing to it, long term we're positive with respect to those channels as
they form and as they become areas where we think we can participate and add value. The near-term dynamics are
more challenging for us and maybe that's specific to our particular profile of business. So near term we have tended to
be more cautious with respect to those and I think generally the elements that have been occurring reinforce those
tendencies.
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Good morning. It's Gail Boudreaux. I think Steve hit on the core principals. We've
been, I think, modest in our participation in the exchanges, but I think the bigger story, quite frankly, is there is
significant change going on across the overall commercial market. So as we think about our business, we're focused
both inside and outside of the exchange around affordable benefit offerings for our consumers. So what we're talking
about in terms of our network and our intentional integration of product, clinical and network strategies is really core to
both what we're doing inside and out of the exchange.
We're participating in about a dozen exchanges, as you can see from what's been publicly disclosed. And quite frankly,
at this stage of the game we've kept a very disciplined process around that. We think that there's a huge opportunity
over the long term and we're going to participate to learn in those exchanges.
In terms of what's happened on the overall reform implementation, at this stage we're preparing our business. And as I
said, much of what we're doing we're doing for both inside and outside the exchange because we think affordability and
consumer engagement are probably the most critical pieces.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Great. I just wanted to understand a little better this year's guidance. You know, you
guys reported a quarter which beat at least consensus numbers by $0.15, but it looks like you're only raising guidance
by $0.05 at the midpoint. So I wanted to understand a little bit how you thought about guidance. If there's anything that
you thought of in the back half of the year that might be a headwind that maybe you weren't anticipating before or
maybe the market wasn't anticipating?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I don't think so and I might have Dave comment on that. But in essence, we tend to
operate within a range and feel comfortable in that range. I think excessive precision here is – time has taught us to be
careful about that and to in essence be prudent with respect to the guidance that's offered. I would say that the
performance of the business has been strong through the first half. And while the orientation of the business was more
challenging to the second half, we are pretty much on course and had – saw no reason to do anything other than tighten
range of guidance.
<A - David S. Wichmann>: Right. So, Kevin, it's Dave. If you kind of parse through this, the range of $5.35 to $5.50
per share suggests that the second half of the year will be not only stronger than the first half of this year but also
stronger than the comparative half year in 2012. And as we kind of commented on in the first quarter, that's largely due
to the change in the seasonal pattern of Part D revenue and profit recognition.
While Steve had it right, there's very modest additional pressure on the back half of the year, I think we've already
pointed some of these out, but just to keep in mind obviously the last half of the year has two quarters of the
sequestration impact versus the first half of the year only having one, as an example.
And then of course as you also see, we have a uptick in a run rate of our growth patterns in the business as well, so that
requires some investment not only in terms of selling but also in terms of implementation. And then Steve did mention
the near-term impact on the higher interest rates than the impact that they have had on our ability to recognize the
extent of capital gains that we have in the past.
And then the last thing I'd just point out is our tax rate will return to a 36.75% level for Q3 and Q4, which will
comparatively impact earnings in the last half of the year.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Okay. But I guess except for maybe higher interest rates, none of those sound
necessarily new, like new headwinds, per se.
<A - David S. Wichmann>: Yeah, I was just trying to give you some...
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: No. I just think we're trying to establish a prudent balance, I think consistent with what our
posture has been for the last several years, and the businesses continue to perform well. And Optum in particular is
having a very, very strong year. But we didn't really see a need to change the guidance, other than to tighten range,
given the fact we only have a half year left.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Okay, perfect. Thanks.

And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joshua Raskin>: Hi. Thanks. Just taking a look at the SG&A changes, they came in a little higher than what we

second. And I see the TRICARE piece of it, but I'm just curious, what's driving that? Was there any discretionary
spending? Any acceleration of planned spending that you thought would be coming? And maybe within that, if you
could just give us a baseline to start with the TRICARE revenue contribution, that would be helpful.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Dave, do you want to respond to that?
<A - David S. Wichmann>: Sure. Hi, Josh. So the operating cost ratio is up 90 basis points year-over-year. It was very
much in line with our expectations for this quarter. We mentioned in the script that there's several things contributing to
that ratio, predominantly related to business exchanges. As you know, we had one large funding conversion from risk
to fee in the first quarter that obviously will continue to impact us throughout the year. We've also added Amil, which
has a higher SG&A ratio, and obviously we didn't have Amil in the second quarter of last year.
TRICARE of course, fee-based contract as well continuing cost of implementation through the second quarter. Again,
not in place last year and, of course, Optum is growing very quickly. And of course, most of that business is service
oriented and fee based as well.
The only thing I'd point out beyond that, which is all in the script really is there's continued costs of implementation for
PPACA, ICD 10, the TRICARE implementation and the PBM migration. Those are all items that are inside our
numbers for the second quarter. And those for the most part are associated with improved growth prospects for the
business going forward. So we're pleased to make those investments.
The last thing I'll just say is that, as indicated in the script, that obviously all of these things have offset what this
management team has done over the past several years. But in particular, in the last year around cost containment
efforts and have done a very nice job of advancing the productivity of the business and really meeting the impact of this
mix shift on this operating cost ratio.
<Q - Joshua Raskin>: Got you. I was looking, Dave, a bit more at just 1Q increase versus 2Q increase. It looks like
there was just sort of a pickup the second quarter. I understand a lot of the implementation costs and the funding
conversion and Amil and the implementation – and I know a lot of that is impacting first quarter as well. So I was just
curious what caused sort of the 70-basis point increase in the year-over-year in 2Q? And I'm trying to figure out if
TRICARE was big enough to do that. My guess is as a fee-based business it probably wasn't big enough to cause that
change.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I don't think there's anything from our perspective that's out of line in there. I think it
is the continued progression in mix. I think Optum continues to be a larger overall factor, and I'm not sure everybody
can actually calculate the impact of that. But I think that is probably the largest contributing factor that the business is
all operating expenses and it's growing at a very solid rate. So I think it is – as we have analyzed it, it is
overwhelmingly mix. Even in the items in terms of regulatory and so forth are basically in these numbers
year-over-year and in them sequentially.
So there's nothing in that that we see out of line or outside of our expectations or plans for the year other than probably
an even higher level of performance on the part of our services business, which includes, not just Optum, but also the
fee – the significant growth in continued fee-based businesses across UnitedHealthcare. That's where all their
commercial growth has been.
<Q - Joshua Raskin>: Okay, thanks.
<A - John S. Penshorn>: Josh, it's John Penshorn. Last November, we said 15.9% plus or minus 30 basis points. That
range we affirm and that accommodates the accelerated growth in fee-based services Steve referred to.
<Q - Joshua Raskin>: Okay. Thanks, John.

We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter Costa>: Hi, guys. Can you go over for us how OptumRx growth is helping the firm exactly? We can see it
on OptumRx but some of the improvement bleeds over into the commercial side of the business. What portion is on the
commercial side of the business? And what portion is in OptumRx itself? And then can you talk about the growth path
of OptumRx in 2014 and 2015?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I'll have Dirk respond to that. I mean, it is perfectly in line with the OptumRx's
agenda on synchronization and the impact it has extending into total medical cost. So Dirk, do you want to comment?
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Yeah. Let's start off by talking about the business. I think if you look, our RFP volume is up a
little bit year-over-year. And if you look at what we see, we don't see a lot of the business changing hands across the
PBM space. But what we do see, we're actually getting a little more than our fair share and our retention has been
pretty good. So if you look at what we try to do, we try to manage total health outcomes as well as our – as well as
improving the cost of care. And we do that, so largely with our synchronization approach we bring all the data together
and optimize the overall spend. So we think that, in addition to our specialty offering in the marketplace is resonating
very well.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So that bleeds through to performance for UnitedHealthcare and its businesses and
obviously for our government programs. So it does, we think, make us distinctive with respect to medical cost trends,
with respect to that section of medical costs, drug, as well as a growing and vital and more diversified PBM business
that we think the potential once this migration is fully digested and we can focus our full attentions to the external
marketplace, I think the growth prospects of that can be quite impressive.
<Q - Peter Costa>: Can you quantify for us in any way how much of the improving MLR on the commercial side
comes from bringing the Optum business in house?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: You know, I think that we would be – it would be too much of a back of the envelope kind
of response. So we'll take that offline, and we'll bring that kind of thing perhaps back in the next – in our next quarter,
we'll comment specifically on the impact of that. I just don't want to shoot from the hip on something like that. So I
think it's a very good question, and I think we'll take it that way, if that's okay with you?
<Q - Peter Costa>: That's fine. Thank you very much.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you.

And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sarah James>: Thank you. There's obviously a robust conversation going on with parties in DC around the
sufficiency of 2014 Medicare rates and how that may influence 2014 budgets and rates. Can you give us a read on what
you see as the current perception in DC of the adequacy of 2014 rates? Initially it seemed that they viewed 2014 as
more positive than you view it. So I wanted to see if the perception in DC has changed throughout your discussions
with them, and if you could give us a read on the level of their receptivity compared to previous years to the
information you're presenting on where rates should be going forward?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: You know, that is a – that would be a challenging kind of conversation to have in a forum
like this. I would say this a in a very constructive way that access to the – to the administration, CMS administration,
HHS and so forth, has been – has always been open and fair, and constructive dialogue and conversation.
They obviously pursue a variety of protocols in establishing the rate process. It is a complicated process. It's
multifaceted. So it's not really possible to have a single conversation about elements such as that. I think our positions
with respect to the funding patterns on Medicare Advantage are well articulated and supported, and there is an open
dialogue about that and that dialogue is occurring, in essence, all year long.

So I do think it's an environment where the parties are working together. I think there is a recognition of the – of the
role that Medicare Advantage plays in the marketplace. And I would describe the conversations as very professional
and productive, and I think we would have to leave it at that.
It is not what I would characterize as some kind of contentious environment at all. These are extraordinarily
professional people in the administration that are trying to administer these programs in accordance with the protocols
that have been established and to the best of their capacities. And we are having an ongoing business dialog with them
on this subject. So I think that's all we can really comment. And that happens in states as well. In Medicaid it's just the
nature of the market.

And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks. Good morning. First just wanted to make sure I heard correct that you're planning on
exiting 5% of MA markets next year. And if possible, if that's correct, can you give us a sense of what percentage of
MA enrollment that represents today?
And then second, separately, just wondering, has the delay in the employer mandate changed or would you expect it to
change the discussion at all with employers? You know, I guess it would be helpful just to get a sense of how your
discussions are going with employers? Is there more push back? Is there confusion? Is there concern, et cetera? Just
trying to get a broad sense of the appetite to make changes due to ACA near term? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Let's take Medicare first.
<A - Jack Larsen>: Hey, Ralph. Jack Larsen. So the 5% does relate to our membership and I really wouldn't call them
market exits as much as plan withdrawals. So about 150,000 or so of our members will be affected by member
withdrawals, but in turn, about 80-plus% of those members will have access to another UnitedHealthcare MA product.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Okay. That's helpful.
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Hi, Ralph. This is Gail Boudreaux. There are a number of questions I think
embedded around the employer mandate. So let me address that one first and see if I get to your issues. So in terms of
the delay of the employer mandates, we don't really think that's going to have a significant impact. Employers who
currently offer insurance are going to continue to do that, and that's been the course of our discussions.
In terms of how our discussions are going with employers, there is a lot of change coming to that marketplace and the
intense focus is around affordability, as I said earlier. Not just on the exchanges but across all of our customers, they're
looking at value-based plan designs, getting consumers much more engaged, how they integrate clinical programs. So I
would say the real focus is around affordability of coverage and improving consumer engagement in making sure they
have really value for the dollars they spend.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Okay. Thank you.

year as one might have thought. So I guess the first question is, is that – the first part of the question is, is that the
correct interpretation that now that you've gone through all of this, you've affirmed your commitment to the program
long term, post 2013, which I think was the point of that discussion, that you're able to find ways to mitigate the impact
on both the beneficiary and the company of what is a dramatic underfunding of MA?
And then the second question I have relates to capital deployment. Given that discussion about MA, can you either give
us a sense of where you see the most attractive segments of your market or new opportunities be they international or
existing opportunities like Optum, like commercial, et cetera, where you think are the highest best uses of the capital
that you're not already returning to shareholders?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. First of all, and a very good observation, which I'd like to make sure we bring in
line. I think our view in terms of Medicare Advantage is really not different than we had indicated last quarter. We
believe that program is severely underfunded for 2014. The comments that we're making if you parse them are that we
are exiting certain markets, we're exiting certain plans, we're narrowing our networks across virtually all the markets.
We're taking benefits down across all of the markets. So those are not good things for American seniors who engage on
these benefits. And those elements will clearly put pressure on both top line for 2014 on Medicare Advantage, an
important program for us, and on the margins of that program. So to level set on that basis, that's, I think, what we said
clearly.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: That's what I thought you said.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And we will work through those things, and we are absolutely intense on this program
because we think it has a meaningful long-term value to American seniors and to basically the viability of the Medicare
program in total going forward because it brings in market dynamics around managing medical costs, around engaging
consumers, around holding care providers accountable, elements such as that. That along – plays to our competencies.
It should be a strong long-term market so long as the program is funded appropriately. If it is not funded appropriately
then those market dynamics will change.
So I don't think anything has changed about that. We have just worked one more quarter through the tactics of how we
will have to navigate through 2014. So to level set that, we are – what we see pressure in 2014 and 2015 on Medicare
Advantage as a product, we're working through those. The program, in our view, has not been funded strongly in the
past and 2014 was very significant. It's a 750-basis points delta in what we see the cost of that program to be.
In terms of allocating capital, we have a diversified model. And that strategy of diversification is a conscious one with a
notion of allocating capital opportunistically across the spectrum of that diversified model. We see compelling
opportunities and have in the Optum business. There are opportunities that will emerge, we think, in the benefits
businesses. And we think that they will emerge over time as more pressure is brought into the overall health benefits
marketplace. And we look for opportunities where we can deploy our three competencies around local care market
engagement, around information and around enabling technology in international settings.
We found Brazil to be a compelling opportunity for that, particularly on our Optum services side. There's probably
more market opportunities for us on the international side and we'll continue to look for benefits. But that is going to be
probably more opportunistic because we don't see as many of those, other than in Optum. I think Optum has a
significant opportunity on the international side. We parse our investments based upon cost of capital return thresholds
along those lines and recognize our responsibilities in terms of returning capital pursuant to dividends and share
repurchase. So that's kind of the perspective and that really hasn't changed at all.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: All right. So if I could just follow-up then. If I'm going to interpret your 2014 comments, I
think what I would say is beyond the challenges provided by MA you see your capital deployment and all the other
expertise that you bring to the table as providing the kind of balance perhaps to 2014, offsetting some of the negatives
in MA would be the continued pace that you see in the rest of the businesses and that the challenge in predicting 2014
for us is to balance the negative of the MA against the positives of the other business. The Street is interpreting, I think,
your comments as meaning flat 2014. And I'm trying to – from my perspective, I think you said balance one against the
other but you didn't commit to flat. Is that correct?

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, we have committed to no position on 2014. I think beyond that that what you're
laying out is broadly the way I would – broadly correct, and that is we are positive about the other aspects of our
business and our capabilities and we are applying them intensively to the pressure that is being put on the Medicare
Advantage program and are still working through that. So we haven't declared on 2014. We are focused on growing
earnings in 2014 and growing this business. That is our focus and our intensity every year. We have a lot to offer in
terms of our diversified business model and when we feel we have worked through this to the point where we can
responsibly offer some direction to the marketplace we will do that, but I think generally you have the framework of it
correct.

We'll go next to Ana Gupte with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Yes, thanks. Good morning. So, a lot of questions on 2014. I'm just trying to get a little more
clarity on commercial and Medicare in 2013 as that's the baseline for all the headwinds that you will experience in
2014. So on the Medicare side, in the first quarter you had quite a bit of deterioration in your ex-commercial medical
loss ratio. You brought up sequestration, enhanced Part D and some seasonal patterns of first quarter pressure and so
on. It seems to have eased up a lot in 2Q. I'm just trying to understand if it's because of Part D or you've actually done
something to improve your base Medicare Advantage business and the potential margin deterioration that you'd been
experiencing I think in 1Q, or is it prior period reserves or Amil or something else?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think we'll have Dan comment on it. Clearly, Part D is a factor in it, but I think it's not
the only one. So, Dan?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure, Ana. This is Dan. You had a lot in there. To Steve's point, absolutely, the biggest
difference as you look sequentially first quarter, second, both on a consolidated basis and in government programs and
Medicare, obviously is the Part D timing. In the first quarter as you look year-over-year it actually increased the loss
ratio and as you look at the second quarter it actually decreased the loss ratio on a year-over-year basis. So that's the
biggest swing item.
But I'd also tell you inside of Medicare that we also have more favorable development than the first quarter and on a
year-over-year basis and that's a little more concentrated in our Medicare business. And from the first to the second
quarter in Medicare, we're seeing a little bit better performance on our new growth in Medicare. So those are some of
the things that are influencing it, with Part D being the most pronounced.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: So year-over-year your base Medicare business, and if you can split out Medicare Advantage
and Part D, do you expect deterioration from 2012 or not for the full year 2013?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: On the full year we expect our Medicare Advantage loss ratio to go up. Obviously we have
the significant reimbursement challenges, as well as sequestration, and then working against that is our focus on
clinical management and so forth. So but yes, in aggregate, we expect our Medicare Advantage loss ratio to increase on
the full year.
As you look at Part D, our performance is strong there. On the full year, our earnings will be up, and they're up in large
part due to the significant volume growth that we had in Part D, and obviously the quarter-to-quarter progression is
different, but in aggregate on the year Part D earnings are going to be up.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Thanks. That's helpful. And just to follow-up on the commercial side, you had a little bit of
margin expansion in 1Q. You'd cited the loss of big fully-insured, very high MLR accounts at the time. You're seeing a
little bit of margin expansion in the second quarter. Your days in claims payable have gone up by a day, all of you are
on the hook for this tax for next year. So should we expect that either your reserves will strengthen or that your
commercial underwriting spread gets better through 3Q and 4Q as you build up for that tax burden?

<A - Dan Schumacher>: On the commercial side, yes, we had a decline in our loss ratio again this quarter on a
year-over-year basis so we are down ten basis points. A big portion of that is obviously the large case funding
conversion that we had at the beginning of the year, and that's being offset by the competitive market environment. You
know, we guided at investor day to a more than one percentage point increase in our full year commercial loss ratio.
We've adjusted for that large funding conversion, and we still expect at the midpoint about a 60 basis point increase in
our commercial loss ratio on the full year, so full year commercial loss ratio guidance still in that 81.2%, plus or minus
50 basis points.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: So you're not getting...
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think your question is really a baseline one, a commercial baseline for the current year is
very solid, very strong. And it will then run into the challenges, as you point out, that everybody will run into in the
market place in 2014 and 2015.
I think we have to move on. We'll take two more questions, please?

We'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carl R. McDonald>: Great. Thanks. Can you roughly quantify the margin compression that you're expecting to
see in Medicare Advantage next year? So roughly are we talking 50 to 100 basis points? Or something bigger than that?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. Well, we – first of all, we don't really get into margin at that level in the first place.
And I think if I could do that at this point in time, we would have more to say about 2014. So that's what we're working
through right now. And we have to work through them on a real basis through the specific markets. So I really can't
offer guidance at that level of precision at the midyear of the current year.
<Q - Carl R. McDonald>: Yeah, maybe ask it a different way. If the headwind that you're talking about is 750 basis
points, you talked about sort of the seniors' ability to handle adjustments to that. What would you view as being a
reasonable amount that a senior could handle in terms of benefit design changes in a given year?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I have no basis to really speculate around that. Let me go back to a couple of things. If you
think about it, that spread that you're focusing on, we're attacking by in part taking benefits down in a way that
maintains the value and viability of the program. It runs a spectrum across markets. So it's not like a universal thing.
This is done at a relatively precise level market by market.
Network shaping is also that. We have historically sponsored a very broad, very open access kind of market for our
Medicare Advantage. We will be forced to narrow that. We are focused intensely on operating costs across the board.
So those are the elements that we're really playing in. And obviously we are, as I said, we're operating in a way to
maintain the long-term viability of the program. But my second point in there was protecting margins.
The sustainability of the program has to be that it is one that returns capital. So we are protecting the margins of that
program, and that is a market-by-market proposition relative to our set of assets in the marketplace as well as the way
the program is being administered by its sponsor in those markets. It's a complicated proposition, but I can assure you
we are focused on closing as much as of that gap as possible.
And seniors are clearly going to participate in it, pursuant to benefit reductions, narrower access. So, none of these
things, the underfunding of the program, is not a good thing for American seniors who benefit from these programs.
But we are trying to navigate that in the best way possible to preserve this program's viability long term, because we
think it has compelling long-term growth aspects and value to the administration in terms of what it can do for
Medicare.
Next question, please?

We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Good morning. Thank you. Optum seems to be running generally ahead of expectations.
Is there any change to the long-term Optum objectives that you outlined at Investor Day? And you talked about
international being a substantial opportunity. Where else do you see good opportunities in Optum?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Perfect for Larry, do you want to comment?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. Christine, it's Larry Renfro. I think you know this. We put together what I'll call a
multiyear business plan back about 18 months ago. We call that One Optum and when we did that, we wanted to make
Optum a more potent solutions organization, and we wanted to really position ourselves for the future. And at the same
time we made some financial commitments to you guys on the ROIC being 15% by 2015, a 6% operating margin by
2015 as well as doubling our operating profits of 2011.
So those goals that we set at that point in time, we're kind of marching down the road, we're kind of marching down the
road. We're hitting those pretty well, and meeting expectations, and sometimes actually doing better. The initiatives
around them are pretty much around simplification, re-engineering, business integration, really the whole business
alignment, and we talked a little bit about the PBM, and in 2013 we've now started to pivot toward growth. And part of
the growth initiative, and this will get to part of your question, is that we're trying to really have deeper, what I'd call
larger, as well as significant relationships with our customers and that's actually working fairly well for us right now, as
well.
The other part of growth, as we've been talking about this today, comes from what I'll call new opportunities that
surround us around, let's just talk about Medicare rates and the pressure that's going on in the industry. So what all that
does for us is cause us to really look for the future, and we have to but certain development dollars as well as
innovation dollars in to make all this work. I would say that international would fall into that same category in terms of
innovation and development, as we work toward doing a lot of these programs that we are doing today in the United
States, we'll be putting them into Brazil. So we're confident that we have planned investments. We're balancing those
investments with growth as well as cost management, but at this point in time, we would pretty much stand by the
overall multi-year plan in terms of our guidance to meet or exceed the high end of the range.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you.
Stephen J. Hemsley
So thank you all. Once again, thank you for your interest in UnitedHealth Group today. We have had a very solid
quarter, and a strong year-to-date, both for UnitedHealthcare and Optum. They've both continued to grow. Our
performance trends are positive. I think it reflects in part the value of our diversified business approach, and we remain
intensely focused on the remainder of 2013 and on 2014 and the long-term success of the enterprise. So thank you for
joining us.
