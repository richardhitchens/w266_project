Thank you, Patrick, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. As we reported, 2013 was an exceptional year
for Celgene, and the outlook for 2014 is even brighter. Today we'll review some of these highlights from a perspective
of how they support the achievement of our 2014 goals and enhance our long-term growth trajectory.
The progress achieved in 2013 positively impacted our prospects in multiple ways. Through our innovative research
and development strategies, we have built an extraordinarily high potential deep and diverse research and Phase I
pipeline. This pipeline has been created by our internal teams and in collaboration with some of the world's finest
research-based companies and investigators. I should note that we're rapidly advancing our next generation biologics
platform with three biologic candidates in the clinic and expect about 50% of our new INDs to come from these
programs in 2015.
In addition to our early stage pipeline, our Phase II programs, which today encompass over 100 clinical trials in over 50
different indications, have the potential to produce proof-of-concept data in multiple indications for multiple products
in the next 12 to 24 months. Epigenetics-focused compounds from our pipeline such as oral azacitidine as a priming
agent for solid tumor cancers and compounds from Agios and Epizyme, are among these high potential opportunities.
Our Phase III pipeline has delivered numerous positive results over the past 12 to 18 months. and we expect important
new data this year from Phase III trials in both our I&I and hematology/ oncology pipeline. Significantly, we're
advancing new compounds and indications into Phase III, including the potential for an ACE-011 or ACE-536 Phase
III trial in Beta-Thalassemia and MDS later this year.
The operating and financial results achieved in 2013 provide us with increasing momentum, supporting the raising of
our financial targets and provides the resources for us to invest in the future and to assertively manage our capital
structure.
It's an exciting time at Celgene, and one of our most important opportunities is Otezla. Normally we'd have Scott
Smith, the Head of our I&I franchise here with us today to provide the update, but he's with one of our regional teams
participating in launch meetings today. I was with them last evening and they're finalizing preparations and are ready to
go.
We've assembled world-class, highly experienced commercial and medical affairs teams. Our complete psoriatic
arthritis U.S. salesforce is on board. They're energized, focused and prepared for launch. Using a wide array of tools,
including extensive market research, a well-defined brand strategy has been developed to effectively position Otezla in
the current competitive landscape. We have finalized our sampling and distribution plan and our market access and
pricing strategies as well. Our teams have built extensive robust strategic plans.
As we're concentrating on launch preparations in the United States for psoriatic arthritis, we're also readying launch
preparations for additional indications in the U.S. and international markets. In the United States, we're moving forward
expeditiously in advance of our September PDUFA date for our psoriasis application and our team in Canada is
accelerating planning for a psoriatic arthritis launch in the next few months, and we anticipate European action on our
combined psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis application late this year.
We're also actively advancing Otezla in other indications. We expect Phase III data from our ankylosing spondylitis
trial during this coming next quarter. We expect to initiate Phase II trials in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
atopic dermatitis later this year. It's an exciting program.
Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.

Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Bob. Good morning to all, and thanks for joining us on our Q4 2013 call. We finished 2013 with strong
momentum across the board and we are happy with the start we are seeing so far in 2014. Our teams around the world
delivered on all of our key financial and operational metrics. Product sales grew 18% in 2013 versus our original
expectation of 11%.
REVLIMID sales grew 14% versus our original expectation of 10%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 21% versus our
original expectation of 14%. And we did this while investing in our emerging Inflammation & Immunology franchise
and while making incremental investments in R&D over the course of the year that were in addition to our original
plans.
We also continued to return funds to shareholders via share repurchases, and these totaled $2.8 billion for the year. As
we move into 2014, we are in a great place with respect to our ability to deliver both strong current year financial
performance and strong, sustainable long-term growth and performance.
Summarizing our top line growth for Q4 and the full year, product sales reached just over $1.7 billion for the quarter,
posting 22% year-over-year growth and $6.362 billion for the full year, 18% growth. Both periods reflect the entry of
generic competition to VIDAZA in the U.S. as of the beginning of Q4.
Royalty and other revenues for the full year amounted to $132 million. Including these, total revenue for Q4 was just
over $1.75 billion, year-over-year growth of 21% and $6.494 billion for the full year, 18% growth. Q4 year-over-year
growth accelerated compared to the prior two years, particularly as a result of building momentum in ABRAXANE
globally, POMALYST in the U.S. and IMNOVID in Europe, along with very good overall growth in geographies
where our local businesses are still in the early stages of development. Full year 2013 growth accelerated versus 2012
for the same reasons and in spite of the impact of the U.S. generic VIDAZA entrants.
Consistent with what we saw throughout the year, our Q4 growth was driven by volume, which was up 21%, and
globally we had a modest net 2% positive impact from price and a net 1% negative impact from foreign exchange. Full
year growth came entirely from 18% volume growth as price of positive 2% and foreign exchange of negative 2%
offset each other.
Our adjusted earnings per share growth trajectory continues to be strong and EPS grew faster than revenues for the full
year at 21% while we continued to invest in the business and including the impact of milestone payments related to our
R&D collaboration agreements. The amount of collaboration milestones and extension payments totaled $65 million
for the full year or $0.13, with $52 million of those occurring in Q4, about $0.10. For the quarter, our EPS growth was
fueled solely by operating income growth. For the full year, operating income growth contributed 90% of our EPS
growth and the cumulative impact of our last three shares of share repurchases contributed the remaining 10%.
We're extremely happy with the evolution of our product portfolio, including the performance of our flagship product
REVLIMID, the strong momentum in ABRAXANE, now with three approved indications, and the addition of
POMALYST/IMNOVID and the outstanding launches our team has delivered for those products in 2013.
U.S. REVLIMID growth was very solid all year, finishing with 15% year-over-year growth for the quarter and 16% for
the full year. International REVLIMID growth was equally impressive at 11% for both the quarter and full year net of
price decreases in many international markets.
Branded VIDAZA continues to grow nicely outside the U.S., while in the U.S. we saw the impact of generic
competition to the brand in Q4.
ABRAXANE growth accelerated throughout the year as we solidified our position in breast cancer, grew it in
non-small cell lung cancer and began the launch of the product in pancreatic cancer. We realized outstanding global
growth in the brand with an overall 90% increase for the quarter year-over-year comparison and 52% for the full year
with both the U.S. and international markets performing well.

In our first year on the market and even without a full year of revenues in any jurisdiction, POMALYST/IMNOVID is
already an over $300 million product in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, and we look forward to a strong growth
trajectory for the product for some time to come.
Total other revenues include ISTODAX, thalidomide and our authorized generic for VIDAZA in the U.S., with this
latter particularly impacting Q4.
Looking at the other major line items in the P&L, our product gross margin improved 40 basis points to 95% for the
quarter and 30 basis points to 94.9% for the full year. R&D expense as a percentage of revenue delivered 60 basis
points of leverage for the full year, ending at 23.2% even as we invested incrementally to support our pipeline and long
term growth. For the quarter, R&D expense was up 420 basis points versus last year as a result of our spend for
ongoing clinical trials as well as incremental investments in our collaboration arrangements and the impact of the
milestone payments I mentioned earlier.
SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue moved down by 70 basis points in the quarter, but increased 60 basis points
for the full year due to investments in support of a multitude of launch activities in our Hematology and Oncology
franchises throughout 2014 including POMALYST/IMNOVID globally, REVLIMID for mantle cell lymphoma in the
U.S., REVLIMID for MDS in Europe, and ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer globally, as well as investments we made
in our I&I business as we get ready for Otezla commercialization. I will talk about more the trends we see in these line
items for 2014 when I cover our financial guidance.
We improved our full-year operating margin by 30 basis points to 48.4%, a little lower than we originally planned
because we saw opportunities to make unplanned investments that we believe will serve us well in the future. Those
related to both launches and new clinical development projects. The margin was impacted in Q4 by collaboration
milestones, pancreatic launch expenses, mostly in the U.S., and IMNOVID launch expenses in Europe.
We ended the year with an effective tax rate of 16.8%, basically in line with our guidance.
We continue to produce higher returns on invested capital over time. As you will remember, we acquired Abraxis in
2010 and our returns dipped modestly for that year and then returned to their pre-acquisition level right away and
continued to grow subsequently. The income we used for this ROIC calculation is U.S. GAAP income and we give you
two measures of ROIC, one that uses gross invested capital including cash balances and one that uses net invested
capital excluding cash balances. The gross return was somewhat negatively impacted in 2013 by the increase in cash
we experienced post our August bond issuance and I expect that trend to reverse and improve over the course of 2014.
At 12/31/2013 we had about $5.7 billion of cash in our balance sheet, up from $3.9 billion at year end 2012. We
produced strong net cash flow from operations of over $2.2 billion during the year and we bought back $2.8 billion of
our shares.
For the full year 2013, we made $576 million in up-front payments in the context of R&D collaboration deals, another
$162 million for equity stakes in our partner companies, and $53 million for prepaid R&D. Of those totals, $227
million was paid in Q4 for up-front payments and $40 million for equity stakes. The equity stakes appear in our balance
sheet.
If the companies are public, the stakes are marked-to-market with the value of the stakes being included within our total
cash and marketable securities, but the impact of the mark-to-market does not go through our adjusted or GAAP P&Ls,
unless we sell the stakes. For product companies, we do not record any gains on those investments unless we realize
gains upon sales of the stakes, but we do record writedowns in both our adjusted and GAAP P&Ls in the event of
impairments of those stakes. Prepaid R&D is amortized in both our adjusted and GAAP P&Ls as the R&D work is
carried out. If we have cost sharing arrangements in our deals, those expenses are included in both our adjusted and
GAAP P&Ls and any milestone payments included in these deals also flow through both our adjusted and GAAP
P&Ls.
One-time upfront payments include value for the components of the deals related to acquiring product rights, options to
license products and options to acquire our partner companies. We view these as acquisition-like payments and

therefore exclude them from our adjusted P&L.
Our unique business development strategy is designed to give us access to potential breakthrough science and leading
technologies to allow us to pay our partners for success and share risks with them along the way and to give us a
multitude of shots on goal in the categories we think will be important to sustaining long-term innovation in our core
businesses.
Turning to our financial guidance for 2014, we previously told you we expect total revenues of approximately $7.5
billion with product revenues of $7.3 billion to $7.4 billion and REVLIMID revenues of $4.9 billion to $5 billion,
growth of 16% each at the midpoint of the ranges. Our total revenue guidance includes the impact of a full year of
generic VIDAZA in the U.S.
We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.20, growth of 19% at the midpoint. We expect an
operating margin for the full year of about 50%, with cost of goods sold around 4.8% of revenues; R&D about 22.8%,
including the impact of collaboration cost sharing arrangements and an estimate for possible 2014 milestone payments;
and SG&A around 22.5%, including the impact of continued investment in our I&I platform. We see some leverage
from each of these line items in 2014 while we maintain our strategy of investing for the future.
Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 16.5% for the year and we forecast a fully diluted weighted average
share count of 425 million shares for our EPS calculations.
On the strength of our outstanding performance in 2013 and with the catalysts we see ahead of us in 2014 and beyond,
we've updated our long-term targets and now see revenues in a range of $13 billion to $14 billion in 2017 and earnings
per share of at least $15. Our expected constant annual growth rate trajectories for both revenues and EPS are
accelerating up to 21% and 26% respectively versus 19% and 25% from our previous targets.
All of the increase in our revenue targets comes from our hematology franchise as REVLIMID is poised to embark on
its next wave of accelerating global growth, with future label expansions expected for newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma and as POMALYST/IMNOVID solidifies its global position in relapsed refractory myeloma.
To finish on our long-term targets, our EPS targets include our assumptions for investment in our I&I infrastructure
globally, as well as continued investment in our portfolio of R&D projects and activities including our collaboration
arrangements. While we make those investments, we believe we can continue to generate sustained improvement in our
operating margins and grow earnings at a faster rate than revenues.
As concerns the financial drivers, we expect our effective tax rate to be on average flat at about 16.5% for the 2014 to
2017 period and for our fully diluted share count to be flat at 425 million shares.
There are a number of Phase III trials for which potential positive impacts have not yet been included in our financial
model. These are listed on the webcast slide and include both new indications for existing products as well as
completely new compounds in late stage development, like CC-486, our oral azacitidine compound and the Acceleron
compounds of ACE-011 and 536. You will see data for our Phase III trial of Otezla in ankylosing spondylitis in the first
half of this year and for other trials over the timeframe to 2017.
With these as well as numerous other trials we have planned or initiated in Phases I and II, we're confident in our R&D
engine and its ability to produce a continuous flow of data and new products to fuel our growth for a very long time.
Our business model continues to deliver sustainable operating leverage and on this chart you can see our past track
record in that regard as well as where we see ourselves by 2017. We now estimate our adjusted operating margin to
reach 57% in 2017 versus our prior target of 55%. All of our P&L metrics are strong and our model is delivering on its
promise as a result of the efforts of all Celgene employees around the world and across all functions.
Let me now finish by reiterating that 2013 was a year of excellence in both execution and strategy across all functions
throughout Celgene around the world. That excellence drove outstanding financial performance and momentum that we
see carrying into 2014, and we are in a great position to capitalize on the milestones we see coming this year and
beyond.

Mark will now talk more about our strong operational performance and our bright future. Mark?
Mark J. Alles
Thanks, Jackie. Good morning everyone. As you heard from Bob and Jackie, we made outstanding progress last year
and generated strong momentum in the fourth quarter. We achieved a number of very significant clinical and regulatory
milestones. Total net product sales grew 18% year-on-year to $6.4 billion. REVLIMID sales exceeded more than $4
billion for the first time. We introduced REVLIMID into new markets, added the MDS deletion 5q indication in Europe
and the relapsed and refractory mantle cell indication in the United States.
Major new REVLIMID clinical data and the U.S. and EU regulatory approvals for POMALYST/IMNOVID
significantly strengthened and expanded our global multiple myeloma franchise. ABRAXANE in combination with
gemcitabine was approved in the U.S. and in Europe for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Extending our scientific leadership remains a top priority and we significantly strengthened our development pipeline.
In 2013, we established several important partnerships and alliances and together with investigators, presented and
published the results of more clinical research than ever before. We enter 2014 completely aligned by our common
purpose. We are acutely aware of the unmet medical needs of cancer patients worldwide. In 2013, more than 200,000
unique patients in over 60 countries were treated with one or more of our products. But the treatable population we
seek to help is more than 1 million patients, and it's growing.
Let me turn briefly to our product results and begin with REVLIMID. Key brand performance indicators remain strong
in the fourth quarter. Sales were driven by four factors: increased duration, global myeloma market share above 50%,
and continued expansion of use in mantle cell lymphoma in the United States and MDS in Europe. REVLIMID sales
grew 4% quarter-on-quarter to $1.136 billion and 14% year-on-year to $4.28 billion.
New potential clinical and commercial opportunities for REVLIMID in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lower-risk MDS,
AML and CLL are expected to come into greater focus throughout the next 12 to 18 months. And little Phase III
registration studies testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in combination with
rituximab in follicular lymphoma and as maintenance therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia should complete
enrollment in 2014. We also expect to have the results of the MDS-005 study in patients with non-deletion 5q MDS
during the second half of this year.
Each study is tied directly to a major unmet medical need and positive results would be expected to provide significant
upside to our current 2017 sales target. The American Society of Hematology Meeting in early December represented a
milestone for the next phase of accelerating growth for our hematology franchise. We believe four major themes
emerged during ASH: renewed focus on the molecular classification of diseases and necessary diagnostics, the
evolution of targeted treatments, epigenetics in MDS and NHL, and the clinical benefit of continuous treatment until
disease progression.
In the short term, we are completely focused on establishing the continuous treatment paradigm for REVLIMID in all
lines of therapy for multiple myeloma and for POMALYST/IMNOVID in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma,
extending duration of treatment until disease progression is critical for optimal patient benefit and it is one of our most
important value drivers.
Prior to ASH, we highlighted three abstracts, with particular importance to our REVLIMID newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma regulatory strategy. The progression free survival, two results from the MM-015 study, the meta-analysis for
the lenalidomide randomized maintenance trial in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, and the plenary presentation of
the initial results of our MM-020 study.
Our focus now is to provide these and other efficacy and safety data sets as part of our EU and U.S. regulatory
submissions for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Recall that we plan to pursue the broadest possible
indication. REVLIMID in combination with low-dose dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of patients with

newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We have made excellent progress building these regulatory dossiers and we
continue to expect submission by the end of this quarter.
Fourth quarter POMALYST/IMNOVID sales grew 34% quarter-on-quarter to $120 million and full-year 2013 sales
were $305 million. Although still very early in the U.S. launch, we are encouraged by reports of significant patient
benefit and by the almost 30% market share achieved in patients with myeloma who have progressed after at least two
prior therapies.
Since the August 2013 approval of IMNOVID in Europe, we've initiated market-by-market pricing and reimbursement
discussions, and they're going very well. Despite this obvious gate to market adoption, early 2014 sales of IMNOVID
are strong. Given the lack of other novel agents in Europe for patients who have failed REVLIMID-based or
bortezomib-based treatments, we expect IMNOVID to rapidly become the standard of care in this setting.
The 2013 clinical, regulatory and commercial success of ABRAXANE has helped us to more fully establish an
oncology franchise that is bringing important outcomes to patients who continue to have extremely limited therapeutic
options. 2013 was a breakout year for ABRAXANE. Fourth quarter sales were $202 million, representing 19%
quarter-on-quarter and 52% year-on-year growth.
Approved for metastatic breast cancer in more than 30 countries, the recent U.S. approval and launches of
ABRAXANE in combination with carboplatin for lung cancer and in combination with gemcitabine for metastatic
pancreatic cancer have dramatically changed the clinical and commercial potential of this innovative therapy. At least
11 trials of novel agents, including demcizumab in combination with ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine in pancreatic
cancer are ongoing.
We have initiated Phase III registration studies in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and in triple-negative metastatic breast
cancer and we're exploring new clinical opportunities in lung cancer. Several study concepts are being considered using
combination strategies with epigenetic priming plus the T-cell checkpoint inhibitors PD-1 and PD-L1 in lung cancer
and other solid tumors. We're still learning about ABRAXANE's role and its full potential in the treatment of solid
tumor cancers. But the clinical evidence and our execution are expected to make it one of our franchise blockbuster
brands.
Our research and development team continue to build on our internal strengths while adding important opportunities
through external alliances. We've developed substantial research platforms with competitive advantages in epigenetics,
protein homeostasis, cancer stem cell resistance, and others, and these programs are producing multiple drug candidates
each year.
This productivity and innovation has built a Phase I program in Hematology and Oncology that now includes
next-generation immunomodulatory drugs, targeted monoclonal antibodies, highly selective HDAC6 inhibitors,
inhibitors of histone methyltransferases and other promising agents. We're conducting or planning more than 100 Phase
II or III clinical trials with our inline and pipeline therapies.
Advancing CC-486 in MDS, AML, and defining its role as a priming agent in combination strategies for solid tumors
continues to be one of our most important and high potential programs. Defining registration studies for our BTK
inhibitor CC-292 and our next-generation IMiD CC-122 are major objectives for 2014. In collaboration with our
partner Acceleron, we expect to be able to select either sotatercept or ACE-536 for full development in
Beta-Thalassemia and MDS during the second half of this year.
2014 is off to a very good start and our future is more promising than ever. Looking ahead, our franchise strategy
remains very clear. We intend to capitalize on our global strength in hematology and to expand our oncology franchise.
The opportunity to optimize the full clinical and commercial potential of REVLIMID, POMALYST and ABRAXANE
drives what we do every day.
Before turning the call back to Bob, I'd like to again thank my colleagues for their outstanding achievements in 2013.
Thank you very much. Bob?

Thank you, Mark. Thank you Jackie and thank you Scott for being out in the field ensuring that we're really ready for
the launch of Otezla. Very exciting. I hope you can sense our optimism on the future of Celgene. As we close the
presentation, we thought it helpful to provide a chart of the many significant milestones for 2014. We're very fortunate
to have milestones across our portfolio with the potential to positively impact our growth trajectory, many of which are
not included in our base case outlook. These milestones range from late stage regulatory actions and to Phase III data to
numerous proof of concept studies that can lead to registration trials. These milestones are the product of a long term of
investments in disruptive technologies, with the potential to transform patient care.
The outlook for Celgene is brighter than ever, and we look forward to updating you throughout the year on our 2014
results and our progress in enhancing our long-term growth prospects. Thanks for joining us today. Operator, please
open the call to questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open .
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. I guess I just
wanted to ask about spondylitis. You'd mentioned at JPMorgan that if that trial is successful, it could really change the
trajectory of apremilast. Maybe talk a little bit more about what does that mean. How might it really affect the launch in
other indications.
And then second, when you think about doctors and what they're looking for in Phase III, what are the key metrics that
docs will be looking about in the trial? And we also have heard that the market's smaller than psoriatic arthritis. Your
numbers suggest otherwise. How do we think about improving diagnosis in the market? Thanks.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Thanks very much. We are very excited about the potential here. And it is a very, very near
term outlook. And I think as people really do have the opportunity to meet with thought leaders and understand the
importance of the disease, it will become more prominent as to what the potential is. I think one of the issues are is that
there are really not many therapies for the indication, certainly not any oral therapies and ones that really have the
prospect for changing the course of disease. So it's such a near-term event for us and it's almost 500 patients in the
study fully accrued and we're in the last couple of months before we get that data. And we're optimistic that as we look
at not just signs and symptoms, but also the real underlying implications of the disease and impact of the disease that
our product has the potential to have a significant impact there.
And when we think about the marketing and the fit with our focus on psoriatic arthritis, we really see great leverage
opportunity here all around the world. As therapies come out to this marketplace, I think you'll see people looking and
understanding at what the size of the market is and it's one that really fits with our focus on a rheumatology
organization that we've already built. So there's tremendous leverage there. And again it's such a near term thing. We're
going to see the data and we'll be able to see what the consequences of that data are and ensure we have the program to
fully capitalize on it.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And just maybe I can add very quickly, in terms of the potential, I mean I think you've
seen probably the patient numbers. We know that there's a sizable number of patients for this indication, but in terms of
the dollar value associated with that opportunity, it doesn't maybe look huge today, but it's an evolving situation
because it's a need, it's an unmet medical need in the need for treatments there. So we think it's going to be something
that evolves quite positively over time and we have not included anything in our model for that. So let's see how it
goes.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Yes, the data is very near term.

Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey guys. Hey, first of all, congratulations to Jackie in winning the World's Best CFO
contest in the II magazine. Well deserved, and also to Patrick for the recognition in the IR part of that. And also thanks
for the detailed slides. I was looking at them, and on slide 41, Jackie you had in there you did about $576 million of
up-front payments to collaboration partners in 2013. I was just wondering if you could give us directionally kind of
what your budget for that line is roughly speaking in 2014 if possible and congrats again.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Well thank you for the compliments. We do appreciate that, the IR team.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: It's the hair.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: The IR team here has done a great job, and they have different hair than I do. So we were
really trying to educate a little bit on these up-front payments and just the nature of how we account for the things
around our BD deals. We think that we've got a unique strategy going with respect to how we're approaching business
development and our ability to access assets and acquire those assets over time. So we think it's going to pay off very
nicely from a strategy standpoint.
In 2013, we had significantly more activity than we have had in prior years. Partly because we're very focused on that,
but also because many of the partner companies have evolved over time and are now at a point where many years of a
lot of hard work are producing data and things that where we have some visibility to certain compounds in certain
areas, and I think that's been behind the level of activity as well.
So in any given year, it's going to be hard for us to predict that. What we do include in our guidance are estimates for
potential milestone payments in those agreements. We include the cost sharing components of those and we do not
include new deals that we could have necessarily because it's just very hard to predict the flow of those and then what
the components of each deal will be in terms of amounts related to equity stakes versus the prepaid R&D versus
up-front payments. So we're trying to give you the visibility to the data, explain what's behind the strategy and then go
from there. So hopefully that answers the question.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Yes, thanks for all the disclosure and clarity, Jackie.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. A question on newly diagnosed
label in Europe, obviously assuming approval, how should we think about the pace of the rollout across Europe? I
know obviously it will take some time for reimbursement, but wasn't sure what you could do to accelerate that, and
then I wasn't also sure what's now assumed in your 2015 new guidance or 2017 new guidance that accounts for the
first-line label. Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yes, hi Geoff, it's Mark. Thanks for the questions. So on the pace of approval, we should start
with what the assumption is in terms of submitting this quarter and then the typical review cycle for any application in
front of CHMP and the European Commission. So we would expect approval coming about 12, 13 months later. Maybe
it's a month before that, but in that range followed immediately by uptake in some early launch countries. What we've
experienced with POMALYST/IMNOVID is illustrative because we've seen sales in countries for example like
Germany, prior to the AMNOG full review and final price negotiation.

So we would see some early launch and that is built into our base case out to 2017. By mid 2016 we would expect, mid
2016 we would expect that the majority of the European countries would have settled into a negotiated pricing volume
agreement similar to what we've dealt with over the years with REVLIMID in the relapse setting, now IMNOVID in
the relapse setting. And again in our model out to 2017, we see that timing relatively constant. If we move a country,
for example, one of the big five countries ahead by a quarter, that would provide some obviously nice momentum and
upside in the years 2016 to 2017. But we don't see a lot of flexibility in that timing. Jackie, did you want to add
anything?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: So I think just from a modeling perspective, we've been able to refine a little bit our
thoughts on timing, so because of the visibility that we now have to the timing on the submission. So we would be
assuming standard review times and approvals in Q1 of 2015 thereabout, in both the U.S. and Europe, Q1, maybe
beginning of Q2. But we also, as a reminder, assume in Europe that we're talking about a non-transplant eligible
population, which in any event is about 75% of the opportunity in the first instance and we moved the stem cell
transplant population out in terms of timing for approval. It's at 18 to 24 months later in the model, just to be clear
about that.
So the upside that you saw us reflect in our 2017 targets, when we increased to the $13 billion to the $14 billion in the
REVLIMID number, now include our thoughts about the impact of the MM-020 data in terms of influencing treatment
paradigms as well as the solidification of our thoughts on the timing in all of that, and that's what you see reflected in
the number.
So whereas before we talked about I think over time having somewhere between $300 million and $500 million
globally in for incremental newly diagnosed revenues in 2017, you can essentially add that $1 billion increase in the
REVLIMID number to that. I would say that we continue to be probably somewhat conservative in terms of our
assumptions in any given geography around how fast we see share uptake, how fast we see the impact flowing through
in terms of duration of treatment. So we put in there, as Mark said, a base case based on what we think that we see
today.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thank you very much for the question and congratulations on a remarkable year.
Quickly on MM-020, just Mark, could you talk a little bit about where you see things in the U.S. in terms of your
ability to push share and duration? Remarkable uptake already even without the label, but with the label presumably
your field organization, MSLs, et cetera, will be able to be much more active there. So is that something you see as a
real opportunity and a driver?
And then just quickly another just – could you tell us what we should be looking for on CC-486 in solid tumors? Is
there a result this year that's going to tell us whether this is really seasonally an incremental driver of effect and benefit
and value?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Great questions. Thank you very much. So with respect to the U.S. market, we're extremely sure
that full approval in the U.S. for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma will have a significant opportunity
for expansion of market share. We've never been able to commercialize the full value of REVLIMID from induction all
the way through continuous treatment or maintenance at all in the history of the brand. So a newly diagnosed approval,
particularly on the strength of MM-020 offers that induction continuous treatment paradigm from a commercial clinical
perspective. And we do think 10 points to 15 points in market share are possible.
That's not the only reason we believe that. There are so many trials in development across the landscape of novel agents
using REVLIMID/dexamethasone as the backbone, that we really think that newly diagnosed myeloma over the next

five to eight years will be transformed where subsets of patients get triplets and/or doublets, and of that will be built on
the REV/dex backbone. So induction followed by continuous treatment either in the young or old population. So we
remain extremely, extremely optimistic about what we can do on the demand side and on the continuous treatment side.
So Geoff I hope that answers the – it was who?
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Geoff, Geoff Porges.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yes, Geoff. It was Geoff, that's right. Sorry, I wanted to be sure it was you, Geoff. And then on
the priming side, interesting the timing of your question couldn't be more appropriate. I leave today to go to an advisory
board meeting with some top KOLs in the U.S. on some recent evidence that have been produced in ovarian cancer
with that very phenomenon, epigenetic priming using azacitidine with or without platinum based chemotherapy and
then the T-cell checkpoint inhibitors. So it's relatively new translational data, but we think may build to additional work
in lung cancer, ovarian cancer and some other solid tumors.
If I had to forecast, I think we would be looking for abstracts and presentations that would put this in more of a Phase II
category, probably ASCO, 2015 timeframe. We need about probably eight months to another 16 months or so and then
these data will start to mature and be available at major medical meetings. Remember that CC-486 is continuing to be
developed in AML and MDS. So while we're developing it as an extension in our blood cancer franchise, we'll continue
to double down and triple down on the solid tumor side and see where we go.
The other thing is our early pipeline. Bob mentioned our targeted therapeutic antibodies. We don't talk a lot yet about
[ph] CD-047 (46:02), but we're excited about different antibodies in development and different approaches that in the
market different investigators are working on, as other opportunities with priming, with new antibodies, not just the
straight up PD-1, PD-L1 approach. So I think it's a dynamic circumstance. We're looking forward to the next really 12
months to 18 months to prove if we can that we can go into pivotal randomized Phase III trials with epigenetic priming.
So thanks for the question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great, thanks for taking my question. So I think, Mark, I don't know if it's the best suited
with you. It's relating to the activin pathway that you're testing with sotatercept and 536, and so I had sort of two
questions. One, help me understand how do you look to differentiate the two drugs? Sotatercept is kind of a broader
acting and [ph] is Activin A – 536 appears Activin A. (47:06) So what do you think that means clinically?
And then two, you also are looking at CKD which is obviously a very different price point than MDS and Thalassemia.
So is there an opportunity to differentiate there and sort of how serious are you guys about CKD? Thank you.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Yes, I think a couple of us will chime in on this, Yaron. It's a high, high potential program,
right, in areas that really there are not a lot of things that can provide the kind of value in this area of unmet need. And I
think you highlight a number of the very, very important considerations and the decisions that need to get made over
the coming months as we get more data, more mature data to really understand the full profile of the different
compounds. And they are different. They are clearly a number of similarities, but from side effect profile to the
different activity levels in different indications. But we're certainly very much encouraged on the potential.
And you highlight when you look at Beta-Thalassemia, chronic kidney disease, very, very differentiated markets. And I
think the fact that there appear to be multiple compounds with differentiated activity, different side effect profiles, the
ability to position the right profile for the right marketplace and therefore capture the maximum value, that opportunity
is there for us, I think we need a little bit more data, a little bit more time to be very clear about it.
And on the chronic kidney disease, it's a huge, huge opportunity if we can demonstrate both an impact on hemoglobin
and also on bone. And obviously ACE-011 was originally designed as a bone agent that demonstrated a very positive
hematological activity also. That we have to see if the actual therapeutic window of index gives us the opportunity to

do both with the right dose that provides the right risk/benefit reward.
So if it does hit that bull's eye, it's going to be a big, big winner, but I think we have to wait for more data to be clear.
And with a little bit more data on the profile and then we've got to do the analysis that your question implies. There's a
lot of factors that have to be considered so we map out the right long-term strategy to maximize patient benefit and then
the value of the whole franchise.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: The only thing I would add, Bob's exactly right. I think it was a great description of where we
are, is that we have the opportunity to look at these two agents with differentiated data from erythropoietin. That's the
first part of Beta-Thalassemia. Epo clearly does not work well or at all in Beta-Thal. So that's a gate towards some
differentiation right away. The second things we're looking at, treatment for the acute setting for disease and then
supportive care. And again these are decisions that we would make on the basis of data and the Phase III programs that
we would eventually initiate.

Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of nits, maybe the first for Mark. We're used to
seeing some seasonality in Q1, with sales actually being down on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Would you expect to see
that or would the MM-020 presentation and others at ASH perhaps cloud what we might be seeing otherwise?
And second, just your views on pricing in Europe. I was kind of surprised and impressed to see that overall for the
franchise you had about a 2% price benefit in 2013. Is Europe becoming less of a headwind?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi Eric, it's Jackie. Let me just jump in quickly on the pricing issue. So I think as you
know, we typically take price increases in the U.S. That net 2% is a global number. So we did continue to see price
declines in other markets around the world, probably most notably in Europe. However, what I would say is in 2013, on
average those came out a little bit less than what we had planned for in terms of the magnitude of the decline and
maybe a little bit less than what we had seen in the year or two prior. So, but some of those countries can have choppy
patterns in terms of their pricing actions, but we felt pretty good about what we saw in 2013 as you just observed.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yes, and the dynamic for country-by-country reimbursement is interesting because we model a
pretty steady decline in terms of price and price volume. But different things have happened that have changed that
equation a little bit over time. One example is that AMNOG has come out, again Germany, where we have been
modeling a more steep decline or a deeper rebate system of double digits and what's happened in the last couple of
weeks, months, is that the outlook has changed where that rebate looks to be more in the mid single digits versus
double digits. So things can change to be slightly more positive. But overall, we're pleased with the model.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: A little challenging, still challenging, Mark.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: And what we understand is happening with price volume across Europe. And of course the
POMALYST negotiations are reengaging Celgene across the value proposition in every major market.
With respect to Q1, you're right to say that the historical trends of that Q1 over Q4 sequentially is challenged by not so
much seasonality, but more recall that in the U.S. there is that donut hole exposure, that early year exposure for patients
who convert year-on-year to the benefits program and then also that has a filter on gross to net. So we typically have to
deal with that gross to net challenge and potentially some seasonality. But it's early in Q1 and so far we're encouraged
with the start of the year. It's not very different than what we expected.

<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Yes, thanks. I was hoping you could a little bit more color on ABRAXANE in 2013. Is
breast cancer growing at all? Should we think about that as kind of a base of $425 million-ish? And was wondering if
you could give us a sense of how much pancreatic actually occurred in 2013 so we can think about growth for 2014.
And then Jackie, on capital allocation, a couple years ago you had said we don't need to have more than $2 billion in
cash for working capital needs. You obviously have well more than that now. Are there big deals on the horizon or how
do we think about the outlook over the next year or two as your free cash flow generation goes up and your cash
balance is as high as it is. Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi Rachel. Thanks for the questions. I'll jump in just on the capital allocation first and then
turn it over to Mark. So I mean I think as the company grows, you do like to have some growth in the absolute value of
your financial flexibility to deal with all of the things you may want to do in the R&D side and lots of things. But I
mean what we've seen is really nice business model kicking in with the strong stable cash flow generation, and we're
trying to pursue a dynamic strategy in terms of how we manage the capital structure and a sustained long term share
repurchase program. So you saw that in 2013 where we got to just shy of $3 billion of share repurchases, and we'll
continue to do those.
From a business development standpoint, we're always going to say that we want to pursue the things that we feel are
key to our ongoing strategy. I don't think that much has changed in that regard. So the simple fact that we've got a little
bit more cash on our balance sheet right now doesn't influence how we think about the strategy there. We like very
much the things that we've done with our collaboration partner arrangements over time and we'll continue to look at
things like that. And I think we can say that we don't see any huge M&A activity on the horizon for now, and we're
going to keep doing what we've done so well.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Rachel, thanks for the chance to talk about ABRAXANE again quickly. Of course, remember
that the European Commission approved pancreatic cancer for ABRAXANE right at the end of 2013. So we're in full
launch mode, if you will, in Europe for that indication. The growth for ABRAXANE in 2014 will be driven first by
adoption in the U.S. and Europe in metastatic pancreatic cancer. That's the large portion of the growth. In the U.S., lung
cancer continues to contribute very nicely to growth, but that would be second in 2014 to pancreatic cancer.
And as you said, breast cancer, I would describe that business as very stable, but we continue to be excited and
enthusiastic about the triple negative opportunity where our registration program is ongoing and thought leaders around
the world are quite interested in ABRAXANE/gemcitabine in that setting and then other novel agents, PARP inhibitors,
et cetera, that may come into clinical trials with us. So I think you can think about the breast cancer business as very
stable and potentially growing on new programs, but pancreatic cancer followed by lung cancer are the clear drivers in
2014 and beyond.

Our next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey thanks, question on two pipeline products, You had some data on your BTK inhibitor at
ASH. Looks active now. I just wanted to understand your interpretation of the CLL market now and where you think
you are and how you think you can differentiate there.
And the second question was on MOR202, I know we're starting Phase I. Do you think we'll need data at ASH this
year? What are you thinking about for that this year?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question. What a great time for patients who have CLL. All of the emerging small
molecules and biologics that have changed the landscape really for newly diagnosed patients is remarkable. So we're
very happy for the marketplace and for patients. With respect to CC-292, you're right. We see a profile emerging where
the activity profile, the safety profile is becoming very competitive. The segmentation is something we're evaluating all
the time.

The thing to remember in CLL, while it's an indolent disease, none of these treatments are curing the disease. So we see
prevalent pools of patients growing who have resistance to BTK inhibitors in the market, other therapeutic approaches
and we think this is creating new segmentation, new opportunity for us to come in and create a standard of care status
in one or more homogeneous groups of previously treated patients. I think the newly diagnosed setting for CLL is
where we expect REVLIMID to play quite frankly in the maintenance setting. We have an ongoing study, CLL-002,
which is testing REVLIMID maintenance after responses are achieved in CLL. And like multiple myeloma, we think
that's a differentiated approach. Whether or not the combination of our BTK inhibitor with REVLIMID or with a
biologic would be further differentiated remains to be seen on the back of data.
With respect to MOR202, we do expect a constant flow of data coming probably late this year, throughout 2015,
because we want to rapidly combine our CD38 inhibitor with pomalidomide in relapsed setting and with REVLIMID in
second and first line myeloma. So we would expect that to accelerate over a 12 to 18 month window leading to an
approval. The other disease category for MOR202 that we're interested in is AML.

Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on two of your pipeline drugs, CC-122 and
ACY-1215. I was just hoping to get your thoughts on how these two drugs fit within your myeloma portfolio and
maybe if you can speak to their potential role outside of myeloma into other hematological malignancies.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Well, thanks for the question. First, CC-122 has demonstrated good response data in cohorts of
patients with lymphoma, leukemia, and we're expanding cohorts to look at it in myeloma. So I think it's early to decide,
declare which type of patient or subset of myeloma, NHL/CLL we would go to. But as I said in my prepared remarks,
this is a year where defining that pathway from a therapeutic value proposition and a registration point of view is quite
important.
ACY-1215 is an HDAC6 inhibitor and we like this opportunity a lot because we think epigenetics in multiple myeloma
is an underappreciated way of extending the benefit of treatments like REVLIMID, we think like pomalidomide, but
even in combination with proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib. So multiple Phase I/II studies are ongoing in
combination with the branded drugs for myeloma. So we would expect news flow on ACY-1215 in myeloma over the
next year, year and a half. And once again, our effort this year is to define a registration path for the combination of
ACY-1215 with one or more of our myeloma assets.

Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hey, thank you for taking my question which is an extension of Rachel's question on capital
redistributions. Jackie, you've obviously returned more than your operating cash flow this year. Going forwards, how
should we think about your return as a proportion of cash flow? Can we at least presume it's going to be the majority?
And just on your updated views on dividend versus share buyback. Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yes, so I mean in terms of the share buyback program, we've got, this is a pillar of our
capital deployment strategy. It's something we will – it will be part of the strategy year-after-year on an ongoing basis.
That's what you've seen from us for the past three years and you'll continue to see that. So the question of dividends
probably will continue to be on our list. As I think we've said often, we would like to have a more diversified revenue
stream and actually see those, the new products ramping up as we think about the dividend issue. So probably not for
this year or so for sure, but we'll come back to that over time and as we continue to see the very strong growth profile
that the company has. So I think that's the short answer to the question.

We look at what we think the net cash from operations is going to be in any given year and we kind of flex these
different tools along the way as we see that as well as the other opportunities that we've got to invest in our own
research and development pipeline as well as support our collaboration agreements and any other things that we think
are appropriate to do in terms of long term investment for the business.
I think we've got time. We do have a fairly long list of people in the queue. So we're going to try to take maybe three or
four more questions and if we don't get to everybody we apologize for that. We'll follow up with those of you who we
don't get to afterwards. So next question, please.

Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. You've talked a little
bit more lately on the potential for apremilast in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. Was wondering if you could maybe talk
a little bit more about the preclinical data supporting moving forward there, what a development path could look like
and where you see it fitting into the paradigm. And then separately, how should we think about the regulatory path
forward for ABRAXANE in melanoma given the data today? Thanks.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Yes, on apremilast, obviously having been developed in our own lab, discovered and
developed in our own laboratory center, we have worked for a long time to fully understand the mechanistic and done a
tremendous amount of work preclinically to think about where the areas are that its activity would be most beneficial.
And so we've chosen the three indications that I mentioned out of that work, that extensive work. And it is our goal to
have all three underway this year, so that over the next year or two, we'll have some data to make that decision, does
the actual activity in humans actually reflect what we see as the potential in the clinic, in the preclinical work. So it's
very clear those are what we see today as the three best. We also still continue our work in rheumatoid arthritis to see
both if there is monotherapy opportunities and we have studies underway that we'll see data later this year to
understand is there something there. But these are the ones we're going for after ankylosing spondylitis.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: I just think the other maybe clinical relevance of the Behçet's data is such that when one sees the
manifestation of ulcers in the oral cavity, et cetera, one can make a clinical judgment which is where we believe we
have support for an ulcerative colitis type approach because those data are quite striking in terms of resolution of those
oral ulcers. So that gives us some sense of the preclinical's translating to the clinical.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And the melanoma?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yes, so melanoma, thanks for the question. Recall that the primary endpoint for the [ph] CA-033
(66:17) study was progression free survival. So we were encouraged that the study met the primary endpoint with
statistically significant results. The interim results showed a trend for overall survival. We've completed the analysis
and now that trend did not translate into a final overall survival analysis. At this time, we've decided not to pursue a
regulatory strategy, but we continue with multiple clinical trials of high interest. One that I think is very novel is
investigators are combining ABRAXANE with Avastin as a combination approach and in fact it was a randomized
Phase II study ongoing with ipilimumab as the control. So we are learning. We have learned and we're going to
continue to look at melanoma as an opportunity. But in our model and in our overall plan for ABRAXANE, we're
currently deemphasizing that indication.

Our next question comes from Howard Liang with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Hi, thanks very much. Given the potential excitement over oral CC-486, can you talk about the
IP protection on this compound?

<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Yes, this has been in development internally here for a considerable period of time. And so we
can give you the actual patents that have been produced there. But we're certainly expecting longer than 10 years to 12
years after launch to have protection.

Our final question comes from Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question as well. I wanted to ask about another
one of these near term events, and that's the VIDAZA Phase III readout in AML. First just to clarify if the top line data
will include overall survival or whether or not that will mature later? Secondly, AML has been a tough segment taking
into account decitabine results. Can you talk about why you think that this trial may work or may not work? And then
related, could this readout have any impact on the oral 486 development strategy? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yes, so thanks very much. On the AML-001 study, first recall that in Europe and in other
markets around the world, VIDAZA is approved for a subset of AML, which is the smaller portion of the AML
population. This study would extend the benefit of VIDAZA with a primary endpoint and other endpoints including
overall survival, progression free survival, et cetera, to patients across the board with AML. So we see this as a very
important market expansion opportunity for the brand. The second part of your question, though, I didn't hear all of it.
So I want to just clarify, can you repeat the second part of your question?
Operator
Matt, your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Can you hear me? Hi, I'm on.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yes we hear you, go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: So the first part was can you clarify whether or not overall survival will be included in the top
line results this half. Secondly, I asked why you think this is going to work considering some other data like, for
example, from decitabine. It's just a tough segment. And then third, whether or not this could have any impact on the
486 development strategy in AML.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: So I appreciate the reference to decitabine. We think VIDAZA is a very different drug. This has
been a well-studied discussion. Clearly the study design may or may not have an impact because the heterogeneity of
these patients with acute myeloid leukemia. But we feel very good about the control that we exerted on the population
and on the conduct of the study. I think the product already has demonstrated, as I said before, good benefit in a subset
of AML. We're looking for this study to repeat it in the broad population with AML.
With respect to CC-486, the read through we have to consider it as positive, because our development of oral
azacitidine in AML is maintenance following induction treatment. So it was a very different setting and it could be very
complementary. One could see an induction or acute treatment with over time the generic form of azacitidine followed
by the very, very appropriate oral use of azacitidine to maintain that benefit. And of course in low-risk MDS, oral
azacitidine has been developed again in a very different population than VIDAZA in its current form. So I think we feel
very good about the segmentation, the clinical program and the potential for success.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And just a follow up on Howard's question on the IP, the patent goes out to 2029.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
And with that, I think thank you everybody for your interest in us and joining us on the call today. I think we're out of
time, so we're going to wrap up here and we will see you soon.
