MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's First Quarter 2015 Earnings
Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and
media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the internet.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of
Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.
Troy J. Lahr
Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. I'm Troy Lahr and with me
today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and, Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial
Officer. After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you
please limit yourself to one question.
As always, we've provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow this broadcast and
slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and

goals included in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our
various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we
refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use
when discussing our results and outlook.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everybody. My comments today will focus on our positive first quarter
performance and what we see as a continued healthy business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through the
details of our financial results and outlook.
Now let's move to slide two, please. Building on the strong performance trend we sustained through 2014, Boeing
delivered solid first quarter 2015 financial results, including higher revenue, healthy core operating margins and
double-digit growth in core earnings per share. We also continued to return cash to shareholders in the first quarter by
repurchasing $2.5 billion of Boeing stock and increasing our dividend, as promised, by 25% for a payout of $639
million.
Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 21% to $15.4 billion and operating margins were 10.5%. We
delivered 184 commercial airplanes in the quarter and added 110 net new orders. Key milestones in the quarter
included delivery of the first 787-9 built at Boeing South Carolina, the opening of our South Carolina Propulsion
Systems facility and start-up of an automated Wing Panel Assembly on the 737 program in Renton.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenue in the first quarter of $6.7 billion and generated strong operating
margins of 11.1%. Key contract awards included orders for 43 AH-64E Apache helicopters, a multi-year combat
logistics support contract and an order from SES for an all-electric 702SP satellite. In addition, the U.S. Air Force
selected the 747-8 as the next presidential aircraft.
Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included: launching the first two all-electric propulsion satellites double
stacked on a single rocket; and breaking ground on the crew access tower which will support the commercial crew
program; and replicating a best practice for bolstering performance on development programs by establishing a single
unified Defense and Space Development Programs organization. Our success with a similar structure put in place at
Commercial Airplanes starting with the development of the 787-9 shows that we can leverage synergies and expertise
across different development programs to reduce cost and risk and better ensure performance, as promised to our
customers.
This new organization will oversee current and future development efforts, including work on the KC-46 tanker, the
747-8 presidential aircraft, our commercial crew spacecraft and space launch system rocket, the 502 small satellite and
our St. Louis-based 777X work package.
In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of operating performance, achieved significant program milestones,
captured orders totaling $15 billion and returned significant cash to shareholders, all of which Greg will cover in more
detail in a moment.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide three. Strong airline profitability, healthy global air traffic
trends and our backlog totaling more than 5,700 aircraft all combine to underpin our planned production rate increases
over the remainder of the decade. Our long-term outlook also remains positive, as we expect airline fleet growth and
replacement demand to drive the need for nearly 37,000 commercial aircraft over the next 20 years.
As evidenced by the healthy pace of orders during the first quarter, conversations with our airline customers continue to
center on new purchases or accelerating delivery slots. Deferral requests are still running well below the historical
average. These remain very good times for our industry. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, historically airplane
orders are highly correlated to airline profitability and lower oil prices have not fundamentally changed our customers'

view on fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. The rapid return on investment from new,
more efficient airplanes remains a compelling factor in purchase decisions in a fuel price environment, even if it
remains well below the 15-year average.
As a reminder, in addition to far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, our new technologically advanced
airplanes also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger
experience and greater range that grows market opportunities by allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes.
All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.
Further to those points, demand for both the 777 and the 777X remains strong. The 777 production line is essentially
sold out for 2016, approximately half sold out in 2017 and has a healthy number of slots already sold firm in 2018. As
we've discussed before, the new 777X is scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 timeframe and we'll leverage
new manufacturing processes and technologies being proven on the current 777 to optimize the overall 777X
production system. We will continue to assess the most efficient way to phase in this new technology and adapt as
necessary to ensure we meet our customers' commitments.
On the 787 program, we have now delivered more than 250 airplanes, including 20 787-9s. Notable among the strong
new bookings during the quarter was ANA's order for three 787-10s. 787-10 development remains on track for first
delivery in 2018.
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high, with cumulative orders
totaling more than 2,700 airplanes from 57 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in
2017.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. The president's fiscal
2016 budget request included increases for core Boeing production programs, such as P-8A Poseidon, Apache and
Chinook helicopters. Key development programs such as tanker, long-range strike and commercial crew also saw
budget increases.
International demand for our offerings remains strong, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region.
During the first quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 23% of revenue and 37% of
our current backlog. Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as
commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance and a few critical future
franchise programs, like long-range strike and the T-X trainer, which are priorities for our customers.
The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and
affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative which is focused on reducing operating costs
by another $1 billion on top of the $5 billion already achieved, which will ensure competitiveness through the ongoing
downturn in domestic defense spending.
Overall, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and the opportunities of our markets and our teams are
executing them well to deliver increased top-line and bottom-line performance, support the needs of our customers and
capture new business to sustain our growth and profitability for the decades to come.
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?
Gregory D. Smith
Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to slide four and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue
increased 8% to $22.1 billion, driven by strong Commercial Airplane deliveries. Core earnings per share for the quarter
increased 12% to $1.97, driven on higher Commercial Airplane volume and continued strong operating performance.
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide five. For the first quarter, our Commercial Airplanes business
increased revenue 21% to $15.4 billion on 184 airplane deliveries and reported operating margins of 10.5%. Strong
operating margins in the quarter were primarily driven by higher volume, continued focus on productivity and program

mix. Commercial Airplanes captured $9.8 billion in net orders during the first quarter and backlog remains very strong
at $435 billion and over 5,700 aircraft equating to approximately eight years of production.
Specifically on the 787 program, we continue to expect the program to be cash positive during 2015 and we still
anticipate deferred production to the client shortly after we achieve the 12 per month production rate in 2016. No
change to these fundamental milestones. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators for the
787 program as we further implement production efficiencies while meaningfully increasing 787-9 production and
managing through some near-term disruption in supply chain, largely around cabin interiors. Despite these challenges
and with a lot of hard work from the team, we delivered 30 787s in the quarter and made further progress on reducing
unit cost.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 30% over the last 190 deliveries. And furthermore, the
787-9 unit cost declined approximately 25% over the first 20 deliveries. In line with our expectations and at a declining
rate, 787 deferred production increased $793 million to $27 billion in the first quarter. And as we previously discussed,
we continue to anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at similar levels for the next couple of quarters before seeing
a healthy decline in the growth later in this year.
We remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution, risk reduction and improving the long-term productivity and
cash flow going forward. We continue to manage the smooth ramp of the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 rate per
month introduction of the 787-10 while also driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.
Let's turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on slide six. First quarter revenue at our Defense business was $6.7
billion and operating margins were strong at 11.1%, largely driven by solid performance and favorable mix. Boeing
military aircraft first quarter revenue declined to $2.7 billion, primarily driven by planned timing of C-17 and F-15
deliveries. Operating margins at 9.5% reflect delivery mix that offset improved operating performance.
Network and Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion and increased operating margins to 9.6% in the quarter,
resulting from higher ULA earnings. Global Services and Support revenue was $2.2 billion and operating margins
increased to 14.1% on solid operating performance and favorable program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a
solid backlog of $60 billion with 37% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.
Next slide, please. Operating cash flow. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was approximately $100 billion (sic)
[$100 million], driven by solid operating performance and, as expected, the timing of receipts and expenditures that
were largely benefited late in Q4 of 2014. We continue to expect 2015 operating cash flow to be more than $9 billion,
with the majority of that being generated in the second half of the year. With regards to capital deployment, as Jim
mentioned, we paid $639 million in dividends and repurchased 17 million shares for $2.5 billion in the first quarter as
we continued to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders and, furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence
in the long-term outlook for our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $9.5 billion repurchase
authorization over the next two years to three years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to
support future growth remains top priority for us.
Moving to cash and debt balances on slide eight. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable
securities and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us very well going forward.
Let's now turn to slide nine and I'll discuss our outlook for 2015. We are re-affirming our 2015 guidance for revenue,
operating margins, core earnings, deliveries and cash flow and overall we're very pleased with the first quarter
performance as the core operating engine continues to deliver strong results and we expect that performance to
continue as we remain focused on production, program profitability, rate ramp-up and ongoing productivity
improvements.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim for some closing comments.

Thank you, Greg. With a strong first quarter behind us, we remain focused on disciplined execution, quality and
productivity improvements and meeting customer commitments. Our priorities going forward are clear and consistent:
the profitable ramp up in commercial airplane production, executing well on our development programs, driving
efficiencies throughout the enterprise, continuing to strengthen our Defense business and, importantly, providing
increasing value to both our customers and our shareholders.
Now we'd be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Howard.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: You talk about – there could be a number of questions to ask – but you talk about being
able to make some real progress with the 777 bridge. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? And, Jim, maybe talk
about the quality and the characterization of the discussions you're having with customers?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I think 777, you've heard my speech before, Howard. Unique airplane in terms of
its capability and where it's positioned in the market, so a real opportunity to manage this bridge well. So far so good. I
think last year's performance was good. I think this year, where we stand now, we've got 25 orders and commitments in
hand today. That's roughly half or just short of half of what we're looking for for the entire year.
I mentioned the production skyline in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and it's beginning to firm up. So, we are increasingly
confident that we can implement this bridge and it's important, not only commercially and to keep the rate going, but as
I mentioned in my comments, we're sort of feathering in some new technology on the current airplane, the ER, so it's
tested and de-risked by the time we get to the X. And so this bridge has lots of value for us, lots of value for our
customers. So steady she goes.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Maybe just a follow up for a second. You talk about feathering in some of this
technology. And in the press release, you talk about accelerating some of the development milestones. So are we to
take that that in fact the R&D programs are, whether it's the MAX or the 10 or the X, are kind of coming in a little bit
better than your current budgets?
<A - W. James McNerney>: No, what I would say is on budget, slightly ahead on de-risking. In other words, things
are – we're spending about what we had planned – but the technical advances or the reliability that we're shooting for is
coming in a little bit more robustly than we'd hoped. And as you recall, we've got a development organization that is
100% focused on development now and that gives us much greater visibility and much more objectivity around these
kinds of milestones.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yep.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you very much. So your 787 deferreds per unit built look like they went from $32
million in the fourth to $26 million. Maybe give us some color. This looks like better performance than we'd expected.
Was this better than your performance expectations? How did the 787-9 and 787-8 do? And is the 787-8 now in a cash
positive mode with regard to deferreds?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I guess what I would say, Cai, when you look over that timeframe, we have seen
improved performance, in particular, I noted on the 787-9, as they're coming down the learning curve in a very
aggressive manner. And I that think that goes to the lessons learned off the 787-8 and getting those into the production
system. So that introduction of that airplane is going very well and, as you know, that'll be close to half of our
deliveries this year so that smooth introduction is important.
When you look quarter-over-quarter, as you know, Cai, mix comes into play. So we did have some early 787-9s,
actually the first two, coming out of Charleston. So that played into the shift quarter-over-quarter. But I'd say
fundamentally, again, the program continues to make good improvements on unit cost. Still got a long way to go, but
making good progress.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: And maybe a follow up. You'd mentioned the cabin interior disruptions.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: What impact did that have on the 787 and when do you think you'll have that behind you?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, I mean, Cai, we delivered 30 airplanes, which was the production rate, but it's
disruptive. It added additional pressure obviously on deferred. And you see by the growth in deferred, we were able to
offset some of that through our own productivity. But certainly it's been disruptive. There's recovery plans in place.
We're part of that recovery. We're actively engaged with them and we don't see that impacting our delivery through the
balance of the year.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you very much.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: You're welcome.
Operator
And next we'll go to Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I'd like to just continue on that with the 787. If you look at the increases that you're
seeing in deferred and as I look at the numbers for this quarter, it looks pretty much on the trajectory you described last
quarter. But can you parse this out into buckets? And what I mean by that is, things that would be one-time
investments, I would say higher costs on early 787-9 deliveries and potentially other factors related to operations of the
supply chain, how would you divide this? I mean, how much falls into each category?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I'd say roughly, Doug, it's about a third, a third, a third, breaking each one of those pieces
down. Certainly, as we talked about, maintaining some higher employment as we work through incorporating reliability
and driving productivity initiatives obviously getting ready to de-risk for the 787-10, the 12-month, and the early
introduction of 787-9. And as you know, you've been covering this business a long time, and this is about as smooth an
introduction you've seen on a wide-body program and particularly one that is at record production rates. And that's
attributed to really risk reduction effort and focus early on in the program.
Some of the supplier negotiations that we talked about moving some of those to the right as we get more mature on the
learning curve within those suppliers and then some of the productivity initiatives, as I've highlighted where we're
really seeing opportunities to drive further value in the program over the long-term, but require some upfront

investment. Those are very good business cases, they're absolutely the right thing to do to drive long-term profitability
in cash for this program. And those obviously remain a top priority for us.
And at the same time, we're looking for more opportunities to capture further productivity and cash that will require
more investment. So we're continuing to focus on that. And, again, I think it's absolutely the right thing to do for the
program and, again, driving long-term profitability and that's the focus.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And if I can, on a follow up on this. I mean, on the 787-9 in principal, I mean, this is an
airplane that has higher pricing. You've done a lot of design work to lower manufacturing costs for it.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: So in theory, this should be a very attractive airplane from a profitability standpoint. Can
you give us a sense of when you expect the 787-9 to become cash positive?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I don't really look at it that way, Doug. I mean, I look at it as a program as a whole.
And the productivity focus is not just on the 787-9; it's across the entire value chain of 787-8 and 787-9. But, again, on
the overall profile, when you combine the 787-8s and 787-9s, we expect to be cash positive during 2015. So that hasn't
changed. But the fundamentals, again, are more across the entire either supply chain or internally whether it's a 787-8, a
787-9 or a 787-10, where do we drive additional productivity?
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Okay.

Next we'll go to Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, Jim and Greg.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hey. Good morning, Carter.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Greg, I wondered if you might clarify something on the 777 for me. I'm just sort of
wondering what the implications of inserting some of these productivity investments into the ER production line are on
the margin front for that program? Is that – by including those in sort of end-of-line ERs ahead of the 777X, does that
have a negative margin impact of any significance?
And then secondly, how should we think about the impact of splitting the 777X into its own block and what that will
mean for overhead and non-recurring investments? Is that a material up, or in the other direction? How should we think
about those impacts?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, first, the answer to your last question is no. As far as the introduction of this, we
extended the block by 50 units this quarter and that investment that we've talked about that's going to apply on the 777,
eventually the 777X, when that cost is incorporated. So those are in our booking rates this quarter.
I would tell you very smooth introduction when I say that, proving out this technology outside the production system in
an isolated – again, outside the mainstream production proving it out, making it rate capable and then a smooth
implementation as you're continuing to build 8.3 a month. So a lot of that prove out, again, risk reduction investment up
front, but long-term profitability of the program, doing that outside the production system. So we've been doing that.
And that's, I'll say, the plan, to implement that into the mainstream production. So I don't view that as high risk. I think
the de-risking activity has been very prudent. And if we see any issues along the way, we have a plan B or, I'll say, an
off ramp to continue with the current production system. So I think the risk is very managed. Now, the opportunity
obviously is reducing flow time, better quality and ultimately better unit cost. So a very good investment for us over the

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: And keep in mind, too, Carter, escalation comes into play here that some of the productivity
that came through in the booking rate, some of that was offset by escalation that impacted the booking rates across all
the programs. But, again, strong productivity across all the programs.

that they would have liked. And so I guess to what extent did those delays impact that inventory number? And where
do you see issues in the supply chain that concern you as you talk about going up to 12 a month?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, I mean, some of that, Sam, is just the fact that we're going up in rate. So there's some
of that. The disruption we've talked about, again, the team has done a fantastic job managing through that disruption,
reaching back into the supply chain and helping wherever we can help out. And there's recovery plans in place. So
watch item, certainly been disruptive, but certainly not something we see impacting the deliveries for the year.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: And can you tell us when in 2016 you plan to go to 12 a month?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Later in 2016.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thanks.

Next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey. Good morning. Jim, I was wondering if you might spend a few minutes talking about
the Defense business.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: In particular, comment on the sales efforts on the C-17. And then maybe just provide some
updated thoughts on, say, the next five years in the Defense business. Historically have talked about this being flattish,
with some programs coming up and some coming down. Maybe just an update there would be helpful.

<A - W. James McNerney>: I think the summary would be the outlook remains challenging, but recently looking a
little better as I read the political dynamics, just overall comment about the marketplace, particularly the U.S.
Congress-driven marketplace. But to the specifics of your questions, C-17s, we've got orders and commitments that
leave about five to go. We have a lot of action on those five. So I think the team made the right call on when to curtail
the program. You always want to curtail these things where you end up having a little more demand than you've got
airplanes at the end to hold pricing and production. And that is playing out well for us.
I think in the face of sequestration, the reason for my optimism – and it's not wild-eyed optimism, it's a matter of sort of
Ryan/Murray 2.0 sort of maybe extending the kind of budget compromise that had been fashioned a couple of years
ago another couple of years. And that may turn into a broader consensus dealing with sequestration in a balanced way.
So a little more optimism that that will sort out. And based on newspaper reports I've seen, Murray and Ryan are
working together again trying to come up some kind of a budget compromise that would include the defense portion.
We're well marked up in the president's budget request, more than our fair share of sort of the jump balls I guess is the
way to put it. And so our backlog remains strong. Our profitability because our productivity plans assume the worst and
what we'd like to do is be surprised, and so that's the reason you're seeing strong margins in the first quarter in our
Defense business, notwithstanding some timing on the deliveries, which will sort out by year end. But does that give
you the flavor you were looking for?
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Yeah, and maybe just to put a little bit finer tooth on this, you've got risk on F-18, F-15
towards the end of the decade. You've long talked about tanker and P-8 offsetting those declines.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Is that still the broad brush stroke view of the world?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah. And I think F-18 and F-15 may have more legs to them yet to be proven than the
last time I made that comment. So a little bit more bullish there. But long-term that is the way I look at it. The only
other thing I'd add to that is that there are three or four major development programs that are in play right now.
Long-range strike is one, tanker is another one. The UCLASS is another one. And so there's some major programs. And
if we win our market share's worth of those or maybe a little better, that will provide some upside to the equation you
mentioned.

Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Yeah, hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning, Ron.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hey, Ron.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Just a quick question on customer advances. It seems like more recently that's been more
volatile than it has been in the past. And just thinking about it, has there been a change in policy around how you
collect the PDPs? Meaning, with backlogs going out so far and is it to your advantage to try to collect some of those
PDPs maybe sooner, monetizing it sooner than waiting eight years for those PDPs? Does that make sense?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No change, Ron. No change. I mean, what you're really just seeing is just that the timing of
those. And as you've heard me talk about before, as you go up in rate, obviously, and with the strong order book, we've
seen more advances. But the timing of those quarter-over-quarter, very difficult to see a trend there. And you really got

to look at it over a year-over-year and, frankly, over a 24-month period because of the size of those – some of those –
as well as milestone payments, so very difficult to look at quarter-over-quarter basis. But no change.
I would tell you as far as cash flow goes, the outlook for operating cash from us remains unchanged. And we still see
strong cash flow this year, again, greater than $9 billion and continued growth as we come out of 2015 into 2016.
Advances are certainly a part of that, but just the core operating performance and the fact that our delivery rates will
continue to go up as we deliver on the 5,700 airplanes. So our view on cash flow, again, is very solid and remains
unchanged.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay. Great. And if I can, just follow on with a just a more technical question.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yep.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: On the 777X, I think you guys have said that the center wing box is going to be aluminum
as opposed to carbon fiber. What can we read into that, with that move on that aircraft compared to what was done on
the 787?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I wouldn't read anything into it, Ron. Obviously, when we go through the design of the
airplane, I won't pretend to be a design engineer here, but everything's taken into consideration as far as efficiency of
the operating economics of the airplane and the weight and that gets taken into consideration. Maturity of technology
and obviously development costs and recurring costs to build the airplane. So those are a few things that obviously are
some important key factors that we take into account when we're making tradeoffs between one type of, I'll say,
application versus another.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay.
<A - W. James McNerney>: And there was no change there. That was always the plan.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay, great. Cool. Thank you.

And next we'll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Greg, you did 10.5% BCA margins in the quarter. It looks like mix and volume
would actually be modest helps for the rest of the year. Doesn't look like R&D should be much of a headwind and it
sounds like the 777 kind of extension was a negative in this quarter. So other than conservatism, how do you foot it to
the 9% to 10% guidance for the year?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I'd kind of put it in three main areas, Myles. I mean, R&D, we do expect R&D to pick
up a little bit in the half back with, in particular, the 777X ramping up. We'll have more 787-9 deliveries and then with
more 747s as well. So that's the, I'll say, the dilutive impact for the margins going through the balance of the year. And
having said that, obviously, we got everybody extremely focused on continued [inaudible] (38:05) productivity and we
will through the balance of the year. But it's really that mix that's driving it.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: And just one clarification. You said the majority of cash in the second half. Are you
thinking two-thirds or are you talking 80%?

Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hey, Rob.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Just wanted to get a clarification from Jim and then a question for Greg. Jim, on the 777,
you mentioned 25 orders and commitments, but I think you printed just the seven orders in the quarter. So are these still
in process or are they falling to Q2?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, we don't mention commitments unless things are largely done.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay.
<A - W. James McNerney>: And so things are largely done. And there's timing considerations, in some cases driven
by customer requirements and things. And so we let the customer decide when to finally approve and release. But I
have a very high degree of confidence in the 25 number.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. And then, Greg, on cash flow, just going back, sort of a follow up to Ron's
question. So you'll probably have, let's call it, after-tax of $1 billion to $2 billion tailwind on 787 deferred. And you're
guiding to a flattish OC – operating cash flow – somewhat flattish net income and I know timing is at work there a little
bit. But given that, how should we think about the advance and physical inventory balances at the end of the year here?
I imagine that there's some offset to the deferred tailwind in terms of a headwind on advances and physical inventory.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, like I said, Rob, timing around advances and milestones can swing significantly
quarter-over-quarter and, as you said, year-over-year. So, that comes into play as well, as I said, delivery mix and even
the way the orders are profiled through the balance of the year. So, again, the outlook on cash flow for this year,
unchanged. Greater than $9 billion, that's what everybody's focused on generating. Again, quarter-over-quarter, you're
going to see variance in there. And those elements I described are really what the big shifts in quarter-over-quarter, I'll
say, fluctuation you're going to see.
But nothing's changed on the cash flow, Rob, and we continue to remain extremely focused. And I think as you've seen,
$2.5 billion share repurchase in the quarter alone, I think should give you some idea of the confidence we have in
executing to our business plan and just the overall business environment and executing on the total backlog.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: But, Greg, just to be clear, you can do the $9 billion even if advance balances decline?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, we don't anticipate any change from what we talked about when we gave guidance.
So, again, I see advances about flattish year-over-year...
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: ...from 2014. But those are all scheduled. We know where they're timed and we know where
they're coming from and we have the confidence that we'll obtain all of those as we normally do. So I don't see any
change there.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

And the next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Good morning, Jim and Greg. Jim, a question on the – you mentioned the deferral
requests continuing to run at record low rates and kind of accelerated purchases. Do you still feel confident about the
bookings environment? I guess it speaks to healthier backlog, but do you still think you can get a book-to-bill of 1 this
year?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I think we'll get a book-to-bill of 1. I mean, when I look at the pipeline, I look
what's happened so far in the first quarter, that remains how I see it coming in. And I think that's a healthy sign after a
number of years at well above that. But remember a lot of demand out there is replacement demand, new technology
replacing old technology. We're in a technology cycle now where we're not tied to GDP growth. We are tied to very
favorable replacement economics and so half our growth is replacement. Half is sort of new routes, new airlines
opening up new deliveries is more tied to GDP, but that's the nice thing about what innovation can do for you.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah. And is there any concern about just when you mentioned oil that you're not seeing any
pushback just related to that. Are some of your leasing customers that – as production rates not to go up as high as they
had indicated – are you worried about the capacity aspect or is it just related to that replacement cycle?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I think said another way, the replacement cycle numbers still work really well with
oil at current prices. Remember, we launched the 787 at roughly 25% lower oil prices than we have today, okay. So we
felt very confident then and we even more so do now in a higher oil price environment from then that this is attractive
proposition for our customer. And as I said, the order trends relate more when you just look at the stats, you look at the
r-squared, relate more to airline profitability than it does to temporary fluctuations in the dollar or in oil prices.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Thank you. Very helpful.
<A - W. James McNerney>: And that's very profitable now.

And that will be from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hey. Thanks a lot for getting me on. Sort of a follow up to the previous question actually
about the comments you made, Jim, over last couple calls about running below historical deferral or cancellation rates.
Can you give me some more color on that? How are you tracking that? Did you look back at that metric to sort of
where we are in prior cycles at this point in time, or is it sort of like a rolling historical look back? Is there any way you
can give us some more color on how you look at that metric and help us think about it in quantifying it?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, it's sort of a rolling look back, this specific metric. I think, this question, I started
working this into our presentations when we – this is before the last – back in the last dip. And people were concerned,
rightly so, about that metric. And we've just sort of kept it in place. But just in my experience over the last decade, we
have remained – in bottom-ish parts of the cycle, top part of the cycle for the last decade or so, we've remained below
that historical average, which is a good thing. We can break out the number for you a little more finely, if you'd like.

But, in general, I think the point is valid through the cycles of the last 10 years.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Okay, great. And, Greg, maybe a quick follow up for you on the comment you made about
advances being roughly flat. I had thought you'd said at a conference last month that they were going to be maybe
down a little bit because of lack of rate break. Were you just referring to PDPs or is there any other noise in the
advances line that would cause that maybe disconnect? Or am I just – did I mishear you?

And we'll go to Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning, Jon.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Hey, a question about Boeing South Carolina. The IAM just withdrew their request for an
election there late last week. I'm just curious, Jim, your thoughts on the site today and looking forward as far as the
relations with the Union more broadly and whether or not there are any lessons to learn from how Boeing has dealt
with its workforce there in terms of more broadly looking at what's going on back in Puget Sound and how to manage
that relationship and whether or not essentially Boeing South Carolina, in your view, has to stay non-Union for it to be
a competitive site?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Listen, I mean, you're right. They decided not to go through with the election,
presumably because they felt they didn't have the votes, but you'd have to ask them specifically about why they
withdrew. We are very happy with our relationship with our teammates down in South Carolina. The site is technically
and on a manufacturing certification engineering basis doing very well. I'm very pleased with its progress.
But I also highly value the relationship that we all have with our employees in Puget Sound. I mean, one group has a
Union, one doesn't. We prefer to have a direct relationship with our employees, but when they choose to have a Union,
we want to work with them. So it's not either/or. Our task is to work with both environments and to grow them to their
potential. And so very happy with developments down in South Carolina. That place is really doing well.

<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Airbus said today that they're looking at boosting A320 production past 60 a month. And I'm
just wondering if Boeing is studying a similar increase in narrow-body output and if there are concerns at this point
about the supply chain's ability to keep pace with some of the increases coming down?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Didn't see Airbus' comments today, but I think our supply chain has anticipated robust
growth, probably from both of us. They see the orders in the backlogs as we do. We spend a lot of time talking with our
supply chain and working on them on readiness issues. We've announced 52. They count a little bit differently. 60 is
roughly the same as 52, 54. I've forgotten how the math works. But I think the supply chain is ready and we spend a lot
of time investing in getting them ready.

<Q - Dominic Gates>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Dominic.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Hi. I wanted to ask for an update on tanker. And very specifically, we learned from the GAO
Report this month a couple of things. First of all, that the flight tests are – you're going to start production ahead of the
flight tests. So could you speak to the risk of that? And a very specific question, the GAO Report says that Boeing's
own estimate of the cost overrun on the initial development phase is $380 million. Is that amount covered by the charge
you took last July, the pre-tax $425 million, or is that some anticipated new charge later?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I'm not sure about the last number.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: There's no anticipated charge here, Dominic. Our estimates...
<A - W. James McNerney>: No. I don't know where they got it from.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, our estimates, taking all of that into consideration on first flight as well as completing
the balance of the airplanes, certainly there's work left to be done here and we're going get the airplane into the air
sometime this summer and that will be fully militarized. And we'll see how that goes. And continue to execute the
balance of the program, but there's no change to the financial position on the program at this point.

are resolved. They've said today they got to the root of the problem, but that they're still anticipating some disruption.
Can you tell me more about that, what gives you confidence that it won't disrupt your deliveries this year?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I think that all the problems are not resolved. We do have a high confidence in the
plan to resolve them and it's because our people are deeply involved with them in the resolution. We don't anticipate a
lot of it being worked through 'til the end of the second quarter. But we've all figured out a way to work together that
it's not going disrupt our production plans and we're pleased to see their response now to getting this fixed.
