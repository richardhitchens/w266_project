MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caterpillar third quarter 2013 earnings results. [Operator
Instructions]
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael L. DeWalt
Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call. This is Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's
Vice President of Strategic Services. On the call today, I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman,
and Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.

We'll start this morning with a review of the quarter, our outlook for 2013, and a preliminary look at our sales and
revenues for 2014.
For the third quarter, sales and revenues were $13.4 billion, and that's a $3 billion or 18% decline from the third quarter
of 2012. The decline was principally a result of changes in dealer inventories and lower end-user demand. The sales
decline was mostly in our Resource Industries segment, which is principally mining, where sales were off 42% versus
third quarter of 2012.
Sales in our Power Systems and Construction Industries segments were each down about 7% in the quarter, and driven
mostly by dealer inventory changes and in the case of Construction currency impacts. End-user demand for both Power
Systems and Construction Industries were relatively flat with last year.
Now if sales in our Resource Industries segment, which is mostly mining, had behaved more like Construction and
Power Systems, we'd certainly be having a different and more positive discussion today. But the reverse is also true. If
Construction Industries and Power Systems were seeing similar conditions as mining, it would be a much more
negative story. And in a way, that's the silver lining in a down year like 2013. It's good that we have different
businesses that aren't all behaving the same way at the same time.
While Resource Industries sales are very low, sales in Power Systems, Construction Industries have been more stable.
In fact, despite the drop in Resource Industries, which we expect sales to be down about 40% this year, you might be
surprised that our outlook expects 2013 to be the third highest year for sales and revenues in our history.
Profit in the quarter was $1.45, and that was down $1.09 from $2.54 in the third quarter of 2012. The decline in profit is
primarily a result of the $3 billion drop in sales and absence of last year's gain on the sale of our third-party logistics
business. For the quarter, our decremental operating profit flow-through, and that's the decline in operating profit as a
percent of the decline in sales and revenues, was close to 30% if we exclude last year's gain from the logistics business.
We think that's pretty good considering how much of the decline was from mining products, which have a relatively
higher variable margin. We were able to do that because of the cost actions we've taken this year. Being cost flexible in
a downturn is a key element of the strategy, and we're executing.
Volume adjusted costs were down over $350 million in the quarter. And excluding inventory absorption impacts, it was
more like $450 million. Year to date, we've flexed our variable cost down with volume. And beyond that, we've taken
out cost, again excluding inventory absorption impacts, by about $700 million, and that's year to date. To achieve that,
we've had numerous temporary plant shutdowns, a reduction of more than 13,000 of our global workforce since this
time last year. We've had temporary layoffs for thousands of salaried and management employees. We've had
reductions in program spending, substantially lower incentive pay, and we've implemented general austerity measures
across the company. In addition, to lower cost we've also cut CapEx. And through the first nine months of 2013, it's
down nearly 20%.
Now we've also continued to improve operational performance throughout the company. But unfortunately, much of
that improvement is being overshadowed by the decline in mining sales. We've improved safety in our factories. We've
improved product quality, and we're seeing that in the metrics that we track, and that's what we're hearing from dealers
and customers. For most of our major machine families, and that includes mining overall, our sales of products to end
customers are doing better than our machine competitors as a whole.
We've also done a good job executing in China. And sales there are up about 20% year to date and almost 30% in the
third quarter.
Okay, that's a quick summary of the quarter. I'm going to move on to the outlook for 2013. This morning we've lowered
the outlook for sales and revenues to about $55 billion. That's a decline of about $2 billion from the midpoint of our
previous outlook. We're now expecting profit in 2013 to be about $5.50 a share, and that's down from $6.50 at the
middle of the previous sales outlook range.
While sales and revenue expectations are lower across much of the company, the decline was most significant in
mining, and that's in our Resource Industries segment. Mining has been difficult to forecast, and that has been the case

all year. I think it's worth recapping what has happened to the outlook over the course of 2013. And that story starts
about mid-2012, when orders of new mining equipment began to drop substantially, and they remained low through the
remainder of 2012. By the time we got to the outlook that we provided in January of 2013, we've been seeing few
mining orders, and we understood from customers that they intended to reduce CapEx. Because of that, our outlook
from last January included a drop in mining sales for 2013.
Now that said, we were still seeing strong mining production levels for most commodities, and we were expecting that
mining companies would start ordering more as 2013 progressed. Now to be clear, we were not expecting at that time a
quick return to the higher order rates of early 2012, but we did expect some improvement later in 2013. By the time of
our April outlook, orders had still not improved much, so we lowered expectations in our outlook for mining. We
reduced the sales and revenues outlook again when we released our second quarter results in July.
And that brings us to today. We're still seeing strong mine production. In fact, some of the big mining companies are
setting production records. But despite that, we're still not receiving nearly as many orders as we expected, and our
outlook today is lower as a result. With the outlook now at $55 billion, we expect the full year to be down almost $11
billion from 2012, and about $8 billion of that is Resource Industries.
In terms of profit, we've reduced our outlook for 2013 by $1 a share. The most significant reason for the lower profit is
sales volume. Price realization, currency impact, product mix, and cost absorption from lower inventory are also
contributing. We did have a favorable tax item in the third quarter, and that's helped to offset some of the decline.
With one quarter to go, our full-year outlook for 2013 is essentially an outlook for the fourth quarter. If you subtract
nine months of actual from the full-year outlook, you'll see that we're expecting sales and revenues in the fourth quarter
to be a few hundred million dollars higher than the third quarter, but profit per share to be about 16% lower than the
third quarter.
The $0.16 profit drop is from the absence of the favorable tax item in the third quarter and higher costs in the fourth
quarter, and that's common at Caterpillar that costs are up in the fourth quarter. It's usually a high seasonal quarter for
us, and the first quarter is usually the low seasonal quarter.
Okay, that's the outlook for 2013. Let's turn to 2014, and we'll start with economics. In general, we think 2014 could be
a better year for global growth. However, we are concerned. We've been in a similar position over the past two years.
When economic indicators began to look more positive, we forecast better global growth. That drove expectations
around key industries that are important to our business, and we set our outlook. As it turned out, world economic
growth was weaker than we expected.
Today, while it looks like there's a good chance that the world economy could improve next year, there's still much risk
and uncertainty. The direction of U.S. fiscal and monetary policy remains uncertain, and the climate in Washington is
divisive. Eurozone economies are far from healthy, and China continues to transition to a more consumer demand led
economy. In addition, despite higher mine production around the world, new orders for mining equipment have
remained low. As a result, we're holding our preliminary outlook for 2014 sales and revenues flat with 2013, in the plus
or minus 5% range. We're expecting some growth in Construction Industries, relatively flat sales in Power Systems,
and a decline in Resource Industries.
Within the decline in Resource Industries, mining remains very cloudy and tough to forecast. The $8 billion decline
that we've seen in 2013 has been largely from equipment sales, and that decline in equipment sales has been split
between lower end-user demand and the impact of dealer inventory.
Embedded in our outlook for down sales for Resource Industries in 2014 is more decline in end-user demand for
mining equipment. Our outlook for 2014, in fact, includes a greater percentage decline in end-user demand in 2014
than we've had so far in 2013. However, that's partially offset by the impact of dealer inventory changes. Dealers have
reduced mining inventory substantially in 2013. And that means what we've sold to dealers this year is much less than
what end customers have been buying from them. For 2014, we're not expecting nearly the scale of dealer inventory
reductions that we've seen this year, and that should help offset some of the decline in end-user demand.

Mining orders have been weak since the middle of 2012, and we'd like to start seeing some uptick. We all know this is
an industry that has a history of quickly and significantly changing course, both up and down, and we've seen it move
dramatically in both directions over the past five years. That said and despite prospects for improved economic growth
in 2014 and a continuation of strong mine production around the world, we won't be increasing our expectations for
Resource Industries until mining orders improve.
Now one thing you won't find in today's release around our 2014 outlook is a profit expectation, and that's normal for
us. At this time of year, we commonly provide a sales outlook, which we've done, but not profit. And that's because
we're still working on our plans for next year. It's our usual practice to provide our first profit outlook with our year-end
release in January, and we certainly expect to do that.
I'd like to finish today with a few comments on cash flow and the balance sheet, and then we can move on to the Q&A.
Although it has been a challenging year for sales and profit, it has been a very good year for cash flow. In the third
quarter, Machinery and Power Systems operating cash flow was $2.1 billion. And even if we stop today – or at the end
of the third quarter, the nine-month mark for the year, those nine months would be our second best year for cash flow in
history. And that has enabled us to continue improving our balance sheet. In fact, our Machinery and Power Systems
debt-to-capital ratio currently stands at about 34%, and we expect it's going to improve again in the fourth quarter.
We've also returned cash to shareholders. We've repurchased $2 billion of CAT stock this year, and we've raised the
quarterly dividend by 15%. We have $1.7 billion remaining on our board authorization to repurchase stock, and that
expires at the end of 2012 (sic) [2015] (15:00). We're not announcing additional stock repurchase today. But our
priorities for the use of cash are unchanged. There are certainly many factors that could impact the future, but the
strength of our balance sheet and cash flow are positive indicators of our potential to complete the authorization before
it expires.
Okay, with that, let's move to the Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation; then
pose your question.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Good morning, it's Goldman Sachs. Mike, can you say more about the magnitude of the
additional cost rationalization efforts you're considering that you outlined in Q&A item four? And just give us a sense
on timing of the decision and the potential magnitude of savings if you can go out that far.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: This is Brad Halverson. Let me give a shot at that. We talked and Mike talked about the
fact that we missed the mining sales forecast this year. There's no doubt about that, and that has caused our forecasted
sales to drop. But inside our walls, we've been planning for a variety of volumes. And so if you look at our mining
group, they've been taking significant cost action during the year. And so a lot of those actions have been, I would say,
cyclical. And Mike talked to them, about our shutdowns and our rolling layoffs and some of the CapEx reductions and
those things. And the fact is we are proud of the results that we're forecasting for the year. We're looking at a
decremental pull-through of around 30%, which was within our target range, and I would say had two significant
headwinds, what would be over $1 billion headwind in operating profit and that would be the mining mix and the
period cost absorb impact.
So to get back to your question in terms of looking at further cost reductions, we are looking at structural cost
reductions, cost reductions that we would take with us as volume would turn up. And the types of things that we would
be looking at would be shifting production between facilities, rationalization of some product lines, looking at some of
our smaller facilities in terms of rationalization, consolidations of functions, benchmark activities, span of control,
those types of things, and we have a lot of those in consideration. We're not ready to talk about the magnitude of what

that could be, but there's clearly a lot of work going on in that area.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Brad, as you alluded to, obviously a lot of adjustments this year to the lower production levels.
I guess in the past, we've seen your cost structure improve as you've gotten to more even production levels, and I'm
wondering. How should we think about the normalized cost structure today compared to where we were starting the
year? I know you're not going to talk about 2014, but just give us a rough sense of the type of tailwind we should be
thinking about.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: I think it's always hard when you get into a discussion of 2014, where we're not giving a
profit outlook. But we've talked pretty consistently about our pull-through targets. I can say we're going to hit them on
the downside this year with huge headwinds. We're still committed to a 25% operating pull-through as business
improves. That's an environment that I think that we'll all like to see with our capacity and our cost structure we'll have
in place in terms of ability to deliver that. But I would say that we're in our planning process now. That remains our
target. There are some things that we may not be able to control or cannot control like the R&D tax credit and those
things which will be renewed or will not be renewed. But we're committed to that 25% pull-through number.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ted Grace. Please announce your affiliation; then pose your
question.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Thank you. Hey, guys. I was hoping to follow up on Jerry's question. I know you highlighted a
reduction in workforce by 13,000 year on year. Could you just maybe start by telling us how much of that – from
Brad's comments, was that all cyclical and not structural? And was there any of that tied to any of the divestitures,
whether it was logistics or some of the Bucyrus Distribution sale?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: This is Mike. There's a little bit. If you look in our release, we have a line that shows
acquisitions and divestitures, but it was actually in the scheme of things relatively small. I think most of the reductions
that you would have seen in employment this year were to take costs down with volume. I wouldn't say that there are
no structural cost reductions in there, but I think the majority of it would be around taking cost out in response to lower
volume.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. What I was hoping to focus on is the use of cash going forward.
The operating cash flow from the manufacturing business has been great. You've done a great job highlighting that. As
we look forward, I know you mentioned that there's $1.7 billion left in the buyback, and I think it runs through 2015.
But just when we first ranked the use of cash going forward given this is going to be a big cash generation year, can
you just run through the priorities again and highlight why or why not we might not see more come back through
buyback and what the biggest variable will be to maybe seeing that $1.7 billion left accelerated?
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: This is Brad Halverson again. We're having a great cash flow year. And if you go back
to the end of 2008, our debt-to-capital was 58%. And we've had a lot of focus on working capital management. We
issued our new internal measure, which is operating profit after a capital charge to get after asset management. And
we'll have $6.2 billion M&PS for the year and $2.1 billion. So the question is have our priorities changed, and the
answer is no; we'll continue to protect our credit rating. I would say that coming out of 2009, modeling the potential
downsides would have us keep a slightly stronger balance sheet in terms of what could happen in a recession or a
contagion, which clearly we're not calling for, but we probably hold a little stronger balance sheet.
And then it really looks at our growth opportunities across our segments. That's our second priority. And we have a
pretty strong forecasting process and modeling for each of those two. We'll continue to fund our pension and benefit
plans. We'll continue to have a very sustainable dividend. And then you get to the question of stock buyback. And we
thought given that equation and all that modeling that this year the $2 billion we did made sense, and we still do. We
have $1.7 billion left. We're calling for a flat outlook. So I would say we would like to see how 2014 would materialize

and what will be happening in 2014 before we make a decision on that remaining $1.7 billion.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Okay, that's great. Thank you very much; I'll get back in queue.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation; then pose your
question.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Hi, ISI Group. At the end of the day, people are trying to figure out on flat revenues, can you
grow earnings next year? So I know you don't want to give EPS guidance for 2014 yet. But can you at least take us
through the puts and takes to think about, the year-over year change in costs, mix, incentive comp, share count, just to
frame the discussion because obviously the guidance for this year I'd argue about $0.50 lower than most of the buy-side
expectations. But even off that lower level, if you're guiding revenues flat, what's the reason to leave us all thinking
earnings are up next year? So can you help us with the puts and takes?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: David, I really don't want to get into a discussion around profit next year, not because I
wouldn't have an opinion on each one of those items that you discussed, but we haven't really provided a profit outlook.
We don't normally provide a profit outlook until January. We're working on many of the things that you discussed right
now as a part of our planning process. There will be things that are positive. There will be things that are negative.
Brad's comment about our operating level of incremental margin stands. But in a year where we're not forecasting any
change in sales. I'm not sure incrementals are a great, great metric. There's just not enough sales change for it to
probably be a very valid metric at this point. So if you have another question I'll take it, but I think we'll pass on talking
about 2014 profit because we just don't have an outlook to talk from.
<Q - Ted Grace>: How about on the sales as it relates to dealer inventory? We used to target $3.5 billion of dealer
inventory reduction for the year; I think roughly 75% of that in mining. Can you update that target?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I think it's by and large similar. We've not changed that. We're looking for another decline
order of magnitude the size of the fourth quarter – I'm sorry, the size of the third quarter again in the fourth quarter. So
yes, we'll have a pretty sizable inventory reduction this year. Next year, if you look at our sales forecast, we're thinking
of inventory being more neutral, maybe a slight further decline in Resource Industries, but maybe a slight increase in
Construction. But neither are that dramatic and on balance pretty neutral.
So what you have is you have a tailwind, if you will, from dealer inventory. And that would drive most of the
improvement in Construction Industries that we talked about. But we're looking at a further decline in end-user demand
from mining, and that's essentially offsetting the inventory decline, or actually for Resource Industries a little more than
inventory decline.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eli Lustgarten. Please announce your affiliation; then pose your
question.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Longbow Securities. There are two pieces I'd like if you can talk a bit more. One, the change
in outlook in Power Systems, which was really talked about being flat and now we're down 5% for the year with a
bigger decline; have things been pushed out? Can you talk about some color on what's going on with order trends there
so maybe we can get some feel for next year? And then the big decline in profitability of Construction that occurred in
the quarter, I guess that was mostly from lack of production, inventory liquidation. Maybe give us some color behind
what's going on there as we look forward.

<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes, Eli, I'll start with Construction here. You're right. From a margin standpoint, it was
not a great quarter for Construction. Their operating profit was around 6%.
If you look at what's going on in Construction, they've got a few things that right now are headwinds for them. One of
them is actually product mix. Their sales aren't down all that much. But if you look at what's down and what's up, you
have some of their larger products in Construction, maybe as far up as a D8 tractor. That's the largest bulldozer that
they make, and maybe some of the larger wheel-loaders that are a part of the Construction business but that are
frequently used in mining applications. So at the very top end of Construction Industries, you have some products that
have a crossover into mining. And that part of their business is down, as you might expect, from mining. The part that
has really picked up is really the small end. Our BCP, Building Construction Products division, they're actually up
nicely this year. So you've got this negative mix right now that's weighing a little bit on Construction Industries.
They've also taken some and delivered some sizable orders in Brazil directly to the Brazilian government. And in fact,
it's a large order. We delivered some in the second quarter and even more in the third quarter. And in fact, we recently
won some more business there. So that's a good story on sales. The problem is it's a very big order. And the pricing on
it, I would just describe it as you would expect with a large order, lean.
Also in Construction Industries just from a competitive standpoint, it's always a tough market out there with
competitors, but you'll notice price realization is negative in the quarter for Construction. A chunk of that is because of
the large Brazilian deal, and a chunk of that is just because it's a very, very tough environment from a pricing
standpoint. And I would say particularly in Europe, it has been tough. Over the course of the year, we have been
reducing our inventory as well. We had PDC [Product Distribution Center] inventory and that's been coming down all
year long, and we've participated in selling that. So I think those things have been negative for Construction Industries
in the quarter. I think at some point in time here when the mix for them gets maybe a little bit more back to normal and
they're no longer cutting inventory, there's good potential for margin to improve there. But at the moment, it's a tough
environment for them. Now you asked a question on Power Systems.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Power Systems change in forecast to down 5% from flat. What's going on color-wise or
order-wise so we get some idea as we go through the rest of this year into next year?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes, when we started the year, we thought it was going to be flattish. So I think if you go
back to January, Electric Power is probably a level below total Power Systems. If you look at power, petroleum,
turbines, marine, rail, I think we've been probably more surprised with the downside on Electric Power than any of the
other segments. It's the weakest segment of the year. In fact, if you look at the third quarter versus third quarter, it's the
most significant reason for the sales decline, so it's off the most. Actually, between the last outlook and this outlook
going from the midpoint of $57 billion to the midpoint of $55 billion, Power Systems was fairly neutral into that. It
didn't really change much.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation; then pose
your question.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Hi, it's Jefferies. And a lot of the questions have been answered, I guess. But, Mike, I
think you were saying if I'm reading this right that you think the Resource Industries business on the OE side will be
down again next year. Is that also true on aftermarket?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: No, that's actually a good question and I'm going to expand a little bit more on the specific
question you asked. I think our view on that is probably flat next year. I would say if there's one thing in mining, it has
been difficult to forecast overall. I went through that from a machine standpoint.

I think another place where the actual has been a little bit more negative than we thought when we came into the year
was actually on parts. It's not down substantially. But in an environment where mine production is up, for parts sales
even to be down a little bit is not what you would normally expect. We do think that mining customers are delaying
some maintenance and repair. They're working hard to improve for this year their results, and we certainly understand
that. We're taking a lot of cost action that's pretty short-term focused as well. But that kind of behavior can't go on
forever. So it's probably increasing the likelihood that the further out you go, the needs for rebuild and repair are going
to go up. So it has been a little bit of a negative this year. We're thinking of it as probably flat for next year.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Great. And then can I just ask you in your forecast for the top line next year, what are
you assuming for price?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Quite modest. We weren't specific on that in the release, but I would say well less than 1%.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: But positive?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: But positive, yes.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation; then pose your
question.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Hey, good morning. It's RBC. I just wanted to go back to the Resource category again. You
mentioned that you're not cutting back on capacity there. Could you just explain to us your thought process? It seems
like trends are going to be soft for the foreseeable future anyway. I know it's an industry that can turn quickly, but you
have added a lot of capacity. Can you just walk us through maybe why you're not making any adjustments there yet?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I'll use a couple examples here, Seth, just to maybe highlight this. If you think about
mining trucks, we make some in India. But for the most part, we make most of our – essentially, with very few
exceptions, all of our large mining trucks in Decatur, Illinois in one factory. The capacity that we've added for that over
the past few years has been around reshaping the assembly process, to do more like assembly lines [ph] rather than stall
build (34:54) there. And we've added capacity on component manufacturing in Decatur. So if you think large mining
truck, it's already centered around one factory. And in terms of physical capacity, it doesn't make any sense to close
down an assembly line or get rid of machining equipment that you've put in place. So I think just from taking out
physical capacity standpoint, there's just not a lot of scope to do that.
I think secondly, we're about 12 months away looking in the rearview mirror, maybe 15 months of record production.
This is an industry that goes up quickly. It goes down quickly. What you need to be able to do is flex your costs. And
that we've worked pretty hard to do and we've done a pretty decent job of that in Resource Industries. If you look at
them year to date for Resource Industries, their operating profit, incremental pull-through third quarter to third quarter
on a substantial decline in sales was just over 30%, which considering their margins is very good. So they've worked a
lot on taking out costs. But we're going to need the physical capacity. It's an industry that changes around quickly. And
so there's just not much sense in taking out half of a factory, let's just say.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Okay, so maybe if I could just follow up on Steve's question on the aftermarket. Do you feel
like – do you get any sense that you're losing share to gray market or the producers are bringing stuff into service, work
in-house, or do you think it's just they're burning off existing parts inventory?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes, that's a good question. You're always concerned about competitors in that industry.
And frankly, it is a lot harder to figure out what your market share is of that because you don't have the kind of unit
reporting of what your competitors are doing. So it's an educated guess, but it's really tough to forecast market share
there.

What I think we're seeing right now is a lot of new equipment was purchased over the last couple of years. And where
mining companies have a choice about uptime and where they're pushing equipment hard, they would be tending to do
that with the newer equipment that they have. And we do think they're delaying some maintenance as well.
So our general feeling around it is that it will come back. We've not seen any seismic shifts there. Our dealers are
highly engaged with service and support activity of the customers. They're very good at it. They have significantly built
programs. So I think to some degree, it's around mining companies working really hard right now to improve their
operating results like we're doing.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Right, okay. Thank you very much, Mike.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation; then pose your
question.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Wells Fargo Securities. Good morning, everyone, a couple of questions. First if could go
back to the Construction Industries comments, Mike, I think you talked about new Brazilian business contract that you
won recently. Is that coming on with about the same margins as the contract that you're finishing up? And then on the
mix issue within Construction Industries, the BCP versus the large equipment, are you seeing any of the larger
equipment sold into mining coming back onto the market in the form of used equipment?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: On the first part of that with Brazil, the more recent orders that we've won volume-wise are
less than what's been flowing through. But I think the pricing would be – I've actually not seen it but I would guess it's
probably pretty similar.
In terms of used equipment coming back on the market, I wouldn't claim to know that as a firm yes or no. but if you
look at actually mine production – so let's say you've got some D8 tractors working in a small surface coal mine.
Mining production has actually come up a bit, so it would surprise me that there would be a flood of that kind of
equipment on the market. I think it's more a case where they're working with what they have and not buying new. But
as I say that, Andy, I don't have any facts and data to back that up.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Okay, and then if I could sneak in actually a positive question. You realized about 50 basis
points higher gross margin in Q3 than Q2...
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: ...despite lower revenue and lower price realization. Can you talk about the main drivers of
that sequential improvement?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes, it's been all about cost. We have been hard at work taking out costs, so that has been a
piece of it. I would be remiss if I didn't take a little bit of credit though for this tax item we had in the third quarter. And
we did have a little bit less negative of a currency drag. But I think given the decline in sales second quarter to third
quarter, you have to look at costs. We talked about being favorable year over year, $350 million in the third quarter,
$450 million without inventory absorption. And year to date we're about $700 million. So we got more than half of the
year-to-date cost reduction actually in the third quarter. So that has been a big focus for us. A lot of the actions that we
started putting in place in late spring, early summer have started to bear fruit.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Mike, let me just interject here, Doug Oberhelman, on two items. One is price and
market share. And the other one is cost, picking up where Mike left off on cost. For example, if you look at second
quarter 2013 quarter to quarter, same profit per share both quarters on $1 billion less of sales. It makes Mike's point.
We have everybody here on a cost lockdown binge. As I mentioned in one of my quotes in the release, if you sort
through the absorption factor of inventory and adjustments and everything, we've really taken out $700 million. Now a
lot of that is incentive pay and rolling layoff et cetera, but there's a pretty good chunk in there starting on structural cost
reduction, which we'll see picking up as we go forward. But certainly, that 30% decremental operating profit is one we

watch, a little higher than I want. But when you factor in the mining mix, it's justified but it's something we will really
concentrate on. And as we see sales increase, and at some point they will, I fully expect to get back to that 25% or so
range of incremental operating profit, so all hands on deck here on cost structure and more coming.
Secondly on pricing, there was a question on pricing in 2014. We have really been on a strong effort here with our
dealers to balance market share and price the last four years, and we have seen our market share grow substantially on a
global basis. And just as a reminder, inside China, while our China business is up overall, it's up primarily because of
increased market share, and we're in a nice position there going forward, a market I think we have to be if we're going
to be the global leader down the road.
With that, we've said to our customers that we would expect to keep pricing in line with inflation or so. And so we've
been able to do this and gain market share through cost reduction in quality improvements while getting some price,
and I'm just going to roll that in as a general statement to 2014. I would not expect great price realization in 2014.
We're not going to budget that in. But at the same time, I'd anticipate and hope for more market share gains. They
might be modest while we maintain some price. I think that's a balance we've been on and hope to maintain.
Remember, every extra machine we put in the field population drives a tremendous piece of aftermarket sales for us,
which we really like.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation; then pose
your question.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: It's Vertical Research Partners. Good morning. You've mentioned a lot on mining. One
question I had is just you laid out last quarter the potential in a market that was down somewhat for you to be up
somewhat on the inventory swing, and the arithmetic made sense there. Then obviously you're forecasting down now
and you're saying that retail will be worse. The underlying question really is, have you heard from mines and their
strategic planning and the walk they do with you that's not just a couple weeks or a month or two forward reflecting
current orders, but reflecting the next year that they found that much more cautious? And do conversations like that
drive the outlook that mining could be down next year, OE?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I'll take that, Doug again here, Rob. I have had several personal meetings with our
mining customer CEOs the last few weeks, month or so on this very question. And it strikes me that two things are
going on, the bullishness in which they answer that question on existing mines. If you look at a couple of big
announcements, even in the last week, of increased iron ore production, increased coal production, and you talk to these
– in my discussions with these guys it has been pretty bullish in terms of what they see for existing mines in the scope
of a very bearish situation for any expansion. Any expansion in the near term is dead. It's over. It's not going to happen.
But they are really focused on increasing productivity, getting a lot more mine production out with less resources.
That's one of the reasons I think we've seen fewer replacement sales and aftermarket sales, frankly, in the last few
months.
But they are all fairly optimistic on existing mine production also in the medium term because if you get back to what's
going to happen with the world economy, nobody knows and I'm not going to forecast it here today. You noticed we
took a pretty benign view of all that in our release this time because we don't know. But they are feeling I think for the
most part that even one to three years out, the world will grow. China will not implode. It will continue to attract iron
ore and some coal. And they feel that, but they want to get that out of existing resources. At some point, that plays right
to our hand, just not right now.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: Great, thank you, Doug, one unrelated follow-up I guess. Locomotives I think you
mentioned in the press release were down. We're coming into a pre-buy year. That was a bit of a surprise. Could you
talk about why that might be down a little on the mining mix? And then what's your status on Tier 4 freight

locomotives?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Okay, we'll go back to the first part of that. This should end up being an up year for
locomotive sales, a pretty good year. And I think our view on next year is actually reasonably positive as well. Now
that said, in some ways it's a little bit like turbines. It's shipments on big orders from customers. They don't go out
necessarily smoothly month by month by month. So there was a small decline quarter over quarter. It had more to do
actually with the pretty good third quarter last year. So I wouldn't want to send any weird messages there. I think it's a
case where our locomotive business is going to be up this year. We expect a decent year in 2014 as well.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Yes, I want to come in on that as well. We are really happy with our rail division and
our locomotive business. We've seen steady market share gains. We've seen a lot of cost reduction there. We're really
happy with that and have a lot more plans coming.
With regard to your question on Tier 4, I think in November we will ship our first production locomotives powered by
LNG. We've been working on that all year. It's a big effort we have and it's one way to address the Tier 4 situation
coming up in a couple of years for rail. The first ones will hit the tracks in November, and they've been through quite a
bit of experimentation and we're optimistic on that.
In terms of the diesel power side, we have a lot of experience with diesel Tier 4 on our off-road business that spills over
into locomotive. And while we're a couple of years away on that, we'll be using a lot of that same technology and in
good shape. But I'm really excited about the possibility of LNG powered locomotives here in the near term, particularly
with the spark spread being so low at the moment. So I'm really happy with rail and locomotives. This will be I think a
record year for them, and next year ought to continue on that as well.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your affiliation; then pose
your question.
<Q - Andrew Alec Kaplowitz>: It's Barclays. Good morning, guys.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Good morning, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Alec Kaplowitz>: Mike, can you talk about your comments that you made earlier in the call about dealer
inventory in construction, that it could be up next year, maybe your visibility around that? And as part of that, is it
possible to quantify your PDC inventory now versus maybe this time last year and the peak in that PDC inventory?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes, I'm actually glad you're asking me to clarify that a little bit because I just want to be
clear. We're not expecting construction inventory to be up a lot. We're not looking for mining inventory to be down a
lot. The reason for my comment was in a year that we're not expecting a lot of dealer inventory change, that's 2014,
that's not to say there might not be a little shift up and a little shift down here and there by business. So I wasn't trying
to signal a big build or a big reduction. I'm just trying to say that it doesn't mean it's going to be zero everywhere.
So Construction, I think whether or not and how much inventory is built next year will depend upon how things are
looking in the marketplace later in the year. So is 2015 looking up? Does 2014 start slow and start building as you go
through the year? If that's the case, then dealers may want to add some inventory later in the year. We'll have to
actually see how the year shapes up and what 2015 is looking at when we get later in the year. So I think the takeaway
from today should be our expectation based on what we see today is probably not much change.
In terms of PDC inventory, we don't quantify that directly separately, but I can tell you it's less than half of the peak. So
it's actually fairly, I would say, at a good level right now. It will change seasonally. It will probably go up some in the

fourth quarter and maybe a little more in the first quarter as we get ready for the spring selling season. What customers
buy has a lot more variability in it than what we sell. So dealers usually build some inventory in the first quarter. And
probably late this year, first quarter next year, we'd probably build a little piece of the inventory ahead of the spring
selling season. So some shifts up and down would be normal based on seasonality, but it's less than half of what it was
at the peak.
<Q - Andrew Alec Kaplowitz>: That's helpful, Mike. And, Mike or Doug, maybe could you tell us, do you think
you'll see any impact from the government shutdown, the uncertainty in Washington? And maybe just your sales
guidance for 4Q, you are talking about a slight uptick in sales. Yet if we look at your sales trend throughout the year,
3Q was pretty low versus 2Q, and your backlog is sequentially lower. So where should we expect the sales pickup, and
why should we expect a sales pickup?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes, I'd say you'll see the sales pickup in Power Systems. That normally happens on
turbines, rail. We usually have a little bit bigger fourth quarter.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I'll handle the shutdown piece of your question a little bit. I would say there has been
minimal impact on us so far. However, I've been with a number of small, medium-sized contractors the last two weeks
from around the country, and that is the first or second question they ask because they're feeling it. And for the most
part, they're fairly busy right now, but they're worried about where this goes. I would say that their answer wouldn't be
that they felt it but they're worried about feeling it in the future. And that's frankly one of the reasons for our uncertain
comments or our comments in there about uncertainty in the political arena because I don't know what's going to
happen in the next 90 days.
But if you look backwards, I've got to believe that the rancor in Washington, the dysfunction in Washington over the
last three years has not helped grow the economy any faster than 2%. That's probably not a real brilliant deduction. But
I think if it would have been quieter out there, we would not have had that, we'd probably have higher growth. So I
look at it just the opposite when I think about it. I'd like it to go away. I think we have higher growth, but I don't think
it's going to go away and I think it's going to be with us for some time. And that's just the atmosphere in which we have
to operate. We're working on everything within our four walls that we can do to make sure we're operationally efficient,
doing what we can do to lower costs because I don't know what's going to come from outside, maybe led by the
politicians, maybe not.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation; then pose your
question.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Yes, JPMorgan, thanks. Doug, back to the point you made about focusing on costs and
lowering costs, we still missed the goal of 25% pull-through, which you've been pretty adamant you were going to
meet, and we missed it by a long shot this quarter. Should we take away from that that you're just not moving fast
enough, or that your structurally disadvantaged going forward because of the high fixed costs in mining, to Mike's
point earlier, that most of the mining equipment comes out of one plant, and therefore there isn't really the opportunity
to take as much structural cost out of the system as we need in this environment?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Ann, I want Brad to start on that, and I'll finish it up with a couple observations.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Ann, we have talked about on the decremental side being in the range of 25% to 30%,
and so we're on the high end of that. And I think to the extent we had a normal decline in volume which spread across
our segments, we would be living to that today. The fact is we have a huge mix issue with the mining margins and a
pure cost absorb impact. And I talked about them earlier, but they'll be over $1 billion and over 10% impact on

pull-through in and of itself. And so being at 30% decremental, given where the volume came from, I would say would
be within our expectations for what happened.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Ann, I would say...
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Let me...
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Go ahead, sorry.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: One thing that maybe we haven't commented on enough is that living within this 30%
has been partly due to the strong performance of our Power Systems business. We had, even with sales down, good
margins in that business. And Cat Financial is having a great year. Their financial products profit will be up 25% year
to date. Their portfolio is in great shape. Their past-dues are well down from last year. And I think probably maybe
more importantly than that, the percent of the deals that they finance is up I would say a significant number. So, Ann,
we want to be at 25%, and I think that our cost structure that we're working on is to make sure as we move forward
even to the flat as we recover would be in that range.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Ann, this is Mike. I just want to make one other comment to you. If you're pulling numbers
straight of the face of the statements, you might be getting something a little worse than that. Remember, we had a gain
last year, I think order of magnitude $270 million when we sold our logistics business. And when we're talking about
30%, we're pulling that out. That's not operational.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I'll just finish this discussion on this. And, Ann, you've heard me say it and I think
everybody has. I look at 25% incremental on the way up and 25% or 30% or so, 25% or so on the way down over the
period. We've had some quarters on the way up where we weren't at 25%; we had some where we were at 35%, and I'd
say this is going to be the same thing on the way down. But generally, that's our expectation, and all of our internal
planning on cost structure is based on that. While it's a little bit over now, and I'd argue a little bit that we're not within
our range, I think we're awfully close. Losing $11 billion off the top line in a year is pretty tough to go through. And
we've taken a lot of cost out to help that, but it's just happened pretty quick. But my expectation hasn't changed, I'll tell
you that.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: I guess my pushback, Doug, and I appreciate what you're saying that when your volume is
down this much, it is hard to manage the bottom line. But I guess I would push back and say are you really moving
quickly enough? When can we expect to hear what's next? When are we going to hear about all these things you're
looking at?
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Ann, I would say that again with what happens I think we're moving very fast with
what we can do. I would say you're going to hear more about the things that we are actively working on as we speak
when we release in January would be my guess.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Okay, so we won't have to wait for CONEXPO. I guess that's what my fear was.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I don't know. I can't tell you for sure. But if you ask me what my estimate would be, I
would say that we would be looking to do it in the release in January.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks very much, I appreciate it.
