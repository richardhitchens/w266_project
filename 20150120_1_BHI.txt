Thanks, Trey, and good morning. Let me start by saying that I am very pleased with our performance in the fourth
quarter. We delivered strong results to end a record year for Baker Hughes. I expect 2015 to be pivotal in many ways
for our company and our industry, and I will provide you with our views on the marketplace later in the call. But first,
let me provide perspective on the prior year and the fourth quarter. We entered 2014 with a number of strategic
initiatives, which we communicated at our analyst conference in May. We plan to leverage our strength in well
construction, to grow share in deepwater and unconventional markets. And we wanted to establish differentiating
positions in our well production and midstream product lines through technology development.
We also outlined three financial targets; first, to raise margins in the Western Hemisphere targeting the mid-teens in
North America by year's end; second, was to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the Eastern Hemisphere; and
third, was to maintain capital discipline and deliver strong free cash flow. Achieving these performance objectives
would require managing our business more efficiently and delivering on our strategy to convert innovations into
earnings.
That means leveraging our strength in technology development and our global supply chain to deliver differentiating
new products and services, which are designed to solve our customers' three biggest challenges: efficient well
construction, optimized well production and increased ultimate recovery. The cornerstone of this strategy is to
accelerate new product development and to maximize returns early in the product lifecycle. One of the targets that we
shared at our conference was to increase the revenue generated from products within the first 12 months after they've
been commercialized.
We set an ambitious target of $1 billion in revenue for the year, a 20% increase over the prior year. During the year, our
Global Products and Services group introduced more than 160 new products and services to the market. That means on
average, we brought a new solution to the marketplace every 55 hours.
Now, let me share a few examples of technologies which are reshaping our industry and our financial performance.
Among the most impactful innovations we have brought to market has been our ProductionWave solution, which
integrates cutting-edge artificial lift technologies with production chemicals and remote monitoring services to
optimize production in the unconventionals.
ProductionWave has come to market at the right time and at the right price point to become a true differentiator, and
today, we already have approximately 5,000 ProductionWave solutions installed in North America and a growing
number of international markets. Not surprisingly, artificial lift was our fastest-growing product line in 2014.
FASTrak is also gaining momentum. This technology remains the world's only commercially available service
designed to reduce reservoir uncertainty and maximize ultimate recovery by analyzing and extracting samples while
drilling. This service has seen strong demand in exploration markets with deployments in 13 different countries across
each of our operating segments and is part of the reason why we've increased our share of drilling services in virtually
every deepwater market around the world.
SHADOW plug is another example of a recent technology breakthrough. By leveraging our strength in completion
systems and material sciences, we created the world's first large-bore plug, which incorporates a disintegrating metallic
ball. This innovation eliminates the need to mill out plugs following well completion, removing a critical barrier to
achieving unlimited lateral lengths, and expanding the possibilities of well construction altogether.
Sales for SHADOW plug grew exponentially over the year, with fourth quarter sales exceeding the first three quarters
combined. These are just a few of the innovations we placed some big bets on and these bets are paying off, creating
value for our customers, differentiation for Baker Hughes, and more than $1 billion in revenue from new products.
We also highlighted that our focus is squarely on execution and outcomes. In North America, we set out to completely
transform our largest product line, our Pressure Pumping business. This is part of a multi-year initiative we put in place
shortly after I became CEO. The plan included key investments to modernize our supply chain, deployment of new
technologies to drive efficiencies at the well site, and the relentless pursuit of contracts with larger, more efficient
customers. Our North America results are a reflection of this plan in action. For the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to report
that our U.S. Pressure Pumping margins were the highest they've been in three years.

Taking a look at our international operations, we are also seeing the benefit of investments made over the last few
years, leading to significant contract wins in Brazil, Norway, Angola, and the Middle East. At the same time, we made
the tough decision to exit some projects that weren't generating satisfactory returns. In Iraq, we demobilized on a major
contract this summer, freeing up resources to be redeployed to more profitable projects in the region, contributing to
better margins in our Middle East, Asia-Pacific segment and profitability in Iraq.
In Libya, we shut down our onshore operations there and reorganized our North African geomarket allowing us to
service the offshore market safely and efficiently from neighboring countries. During the fourth quarter, North Africa
margins were at their highest level since the geomarket was formed more than five years ago.
In Venezuela, we altered our business model by partnering with local providers, allowing us to maintain support for
this vital oil-producing country, while at the same time significantly reducing our working capital exposure. Today, our
net receivables in Venezuela are less than 1% of our total receivables balance, a fraction of what it used to be only a
couple of years ago. Across all of our international operations, we are seeing increased earnings from investments made
to modernize our infrastructure and enhance our global supply chain.
During the fourth quarter, we delivered the highest volume of year-end product sales in the history of Baker Hughes.
Our manufacturing, operations and supply chain teams all worked in concert to fabricate, sell, and deliver an
unprecedented volume of completion systems, drilling assemblies, artificial lift products and wireline technologies to
customers across Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.
Compared to the previous year, fourth quarter product sales increased nearly 20%, a remarkable example of execution
and a solid way to punctuate the end of a very positive year. We also grew our industrial segment and increased our
capabilities through the acquisition of a complementary Pipeline Services business.
In alignment with our strategy to help customers optimize production, Baker Hughes has established a differentiating
and very unique position in the midstream space, with unmatched capabilities in Process and Pipeline Services and
Downstream Chemicals.
By executing our strategy and managing our business more efficiently, we delivered on each of the performance
objectives we set out to achieve for the year. We increased share in deepwater with major wins in Brazil, Angola and
Norway. We strengthened our position in the unconventional with technologies like SHADOW plug and by
transforming our Pressure Pumping business.
We established a differentiating position in well production with ProductionWave, and through our acquisition, we
have established a very unique position in the midstream market. We ended the year with 15% margins in North
America and 20% margins in Latin America. And in the East, we achieved 12% growth over the prior year.
We achieved these performance objectives while maintaining capital discipline and reducing our cash conversion cycle,
and delivered the highest free cash flow in the history of Baker Hughes. And we converted these results into greater
shareholder returns. We repurchased more shares and increased our dividend, all while maintaining a strong balance
sheet.
But without a doubt, the most notable highlight of the year was secured late in the fourth quarter, with the successful
negotiation and signing of the merger agreement with Halliburton. We fully expect the closing of this transaction to
deliver a premium to our shareholders in the near term and provide a long-term opportunity to benefit from the future
upside of the combined companies. We fully believe in the potential of the combined companies to better serve
customers with a broad suite of products and technology, and to create more opportunities for employees over the long
term.
Under the leadership of Mark and Belgacem, our integration teams are developing plans for an efficient and thoughtful
integration, and I am very pleased with the progress to-date. Until the transaction closes, our focus remains on
execution and navigating the current market downturn. Late in the fourth quarter, we began to see the first evidence
that customers are pulling back activity, as reflected in the North American rig count. This is the beginning of a trend,
which will continue to unfold in the weeks and months ahead.

Later in today's call, I'll share my thoughts on what the near-term outlook is for our industry, what we are doing to
adjust our business accordingly, and why I am confident that Baker Hughes has the right people, the right technology,
and the right strategy to remain strong in the months ahead. But first, let me turn it over to Kimberly Ross who I am
pleased to welcome to her first earnings call for Baker Hughes to provide additional details on the quarter. Kimberly?
Kimberly A. Ross
Thanks, Martin and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported revenue for the fourth quarter of $6.6 billion, a record
for Baker Hughes and an increase of $385 million or 6% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was
also a record at $1.450 billion, up 22% sequentially.
On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to Baker Hughes for the fourth quarter was $663 million, or $1.52 per share.
Adjusted net income excludes a $34 million before and after tax gain, or $0.08 per share, resulting from the
deconsolidation of a joint venture in North Africa.
The effective tax rate on adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was 31.5%, a reduction from the previous quarter
due to the recent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit, and a more favorable geographic mix of sales. As a result,
adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $629 million, or $1.44 per share. Compared to the previous quarter,
adjusted earnings per share increased $0.42 or 41%.
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. We posted record revenue IN North America of $3.3 billion, up 5%
sequentially. North America operating profit was $488 million and operating profit margin was 14.8%, an increase of
270 basis points versus the prior quarter and in line with the goal we communicated a year ago.
The increased profitability is attributed primarily to improved pricing and utilization in our U.S. Pressure Pumping
business, along with increased contribution from our Gulf of Mexico and Canadian geomarkets. In North America
onshore, we maintained high activity levels throughout most of the quarter and saw increased demand for newly
introduced well construction and well production technologies.
As a result, the segment delivered record revenue across most product lines including pressure pumping, artificial lift,
upstream chemicals, completion systems, and drill bits. Offshore, delays caused by [indiscernible] (13:55) in the
previous quarter began to dissipate in November. When coupled with a large backlog of deepwater stimulation activity,
we saw a solid rebound in our Gulf of Mexico business for the quarter.
Moving to international results, we posted revenue of $2.950 billion, which is a 7% increase versus the prior quarter.
Operating profit was $545 million and operating profit margin was 18.4%. This represents an increase of 490 basis
points compared to adjusted results in the prior quarter. Each of our international operating segments posted increased
revenue and margins with the strongest incremental operating profit coming from Middle East, Asia-Pacific. This
segment remains our fastest growing business, and delivered an impressive 13% top line growth sequentially, along
with a 430 basis point increase in operating profit margins.
Profitable growth was achieved through an exceptionally rich mix of year-end product sales across the region, along
with record revenue in drilling services, artificial lift, and pressure pumping. Completion systems also delivered record
revenue and delivered a major well construction project on our integrated operation in Malaysia. We also saw a
positive contribution from Iraq, which was profitable in the fourth quarter.
We similarly posted record revenue in our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment, along with an increase in operating
profit margins of 410 basis points compared to adjusted results in the third quarter. This segment benefited from solid
activity in our Angola, Continental Europe and Nigeria geomarkets, along with strong year-end product sales across
Africa and the Russian Caspian region. The region also profited from cost reduction measures taken in the previous
quarter in response to activity disruptions in North Africa leading to higher margins.
Strong margin improvement was also delivered in Latin America where we posted a 4% increase in revenue, along
with a 750 basis point increase in operating profit margin. This segment benefited from record revenue in artificial lift

as a result of exceptionally high year-end product sales, particularly in the Andean region.
Additionally, our drilling service product line delivered strong performance and secured additional share in Brazil,
resulting in improved profitability for that geomarket. Our Latin America segment ended the year as our highest margin
operation worldwide. This is a remarkable turnaround for a business that was unprofitable only six quarters ago.
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue for the fourth quarter was $377 million, which is a 13% increase
sequentially. This increase includes a full quarter's revenue contribution from the newly added Pipeline Services Group,
which we acquired late in the third quarter. Industrial Services' operating profit margins were 6.1%, reflecting seasonal
reductions in activity, along with cost associated with the acquisition and integration of the new business.
Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we generated $838 million in free cash flow, a
record for Baker Hughes. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion, which is an increase of $531
million or 44% over the prior quarter. Total debt for the quarter declined by $280 million or 6% sequentially to $4.1
billion. And we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 18%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $503
million.
As we look ahead, we see that market dynamics are evolving rapidly. Customer budgets are being reset, activity levels
are declining and currencies continue to fluctuate. The further we look beyond the quarter, the greater the lack of
clarity. As a result, we're approaching this year one quarter at a time.
With that said, in North America, for the first quarter, we expect the U.S. onshore rig count will continue to drop as
customers reduce capital spending. The average U.S. rig count in the first quarter is projected to be approximately 15%
lower than the fourth quarter average.
Additionally, we are seeing a growing inventory of wells drilled but not completed as some customers are electing to
delay completions and defer production. In Canada, we would normally expect to see peak activity levels in the first
quarter. However, this year, rig counts are expected to remain relatively flat until spring when activity normally drops
sharply.
As a result of the reduction in overall activity in North America, we project decreased demand for our well construction
product lines. In general, well production product lines such as our artificial lift and production chemicals should be
more insulated in the short term.
Turning to international markets, we expect to see rig counts begin to slowly decline in some onshore and shallow
water markets such as Continental Europe, Mexico, Australia, Iraq and the North Sea. International markets, which
should remain more resilient in the short term, include emerging, unconventional plays like Argentina, and deepwater
markets such as Brazil and Angola. Nigeria is the exception where activity levels are likely to decline and remain
suppressed until the upcoming election is concluded.
In contrast to the declining activity predicted in many parts of the world, several Middle Eastern countries are expected
to see a modest increase in activity in the near term. Also, as a reminder, seasonal product sales, which were
exceptionally high in the fourth quarter are not expected to repeat in the first quarter of this year.
In summary, in addition to a sharp drop in product sales, we expect to see reduced well construction activity in most of
our geographical operating segments in the first quarter. With the highest declines in North America, followed by our
Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segments. These segments will see reduced volumes of work almost immediately, and
all markets may see pricing pressures as worldwide demand for well construction services continues to compress.
For Latin America, we expect to offset some of the activity declines with an increased share of drilling services in
Brazil. Similarly, activity declines in Asia-Pacific will be partially offset by increased activity in parts of the Middle
East. For our Industrial Services segment, we expect seasonal reductions in our Process and Pipeline Services business
resulting in a drop in revenue. Margins, however, should improve modestly as acquisition and integration costs
incurred in the fourth quarter are reduced.

With respect to non-operational items, interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $240 million and
the effective tax rate should remain in the low to [ph] mid-30s (21:53) excluding any discrete items. For 2015, our goal
is to remain nimble and maintain a strong focus on asset utilization, working capital and returns. We plan to proactively
adapt to changing market conditions by rightsizing our cost structure to reflect near-term activity levels.
While this work is still in progress, based on current estimates, we expect to undertake a workforce reduction of 7,000,
most of which to take place in the first quarter. As a result, we expect to book a one-time charge in the range of $160
million to $185 million for severance. Additionally, we are reviewing our operations for potential asset impairments
such as facility closures.
At the same time, we plan to increase the rigor around the process of capital deployment. To that end, we expect to
reduce capital expenditures by 20% compared to last year. We enter this cycle well-positioned financially and
strategically. At the same time, we will continue to monitor market conditions closely, adapt with agility and remain
focused on returns, all while maintaining a strong culture of safety, compliance and control.
At this point, I would like to turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Kimberly. As Kimberly just mentioned, our industry is clearly in the early stages of a down cycle, the same
sort of cycle we enter once or twice a decade. As with past cycles, the early days are always marked with a high degree
of uncertainty, which customers will cut spending and by how much, how fast will rig counts drop and where, and
when are we going to reach the bottom? And we don't have precise answers to all these questions, and no one frankly
does. But we've been through this before, many times in fact.
What we've learned in the past is that when the market turns down, it turns swiftly. In each of the last three downturns
dating back to the 1990s, we've seen North American rig counts fall between 40% and 60% in the space of only 12
months. International rigs don't tend to fall as sharply, but begin to drop steadily a couple of months after the first signs
of weakness appear in North America. We see no reason to believe that this cycle is going to be any different, but
we've navigated changing market conditions many times, both the down cycle and the eventual up cycle.
The coming months are going to be challenging, but Baker Hughes is very well-positioned financially and strategically
to navigate the near term efficiently. We know that the key to success is to move quickly, decisively and to never lose
focus on your customers or your core competency, and for Baker Hughes, our core is innovation. This industry can't
simply hope and wait for oil to climb back over $100 a barrel, instead, we must adapt to a new reality of sustained
lower commodity prices.
A major element in this new reality will be technology. And to that end, we are continuing our investment in
fundamental research and product development because our customers' need for innovative new products is more
critical than ever before. Today, our scientists and research engineers are focused on redefining what is possible and
reshaping the limits of the industry's three fundamental challenges: lowering the cost of well construction, optimizing
well production, and increasing ultimate recoveries.
We are exploring new uses for recent discoveries in nanotechnology to reduce the cost of an unconventional well. We
are researching new sensors and new metallurgy capable of increasing production from ultra deepwater reservoirs. We
launched a breakthrough new chemical product called JETTISON, which removes oil from solids in the production
stream, reducing our customers' refining costs. And given the outstanding success of ProductionWave that I mentioned
in my opening remarks, we have greatly accelerated the research and engineering of a new product called LEAP, the
same artificial lift concept we unveiled at our Analyst Conference. This technology has the potential to completely
redefine production management in low-rate wells, and is the latest demonstration of our leadership in production
enhancement solutions.
These are just a few of the opportunities we've been working on, and it demonstrates that our strategy transcends
market conditions and supports our purpose to enable safe, affordable energy, improving people's lives. Longer term,

the outlook for our industry remains strong. The world's demand for energy will continue to climb, and the supply of
energy will continue to increase in complexity, requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technologies. In
the meantime, we remain committed to our strategy, focused on execution, dedicated to safe, reliable service, and
relentless in our pursuit of positive outcomes for the coming year.
So with that, Trey, let's go ahead and take some questions.
Trey Clark
Thank you, Martin. At this point, I'll ask the operator to open our lines for your questions. To give everyone a fair
chance to ask questions, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and one related follow-up question.
With respect to the pending business transaction with Halliburton, as I'm sure everyone can appreciate, we're limited in
what we can say while the regulatory approvals and other processes remain underway. Therefore, we will not be
responding to questions on this topic at this time. For additional information on this agreement, we direct you to the
recent SEC filing for background on the deal, terms of the merger, and recommendations from our board and their
advisers.
With that being said, Paulette, could we have the first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes
from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Thank you. Good morning. First, let me say congratulations on a great operational quarter.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Thanks, Jud.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: A question on – just start on North America. Kimberly noted your expectation of about a
15% decline in the U.S. rig count. Martin, could you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in North America in
terms of the pricing environment across your various business lines starting with pressure pumping and maybe some of
the other business lines and how does that translate? How should we think about potential revenue declines sequentially
in North America given the decline in activity and also pricing deterioration?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Right. Okay, Jud. Good morning. Well, look, this is – this market is moving pretty
quickly. We saw the rig count really start to decline in the latter part of Q4 and it's been picking up a bit of a pace,
around 50 rigs to 60 rigs a week. And I think the – and like almost any industry, the first businesses to feel the most
pressure will be your more capital-intensive businesses.
So, in the pressure pumping world, we're starting to certainly have some serious discussions with customers around
bringing down the prices and helping them adjust the costs. And we look at around four rigs to five rigs per frac fleet in
terms of utilization. So, as those rigs start coming out, there's going to be some capacity brought on to the market. And
there's no doubt that the product line is the first to witness it. And then it will cascade through the others. And again, I
think, from your perspective, the more capital intensive, generally, the more pressure it's going to come under first.
But in terms of some of the other ones, such as artificial lift and chemicals, make up a significant part of our North
American portfolio. I fully expect those to be not fully insulated but more insulated if you will. And on a geographic
basis, Gulf of Mexico would be the least to be or the last to be affected. But some of the higher cost basins like the
Bakken, the Mississippi Chat and even the Permian – we're starting to see pressure, Jud.

<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay, so would it be fair to assume with the pricing deterioration, would it be fair to expect
revenue declines greater than the activity decline in the U.S. markets, that 15%?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think – I'd say yes at this stage because you do have – you kind of have a double hit.
You have the activity declines and the revenue decline trails that. But then you do also have an accelerating pricing
discussion as well, again, depending on the basin and the product line. So if you're trying to model it, I'd say that, yeah,
you might want to get ahead of that curve a little bit.
But again, I just want to remind you that, from a Baker Hughes portfolio, the breadth that we have and the heavy
emphasis on the production side of the business and the customers' increasing focus on getting every barrel out while
they're not drilling, plays very well to us. And we will strategically use that and muscle that as much as we can to
protect our share and our margins in North America.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay, great. That actually kind of leads me to my follow-up question, which is if you look at
Baker Hughes today versus the last downturn in 2009, the company has gone through a lot of changes from
restructuring to the BJ acquisition and as you noted a nice new suite of products. How should we think about your
decremental margins as we go through this downturn? I would assume they would probably not be as severe but I
would like to get your perspective on how you see your decremental margins relative to 2009?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, your assumption is absolutely correct. There's no way we would expect the
decrementals to be as severe as they were in that downturn you referenced. And partly it's – we think it's a bit of a
different market, Jud. That was a worldwide economic recession and we saw across-the-board, customers react and
certainly this is setting up to be a tough one but we also have some customer communities, Middle East as well as some
other select NOCs around the world and some possible markets that are going to be more insulated. And so I don't
think it'll be as broad-brushed. And secondly, particularly as it relates to Baker Hughes, we were absolutely in the
middle, early stages of the geomarket reorganization and it was very difficult to navigate that market turmoil and also
execute the reorganization. So no way would we expect to have anywhere close to those kind of decrementals.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: And if I can just add to that. I mentioned in my opening remarks there about the fact that we
will be working on cost reductions. So obviously, we can't fully offset any top line declines, but we'll be working on
trying to mitigate the impact as we right-size the cost structure for the organization.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Great. I appreciate the color. I'll turn it back.

Our next question comes from Byron Pope from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Byron.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Martin, you touched a bit on your outlook for a couple of the deepwater theaters. I think you
mentioned deepwater Brazil is a little bit unique for Baker Hughes given you've got the drilling services contract with
better terms and conditions kicking in. And I think you mentioned Angola is also another geomarket where it should
hold up reasonably well for you all. How do you think about the deepwater Gulf of Mexico? Clearly you rebounded in
Q4 from the loop issues but as you think about 2015 activity levels and deepwater Gulf particularly given how well
positioned you are in the Lower Tertiary, just curious as to how you think about that deepwater theater in 2015?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think of the three key deepwater basins, I think the Gulf of Mexico could be the most
stable. You obviously have a nice risk profile both I think, subsurface as well as above the surface, if you will. I think
our customers are increasingly appreciating that. As well, I think the customer mix in the Gulf of Mexico has a little bit
more of a steady tendency to it. So, now, again, my comments are more related to the more deeper water. The shelf in
the Gulf of Mexico is already starting to come under some pressure, and I think part of that is associated with the
customer mix.

The other item I'd highlight as it relates to us, Byron, is our position with the floating capacity of the vessels. And
you're aware of those, and we have a very large contract that we secured for a super major in the Gulf, multi-year with
some pretty nice terms and conditions. And I got to take my hat off to the folks who run the Gulf business there, but
secondly, the foresight to put a vessel like that, that is so unique in its capabilities, I think sets us up pretty well going
forward whatever turmoil the Gulf should see. But of those three deepwater markets you highlighted, I tell you, in my
opinion, the Gulf of Mexico will be the most steady.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Okay. And then Martin, just unrelated follow-up as you think about 2015 growth generally
speaking, I can certainly appreciate the fact that you are taking this quarter-by-quarter. But just thinking about the
quarter that you just put up in the Middle East Asia-Pac, clearly some of that is product sales that go away in Q1 as you
spoke to. But I still think about that Middle East, Asia-Pacific region as among the international regions as being
probably the region that holds up the best, if you will, for Baker and just curious if you think that is a reasonable way to
think about it?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Again, the market conditions notwithstanding, I agree with you, but I'll also tell you that
the other two regions, the – and not to take absolutely anything away from the tremendous quarter that MEAP had, but
if you look at the turnaround in Latin America and the margins it's posted, I don't expect – again, the market conditions
notwithstanding, if we were still in the $85, $90 oil, which obviously we're not, but in terms of the resuscitation of that
business, I see it very sustainable, as well as [ph] ERC (37:02) with Africa. And again, albeit we have some serious
challenges in the Russia Caspian, the UK sector and Continental Europe is really executing, whether it's drilling or
wireline.
But to your point, certainly, the 13% sequential revenue growth in MEAP and some very, very strong margins is a
testament to Khaled's leadership, and our position primarily in the kingdom, as well as some of the other Middle
Eastern basins. And our Asia-Pacific group has done a really great job with regards to penetrating some key China
markets. We have a very nice project in Malaysia that we talked about, with Petronas that drove home some nice
numbers this quarter. I mean, across-the-board, I think the international business is really, really starting to stand up and
it's a testament to the leaders that we have around those businesses.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: If I could just add just one thing, if we drill in a little bit, looking specifically Q4 to Q1,
though, I just want to highlight that there were very strong product sales in MEAP in Q4 that don't repeat into Q1.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Great. Thanks, Martin, Kimberly. Appreciate it.

while you were at the helm. You've proven your ambition and your capability and you made Baker proud.
Congratulations.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Thanks, Jim.
<Q - James K. Wicklund>: My question has to do with international. International usually has more momentum than
North America, which implies 2016 could be even weaker. And in all of your conversation about decrementals and
activity, I am just curious to know what your longer-term two-year to three-year outlook is for those markets? We have
been increasing spending to keep production flat and understanding that there will be weakness in some international

markets but they are segmented enough that pricing isn't as homogeneous in the U.S. What is your outlook for
international just over the next two to three years realizing you can't predict oil prices but just looking at potential
activity and your ability to offset with more Malaysian type contracts if possible the outlook?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, that's a great and difficult question. Jim, I think I'd come out at it this way. Let me
start with this. We have to accept the fact that when your customer community is struggling to produce a healthy return
on its capital, particularly the IOCs, on the international front, it's going to pose a challenge for the service community.
And our customers have not been doing very well on that front. Secondly, on the other hand, the geological success, as
some of our key customers have reported over the last couple of quarters, over the last couple of years, internationally,
has not been great either. So that doesn't bode well for increasing from the supply side.
So, we should eventually see some kind of balancing out of oil prices, which will settle the market down. But when it
happens and at what price is still very much up in the air, and that kind of dictates what it's going to mean for us.
Again, I go back to the earlier comments I made. As we sit around the world, this company has never been stronger,
whether it's the talent in place, whether it's the portfolio, whether it's the adherence to processes and controls and
supply chain infrastructure, roof line, whatever it is. So whatever the market will throw to us over the next couple of
years, and you're right on, it's a very difficult thing to predict. This company is very well positioned to perform better
than I think it has any time in its history.
<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Okay. Martin, my follow-up is you guys have spent a bunch of capital over the last several
years to build out infrastructure in places like the Middle East but internationally in general to be better able to compete
on variable cost projects. Is that what we're seeing in a lot of your numbers today?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think so. Absolutely. If you look at the business that we're doing in Central Africa and
the incrementals in the – we didn't break that out, but it's eye-popping, as well as Angola. And Jim, you've been with us
a long time. You know the thousand tribulations we had in that market with the job that Alex and his team in Angola
are doing in terms of share and margin.
Nigeria, in spite of its challenges year-on-year is fantastic. You've been to our Norway facility. It's world class. It's
right in line with the contract we picked up last year on the drilling and the completions' contract, which will kick in
later this quarter, in early Q2, Brazil. Had we not made the infrastructure investments that we've made over the last five
years, this would be a very different company and this would have been a very different year for us.
<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Okay. Thank you very much, and congratulations.

<Q - James West>: And congratulations on hitting all your 2014 targets, especially impressive on the free cash flow
side.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Thank you.
<Q - James West>: I wanted to ask you a question about technology introductions. You highlighted earlier a new
product is introduced every 55 hours in 2014. In prior downturns we have seen some of the larger diversified
companies kind of slow down new technology introductions primarily because it is harder to get paid for the new
technology in a downturn. Do you think that strategy is something you would employ in 2015 or will you guys keep up
this same very impressive cadence?

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: When you have a winning strategy, you run. And we've got some exceptionally cool
things in the market, but we've got some really exciting and even cooler stuff in the pipeline for 2015 and 2016. It's a
competitive weapon and it's a competitive weapon not just because it's cool, it's a competitive weapon because our
customers are challenged.
Now, it's incumbent upon us to not only develop it, but be able to market it successfully. And if you look at the – we
put a billion-dollar target out there, we delivered a little bit higher than that, that's – again, I think it's back to the
leadership of Belgacem and the GPS team, our Global Products and Services, to make sure that the products coming to
market today are positioned properly.
As I said, the ProductionWave has to have a price point given its mission to disrupt the rod lift business. Whatever it is
and you got to have a sales force that's in tune and you got to be able to make the value proposition. So, I don't see us
pulling back at all. I mean, we're not going to have necessarily the cash flows of the past couple of years and we'll have
to be very prudent, but R&D, engineering are at the bottom of the list, I can tell you when it comes to cost adjustments
is our core and we protect our core through the cycle.
<Q - James West>: Okay, okay, good. And then just an unrelated question for me. Just on international, are you seeing
any kind of pricing declines at this point? I know it is pretty early on the international side but have any of your
customers come back to renegotiate?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes. The customers are having those discussions. It starts pretty much with your bigger
companies with pretty sophisticated procurement groups. But it's in the early stages and it's kind of – it's hard to – at
this stage, while it's easier to predict North America which basins, it's a little hard to say which region is going to be the
most under pressure. I think it's just still a little early. I think we'll have better clarity to that in the next quarter's call,
James.
<Q - James West>: Okay. All right. Great. Thanks, Martin.

Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Good morning and congrats again on a great quarter. Martin, you highlight your aim to
manage the business on a quarterly basis and align your cost structure with the near-term outlook for activity. But this
is also an industry that has a habit of overshooting particularly in the U.S. So when you think about the decline in
activity, do you start to identify certain rig count in the U.S. where you just say enough is enough, we are not cutting
our resources further because this is clearly an overshoot?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Oh, absolutely. But it's amazing how you can sit here today and have an opinion as where
we think that overshoot might be. And as you change the environment, your interpretations of what's possible changes
as well. So I don't, for a second, believe that any one of us are very good at, as you've highlighted, for 100 years, this
industry has not done a great job in being able to predict things.
And I do get a bit of a feeling, if you will, that it's – I don't want to say it's overdone, but I'd say there's a bit of drama in
the marketplace. The abruptness with the drop-off, it's almost like the self-confirming negative bias, if you will, right?
And so, I don't know where these prices are going to land. But I do get a sense that it's got a little bit more drama
associated with it than maybe the normal appropriate economics would justify.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: And just to add to that, we obviously need to be very nimble during these times. And as
we've gone through and looked at where we're going to be cutting cost, we have tried to be surgical in some areas to
make sure, for example, Martin talked a bit about technology, and making sure that we're continuing to invest in those
areas and really identifying areas where would we potentially need to cut more or where would we – what would be the
first areas where we would add back resources if we see things turning on the top line. So being nimble, I think, is

going to be key and being surgical during this time. And that's how we're approaching it.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: And Martin, would you care to share the rig count number with us? Where you think the
market should balance out as you look out into 2016 in the U.S.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. That would be my take on it right now. Scott, I'm tempted to kind of give you a
guess. But we're estimating that – I have Trey here pointing out some numbers to me, but I'm going to hold my powder
dry on this. It's still a pretty big crapshoot, okay?

And our next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thanks. And again, I mean, congrats with pretty unbelievably strong numbers.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Thanks, Ole.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: So you are reducing your head count now – with about 12%. That compares with 14% in your
case in 2009 and – 12% versus 14% in 2009 and 15% in 1999. So suggest that you are preparing for a roughly a similar
downturn, is that fair to say or are there efficiency gains within the company, which means that the capacity is down
less than what the numbers suggest?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I appreciate the comparisons that you've done over the various cycles. I would tell you
this though; these are very, very difficult decisions, Ole. I mean, for us, people like you and me have been through this.
This is really the crappy part of the job, and this is what I hate about this industry frankly is these brutal cycles that we
have to go through.
As to the percentages, this gets back to the earlier discussion we're a very, very different company in terms of
complexion, we're more people-intensive that we've ever been. A lot of that has associated with the Pressure Pumping
business, which is a very people-intensive business. So, it's – I think I'd be cautious about looking at the relative
percentages because it's – we're a different company in terms of mix than we were in those previous downturns.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: And if I can just add to that also, the cost reduction is not just about positions that will be
reduced. We're looking at cost across-the-board, so both direct and indirect costs, discretionary spending, consultants,
travel services; we're working with our vendors with regards to pricing. So, I think just looking at positions as a
percentage is really just one piece of the equation. There are other costs that we'll be having a go at, really everything
across-the-board we'll be looking at in the organization.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. I understand. It's all – it's all a little different but still I just wanted to have your response
to that. Could you help us a little bit with how we should think about the first quarter? You came out of this quarter
with just extraordinarily high incremental margins, I mean incremental EBIT margins of almost 90%. So suggesting
that there were some loss-making contracts perhaps that rolled over and maybe some product sales but something that
is difficult to extrapolate. Nevertheless, you're running very smoothly at the moment but how much more is there as we
go into the first quarter, second quarter of prior loss-making contracts that – or other activities that could roll off and
give you some protection or is that already taken in charges up to the third quarter?

<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: So, I wouldn't say there's that many loss-making contracts that'll be rolling over. What I will
say is in general obviously, there's a lack of clarity with regards to being able to predict what's going to happen in the
marketplace. So we're looking at this day-by-day, and every day we get more information. Many of our customers have
not even provided their CapEx numbers yet. What we have seen so far if we look at North America specifically on the
rig count, it very much is trailing, the rig count declines of 2009, but obviously we can see some changes versus what
happened in 2009.
I'll remind you that quarter one tends to be a seasonal low point. I also mentioned in my comments that with regards to
Canada, we expect it to be flat, which is slightly different than what we've seen in the past. So obviously, we've talked
about the fact that we do expect to see some pressure on the top line. With that said, there are many things that we put
in place with regards to some of the efficiencies, the utilization, supply chain and other things that will help offset some
of that, but clearly not fully mitigate changes that we'll see coming through in the marketplace.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: So, it's steeper than normal downturn and the first quarter is obvious. But can you give us some
more color on how to think about consensus numbers for the first quarter? Do you feel good about those despite
coming out of the fourth quarter with a stronger run rate?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: No. We're not going to give you anything additional there. I really don't think it would be
helpful, quite frankly, if I gave you something and then we're wrong. That doesn't really help you. There's a lot of
uncertainty right now still in what's taking place in this dynamic market. So, I'm just not sure that we could give you
something that would be helpful.

Our next question comes from David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Hi. Good morning. So, in your release, you talked about the proactive steps to manage the
challenges, and you had talked about kind of head count reduction. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about
how you're navigating through your customer base in North America. You've been doing a great job of building up the
utilization throughout the year. I'm going to assume the fourth quarter you were largely at capacity. How do you expect
that to play out? I know this is a tough question over the next couple of quarters, but are you trying to keep the
utilization as high as possible or – I'm just kind of curious as you're thinking as we head into this, Martin.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, David. Let me just also remind you though that, I mean, the whole business doesn't
revolve around – I know certainly it's been impactful to everybody's numbers, the Pressure Pumping business, but it's a
multifaceted discussion. To your point on utilization, obviously, again, that's around the, again, capital-intensive
businesses like Pressure Pumping and wireline, but that's kind of where it stops.
And so, yes, utilization is extremely important next to price. In that kind of business, that's your biggest profit driver.
And the discussions with customers, they're still looking for every bit of efficiency that they can achieve. And to the
point – to the degree that we can bring a broader solution to the problems, whether it's the drilling and the completions
and formation evaluation and all the way through the production cycle, we're going to continue to do that for the
purpose of keeping everything active.
But as I said earlier, four rigs to five rigs per frac fleet is generally depending on the basin what we see. And there's no
doubt that as the quarters unfold here, you're going to see capacity getting stacked because it just doesn't make any
sense...
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: To keep it running. So, I don't know if that answers your question but that's the best I can
do.

<Q - J. David Anderson>: Another thing you had mentioned earlier was about the more capital intensive businesses
are being the first to go and so I'm thinking about your artificial lift business, which would not fall into that category.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Right.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Are you seeing that CapEx shift with your customers yet? Do you expect that to play out?
This should be one of your more defensive businesses in North America? Can you expand a little bit on kind of how
those conversations are going? Have you seen that change yet?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No. If you will though, leading that conversation a bit to say let's talk about bringing in a
production solution for you in addition to the drilling and completion. So, we're purposefully broadening the discussion
as a offensive part of our marketing strategy. But it's – you're clearly correct, it's the most defensive, if not even a little
bit overshadowed by our chemical business, which is almost entirely an OpEx issue for our customers and not a CapEx
issue.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: And last quick question here, we are hearing from a lot of E&Ps are looking for 15%, 20%,
some are even asking for 30% reduction in service costs. Are you going back – are you already having those
discussions with your suppliers? And is there enough room in there to get to where E&Ps want to be? It seems like
when we are talking about 30% seems awfully high. I'm not sure if there is enough in the system to give them what
they want. Am I thinking correct?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're thinking correct. I mean, you're just not going to get there. And take your hats off
to any customer, they're going to obviously try to get as much as they can, and there will be a point where it just doesn't
make any sense. And like I say, we'll make those tough decisions. But obviously, we have – we value the relationships
we have with our partners and our supply chain, and we're working with them to help us get some relief.
And there is wiggle room in all those discussions, as there is with us and our customers. But we're working closely, it's
what interdependence is all about with our customers to make sure that we're aligned and we're working to lower their
cost but at the same time, what's right for our business is first and foremost in my mind. And we work to make sure that
we do the right thing on behalf of Baker Hughes.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Great. Thanks, Martin.
<A - Trey Clark>: Hey, Paulette, we've got time for one more question, please.

Thank you. And our last question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Thanks, guys. Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: I suppose – I guess I have some questions of a similar vein, of course. But as you talk about
head count reductions, just trying to put that into perspective. As you're managing it quarter-by-quarter, but presumably
that's not something that's quarter-by-quarter, right? And what perspective does that give us on how on your vision of
the downturn, or does it right – I mean you're absolutely – it must tell us something about how you're positioning for
now and given everything else that you've got going in the organization.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: So, the way we've gone through the process is we put together some estimates of what we
would expect would happen in the activity, as well as in pricing on the top line, and then working towards reduction to
meet that size business. When we say quarter-by-quarter, we're getting new information every day. We'll get more
information and more clarity as we go through the quarters. And to my point that we need to be nimble, we'll
continuously be looking at this to make sure that we're rightsizing the workforce in line with what activity and pricing
we're seeing in the market. So, this is a fluid discussion. It's not something that we say, okay, we've taken this action

and that's it. That's not it. We will continue to make sure that we're monitoring the activity level, so we can flex up and
down as quickly as possible to meet the needs of the business.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And [ph] Dave (01:00:20) let me just reiterate because Kimberly highlighted this before.
This is – these are very, very difficult – Brad, sorry, these are very difficult challenges and I know that's what you guys
focused on, it's what the media focuses on. But there's a lot of other costs in these companies our size that also gets
extracted. There's a lot of spending in areas that are the first to go. The very last to go are the people that work for
Baker Hughes. But like you said, this is the industry and it's throwing us another one of these downturns, and we're
going to be good stewards of our business and do the right thing. But these are never decisions that are done
mechanically.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: I understand and for what – if it's worth some clarification, it's only that I think as we all try
to get some visibility into the business, that's something that you're offering us, right? [indiscernible] (01:01:25)
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: [indiscernible] (01:01:26).
<Q - Bradley Handler>: As Ole was giving percentages. But I certainly appreciate the other elements to it, which are
harder for us basically to grab on to. If I may with a follow-up, perhaps just as many have noted and as you all have
noted, strong year-end product sales were a part of your quarter. And in some ways, that's a very – it strikes me as a
very encouraging sign about 2015 as opposed to a number of players presenting their own uncertainty with weaker
year-end sales. They seem to have gone out and done it anyway, right? But I don't want to read too much into that. So,
with the risk of it sort of being an open-ended question, does it tell you something similar? Does it tell you that there's
really not that pulling in of expectations? Or how do you read the fact that there were strong year-end sales this year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, frankly, I think our folks did a tremendous job in boosting our share position in
what's a seasonal business. So I think our results were a bit outsized and that's just – our guys reached – dug deep and
really delivered. The second thing though is, so while I give them credit, I'll also tell you that when you're selling the
shiniest car on the lot, sometimes that makes things a bit easier, too. And if you look at, again, the portfolio of products
that we're bringing to the market, and the appetite for the customers, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere, to buy
these going into the year-end, I think it speaks volumes for what we're putting out there. So, as to its indication of the
customers' appetite, I think it's still too early to tell, Brad. It's still too early to tell. We just have to watch all segments
of the business, and like I said, quarter-by-quarter, we'll get a better feel for what the year looks like once all of our
customers report later this quarter, early in the next quarter.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Great. Very good.
<A - Trey Clark>: Thanks, Brad. Paulette, you may now close out the call.
