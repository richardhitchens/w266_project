MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. This
call is being recorded. Your line will be placed on mute for the duration of the call.
We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan
Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go
ahead.
Douglas L. Braunstein
Thanks, operator. It's Doug. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation. As you know, it's available on our
website. We'll take questions after walking through the presentation. And then remember to refer to the disclaimer
regarding forward-looking statements in the back of the presentation.
With that, if you turn to page one, for the quarter we generated $4.3 billion in net income, $1.02 a share, on revenues of
$24.4 billion. There are a number of significant items for the quarter which we're highlighting upfront. I want to discuss

each of those in more detail actually when we get to the businesses in the presentation.
At the bottom of the page, you'll see we ended the quarter Basel I and Basel III ratios of 9.9% and 7.7% respectively.
And that's after the impact of repurchasing $4.4 billion of JPM shares and warrants in the quarter, and that completes
our previously approved repurchase authority of $8 billion.
It's worth noting a number of items this quarter. For credit, you see our loan loss coverage ratio of 3.74% on total loans.
Firm-wide reserves remained essentially unchanged quarter on quarter. From a loan growth standpoint, we saw loans
grow across the company $7 billion, and that's despite the runoff we see in our home lending portfolio. We had
meaningful year-to-date growth year over year in our small business originations, up 71%; market balances up 18%;
trade finance up 70% year over year; just some examples of some of the strength in various categories.
We also experienced significant deposit growth, $44 billion quarter on quarter; total deposits up $1.1 billion; and
deposit growth year over year up 21%.
Finally, return on tangible common equity is the circled number on the next page of 13%.
And with that, I ask you to turn to page three and the Investment Bank. Results here were clearly impacted by the
challenging market this quarter. We have circled net income of $1.6 billion. That's on revenues of $6.4 billion. IB fees
in the quarter of $1 billion, down 31% year over year, largely driven by the challenging capital markets environment.
On an absolute basis, it was our weakest IB fee quarter since the third quarter of 2005. But having said that, we did
maintain our number one market share in terms of fees; and we also had very positive league table results, which you
can see in the appendix on page 21.
Markets and CPG results, as you know from the upfront highlight, include $1.9 billion in DVA, and that largely
resulted from the firm's credit spreads widening this quarter. They actually more than doubled in the quarter. Now if
these spreads reverse themselves, we would ultimately book losses. Neither the gains nor the losses relate to the
underlying operations of the company. So if you remove $900 million in DVA that's associated with structured notes,
fixed income revenue would be $2.8 billion, down 34% quarter on quarter. That largely reflects lower results in our
credit related products. And that was offset by solid results in our rates and our currency businesses.
Equities revenue of $1 billion, down 9% quarter on quarter; that's driven largely by the volatility I talked about, lower
volumes, and the continued deleveraging of our prime service customers.
$578 million you see in the credit portfolio; remember, three parts here; NII and fees for retained loans. We had a $1
billion DVA gain in the credit portfolio. And that was largely offset by a $700 million CVA loss after hedging. And
that's again as credit spreads widen for our counterparties, CVA increases as well.
Expenses in the quarter of $3.8 billion; that's down 12% quarter on quarter, up 3% year on year. And you see the comp
to revenue ratio of 29%. We continue to expect to remain full year in the range of 35% to 40% comp to revenue ratio.
And before I talk about 4Q, I just want to step back. So if you – and everyone will adjust differently. If you adjusted
out the complete impact of DVA, net income in the quarter would be about $500 million. For those that adjust DVA
and CVA, net income in the quarter would have been $900 million. And others are going to make different adjustments
as you go through your analysis.
The final comment I'd make on the fourth quarter for the IB is given current markets, it's not unreasonable to expect
that the fourth quarter is going to look very similar to the third quarter.
With that, if we turn to page four, just a quick note here; this is consolidated RFS, circled net income of $1.2 billion on
$7.5 billion worth of revenues, and I want to dive into each of the businesses.
So if you turn to page five, our Consumer and Business Banking business, that's the retail branch and business banking
business. It recorded $1 billion in net income. That's up 22% year on year. Revenues are up 6% year on year. And if
you want to focus on the highlights, deposit growth up 7%; business banking loan growth up 28% year on year.
Actually, the pipeline there remains very solid. And all of that in revenues was offset by lower deposit spreads we saw

year on year. Expenses in the quarter up 2% year on year, and that really is the continuing investment spend. We
opened 60 branches, 123 Chase Private Client branches this quarter, and we're going to continue that investment.
And then the final comment is the impact of Durbin, which as you know took effect October 1. We continue to expect
revenues on an annualized basis from Durbin to be $1 billion plus or minus. We expect $300 million in the fourth
quarter versus the third quarter run rate. And that's an elevated amount due to the timing of when we ended some of our
debit reward programs.
Page six, Mortgage Production and Servicing, you see net income of $200 million. That compares to $25 million the
prior year. Production revenues, we've broken out production and servicing. So if you go to the top production revenues
excluding repurchases were $1.3 billion. It's down year over year but up quarter on quarter largely on the back of $37
billion of originations and improved margins sequentially.
Repurchase losses in the quarter, you see $314 million. That was below our expected run rate, but we do expect losses
to remain at $350 million plus or minus a quarter. But they are going to vary due to timing differences around
settlements and the like.
Servicing revenue of $1.2 billion, down 10% year over year, and that's being driven by the decline in third-party loans
serviced. And that has been partially offset by reduced amortization year on year, and that reflects the revaluation of the
MSR asset we took in the first quarter.
Servicing expense, $866 million this quarter, up almost $300 million year on year; approximately two-thirds of that
expense is default related. And we expect that number to continue to remain elevated, likely to be up actually slightly in
the next several quarters.
Page seven, the real estate portfolios, a loss of 70 million on lower revenues of $1.2 billion; that is a function of the
decline in NII, and that's a function of our portfolio runoff. We talked about that, $27 billion loan declines year over
year, $6 billion quarter on quarter. The expenses are also down 7% year on year, and you'll see the note. That's due to a
temporary delay in foreclosure activity. We do expect FAE [Foreclosed Asset Expense] expense to increase $20
million to $30 million per quarter as that activity resumes.
Page eight, the Mortgage Banking portfolio is just a little deeper dive on credit. You see circled net charge-offs for the
quarter of $900 million, and that's a modest decline versus the prior quarter. But delinquency trends really flattened at
the end of the third quarter. We've got, as you know, the additional detail on delinquencies on page 19 in the appendix.
And given that flattening and the ongoing uncertainty in the environment relative to HPI and other items, you'll see we
made no changes in our allowances either for our non-credit impaired portfolio, which remains at $9.7 billion, or our
PCI. You'll also see our guidance remains unchanged at $1.2 billion plus or minus. But it's fair to say that if the current
environment remains stable, those losses could clearly be modestly better next quarter.
And then just a quick update on sensitivity for the portfolio; so if you had a 10% decline in housing prices from today,
for the NCI portfolio that would imply a modeled loss of $700 million over the next year. For PCI, given that's a life of
loan, it could add $1.5 billion to existing reserves. And you should know that the current mark on that portfolio already
assumes a 4% decline, so that would be an additional 6% decline beyond that. Obviously given where current
conditions are, we feel our reserve levels are appropriate.
Page nine, Card Services and Auto, this now reflects the combination of auto and student lending that we transferred
from RFS, and you'll see in the supplement the restatement of all of that information. Circled net income of $850
million, that's on revenues of $4.8 billion. Credit costs in the quarter were again the story, $1.3 billion. That included a
$500 million reserve release in Card. That was offset by a $130 million build in student lending. At the end of the
quarter, total allowances for Card are $7.5 billion.
So if you focus in on the Card Services number and you look at Chase portfolio drivers of performance, I'd start with
credit. You see the circled number at the bottom of the page, a 4.34% charge-off rate in the Chase portfolio. That's an
improvement of almost 100 basis points over the last quarter. We also think net charge-offs could modestly improve
again next quarter from the current quarter. But after that, you shouldn't expect much additional improvement.

Sales volume you see is up 10% in the portfolio year over year, 2% quarter on quarter. Outstandings, while they
declined 6% year over year, actually leveled off quarter on quarter, and that's a positive trend. But I will caution that
payment rates for the portfolio still remain very high. And if you add all that up on Card, pre-tax pre-reserve is up
almost $1 billion year over year, $700 million for this quarter, and that includes significant growth in our marketing
expenses that you see running through the expense line this quarter.
Auto, the performance of auto again was solid this quarter. We had almost $6 billion of originations. And we do
believe we're going to continue to grow and invest and manage this business for what are very attractive returns.
Page 10, Commercial Bank, circled net income of $570 million; that's on revenues of a little under $1.6 billion.
Revenues are up 4% year on year. That's the same story we've been talking about on the Commercial Bank, which is
growth in loan balances, growth in liability balances. In fact, $180 billion in liability balances is a record this quarter.
And that growth is offset by the spread compression we continue to see in our liability products.
On the loan balance side, you see $107 billion circled. That's up $5 billion quarter on quarter, $9 billion year on year.
It's our fifth consecutive quarter of loan growth. Middle market balances, which I said were up 18%, that's our sixth
consecutive quarter of loan growth in the middle market. And that has been a combination we think of modest demand
increases as well as market share gains. Just I will note that utilization rates still do remain reasonably constant and low
relative to history. Part of that is that those cash balances reflect very healthy balance sheets on the part of those
customers.
Expenses are up slightly this quarter. That reflects the build-out of our WaMu footprint states. Just as a measure of
performance, loan balances and liability balances are each at about $2 billion, up almost 100% year on year,
respectively. And then you see credit trends continue to be favorable, declining net charge-offs this quarter and
declining non-accrual loans.
Page 11, Treasury and Security Services; you see circled net income of $300 million. That's up 22% year on year but
down quarter on quarter. Revenue growth of 4% year on year, that was 7% growth if you exclude the impact of the
transfer of the commercial card business to Credit Card we did. And the quarter-on-quarter decrease in revenue is a
function of the seasonality we see in our dividend seasons in 2Q and 4Q.
If you drill into the revenue growth, really it's driven by a number of factors. You see the circled liability balances.
Those are up 40% year on year, almost $100 billion. Very solid non-U.S. revenue growth in this business, up 16% year
on year; we continue as a function of that growth to build out our GCB [Global Corporate Bank] anchor footprint and
our product capabilities. Trade loan balances are up almost 70% year on year to $30 billion. And all of that continues to
be offset by the same spread compression I talked about in the Commercial Bank.
Expenses here are up 4% year on year, and that's driven primarily by non-comp related expenses as well as the
expansion I talked about before.
Asset Management, Page 12; this is a business that was clearly also affected by volatile markets this quarter. You see
circled net income of $385 million. That's down 8% year on year, 12% quarter on quarter. Revenues of $2.3 billion,
while up 7% year on year, are down 9% quarter on quarter related to those market conditions. And again, this is a
business that we expect to see continued pressure on revenue in the fourth quarter if the current market conditions
persist.
Long-term flows here also slowed materially this quarter, and that reduced the benefit of that mix shift we've
experienced over the last several quarters. We also continued to see outflows in liquidity products as well this quarter.
Expenses were up 21% year on year, and that's due to a non-client related litigation matter as well as the continued
investments we've talked about before. And you see that impacting our pre-tax margin, reported 21% in the quarter. If
you excluded the impact of litigation, margins would be 26% this quarter, but still down quarter on quarter and year on
year.

Page 13, Corporate and Private Equity; these results were also affected by market volatility. Private Equity, you see a
loss in the quarter of $350 million. The majority of that is driven by mark-to-market losses in portfolio positions. But
we also reduced valuations for companies that were experiencing operating performance weakness, and that
contributed to the results as well. Remember, going forward these results are going to continue to be lumpy, and they
are also going to continue to be impacted by markets and market levels.
Corporate, there was a loss of $300 million. It was a function of three things. The challenging trading environment
impacted our mark-to-market positions, and that was partially offset by higher security gains. We had lower NII and
that's really a result of the repositioning of the portfolio. We've talked about that for a number of quarters, but the
security gains we took last quarter lowered NII this quarter. And then we also took $1 billion in litigation expense,
predominantly related to mortgage matters, and you see that in Corporate for the quarter.
The other comment I'd make here is that given the current environment and given our positioning and given
reinvestment opportunities, we do expect Corporate excluding Private Equity to basically be zero plus or minus in the
fourth quarter. And I think Jamie will talk a little bit about '12 guidance later.
I think I've covered much of page 14, in fact, all of 14, all of 15; so with that, maybe Jamie, I could turn it over to you.
James Dimon
Thanks, Doug; hello, everybody. Let me just cover a couple quick things and we'll open it up to questions and
comments.
Page 16 has a page called comments on 2012. I just want to point out to you, as usual, we focus on the negatives and
the issues and not the positives. We have great franchises. Doug mentioned some really astounding numbers: small
business loans up 71%; middle market loans up 18%; trade finance up 71%; deposits retail up 7%; deposits in the
Commercial Bank up something like 30% or 40%. I won't include TSS because some of that may be a little a flight to
quality, but up $100 billion, unbelievable liquidity, and so we feel very good about all the things.
But having said that, just a couple quick comments; Investment Bank, it's hard not to be cautious. I'd say that right now,
nobody, nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow, so I've seen markets like this where things stabilize. Europe
does something big and things take off. There are fairly large backlogs, and we pointed that out to you before. Backlogs
are very deceptive. But you can't look at these things and not expect maybe this will go a little bit longer.
We have no major layoff programs. Obviously, the Investment Bank will be trimming its sails a little bit, getting tight.
And there are some benefits of getting – rolling in some new productive systems, so we expect to see the head count
going down, but no major layoff programs.
Asset Management, obviously depending on market levels, but we continue to build the business and even this quarter
had net inflow. We don't know about other people yet, but I think that's probably pretty good.
Consumer/Business Banking, Doug already mentioned Durbin. This $600 million is the same as the other $1 billion
you saw. This is just after-tax. This is the actual revenue effect minus what we've already done, but not including what
we might do, so we're looking at products, services, how we want to do it, how are we going to price it, try to be a little
creative and smart and do something really neat. So we're just saying that one thing in loan is that there may be other
sides to that one.
And there's a little bit of spread compression given low interest rates that if all things adjusted for now, we just reinvest
it at the same duration, et cetera, it would impact net income $400 million. I just want to point out, that's purely up to
us. We can do that or not do that. It's really longer term rates that this is the effect of. We can wait or not wait, and so it
will probably be our decision.
Commercial Banking and Treasury and Security Services, their margins are going to be low as long as rates stay low,
so they're positioned to benefit from raising rates if and when that happens. Quarterly net income, Doug already
mentioned as Private Equity, if things stay like this, you shouldn't expect any profit this quarter. So just to point out, we

really haven't spoken of this before. Part of Private Equity is marked to market. Part of it is marked to model, which
means marked to PEs and stuff, so you can think of it as several billion dollars are in effect marked to market pretty
much.
And then, obviously, in Corporate, also these are firm decisions. Depending on how long we go in duration, depending
on how much risk we take, depending on what happens to the rest of the balance sheet, we will decide when and how to
use some of our firepower to create more income. We're just talking about the negative part right now.
Reserve release, I think it has been pointed out by several people already that we didn't take reserves down. We're
fighting not to take them down. We may not be able not to take them down because, obviously, we operate under a
bunch of accounting rules. Our preferred election right now is with delinquencies flattening out, there are some good
signs. There are some bad signs. It's all over the place. We'd rather leave them up until we have to take them down. So
don't read anything into that other than we're just trying to be conservative here.
We are going to spend a lot of time really in the next six or nine months dealing with our budgets and dealing with
regulatory issues. So what we want to do is build in at the product level, the legal level, liquidity, capital, G-SIFI,
whatever we have to deal with so we can properly price and manage our businesses going forward. I do think we'll
have effects on a whole bunch of areas. And we haven't calculated it yet now. But if I have to guess, it's going to add
$0.5 billion to overhead over time as we put all these systems and reporting in. I want to point out that I think some of
that is a waste of money, but that's life. I guess we have to do it.
And the last point on Other, I gave one issue on business issues about branch build. I think we have already built about
250 branches this year. We indicated we might do more. It's possible we won't now. We're going to be looking at a lot
of business issues. Take branches for example. With NSF/OD changing, with Durbin changing, with FDIC charges
changing, some branches at the margin are no longer great, so we will probably reduce a little bit the branch build
strategy. We still need to build branches in certain cities in particularly California and Florida to build out our footprint,
but we will modify that and we'll report back to you when we have that. But I would say the same thing about lots of
products and services and issues. We're going to be taking a look at them. I'm not expecting anything dramatic, but
obviously there are a lot of issues there. We're making so many changes all at once.
On capital generation, dividend, obviously a Board decision; we'll probably take it up at the turn of the year. I'd like to
just see us do it steady every year but not much more than that. We're going to continue to invest in organic growth.
But there are a lot of issues, and a lot of analysts have raised which ones might you rethink. We'll get back to you on
that. So there are areas that we know we're going to finish building out. One of the areas maybe we're going to look at,
how aggressive, what the price will be, and whether it still makes as much sense as before. But organic growth is an
important thing that you can't stop/start; i.e., hiring private bankers, training people, building systems, so we're still
going to be doing some of that.
And the last box which is boxed there, which says meeting regulatory requirements and stock buyback, we still will
have enormous capital generation, but we are trying to figure out – I call it capital confusion. It's hard to tell what we're
supposed to do and how we're supposed to do it. We'll be figuring it out, having conversations with regulators. At one
point, the capital generation will be used clearly to do what makes sense for shareholders. The question is how quickly
do we want to get to where we need to be. And there are other things like there are new rules coming, risk-weighted
asset models, models versus European companies.
Some mitigation will take place. We'll write it up. Some we can do more actively, but it would cost a little bit of
money. Why do it quickly if it would cost you money? So we're going to be talking more about this as we go forward.
And obviously, if you want to make the point, we spent a whole $8 billion buying back stock. And yes, it would have
been wiser to wait. We're sorry.
And with that, I will open the floor to questions or comments. I'm sorry, Page 17.

James Dimon
Page 17, we tried to make this simple, but Cramer, if you're on, Jim, I gather we didn't do a great job at it. So I'm going
to take you through the top.
AFS securities, these are held by treasury or by CIO, often to offset deposits or other things we need to do with
asset/liability management. That $3.7 billion if you marked it would be about $3.4 billion. It's mostly sovereign
exposure into five countries, mostly obviously Italy and Spain.
And let me go back to potential losses a second. Trading, $8.7 billion; it includes $14 billion of gross long derivative
with offsets on the other side. We've got collateral which is mostly cash, $6.7 billion against that. Sovereigns do not
post collateral, so a lot of the remaining exposure is sovereign exposure. So think of it as 65% to sovereigns.
Lending, the $7.9 billion is almost all corporate or bank. It's 75% corporate and probably about – or a little more than –
maybe 80% corporate and 20% bank. Some of those banks, by the way, are very good banks, so we're not that worried
about it.
So if we actually look – and a lot of this plays in the corporates is large global multinationals. And these numbers
obviously bounce around. The derivative values change and mark-to-markets change and collateral changes, but the
$15 billion is what we've been managing to kind of. And in my – if you said if everything goes terribly and these
countries default and the loss given default is 10%, 20%, 30%, that's where we came up with $3 billion after tax, which
is $5 billion pre-tax. So you can do it yourself and go across the top. How much would you lose in a government
security if they defaulted and got restructured? And by the way, there are other offsets and other positives not exactly
on this page, and we can manage these exposures.
So the reason we're doing this is because we do business with these countries. And again, you know I mentioned capital
confusion, I'll mention banking confusion. Do we – obviously, we've been doing business with these countries for 100
years. A lot of these clients, you can't say you're going to be your bank one day, and the second things get tough go
away the next day. So we think we're earning some points. We're helping some companies. We're helping a few of the
banks. And we hope the countries appreciate it. And so we've decided to take this risk. Obviously, we can try to – we
change that in a pretty quick way if we wanted to, and we still think it's the right thing to do. I don't expect the worst
case in terms of our charge-offs in any event.
So I will stop there and open the floor to – we'll open the floor to questions and comments for Doug or myself.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Jason Michael Goldberg>: Jamie, I was hoping you can just flesh out some of the buyback and capital
commentary you made. You mentioned confusion. You obviously exhausted the buyback that you set for this year. Is
there ability for you to do more, or now are you going to wait and wait until early next year, or do you have to wait
beyond that?
<A - James Dimon>: I think the way the Fed has set it up is that you can request as we go through our budget and start
to decide what to do, but we used what we already had permission for. And like I said, we have a lot of capital
generation. The only question is when and how you use it and how quickly you want to get up to the higher Basel III
numbers and do you want to get up there just by retaining capital and waiting for mitigation and things like that. So
we'll get back to you on that. There are a lot of issues around that.

<Q - Jason Michael Goldberg>: I guess on last quarter's earnings call, it seemed like you were going to ease – leg
right into these new capital requirements and continue with the buyback, and now it seems like a change in tone. I'm
just curious if there was anything in particular driving that.
<A - James Dimon>: I think that you are picking up a real change in tone. I think the fact is we don't know what the
rest of the world is going to do. It's a little confusing about it. And I think the regulators need to give, not just
JPMorgan but the banking industry, a little bit more guidance. Do they really mean you can leg into this over seven
years, or do they really mean they want you to do it right away? We can probably do it very quickly if we wanted to.
I'm not sure it's the right thing to insist on.
<Q - Jason Michael Goldberg>: And then just turning to Volcker, we got some more guidance late last week and this
week. I guess your initial interpretation of what they put out, the overall impact either in dollars or direction in terms of
your businesses?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, so let me give you the most important thing. The United States has the best, deepest, widest,
and the most transparent capital markets in the world, which give you, the investor, the ability to buy and sell large
amounts at very cheap prices. That's a good thing. I wish Paul Volcker understood that. Now we understand why
Volcker banned proprietary trading, and that was fine. I haven't read them all yet, like 178 rules or 48 in compliance
around what's proper market making. We have to be in a position to do proper market making for our clients. Most of
our business is market making.
And so there's going be commentary. I think the commentary is going to come from the public, which includes you. I
hope all of you on the call understand how important this is not just for your own business, but for the future of the
United States. And we hope at the end of the day we'll be able to make markets freely. If American companies are put
at a huge disadvantage, the foreign companies – we were told everyone was going to adopt this, which we know is not
true, then that would be an even bigger deal. So to me, we've got to keep all these things in mind and make sure it ends
up in the right place. And we'll be giving our comments to regulators and I assume a lot of you will too at one point.
<Q - Jason Michael Goldberg>: Any chance to put a stab in terms of dollars or range in terms of what the impact
would be go forward if you implemented it today?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: It's impossible to tell because these are just comments and rules and requirements. And
it cuts across all of our parts of our company, so they seem to be more proscriptive. I would have preferred to keep it
simple. High capital, high – remember, they already doubled and tripled capital and liquidity on trading. And proper
reporting and disclosure, but this is a little bit more proscriptive. It may make it a little bit harder. Let's let it work
through the process before we have too many comments about it.
<Q - Jason Michael Goldberg>: Fair enough, thank you.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group. Mr. Najarian, your line is open. Please go
ahead with your question. That question has been withdrawn. Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr
with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Thanks very much. So Jamie, on your commentary around the Euro-5 is helpful. But lately,
whether it be valid or not, there have been some massive concerns around some of the other parts of the continent.
What's the key message that we should come away with? A), your exposure to some of the other big areas such as
France was a level of concern for people. And then more importantly, how do we move forward here? What needs to
happen in your view to gain confidence back that the banks there have enough capital that we're not in a never-ending
spiral here?

<A - James Dimon>: Okay, so when you talk about the big European countries, obviously, the exposure to France,
Germany, and the UK are bigger than the ones we have in the ones in Italy and Spain. Large parts of those are also
large corporates, so keep that in mind. Plus the sovereign credits are fine; that's a whole different issue. The real issue
you're talking about is how we separate to go to the banks – obviously, we do business with banks and the larger global
market counterparties, which we track and monitor very carefully those exposures. Most of our exposures, not all, but
most of our exposures to global market counterparties are collateralized, sometimes with the bucket. And sometimes
we have other tertiary exposures, something like that.
So a couple of them are rather large. But not one of them would make me lose my – because of a derivative related
would we lose sleep. Most of them are well – most of them are in the couple hundred million dollars net-net-net.
Remember, those bounce around. Derivative exposures bounce around. We also think most of those banks are actually
quite sound. They have capital. They've got liquidity. We think they'll get some kind of, if they need it, some kind of
support. And what's needed in Europe, or are you talking about the United States?
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Europe.
<A - James Dimon>: Okay. Greece eventually has to be ring fenced and restructured. But you don't want to do that
disorderly so you don't cause a problem elsewhere. Eventually, you got to by using ECB [European Central Bank] and
ESFS [European System of Financial Supervisors] and statements that Italy and Spain are solvent. They just need a
little liquidity help, which by the way is true.
We believe they're quite solvent. And if they have their own central bank and they could print euros, we wouldn't be
having this conversation at all. As you know, they can't print euros, so they have – and they have central banks but they
can't print in the euro currency. So in effect, ECB or someone else has to stand in as the central bank to provide
liquidity. I think to do that, you want other countries, France and Germany, to be very comfortable about – I guess the
final point is that some kind of restructuring of the treaty so people feel that they're not continuing – that no one is
continuing to take advantage of a system that is flawed. I think it's all reasonable.
And finally, I think some kind of national programs for TARP to support banks that need help, that's kind of belt and
suspenders if you do other stuff. But you obviously might see that too. If you do all those things, this crisis would be
over. It's complex. You've got 17 nations involved in it.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Yes.
<A - James Dimon>: So I'm not saying it's simple. And when I listen to politicians, it sounds to me they have the will.
Just it's hard to find the way.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Yes, understood; and then maybe, Doug, one for you, a more technical one. On page 42 of the
supplement, we've seen a big jump up this quarter in some of the repurchase demand buckets by certain vintages in
2005. And what was surprising was even the post-2008 stuff. And I guess my question there is, is that the same GSE
monoline stuff that we've seen, or is a new player in town with the FHA? Any color around that would be great.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: It's the same that we've seen. But remember, Glenn, it's just going to be lumpy, and
that's in part what you're seeing. But you did see both demand as well as unresolved demands go up quarter on quarter.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. And is the FHA going with the GSE playbook, and do they have the same rep and
warranty?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: The FHA issue is a different issue. And that really relates only to our Chase activity
because that was really the only – Chase was the only real counterparty with FHA on that. And that issue is one we're
going to continue to watch. We don't think we have issues there. But you don't see that reflected in these numbers here.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, thanks very much for all the help.

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.

Ed, your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Can you hear me?
<A - James Dimon>: We can.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay. Thanks, okay. Sorry about that, I apologize. So my question has to do with your Trust
Preferred Securities. I think you have nearly $20 billion of callable TruPS, and just wondered what your thoughts are
about calling them and the timing of calling them.
<A - James Dimon>: Go ahead, Doug.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: So there are a number of those that would make economic sense for us to call. They are
callable as a function of a regulatory event, and we would expect to see that regulatory event clarified. And to the
extent that it makes economic sense for us to do so, we'd then call.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: So should we potentially think about you calling those sometime next year perhaps?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: I think the ones that make economic sense for us. There are some that are very
attractive financing over the long run for those that make sense for us to call. Because they're not attractive, we expect
to have the ability to do so.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: But as we read what you refer to as the regulatory event that looks like it makes them callable,
you agree that that makes them callable at your description?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay, thanks.
<A - James Dimon>: And different people have different things in their node, so that's why some people are able to do
it in a different way.

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Yes, hi; Doug, a question on the net interest income and spread compression. Could you
remind us of that repositioning you've been doing that you talked about in last several quarters in the investment
portfolio; and just at the top of the house, your outlook for net interest income and maybe the margin?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, so on margin, and we saw it again this quarter, there are three factors hitting NIM.
You've got the increase in deposits and a lot of that is being kept short term, and so that lowers NIM but it does
increase NII. You've got a switch in our loan portfolio. We've got more corporate client loans, and that changes the mix

and as a result the yield. And then the third and the most important is this repositioning. And that's – we have taken
security gains. That lowers our NII on a go-forward basis and that has really repositioned ourselves, as Jamie talked
about, for reinvestment when and if there's a rising rate environment. In the interim, those reinvestment opportunities
are short term and low yielding.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: What about any offsets on the cost of funding side in terms of lowering your deposit rates,
your CDs, paying off longer-term debt; is that embedded into your outlook? And just a reminder, when you net all of
that together, how are you thinking about NII the next couple quarters?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Again, you will have offsets that you've seen from that. Let's start with how we're
thinking about NIM. We continue to expect those things I just talked about to continue to play through, so you'll see
more pressure on NIM. NII is in part a function of what balances do, what loan growth does. And generally speaking,
there are some pieces of the portfolio that we've told you all along continue to run off. And so it's a function of what
happens next to NII.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay, then a follow-up on Glenn's question on the mortgage put-backs. It seems like you
slightly tweaked your outlook to maybe $350 million per quarter from $300 million on the put-backs. Just a broader –
are you seeing a change in behavior from the GSEs in terms of their requests where they're increasingly looking to put
back loans they've been paying for one, two, or three years and then go bad? Is there a noticeable change in their
behavior there?
<A - James Dimon>: I don't think we really changed the forecast. It's about $300 million, $350 million. There hasn't
been a huge change in how they're doing it. But obviously we're paying attention just like you are, a little bit. We've
modeled into our numbers some of these factors anyway. So you've really got to look at the difference in what we
modeled in. We still have $3.6 billion in reserves. At one point, those reserves end up being excess and we'll have to
start taking those down too.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: And in terms of the WaMu GSE exposure, do you feel like you're substantially done or
covered in terms of put-backs for WaMu GSE claims?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes.
<A - James Dimon>: We settled some of those upfront.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Some of it is settled, Doug, or it's all settled plus reserved right now?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's right. For just the simple GSE put-back exposure, yes.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: For WaMu?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: WaMu.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay, last thing on the AG settlement talks. I understand this isn't done. But have you been
taking reserves for the potential financial penalties that might come out of that? And then on the other side in terms of
changes to servicing, have you been trying to get ahead of that in terms of adding costs to your servicing base and
reflecting that in the valuation of the MSR, even though that's not done on the AG side yet?
<A - James Dimon>: Let me give you a broad spin. First of all, we would love to have some kind of settlement. We
think it's actually good for everybody to get some of that and move on if it's reasonable. But there are 50 state AGs. It
looks like it's getting bogged down, so we'll see. We're here. We're available. I'd like to work it out. Last quarter we did
take higher servicing costs in the MSR. So go back to last quarter's numbers; we talked about it. We're willing to a
consent order and some of the default loss. And what was the other question?
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Just in terms of financial penalty, you're building a lot of litigation reserves. We're just
wondering. What are the – are you getting some of that in there?

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning; just, Doug, an administrative question in terms of the CVA. When you're
referencing the spreads that have doubled or slightly more than doubled over the quarter, is it correct to say that those
are five-year CDS spreads?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And then, Jamie, you made a comment about...
<A - James Dimon>: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait; not really. DVA and CVA are done by trade, so some are one-year,
two-year, five-year, ten-year, so they're all different. You may be using averages of – it's whatever the maturity of the
derivative is, the loan or whatever.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Right. But fair enough on a portfolio basis from the outside looking in, is the five-year
CDS spread a reasonable proxy for looking forward on those movements?
<A - James Dimon>: I think so. I don't...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, it is a reasonable proxy.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Certainly for DVA.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Right. Right, just for DVA, correct.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: For DVA.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And then, Jamie, you made a comment about branch growth. And looking at the
branch numbers in RFS, it looks like those are up about 128 year to date. You've talked about maybe not quite getting
to the 225 number that you laid out in the Investor Day earlier this year. Is that really being driven not only by just the
reduced fees that you mentioned but also a somewhat more cautious view of the retail banking environment? And does
that mean that you might reduce your overall branch growth going into 2012 and 2013?
<A - James Dimon>: That's what I was referring to because, obviously, we can't stop the fourth quarter. But if you
look at the business and you say okay, Durbin, NSF, that certain accounts no longer are profitable, you might modify

because there's a lot of value in having market share in certain parts of the country. But going forward, we're going to
modify that branch build once we've got a chance to look at the effect of all those things on new branch profitability.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Doug, a final question. You mentioned the payment rates on the Card business is up. It
looks like at least from the Trust data that that's up about 200 basis points year over year in September. Are you
expecting continued increases of that type in terms of the payment rates going forward, or just what's your expectation
for payment rates going forward in the Card portfolio?
<A - James Dimon>: We expect it to go up. We think you've seen some – some of it we added mix. If you look at the
other people that added, it will go up a little bit too. We don't expect it to go up from here. Then again, you've got to do
it by product. For some product, it's 90%. For some product it's quite a bit less.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. One of the questions that investors have been asking a lot is with respect to
the sovereign or European exposures. How can we get comfortable with the management of counterparty risk when a
big part of the reduction in risk that you've got is by having essentially purchased protection from other parties,
especially in light of what happened during the subprime crisis to a lot of people? So maybe you can refresh us a little
bit on how you manage your counterparty risk in terms of diversification, developing information, more information on
the creditworthiness of your counterparties. And maybe you can also tie that into the CVA charge that you had this
quarter.
<A - James Dimon>: So related to the five nations, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, the 6.7 – whatever the
counterparty risk is, that is financial institutions for the most part out – not in those five countries, so it is other
counterparts. And we do it name by name and person by person. Yes, it's diversified, and it's already in the numbers I
gave you about the other banks. So if we said that we have about $100 million net exposure to X bank in Germany, it
would include that as a counterparty exposure, and for the most part collateralized. So we feel pretty good about that.
But obviously, in a financial crisis, these things could filter down, so you've got to look at your primary risk, your
secondary and tertiary and all that. But it's done name by name, day by day. And the CVA is just a mark-to-market on
the receivable.
So if we did a CDS with someone and they owed us $50 million, they're supposed to post collateral the next day. When
we take the $50 million receivable, we mark it. If the spreads go up to $55 million or something like that and you get
more collateral, but it's every day. And a lot of the counterparts are names you know. They are global market
counterparties. Some, obviously, reside in France and Germany, but plenty don't. And I said, reside in France and
Germany, they're already in the exposures of those banks we're getting pretty much marking-to-market collateral every
day. We do have some exposure with those banks that aren't that way. But that particular thing, we do have
mark-to-market every day.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And can you give us a sense for how much of that CVA this quarter came from European
issues as opposed to monoline stuff?
<A - James Dimon>: The CVA is every single derivative credit exposure we have in the United States, overseas,
Europe, Asia, of any type of derivative. I would guess 30% is Europe, and you can go country by country. And so
much is Asia, so much is the U.S. And if you go by ratings, a lot of those are highly-rated counterparties. So we have
this – we also look at derivative exposure no different than credit exposure. We go to you and say we're going to give
Bank of America Merrill Lynch a $100 million revolver; that's $100 million. We may give you a trade finance line of
$100 million, which you use or don't use. And we may give you a derivative line which is not just what you owe us, it's
also a stressed amount of what you owe us. Now all these things will be going to central clearing houses soon or some

of them will be over time.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: That's helpful. Thanks. Let me ask a – sorry, go ahead.
<A - James Dimon>: The world went through this huge crisis with these counterparties, and it was really a very select
few where you had failures. Most of the major broker-dealers were able to manage their counterparty exposures rather
well.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, that's fair. Let me ask you just a question on cards. Obviously, we've seen solid growth
across a lot of your metrics, sales and balances, but the marketing spend is up quite a lot both quarter on quarter and
year over year. And obviously we're seeing more competition in that space emerging, and everybody seems to want the
same affluent client base. Do you think you're going to have to sustain this level of spending in order to sustain the
level of growth you're seeing?
<A - James Dimon>: No, and you have to remember, first of all, marketing is – think of it as an investment. So there's
a lot of analysis that takes place, you can get a return on it. And it's not all – don't think of it as all direct mail. That's
online marketing. We have a lot of partners like United, Continental, Southwest Airlines, Hyatt. And so they have
requirements. So you see our ads in the paper all the time and stuff like that. So it really is a wide variety of stuff and
it's obviously a lumpy number. If you look at year over year, it will probably go up 10%, not like you've seen the 20%

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yes, thank you very much. Hey, Jamie, I think you've talked about regulatory confusion. I think
you guys are confused and we're confused. And moving back to the Volcker rule, there's a huge political process that
has to take place relative to before we get the final rule. But we keep on hearing that some companies, including
yourself, are starting to implement some of these rules. Can you address when you think you have to implement it? Are
they going to accelerate this stuff like they're accelerating some of the capital rules?
<A - James Dimon>: I don't know if they're accelerating things. We want to be prepared for whatever the rules are,
and we're going to do the best job we can in meeting all those regulatory requirements. So we're getting prepared
because like, certain things like LCR [Liquidity Coverage Ratio] you know will be implemented. The calibrations may
change over time. But the detail by type of deposit, by type of counterparty, we're still going to have to do. So some
we're starting to build just to get ahead of it. Volcker rules, we're not starting to build because it just came out, but some
of the requirements we already do.
We may not do it exactly the way they want, but we already do it. We've looked at trading desks and all the Greeks and
VaRs and aged inventory and stuff like that. But they may have reporting requirements. Compliance requirements will
be heavier, so we'll start to build some of that that we know is going to happen. And I think the Volcker rules are meant
to be done by January or something. Comments are in by January. And then I guess there will be some time after that. I
think by the end of this year, we're going to have a lot more guidance on a lot of these various rules and regulations and
the coordination among them. We want to try to embed it in how we run the business. So it's not a – we're not chasing
our tails. We know exactly what these things mean for our clients, our profitability, our trading desk, and our loans, et
cetera.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then on the mortgage balancing side, your MSR dropped drastically. Now rates dropped
almost 100 basis points. And it looks like you had a net hedging gain to offset all that MSR loss. Can you just address
that a little bit?

<A - James Dimon>: Yes, the MSR – when rates go down and things refi, it's like an IO [Interest Only]. It drops
dramatically in value, so there's no surprise there. And so all it says is we hedged it well. But the drop in value was
offset by the hedging we did. And the other thing is that the total values ran off because of the higher amortization and
that $1 billion write-down from last quarter that was really related to higher servicing cost dropped the value of the
MSR too. So if rates went up 100 basis points, the MSR gross value will go back from seven to 10. And hopefully the
hedge would – actually we're going to hedge it at that point and take the gain. But that's all that is. There are constant
adjustments to those models.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Thank you very much, Jamie.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you, good morning. When you look at your net interest margin, your cost of deposits
are about 63 basis points, and you've been having outstanding deposit growth. Your loan-to-deposit ratio continues to
fall. How low do you think you can take those deposit rates down to, especially in light of the fact that Bernanke has
said that he's going to keep short-end rates low until sometime in 2013?
<A - James Dimon>: You've got to look at it by business because some businesses you have competitive results like
you've got to price certain deposits around the country retail competitively. Some of the large TSS deposits are already
getting zero. We're not begging for them. They're coming to us. And then we've got to pay the FDIC 10 basis points on
some of this too. So it's really a little of everything, but it's hard to go below zero.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Right.
<A - James Dimon>: So that's where you get a little bit of this margin compression here.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And shifting over now to the loan loss provision, your credit metrics obviously improved in
the quarter. The net charge-off ratio declined. Non-performing assets declined. But the loan loss reserve release, or the
provision being less than charge-offs, wasn't as large as it was in the prior three or four quarters. Is it more due to either
loan growth, or do you guys have a more cautious outlook now on credit?
<A - James Dimon>: I've already said, I put this in the more cautious outlook category.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Is it more on the consumer side, or are you seeing it on the commercial side?
<A - James Dimon>: I think it was both. If you go through the details in the fiscal supplement, there are loans to NPLs
and loans to charge off. Delinquencies are very strong. I think it might be harder to keep them up here if it stays here.
It's hard – I guess we said it's hard not to be cautious now.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And then finally, just circling back to the European exposure, do you have the gross euro
exposure, or is it just the net number that you have for us?
<A - James Dimon>: We showed you on the page. If you go to page 17, it shows gross derivative and net derivative. Is
that what you're referring to? There are other exposures which are fully collateralized, and I've been through it before. I
don't want to go through it right here.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay, all right. Thank you.
<A - James Dimon>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on two things. One is the capital usage
where you're discussing after say increasing dividends. If we're thinking about the dividend payout ratio, you've been
hovering somewhere between 20% and 30% for the last couple quarters. And 30% seems to be what the regular reserve
is allowing at this stage. So are we talking about having an expectation where dividends are going to be going up in line
with what you think your earnings growth is going be able to generate? Is that how we should be thinking about the
dividends?
And then on the timing, do you think you're going to be able to make a change in dividend before the CCAR
[Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review] process, which is January through March?
<A - James Dimon>: Betsy, honestly, we've asked that question too because the way the regulatory thing got upset,
that was a GAAP issue, so we're waiting for guidance on that one. I'll just wait until we find out. The Board will take it
up. I think we're going to be consistent. I don't know if it's going to be 30% to 40%. It will be 30% with consistent
growth...
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And so...
<A - James Dimon>: ...based upon what we think the real earnings power of the company is, not just based on
earnings.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. Okay, so the Board will make their decision in December, but then you have to
submit to the Fed as soon as you can.
<A - James Dimon>: No, I didn't say December. I said after the turn of the year. We started the dividend in June,
right?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: I think it was April.
<A - James Dimon>: April, before April.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, got it. And then on the topic of expenses, you outlined a couple different areas where
obviously overhead is going have to go up $500 million or so, if you took a guess. At the same time, you're running
through each of the business lines with regard to what they can generate over time. Are you trying to – I'm asking the
question as to how you thread the needle because you've been increasing expenses to take share, which you've been
doing. Are you at the point where you need to tilt back towards profitability in line with what you outlined at Investor
Day last year?
<A - James Dimon>: Betsy, there's no change in strategy at all. We're still going to grow. We think we can gain share
and build a very good business. And there are always your expenses come before your revenues. But like in the GCB,
for example, we think it's working, and we'll probably want to spend there. Other things I said, we have to modify. And
there are whole products that we may not be in anymore if we look at exactly how they function with capital and
liquidity charges.
But we're going be pretty tight in expenses. We're not being lax. We're just adding where we need to add. And then we
always expect to get improvements in certain expense ratios as systems come on board, efficiencies, operational
efficiencies. Doug mentioned a big one. We're spending I think it was $800 million a quarter on servicing now, which
65% is default servicing. That number is not going be up there forever. Eventually, that default number is going to be –
it may take a couple years, but close to zero. And we also expect to make the front-end mortgage far more efficient too.
We're always working on more efficiency to help pay for some of these other things.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And then on the top line side, you talked about pricing, pricing for liquidity, for G-SIFI
buffer, et cetera. Can you talk through how you think you need to reposition the business in order to do that, if any,
because some of your competitors will say you're carrying a higher G-SIFI charge that you're not charging for today?

But when you do you're going to become under-competitive. So how do you deal with that challenge?
<A - James Dimon>: Here's the problem with G-SIFI. There are certain things. We're not going to be uncompetitive
because we're going to price it in the market and get the business. And if you're going to leave your money with us or
them or processing business, you're going to leave it with us and then you're going to call us unfair. We hold more
capital. We're going to win the business because we're more sound. And of course, I agree with them. I'm not arguing
their point.
In other businesses yes, we'll probably want to shed the asset because someone else can hold it – like take consumer
assets. If you can hold it with 7% and I have to hold for 9.5%, I still might service, originate, hold the skin in the game
strip, but syndicate the rest. So it will be product by product. It will be certain things, and certain of these things that
they want to – one of the things in G-SIFI is to reduce interconnectedness. So they don't like interbank lending. I think
interbank lending is going to go away. But unlike certain types of – it doesn't distinguish between secured and
unsecured. But I think they have much higher charges for exposures to financial companies and non-financial
companies. So that's not a terrible objective. It might not happen in a productive way. But you'll see that people price
lines of credit to finance companies much higher than lines that go to non-financial companies. I can go on and on and
really relate to the specific rules. That's the kind of work we're doing now.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Thanks.
<A - James Dimon>: Some will cause unintended consequences that help JPMorgan, and some may very well cause
an entire one that hurt us. But in no event are we going to price it higher and get priced out of the market because of the
G-SIFI charge. That's not going to happen. Whatever competitor told you that, they're not thinking clearly.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it.
<A - James Dimon>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW.
<Q - David J. Konrad CFA>: Hi, good morning; a couple quick questions, one just another follow-up on expenses
strictly in Investment Banking. It looked like if I net out the DVA and CVA, the comp ratio was around 36%, which is
in line with your guidance. But non-comp expense is up a couple hundred million despite lower revenue. So I just
wondered if there's litigation expense in the Investment Banking number as well.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: There's a little bit in there, yes.
<Q - David J. Konrad CFA>: Okay. And then also maybe, Doug, the tax rate came in I think around 27%. You're
usually around the low-30%s. How should we think about that this quarter, and then a run rate over the next couple
quarters?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: I think the run rate will be in the low-30%s, and we had some benefits this quarter,
nothing more than that.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yes, I'd like to flesh out your comment that it's not unreasonable to expect trading – expect
markets to be in the fourth quarter like they were in the third quarter. And just when Jefferies reported earlier this
month or last month, and I realize it's a much smaller, different platform from you; but their commentary was like June,

July, and September were all slow and eh, but the real damage all occurred in August when the spreads blew out, and it
was the movement in spreads that really did the damage to their P&L. I was wondering. Was that your experience as
well? I guess let me leave the question there.
<A - James Dimon>: We're not going bring up monthly numbers for you. But my experience from Wall Street is as
those spreads gap out, credit products including mortgage and stuff like that get hurt. So yes, I believe it happened in
August.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: But every business is different. And we have a very broad business. We've got rates, credit,
commodity, currency, equity. You name it, and a lot of flow business and derivative businesses. So you've really got to
look at what the mix is and not just one company. I don't know Jefferies' business that well.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then looking at the Basel III risk-weighted assets on page 14, I guess I think it's
interesting that the Basel III risk-weighted assets keep on ticking down when loans and Basel I risk-weighted assets are
ticking up, and I wonder. Is that the mitigation, and can we expect to see that kind of decrease in the Basel III
risk-weighted assets continue over the next year or two?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That benefit is going be model driven, and you're going to expect to see model
applications and improvement in RWA as a result of that. And that's what happened this quarter.
<A - James Dimon>: There will be write-off and there will be decisions we make about what we want to do. The way
Basel III is set up, certain products have much higher capital charges than others, and so we have choices of options to
make. Over the next couple years, certain things run off, or we can just sell things or hedge them differently and that
could make a big difference. So yes, we're going to manage the hell out of RWA.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay, all right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. What was the $500 million of additional overhead cost for? You said it's regulatory related.
<A - James Dimon>: That was my guess, Mike. And I just think that when you look at G-SIFI, LCR – I'm not even
including the consent order mortgages here. I think we're going to have to build a lot of additional systems by legal
entity around the world to accommodate hundreds of new rules, regulations, reporting. I'm just telling you that that
would be my guess right now, that's all. We have real professional teams working today on 75 projects, and these are
pretty large projects. They've got risk, credit, legal systems, HR, sales traders globally by legal entity sometimes trying
to do it. There's liquidity reporting, credit reporting, new model building, and we're going to do it all well. This is a new
world. We're going to live with it, but it's hard to say it's not going to money.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And you're saying you wish it...
<A - James Dimon>: And by the way, I think it's going to be, again, a small unintended benefit for JPMorgan because
whatever it costs us, it may be harder for smaller people.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And you said some of that regulatory cost you wish you didn't have to do. You don't see the
benefit, but that's life.
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, that's exactly right. That's what I said.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And perhaps the root cause – you can disagree with my premise, but perhaps the root cause is
the perception of the industry. And a negative perception leads to all sorts of things, protests and everything else, which
in turn to leads to regulation, which leads to some of these higher costs. So the question is, what can you do or should

you do to help change the image of the industry? And a related question, you've been out there defending the industry a
lot. But don't you want to disassociate yourself from some of the bad actors?
<A - James Dimon>: Mike, I think a lot of bad actors are gone, so let's be fair here. If you talked to most clients of the
– I'm talking about generic, not JPMorgan. Most of our clients like us. Our middle market clients like us. We do a lot of
small business, our consumer clients, even our mortgage clients. But we have issues, and obviously I think they get
way over – we should be responsive to them. I'm not [ph] making light (68:10) of them. But if you travel around and
spoke to clients everywhere, you'll hear we try to do the best we can, like any other business. It's hard to make up for –
when you say change the image, if you have any great ideas on the phone and you guys can write them up and send
them to me, we'll take them into consideration.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Let me just follow up. I mean, twelve of the thirteen largest banks that would have failed, I
think you would be the one bank that wouldn't have failed during the crisis. Is that correct? And if that's the case –
what's that?
<A - James Dimon>: I don't know if that statement is completely true. So, I don't want to comment on something I'm
not sure about.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then where is – this is all leading to just revenue growth versus expense growth. Revenues
are down $3 billion. Linked-quarter expenses were only down $1 billion, and it sounds like you're just tweaking around
the edges. Then you have this extra $0.5 billion of expenses coming at you. Are you going to be able to grow revenues
faster than expenses? And if not, at what point do you say hey, we need to be more aggressive with expenses?
<A - James Dimon>: But Mike, if you're going to back DVA out of earnings, which I think you should do, I
completely understand that you normalize, you should back it out of revenues, too. So $2 billion of that is DVA. So
what we look at, and again it's not – I think it's pretty good. Look at the underlying numbers: number of accounts,
number of deposits, number of branches, number of clients, number of bankers, keeping some kind of good trading
flow in what seems to be a terrible environment, market shares. That's what I look at in terms of growing the business.
The revenues themselves are prone to be lumpy. You and I have been in this business a long time. We know that. And
obviously, when we're tight, we'll trim our sails where we think there are products or areas or branches that we can't
make any money at all. So obviously, we'll adjust to that, and a lot of that's going on right now. We acknowledge that.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Jeffery Harte MBA>: Good morning, guys; just a few more questions. One, looking at the real estate portfolio,
the portfolio continues to decline. Loan loss reserve stays where it was. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that
maintaining reserves is just macro caution, versus is there actually something you're seeing in the numbers to give you
concern? We see the delinquency chart that shows delinquencies 30 to 150 days flat-lining. But are you seeing other
things in that portfolio giving you concern?
<A - James Dimon>: It really is macro conservatism. If you look at delinquencies, roll rates, first-time delinquent, that
kind of stuff, they're mixed. It could very well start to improve again, but it has flattened out, which is an abundance of
caution on our part. And the fact that the world questions them anyway about how these – are the reserves sufficient.
Obviously, there are multiple years' covered charge-offs today. They can cover pretty adverse scenarios at this point.
<Q - Jeffery Harte MBA>: Okay. Within mortgage origination, up 35% sequentially, it is a big revenue number. Were
there pipeline hedging benefits to that? Is there a delay? Should we maybe expect some revenue strength spill over into
the fourth quarter from the refi boom? How should we think going forward, do you think?

<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's right, Jamie.
<A - James Dimon>: The pipeline will go against you in a quarter like this when rates were dropping like that.
<Q - Jeffery Harte MBA>: Okay. And the tax rate looks like it declined versus last quarter in this quarter. Any
benefits or stuff we should know about I haven't seen, and then how should we be thinking about the tax rate going
forward?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, so I think we've addressed that. There were some benefits we had this quarter, and
I think you'd expect it going forward to be back to a more normalized rate.
<Q - Jeffery Harte MBA>: So, like, look at year to date being normalized?
<A - James Dimon>: Mostly just true-ups that come from...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: There are always going be ins and outs every quarter, so it's going to move around. But
right, low-30%s normalized rate.

have more exempt income slightly.

Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisory.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Hi, good morning. I have a couple questions. If the stock stays below tangible book value,
how do you look at compensation when stock is a component of compensation year end for bonuses? That's my first
question.
<A - James Dimon>: Actually, I'll going to pass that to Doug. Remember, I'm an investment banker.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: I look at it as a very attractive component of compensation in that regard.
<A - James Dimon>: I think our employees would get very upset if we said when the stock is high, we'll give you a lot
of stock. And when we think it's low, we'll give you no stock.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay, fair enough. Just one more technical and then I have a broader question. On home
price values, have you altered your home price expectation in any of your models this quarter? And can you remind us
what that is?
<A - James Dimon>: In general, we've got – it's by product, by area, by everything. But in general, what's modeled
into our reserves and our purchase credit impaired is another drop of 1% to 4%, depending what it is.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: And it still seems that may actually be what ends up happening. But as you know as well as we
know, we don't know that exactly.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay. So my last question is, there's a lot that's coming on the market in terms of assets for
sale. I would call it an asset flush. What would be your ideal product type of assets to look at, given the fact that you
almost have an unprecedented opportunity to pick up a lot?

<A - James Dimon>: Yes, that's a very good question. I should have put at that bottom of that capital thing when I
talked about capital confusion, that's another one. So there are some wonderful things you can buy now that we can
probably get a 10% or 11% cash-on-cash return for probably with a duration of three or four years as being dumped by
other people, but it's got this very, very high RWA, not like 100%, like 1,200% type charges, but it's mouth-watering.
And so we're trying – that's why I'm saying. When we reinvest our portfolio, we do have options, but it all comes down
to how we want to make those decisions, and we're making them right now as we go along. We want to think it through
a little bit better, but there will be opportunities and we are ready to use our capital to do that.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Do you think this all happens within the fourth quarter?
<A - James Dimon>: No. It won't all happen in the fourth quarter. I'm talking about – we expect that maybe over – I
would say over the next six or nine months.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: But you would ask the next question which you'd want to ask, which is okay, would you rather
buy 11% RWA – an 11% cash-on-cash asset with such a large RWA to get back, or buy your stock back much
cheaper?
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: And the answer is?
<A - James Dimon>: I'm not going to tell you, but I'll just tell you there is a little bit of a dilemma, and then it relates
to whether you can or not. We know we can buy the assets. We're not sure we can buy back the stock.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay, got it. Thank you very much.
<A - James Dimon>: And we know we can buy the asset and also have a huge lift in Basel III when we want it
because it will disappear by that point. That's why I'm saying it's a little bit around this capital confusion.

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mandle with GIC.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But just on the reserve, the reserve versus
charge option, last year there was about a 100 basis point gap between the reserve and annualized charge-offs, and now
it's like 250 basis points. And as you say, you're being cautious. But I'm just wondering what the discussion is that
you're having with your accountants that they are comfortable with having such a large gap and whether this may be
signs that the accountants are more comfortable with less pro-cyclical reserving.
<A - James Dimon>: Okay, I think you're going too far there. First of all, I would simply state that obviously we do
these things. We trust the accountants. And there are judgment calls and analyses, in fact, always updating when we do
these things. For example, I pointed out before, on seconds behind a delinquent first, we are much different in how we
look at that than a second that is not behind a delinquent first. So we do much more sophisticated reserving than that.
But I made it very clear, we're going to be as conservative as possible. Maybe next quarter I'm going be saying we had
to take this down because we were forced to.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Right, that's the point I'm getting at. The accountants don't seem to be forcing you now, so is that
a change on their part?
<A - James Dimon>: I don't think so. I think it's just the facts are constantly changing, and you've got to talk to the
accountants and get their opinion on it. I think you're stretching to say it would be that.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Thanks for squeezing me in here, two questions. One, how sensitive is net interest
income to changes in long-term rates? So for example, rates have popped about 50 basis points here. If Europe gets
resolved and we go up another 50 basis points, how meaningful would that be?
<A - James Dimon>: Hang on because Doug may know the number because we disclosed the number last quarter.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, so a 100 basis point shift in the curve would add a couple of billion dollars to net
income – to pre-tax. That's a 100 basis point shift in the curve. A short-term move in the long end and no move in the
short end, you won't see this short-term move materially affect NIM.
<A - James Dimon>: If the curve went up today 100 basis points, I remember the last time I looked at it, it's about
50/50 that's short and long. They both would benefit the company.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: All right. And obviously if long rates go up, then you might extend out your securities
or things like that?
<A - James Dimon>: Excuse me?
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: If long rates go up enough, that would make you change your strategy in your
securities portfolio that could be additive as well?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately as you talk about reviewing some of the businesses,
trimming some, you mentioned exiting some. The mortgage business is one that has obviously been very frustrating
because of some of the legacy issues. But one can make the argument that you've gotten a capital hit, a political hit.
During most times, it's only so-so in terms of profitability. We don't know what the GSE and the mortgage finance
model is going to look like. Another big competitor I think is getting out about 40% or 50% of their production
channels as closing down. How do you think about the mortgage business going forward in terms of the various
channels and just the business overall as part of the company?
<A - James Dimon>: So first of all, the correspondent issue is not a big deal. Put that to the side. It's actually basically
buying servicing, which to me is a pure economic decision. Are you buy at a good return or not? And some of them are
clients. We treat correspondent clients like banks who also have broad relationships with very differently, regional
banks, et cetera. We're going to be obviously going through that again too. I think in a couple years we're going to cut
the correspondent thing literally a third of what it was.
I'd look at it the other way around. I think that we will have going forward one of the best mortgage businesses in the
country because we tend to build the best front end, middle office, back office systems. Eventually, the legacy
problems will be gone. We know we made a lot of mistakes here, so we're not denying that. We've made them in other
businesses, too, every now and then. We have real competitive distribution, 5,300 branches, salespeople, a mortgage
sales force.
So we think it will still be a really important product, which whatever happens to GSEs, it will have an embedded profit
built into it, and all the legacy stuff will be sunk costs. In fact, all the underlying for the last three years is back to where
it was 30 years ago. In fact, going forward it's going to be a much better business, cleaner. You won't have all these
problems from the past. So we're in favor of cleaning up the mortgage product, disclosures, national regulation. So that
will make it a better. But I think it would be a mistake to say okay, we're going to get out of it because of legacy
problems. Believe me; there's the temptation.

We're still making $10 billion, $12 billion, $13 billion of mortgages a month. A lot of the mistakes will be attacked by
AGs. And we know we made mistakes. We want to resolve the mistakes, and we're ready to be punished for the
mistakes. But I think that's the wrong reason to get out of the business for. It's too important. It's still the most
important financial product for the majority of Americans and it will be for the rest of our lives.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Good morning, a couple of quick just cleanup questions. On the $400 million net income
impact of spread compression next year in terms of an estimate, obviously I appreciate your comments about how you
can move things around on the balance sheet. But does that also build in some expectation for deposit and loan growth,
or should we look at that as additive if that were to occur?
<A - James Dimon>: That's additive. This is like a static analysis.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. Okay, great. On the student loan reserves, you increased those. What's driving that?
I'm just curious.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, we just extended the coverage from 12 to 15 months, and performance net
charge-offs are going up there.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, so somewhat of a catch-up, but also not great trends. And then lastly, any comment
on the thought of the Fed taking away the 25 basis points on excess reserves, how that might impact you or the
markets? It's hard to get a sense of how much you have parked there. And if you had to go into the short-term treasury
markets and buy up six-month, one- year, five to ten basis points versus 25, is that a material impact or not? And how
do you think that affects the curve overall?
<A - James Dimon>: I think we've been very clear about the policy and why they have a policy and all that. It's a real
tool for them. We do have a lot of money parked there because there's a lot of money swishing around the world that
has no place to go. We would have other alternatives that my guess we'd get a lot of that back anyway, but you have to
take some risk to do it. Some things would be 10 basis points. The Fed is 25, some 10, some would be 15. There are
options around the world at other central banks at higher rates.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - James Dimon>: We can turn down deposits. We don't want to go negative with deposits, but we could do that too
if we had to.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.
<A - James Dimon>: We're trying to accommodate our clients more than – the reason we're taking those is to be
accommodative, not to make a spread. Remember, our spread mostly – even if the Fed is not 25 basis points, it's 15
basis points.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. It's 15 basis points.
<A - James Dimon>: You have the FDIC charge.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - James Dimon>: Right. So honestly, you could ask me why do you do it at all.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right.

Your final question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning, guys; first, a quick question on credit. I know, Jamie, that you had indicated
you're cautious, and you said that you're seeing both good things and bad things as far as trends when you commented
before. But I was just curious whether – I'm sure given the size of your credit card portfolio, you have a great amount
of data. I'm curious whether or not you're seeing behaviors in that portfolio that usually lead to an uptick in
delinquencies.
<A - James Dimon>: No. First of all, wholesale credit is exceptionally good. It's better than – it's almost back to where
– I'm not talking about large corporate, middle market, so we're talking about consumer. We said delinquencies trends
flattened out. In credit cards, there's a little bit of flattening there in the 30-day, 60-day, 90-day delinquencies, but no
other major thing. So what we said about charge-offs, they'll probably tick down a little bit next quarter. It's very hard
to tell what it will be next year. We always have a lot of visibility into next quarter. But I think with 9% unemployment,
it will be silly to assume dramatic improvement at this point.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, that's fair. And then on the peripheral European exposure, I know you provided the $3
billion after-tax figure for impacts from losses, from defaults there. But it seems as though from the comments out of
Europe that Greek default and potentially triggering of CDS are no longer taboo issues. Could you walk us through
how to think about maybe Greece specifically?
<A - James Dimon>: Almost none of that number is Greece.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: And then as far as the impact on the system, could you have any comments about what you
think would happen there?
<A - James Dimon>: No, I already commented on that, so I'm not going to do it again. We talked about that
extensively. Actually, there's some great research about it. So if you want, you can call Lauren and she can send it
down to you.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, thanks.
