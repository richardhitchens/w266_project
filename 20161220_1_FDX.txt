Express; Henry Maier, President and CEO of FedEx Ground; and Mike Ducker, President and CEO of FedEx Freight.
And now, Fred Smith will share his views on the quarter.
Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx's second quarter fiscal 2017, and happy holidays
to everyone. Let me note on the front end, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 earnings forecast. Now, remember that
the earnings forecast is before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration
and TNT's Outlook restructuring program costs and intangible asset amortization.
But given those considerations, the range we put out there was $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share. And, of course, Alan
has more detail on that later.
This will be a record peak for FedEx. And to-date, with the exception of several local weather issues, our service levels
have been outstanding. We appreciate the efforts of hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members who work very
hard to make peak operations successful, and who try to keep our Purple Promise daily, which states, "I will make
every FedEx experience outstanding."
Our traffic mix this year is a bit different, by design, as part of our longer term commitment to continue to grow
earnings, margins, cash flows and returns. Christmas falling on a Sunday has created anomalies in shipping patterns,
and this week will see disproportionately higher demand versus other seasonal holiday patterns in the past. FedEx's
integration of TNT and FedEx Ground continue the integration of GENCO well along and going very well with high
morale and excellent execution.
FedEx Express integration expenses will peak next year in FY 2018, and express operating margins should widen in
fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020. As previously noted, there are significant operational synergies in the TNT
transaction, particularly in Europe.
FedEx Express peak operations this year will result in excellent year-over-year profit and margin improvements
foreshadowing the longer term outlook I just mentioned. Of course, our earnings outlook assumes continued modest
global economic growth.
FedEx Ground results will be affected this peak, followed with improving margins later this fiscal year versus the
current quarter. This is due to the recent opening of four major hubs and 19 automated stations year-over-year. It's one
of the most remarkable things I have seen since I have been in business, to tell you the truth. And two, an effort to grow
ground traffic in a more profitable manner than last year's trend at peak, which saw challenging growth of 20%.
While we are committed to being a leader in the e-commerce market, it's important to recognize that non-e-commerce
deliveries to residences and business-to-business traffic represents the vast majority of FedEx Corporation's estimated
$60 billion in FY 2017 revenues.
Regarding business-to-business traffic, we are making major systems investments at FedEx Freight, which will result in
significant margin improvement by year-end FY 2020. We believe this initiative will change the LTL landscape in a
major way.

Let me emphasize, FedEx is much more than a last-mile carrier. FedEx is a global transport and logistics company that
can connect almost every person and business in the world in one to two business days, door-to-door, and we provide
unique value added services across many industries.
It's also important to reiterate that we do not manage our operating companies to maximize margins in each segment all
the time, much less each quarter. Over 92% of our U.S. revenue comes from customers using both FedEx Express and
FedEx Ground, and 76% of that U.S. revenue is generated by customers that use FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and
FedEx Freight. We therefore may be investing in one segment of the portfolio at any given time to produce improved
results for the corporation as a whole in the future.
Now, before I ask Mike Glenn to comment on the economic environment and traffic trends, let me again thank him for
his 35 years of dedicated service to FedEx. At the end of the call, I will have a few concluding comments about Mike's
contribution before his retirement at the end of this month. Alan Graf will follow Mike with more detailed financial
analysis. Mike?
T. Michael Glenn
Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then discuss our performance in business conditions
in each segment including revenue, volume and yield, and provide some commentary on broader industry trends as we
come to the close of another record holiday shopping season. We see moderate growth in the global economy. After
growing just 1.6% in calendar 2016, we expect US GDP growth of 2.2% in calendar 2017, anchored by continued
robust consumer spending and strong business investment. Industrial production should rebound after contracting 0.9%
in calendar 2016 to a forecasted 1.6% growth next year. For the global economy, we forecast growth of 2.2% for
calendar 2016 and 2.6% for calendar 2017.
Now, review revenue, volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express Package revenue grew 2%
year-over-year during the second quarter. Yield per package increased 3% as a result of improved rate and discount.
Fuel for first time in a long time did not have a material impact on yield per package and revenue during the quarter.
Domestic Express package volume declined 1% year-over-year during the quarter.
FedEx International Export Package revenue increased 2% year-over-year in Q2. FedEx International Priority volume
increased 2% while International Economy volume also grew 2%. International Export yield increased 1%, primarily
driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, higher weight per package, and region mix, which
outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates. Again, fuel did not have a material impact on yields.
FedEx Ground transportation revenue increased 9% year-over-year while average daily volume increased 5%
year-over-year. Ground yield per package increased 4% year-over-year, benefiting from yield improvement in both
FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost. Fuel did not have a material impact on increases in revenue or yield per package.
FedEx Freight segment revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q2. If you exclude the impact of the fuel surcharge
revenue, freight revenue increased 3.6%. Average daily LTL shipments increased 4% year-over-year. The continued
strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts, and reflects the speed, reliability, and choice of Priority and
Economy service for our LTL customers. Revenue per LTL shipment in Q2 was flat year-over-year and was impacted
by slightly lower diesel fuel prices and lower weight per LTL shipment. Excluding fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per
LTL shipment was up slightly.
We're closing out what has been another busy peak season for FedEx largely driven by the continued rapid growth of
e-commerce. Trends continue to evolve, as Fred noted, and we're proud of the year-long preparation and collaboration
with customers that has allowed us to deliver outstanding service during this period of intense increase in demand. As
e-commerce grows, so does the challenge of peak with multiple days of volume levels approaching or surpassing
double our average daily volume. It should be noted that this surge in demand is driven primarily by a relatively small
number of customers. Less than 50 large retail and etail customers are responsible for the majority of peak demand so
it's extremely important that we understand their forecast well in advance to allow us to plan resources properly.

While a few customers this year have experienced demand below their forecast, the majority of our large retail and etail
customers are meeting expectations. Again, we're proud of the outstanding service that we've been able to provide. The
secret, of course, is our people. We continue to work hard to deliver for our customers throughout the holiday season
and beyond. The rapid rise in e-commerce continues to drive the need for alternative delivery options. FedEx
understands that the ways people live, work and connect are ever changing. We have long recognized that information
about the package is as important as the package itself, and our long-term investments and focus on IT and mobile
technologies has allowed us to offer customers truly innovative and useful alternative delivery options. This, of course,
includes FedEx Delivery Manager, which gives customers access with the phone or tablet to options such as
appointment delivery and the ability to reroute packages to one of our FedEx office locations or third party locations
for secure pickup.
We continue to have strong growth in demand for Pack Plus, which features dedicated packing professionals and
supplies inside FedEx office locations. The professionals at FedEx office work with customers, large and small, to
provide standard and customized packaging options for even large, bulky and fragile items. None of this would be
possible without the dedication of our more than 400,000 team members at work right now around the world to help the
holidays arrive.
Our service levels have been outstanding with on-time deliveries at record levels, even on some of the busiest days in
the history of FedEx and it's all because of our people. I want to share a special acknowledgment and commend them
for their hard work and outstanding effort this peak season.
Alan?
Alan B. Graf , Jr.
Good afternoon, everyone. I have a couple of introductory comments and will then move to my financial review and
outlook. First, to Mike Glenn. Mike, in our 35 years of working together, we have done literally scores of earnings
calls. As this is your last one, I want to thank you for everything you have done to help make this company great. You
are a consummate professional and the best marketing, sales and communications executive anywhere. You've been a
fantastic business partner. I look forward to many future years of friendship [indiscernible] (14:03).
Okay. The FedEx Corporation's second quarter FY 2017 results. Today we announced second quarter FY 2017
adjusted earnings per share climbed 8.5% to $2.80. Adjusted operating income increased due to the inclusion of TNT
Express and improved results at FedEx Express as it continues to grow base yields and control costs. This performance
was partially offset by lower operating income at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight.
Our effective tax rate was 35.1% for the second quarter and 36.3% for the first half of 2017, compared with 34.5% in
the second quarter and 35.3% in the first half of 2016. The first half tax rate in 2017 has been negatively impacted by
local country losses in some entities within TNT Express for which no tax benefit could be recognized due to the
uncertainty as to the utilization of these losses. This year-to-date negative impact was partially offset from the benefit
of early adopting the accounting standards update share-based payments in the second quarter. Longer-term, as the
synergies from the TNT Express acquisition result in greater international profits, we expect our effective tax rate to be
lower than the rate in recent years. The tax rates in 2016 were favorably impacted by the resolution of a state tax
matter. There was also a gain from the sale of an investment in other income that added $0.08 per diluted share.
Looking at Express, revenues increased 2% to $6.7 billion as base yields improved and package volume grew. Adjusted
operating profit increased by $32 million, or 5%. Adjusted operating income and margin improved as higher base
yields drove revenue growth. Base yield growth was driven by U.S. domestic and international export package.
Revenue growth due to volume increases was driven by international priority package and freight. Express growth was
driven by merit pay increases, higher insurance costs and increased depreciation due to aircraft introductions. Fuel price
and exchange rate changes had little net impact for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased to 9.7%.

At TNT, revenues were $1.9 billion with an adjusted operating profit of $90 million. Adjusted operating margin was
4.7%. The TNT Express integration continues to proceed as planned. We estimate approximately $250 million in
expenses during FY 2017 as a result of the TNT Express integration and outlook restructuring programs. We continue
to expect the aggregate integration program expense over the four years to be in the range of $700 million to $800
million.
The TNT Express intangible asset amortization declined to $10 million in Q2 as we continue to update our purchase
price allocation. We now expect the intangible asset amortization to be $38 million in the second half of FY 2017 and
$75 million for the full year. We still expect our FY 2017 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million with
total TNT CapEx at about $500 million. We expect annual pre-tax synergies following the completion of the
integration program in fiscal 2020 to be $750 million. We will have a full update on the TNT integration outlook on the
March call and I'm not going to say much more about that today.
At FedEx Freight, higher average daily LTL shipments helped FedEx Freight increase revenues 3%. Freight's
competitive advantage, having the fastest published transit times in the LTL industry is driving higher growth in its
priority service. The impact of lower weight per shipment and higher information technology expenses drove operating
income lower. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working to manage costs and increase
yields.
FedEx Ground volume growth in residential services and commercial business along with yield growth helped to push
revenues up 9%. Operating income fell 12% and operating margin declined to 10.5% due to increased rent,
depreciation and staffing related to network expansion, as well as higher purchase transportation rates.
E-commerce continues to drive revenue growth, which provides great opportunities as well as significant challenges.
After challenges from higher-than-expected volumes in certain parts of the country during last peak, Ground invested
in increased capacity and technology. This year we completed 185 facility projects including four major distribution
hubs, 19 fully automated stations and 69 relocations. This equates to more than 10 million square feet of additional
sortation space in the network.
Now all that comes at a cost above and beyond CapEx investment including rent, building insurance, and property tax.
We also incurred higher costs from significant additional staffing as we hired and trained people, sometimes months in
advance of the facility opening. And of course, purchased transportation increased as we pay contracted service
providers to pick up, deliver and transport a growing number of packages. While these buildings and their
state-of-the-art technology are a significant investment, they ensure that we have the capacity, flexibility and efficiency
needed to handle e-commerce and commercial growth.
Although our network projects are impacting Ground's near-term profitability, the investments will enhance long-term
returns and cash flow. We are also working to better balance capacity and volume to improve revenue quality and
margins. These actions contributed to the second quarter volume results and are also expected to mute third quarter
volume growth.
FedEx Ground, Home Delivery and Smart Post Network integration and delivery optimization initiatives continue.
They will increase facility productivity and delivery density over time. We are also investing in technology to improve
safety, and mitigate rising insurance costs. We are committed to increasing margins at Ground over the longer-term.
Turning to our corporate outlook, based on a moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed, we reaffirm expected
earnings before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration and outlook
restructuring costs and intangible asset amortization of $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY 2017. Our total
capital expenditure forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY 2017, including TNT.
This month, we made a $178 million contribution that was required through our pension fund and next month, we plan
to make $1 billion debt funded voluntary contribution to our tax qualified U.S. domestic pension plans.
Now, we look forward to answering your strategic questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. FedEx would like to invite questions via email. To email your question, please use the ir@fedex.com email
address and provide your full name and contact information. [Operator Instructions] Up first, we'll hear from Tom
Wadewitz, UBS.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yes, good afternoon. Let's see, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about – or a
couple of big – broader question, I guess you can answer what you want on Ground. I thought there was some
comment, I don't know, Alan or Fred, about you were maybe holding volumes back a little bit or constraining them to
enhance profitability. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that and if I heard that right. And then just whether the
very large investments in network, if that's – you recover profitability and Ground pretty quickly over the next few
quarters, or does it kind of take a longer look further out for the Ground margin to recover a bit from what we saw in
the quarter? Thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith. Let we make a comment about Ground expansion and then ask
Mike to put more color on my remarks about Ground growth and our effort to manage our traffic a bit better than that
was the case in the past. And then Henry can jump in on margins. First, as it applies to the network expansion, I
mentioned this in my remarks, but these facilities that FedEx Ground has put in place are enormous operations. Some
of these things correct me if I'm wrong here, Henry, are like 250 acres plus. And the amount of sortation equipment
inside are measured in miles not in feet and they are able to sort tens and tens of thousands of packages. So as the scale
of this network has increased, the reality is we have to put the employees and the training in there. You can't just sort of
open them up when the traffic is required.
And the only reason I bring this up is that I'm consistently surprised, maybe more so by the popular media. It was just a
misunderstanding of the gigantic scale of the FedEx and UPS operations, and of course, the postal service as well, but
the postal service is much more last mile rather than upstream. So I just want to put that in perspective. And given the
level of capital that we put into the Ground business, it is very important for us that we get a good return on it. Now we
don't have to get an immediate return. As I've said over and over again and again today, we don't manage FedEx
Corporation as a sum of the parts. We manage it as a broad market segment.
And a few years ago, when Ground had less residential traffic, I mean it was basically supporting increased growth in
the corporation's earnings when we put a lot of effort into re-engineering the Express system. So with that in mind, let
me ask Mike then to give some color to our traffic management efforts
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Hey, Tom. You've obviously followed us a very long time and I think you understand, we've
demonstrated industry-leading growth rates at Ground on a consistent basis. But as I have said many times on this call,
our objective is to strike the right balance between volume growth and yield improvement to maximize operating
margins at each operating company. In that regard, we're constantly looking at opportunities to do that. And over the
last several months or so, we've made some decisions to discontinue relationships with a few customers. Well, we
couldn't candidly agree on pricing and capacity requirements for this peak season. And that's something we do on a
regular basis but we made that decision earlier this year, and as a result of that, we have been managing volumes and
we'll continue to do that. But clearly, it's had some effect on the peak season, but that was intentional on our part, and
we'll continue to do that going forward.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: This is Henry Maier. Let me just add, as Alan noted in his remarks, the integration of FedEx
Ground, Home Delivery and SmartPost yields a number of benefits that positively impact Ground margins. To name a
few, we get improved delivery density and revenue per stop, we get lower cost through improved pickup and delivery
geographies. We get a lower cost structure due to fewer nodes on the network, we reduce our postage expense, and we
move to a single contracted service provider model. All of these things will improve our operating margins over the
longer term.

<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Alan wanted to add a bit to this reply as well.
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: Hey, Tom. Thanks for the question. I'll take it back up to the 50,000-foot level. From a
financial standpoint, earnings, EPS standpoint, this year is going just as I thought it was going to go and my team
thought it was going to go. We were well aware that this big increase in capacity and the hiring that we had to do in
advance of peak was going to hurt the second quarter at Ground. We also knew that Express was going to outperform
expectations. And if you take a look at Ground's second quarter results starting in fiscal 2013 and look through this
fiscal 2017, you'll see how well that they've delivered on that promise.
So we haven't changed the year. We still expect to hit the year, and this wasn't very surprising to us at all. We knew this
was coming. It's a little shocking to see a 250 basis point drop year-over-year in the margin. And as I said, it'll probably
be restrained a bit in the next quarter. But believe you me, we have really good plans to get the returns, as Fred
mentioned on this.
Operator
Next up from Barclays, we will here from Brandon Oglenski.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Yeah, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the career, Mike. So Henry or Alan, I
guess I want to follow up on that. Your revenue was up 9% at Ground, your op income was down 12% so a delta
arguably wider than 20%. And if I look at your major hubs, I think at the end of last year it was like 33%. So if you add
four to the mix and we just think about cost, maybe 10% to 15% additional cost from the new hubs assuming no
revenue even comes through them. The longer term issue here is I think investors are concerned that as you take more
B to C residential deliveries, obviously there's less density there. So is that where the margin's aggregation really is
occurring or is there some competitive pressure from the post office? Can you guys talk more? Because it just feels a
little bit more than capacity additions, but maybe we have that all wrong.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Brandon, it was 185 real estate projects. In the history of the company, we've never opened up
four hubs in a year. So it is a big deal. If you want to look at the expense line, the biggest drivers were rent,
depreciation, building insurance and property tax, which were all driven by the expansion. In addition in the second
quarter, not only do we have to staff those facilities. And as Fred noted, these are sizable operations. Some of them take
not hundreds, but up to almost 1,000 people to staff and train. And in addition to that, at the same period of time that
these facilities are coming online, we're staffing up for peak. So, those are the two major expense drivers, obviously
when volume goes up, revenue goes up, we must pay higher purchase transportation expenses because we pay
contractors more. There's higher postage and higher line haul settlement in moving that volume. So those are the
drivers here.
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: Brandon, let me just go back real quick to my comments where I said we're working to better
balance capacity and volume to improve revenue quality and margins. We have opportunity there. We have an
opportunity, I think, to be better priced for the very, very precious capacity that we offer, not just during peak but all
season long and all year long. So we have opportunity on that side, as well.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Yeah, and let me just add one other thing here, because I think you hit the nail on the
head and it relates back to Mike Glenn's comments. As I mentioned in my remarks, what keeps the lights on here, the
vast majority of our revenue in FedEx Corporation is business to business. And a lot of it is business to consumer, but
it's not e-commerce. It may be all kinds of things. We look at these accounts every day, you'd be surprised.
So e-commerce is basically residential deliveries, and you have to keep in balance the business to business and the
business to consumer e-commerce or you can put extreme pressure on our Ground business. So that is exactly what we
were doing in making the decisions on these accounts that Mike mentioned. So no question, we're trying to manage that
in an appropriate -- an appropriate manner because just business to residential business, I mean, the postal service who
is the biggest of all makes no money at it. That should tell you something right there and they are making millions of
stops a day. So you can't be into our side of the business and not manage this. So that's a very good point that you bring

<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay. Now we are going to do two Internet questions.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. Here are two Internet questions. Well, this is from Ken Hoexter. Where can
you continue to increase technology investments to decrease the need for peak seasonal hiring? We are going to ask
Rob Carter to mention this, but let me just emphasize one more time. The FedEx Ground system is the most automated
such system that you could possibly imagine. The reason for that is FedEx Ground was built in the age of
computerization. So if you go to these great big facilities, it may require a lot of people to off-load and load trucks, but
it requires no people to sort things. Now the FedEx Express system is a bit different because you have to have the
flexibility to move things from one ramp to another and on down the line. But these things are marvels of automation,
and over time we will get even more out of this automation, and in that regard I'll ask Rob Carter to comment on it.
<A - Rob B. Carter>: Well, that's right, Fred. I mean in fact, we have 105 fully automated facilities on the ground
network now, not just the hubs that we're talking about, but the auto stations that exist that drive incredible automation
in that network. And that automation contributes not only during peak, per Ken's question, but all year long. My button
is pushed, there's just no light on it there for the microphone. Sorry about that. But virtually all of our technology
investments and operations contribute to increased efficiency and productivity throughout the operation and they are
incredibly valuable to us.
Route optimization, for example, is driving incredible efficiencies as we're out on the road. We're increasing route
density and stop density all across the network in Freight, Ground and Express with the route technology. But Mike
also mentioned in his comments the customer-facing technologies which are improving these efficiencies, as well.
Things like Delivery Manager that are giving customers more choices that increase security and convenience, but at the
same time with those choices, customers are then driving and do some of our convenience network, increase stop
density and route density that improves our operational efficiency as well.
So all down the line, everything from analytics about better ways to load trailers to sensors that are automating and
optimizing scan technology, driving really incredible efficiencies in the network. And all this is already in market
today, but it's being perfected year by year by year to increase and improve efficiency in the network. So the answer is
yes, Ken, but the reality is it's improving efficiencies all year round, not just in peak.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So by the way, for those of you who don't know, I didn't give the paid commercial
announcement. Ken is with Merrill Lynch, so I should have said that.
Next question. Are FedEx Ground ISPs seeing any increased competition or wage pressure in hiring delivery drivers?
David Vernon, Bernstein. Henry?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Hey, David. This is Henry Maier. Not that we're aware of. But I would add here that we're
increasingly challenged in seven to nine markets to find package handlers. Those markets tend to be markets where
many of our customers are operating fulfillment centers and we tend to try to source those handler jobs from the same
pool of labor. And as a result of that, we're seeing, particularly this time of year, the need to increase hourly pay rates,
offer surge pay and peak bonus pay in an effort to source an adequate number of people to staff these facilities.
<A - Mickey Foster>: We'll take questions from the call.
Operator
And back to the phone we'll hear from Scott Group, Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys. So wanted to ask about Express. So we saw that the US Express
volumes turned negative and just curious if you have any insight on kind of the deceleration of volume there. And then
Alan on Express margins, we typically see good margin improvement sequentially from the first quarter to second
quarter and didn't see that this year and any thoughts on what's driving kind of the lack of sequential margin
improvement at Express this quarter.

<A - Rob B. Carter>: Thanks, Scott. Let me answer the question by telling you that, first of all, we are very proud of
the quarter we just finished. It's our record highest quarter we ever had, $654 million at FedEx Express segment is the
highest we've ever had, the second highest operating profit margin we've ever had in the history of our company at
9.7%. Sequentially, oddly enough, you asked the question and I actually knew the answer. In four years in a row that
we have actually had in the second quarter increasing profits and increasing margins, and actually since the profit
improvement plan went in, in FY 2013 we're up 140%. So how about those numbers?
On the issue of the volume in the United States Domestic, we had some issues in the volume off the East Coast,
primarily due to Hurricane Matthew. We had a typhoon, too, that actually hit the West Coast. So we had a little bit of
an issue on both sides of the coast for us. But in the main we were about where we thought we were -- would be. The
overall yield increased so that our revenue for domestic package went up 2%, and across the world it's actually gone up
2%. So for us, we're in the sweet spot. Our costs are right where we want them to be and our profits are record high.
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: This is Alan. As to Q2 over Q1, nothing to worry about there. It's mostly just a bucket full of
little timing issues. I think just keep watching how we do on the year-over-year quarters and how we finish out the year
and I think you'll be fairly pleased.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: There was also at the Express segment a single customer who moved some traffic
out of the quarter in the last part of the quarter that hit into peak. So absent that, it would have been an up quarter. So
that's a little bit of an item that you see in those numbers.
Operator
From Citi, we will hear from Chris Wetherbee.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Great. Thanks. Wanted to ask about pricing. So it sounds like there is a couple of accounts
that you've walked away from to some extent, but wanted to get a sense of sort of the momentum around pricing and
kind of how you think about sort of pricing out what you've stated, and I agree it's a very valuable sort of capacity and
network as you go through these peak seasons. Just wanted to kind of get a sense of that sort of balance as you're
incurring these costs, particularly on the Ground side, how you can offset that and what you think maybe the potential
is over time of sort of pricing this business.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. Let me first say that I think the pricing environment is pretty stable at
this point. I think our yield improvements that we've noted here today will continue to be industry leading type
year-over-year improvements. We'll wait to see if that's the case. But if you look at our pricing management, our yield
management activities over the last several years, you can certainly say that's the case.
Having said that, I've also said for a long time that the most important thing that we can do regarding peak is to make
sure we price right year round. If we get the pricing right year round, we'll be fine at peak, we just have to manage the
capacity. But beyond that, we're not opposed to looking at alternatives for the valuable peak capacity that we have and
we'll continue to explore options in that regard as the market continues to grow at a substantial rate.
So we're pretty pleased with how we've taken on these revenue management activities to-date. I think we've
demonstrated time and time again, we're not afraid to walk away from a relationship if it's not in our best interest to do
so. We'll continue to do that. And we'll be open-minded about other opportunities to maximize the value of the network
we have.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So let me mention one other thing here that seems to be not clear to a lot of people.
These huge facilities that we're opening up at FedEx Ground are being opened with the firm belief that our FedEx
Ground traffic is going to grow whether it's B2B, or whether it's B2C. And for all of the reasons that Rob Carter
mentioned to you and Henry commented upon, these facilities when they open up, aren't nearly at their max capacity.
So as more volume goes through these sorting facilities, the marginal cost of sorting, because it's all automated, is
shockingly low. So there is huge amount of leverage into these network investments or, as Alan and I both have said,

we wouldn't be making them. Now you get to the point on the yield side of the house, because you start talking about
pickup and delivery and line haul expenses versus the network infrastructure.
There is where it's important to have the appropriate mix of traffic so that you keep your line haul and your PUD cost at
a reasonable relationship, but the bow wave of putting these fixed facilities out will be accretive to margins as more
volume goes through there, regardless of whether it's B2B or B2C. And particularly, as Henry puts one network
together with these initiatives that he has described to you and which culminates, I think, in FY 2019 – FY 2020. So
that's why we say with some confidence these results will pop back up. You can't just put these facilities out and
operate them at full capacity day one. They are put out there in advance of volume that we think will be growing over
many years and will be accretive to profit.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay. Let's go back to two more Internet questions.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. Two more Internet questions. Could you please provide us with an update on
the integration of SmartPost into Ground? Well, that's timely. Have you begun to incorporate dynamic capabilities?
And if not, when do you expect us to ramp up? Amit Mehrotra, Deutsche Bank. Henry?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, thanks for the question. Listen, there is three distinct phases of the integration of
SmartPost into Ground, and I apologize because we probably haven't been as clear on this as we need to be. The first
was dissolving the corporate entity and moving SmartPost employees and management into Ground. That happened
back in September of last year, September of 2015. What I would call phase 2 was the beginning of the diversion of
outbound SmartPost volume from their facilities into Ground hubs which helped to improve load factor, drove down
line haul costs and improved service.
There are two parts to what we call delivery optimization, or internally here, we call it the terminator. The first part of
that came in January of 2016, which was really the ability to manually divert volume that we knew had a high
likelihood of matching a Ground package, or better yet just needed to be in the Ground network. The second phase or
the second part of this comes in July of 2017, next summer, when we will get the ability to virtually divert packages
where the system will see matches and automatically divert them out of SmartPost and into FedEx Ground. We won't
fully realize the benefits of that capability until fiscal 2019 and beyond.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So I have several questions here on the election and what we think that might mean
for FedEx. In fact, there are two or three of them. I'm going to hold that for and I'll address it a little bit later, but let me
get some more, for lack of a better word, technocratic questions out of the way here. There is one about how will we
handle foreign exchange hedging following the acquisition of TNT. Will their program be carried over and
implemented? And that's from Brian Ossenbeck, JPMorgan. Alan?
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: Thanks for the question, Brian. What we found at TNT is an excellent program, very well
thought out, well controlled and well executed. We are getting our hands around what our total corporate strategy is
going to be for hedging. We will be hedging. We'll probably be using a lot of instruments, but we'll only be hedging
known exposures that we believe are real. And at the end of the day with where the dollar has been going, you can't
hedge it all away, you've got to continue to use pricing. I don't know where you think the euro is going to end up but I
know where I think it's going to end up. No amount of hedging is going to protect us from that and that profitability
translation. So it's a mixture of hedging and pricing.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay. Now we'll have questions from the call.
Operator
And our next phone question will come from Jack Atkins, Stephens Investment.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Great. Thanks for the time. Could you comment or just expand on your comments around the
Freight segment and your expectation for improved margins there in 2020? Sort of what do you think is going to be
driving that? And then you mentioned how you think this will impact the overall industry. I would just be curious to get

your expanded comments on that. And then I guess more broadly, when we think about the three different segments,
everything seems to be pointing to 2020 being a very big year in terms of all of these projects coming together. Is there
any sort of thought of maybe putting together some long-term guidance for the consolidated corporation, given that
timeframe?
<A - Michael L. Ducker>: Yes, thanks for the question. This is Mike Ducker. Just a word or two about the FedEx
Freight margin. It's certainly our goal to deliver sustainable double-digit margins for the Freight entity. We've had good
progress on productivity. Our yield and in terms of the contractual increases is improving. And you heard of the
investments that Fred said at the outset in terms of new technology. Those are both in safety systems installed in our
company and also some legacy systems which we expect to greatly improve overall efficiency in productivity. So those
are some of the components for the improvements that we expect at FedEx Freight in the future. Yeah, it absolutely is
customer automation that also connects all the back end systems together. So...
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: The answer to are we going to give you long-term guidance is no. I will tell you that it's not
a switch where all of a sudden in 2020 we have this nirvana. We'll be improving every year all the way up and through
2020 and beyond.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: I tried to give you that forecast and general counsel came over and grabbed my tie
and started pulling it.
Operator
We'll go to our next phone question. It's from Scott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott Schneeberger>: Thanks very much. This is the first quarter of International Priority volume growth, about
two years and also nice International export yield. So curious, just if you could elaborate a little bit on what drove it,
how sustainable is it? And Fred, maybe I'd pull you into the political discussion, just thoughts on trade influence there.
Thanks.
<A – [05GPQ5-E]Rob Carter – FedEx Corp.> Yes, you are right. We're very pleased with that on the International
front. And I think it's our expanded service capabilities and offerings. Quite frankly, we have a different array of
offerings now. We have a deferred service offering in the marketplace and that's growing very nicely at 4%. Overall,
International Priority now has more space and capacity in our existing fleet, and that's now growing, too. Our sales
team is very comfortable selling both. So, I would say across the world and especially in Asia and the United States
back to Asia, we're doing very nicely. In fact, this quarter, starting in December, as Fred mentioned in his comments,
and Mike Glenn, we are off to a very good start. So, yes, we're pleased. We continue to see it going that way. And
those are some of the reasons why.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay, two more Internet questions.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, there's a couple of questions on tax and I'm going to have Alan answer this. I
would just say this on the political side of the house. There is a lot of confusion and concern over what has been
proposed in the House Bill, as most of you know, particularly this border adjustment. Having said that, I do think that
there will be tax reform which will be beneficial to us. And I'll ask Alan to put his thoughts on that.
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: The question came from Helane Becker at Cowen. Thanks, Helane. It involves discussing
the potential impact of 100% expensing, significant earnings outside of the US that could be repatriated, and impact to
our healthcare plan.
So, let me take those in reverse order. We have an outstanding healthcare plan for our teammates, but it does not meet
the definition of a Cadillac plan. So, like everyone else, we'll be watching these developments as they unfold, but we're
very pleased with what we're delivering for our teammates.
At May 31, we had about $1.6 billion permanently reinvested offshore and have about $775 million cash offshore. We
currently plan to use that cash to fund Express TNT needs offshore and have no plans to repatriate that to the U.S. That

also is a statement that says we're not going to be taxed on those earnings that we've left outside. If we are, we'll
probably bring some of that back to pay those taxes.
The bigger issue for all of you to look at longer term for us is the features that are in the GOP blueprint and
President-elect Trump's plans that we like a lot, and those include materially lowering the tax rate, the effective
territorial treatment of foreign earnings, and current expensing of CapEx. We think that will positively impact our top
line through stronger economic growth and, of course, the bottom line potentially in a very big way through the lower
tax rate.
Having said that, we are concerned about the border adjustability concept and are trying to figure out how it would
affect us directly, as well as our customers and trade and global growth, in general. And right now, there's a huge
debate going on that. So, as always, the devil is going to be in the details, and we'll just have to report back to you later
as this begins to unfold. But if you think about our tax rate this year in the 36% to 37% range, a 20% tax rate would be
a mighty fine Christmas gift.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Let me just add some detail on what Alan just said. Alan mentioned that we're not a
Cadillac plan at the moment. The reason we're not a Cadillac plan is because we adjusted our plan when the Affordable
Care Act, to move to more consumer-driven healthcare with much better tools for our teammates to buy healthcare
more expertly and at lower cost. We did things like put in clinics at our high employment locations and we also gave all
of our employees HRAs in order for them to pay for some of their deductibles and so forth.
So, we avoided hitting the Cadillac tax because of the steps that we took. Now, if ACA is not modified in that respect,
given healthcare inflation, there's a good chance we would hit the Cadillac tax in the out years, which would result in
truly onerous taxes on the benefits above the Cadillac tax level of 40%. So, one of the most important things that we
would like to see in the reform of the Affordable Care Act is to do away with the Cadillac tax limit, and that would give
us the freedom to do some other things in our healthcare that we might not be able to do as long as we're on that
trajectory towards a 40% excise tax. It really penalizes excellent healthcare plans like we have, relative to other folks.
So, it's important to understand the context of our healthcare plan design, which was a reaction to the Affordable Care
Act and the very significant cost that would be incurred in the excise tax on the Cadillac tax plan.
I might say, just parenthetically to that, that this past year we paid – how much in ACA taxes? Was it $65 million? $65
million in extra taxes that would have gone into our healthcare plan but went into the federal treasuries in the form of
ACA taxes. It was so much per covered life, I think, or plan participant, I forget what. But $65 million, I mean, this
thing has been a major, major issue to employers who have good healthcare plans like we have had and we have tried
to keep great healthcare plans within the context of the ACA.
Okay. One more. So, there are about three or four questions here on macro and trade, in particular. There's one from
David Vernon, there's another one from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank, David Ross of Stifel. So, I'm going to put
this all together, if you don't mind.
Obviously, we are very concerned about the trade issue, which is one of the reasons that I gave a speech on the 9th of
December at the Competitiveness Institute, which was scheduled long before the election results were known because
both the democrats and the republicans were running on anti-trade platform. So, if you go to policy.fedex.com, you can
read that speech. It is not a polemic and it's not a political speech, it is just a factual speech which points out that one in
five Americans' jobs are related to trade and we have a trade surplus and services in trade. We have a surplus when you
take the 20 countries that we have free trade agreements with.
So, the prospect of significantly reducing trade is, in our opinion, significantly dangerous, and the proper approach is to
lean into trade and try to remove barriers which, by the way, the Trans-Pacific Partnership did to our exports, not to
stop people from selling products and services to us.
So, I hope that that will make a difference in the debate out there. I would point out there's an excellent article in
Barron's by – I forgot the gentleman's first name, Epstein, which sound very similar themes, and again it's fact based,
it's not politically based. So, we hope these things will be considered, and I think what Alan said to you about the
border adjustable tax is spot on. This is just very destructive of trade. It's not the proper solution to the problem. I think

if they lower the tax rate and went to territorial, it would accomplish 95% of all the benefits they're looking for and
ignite a significant investment boom in the United States. It would solve the inversion problem. So, they've got some
very, very good people in this cabinet.
And finally, I think the second largest economy in the world is China. In the speech I just mentioned, we were very
direct on our own experiences with China and Japan in terms of their tendencies to engage in mercantilist practices.
And we feel very strongly it's in China's best interest to open up their markets, and many of the things that the Chinese
administration are trying to accomplish would be facilitated by opening up, rather than keeping their markets closed.
So, we're worried about it, but we hope that all of these facts will be carefully considered before the Congress or the
administration does anything which might be injurious based on the facts of the matter.
<A - Mickey Foster>: You can also get a copy that speech on investor relations website. Let's now take some
questions from the live call.
Operator
Our next phone question comes from Ben Hartford, Robert W Baird.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Thanks for that perspective there, Fred. I guess just to quantify your outlook here for 2017,
there's a host of uncertainties, as it relates to the 100-day plan, and what actually will come to bear in 2017, but the
markets investors have become certainly optimistic about 2017's growth, post the election. But you guys took down
your US IP growth forecast by 10 basis points for 2017. And I'm just wondering the thought process behind that
reduction in the face of what appears to be some optimism from the broader equity markets as it relates to
re-accelerating growth in 2017.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, whatever was there was probably related to the increase in the dollar. But,
Mike, put more detail on it.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: The drags come from energy and inventory. And those are the main issues, and though the
dollar remains strong, it's also a headwind to manufactured exports and those were their primary issues. I would
consider that a minor adjustment, especially if you look at the year-over-year change, it's a pretty significant
turnaround.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: And the good news is we carry things both ways. So, what you pick up on the sand
pile, you ought to find also on the swing, or whatever that old saying is.

Next up from Merrill Lynch is Ken Hoexter.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: Great. Good afternoon. If we can just kind of return to the volume discussion a bit. You
talked a little bit about walking around summit FedEx Ground, FedEx Express being down a half a percent, U.S. freight
pounds were also down, almost half a percent. Would you step back and slow some of the investments here or are you
growing too fast relative to what you're seeing? Or is there something on in e-commerce, is it slowing or is it just losing
share? I want to understand on a big maybe volume picture. And then just, Alan, just to throw in, I want to just reiterate
your target. Does it include the $0.15 of gains from the quarter? The $0.07 and the $0.08, are they in the reiterated
target?
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: Well, let me take those, if I could. In the freight segment, I think we noted that the average
weight per shipment was down. Our actual shipment growth is up. We continue...

<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: I'm sorry.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: I don't know if that was a post office loss or anything like that.
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: Well, the dollar that I just mentioned is having an effect on that. So that's the main issue
there. I think Fred already mentioned and [ph] Dave (01:04:07) mentioned the timing of a large account has affected
the FedEx Express volumes during the quarter. We're not concerned about that whatsoever.
The issue with FedEx Ground, the FedEx Ground segment, which involves SmartPost, was a decision we made on
some specific accounts. And as I have told you many, many times, I mean, we're going to be disciplined about that.
We're growing at a rapid rate. We continue to grow rapidly. If you look at our performance over the last several years,
we've had industry-leading growth rates, but at the same time, it's important that we balance growth with improvements
in yield and make sure we get a proper return given the investments we are making. So, we are confident with the level
of growth that we see going forward as it relates to the investments we've made.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Let me just add more detail on it, just what I was saying a moment ago. I mean, we
have a fantastic sales force all over the world. So, traffic levels are affected on the margin by exchange rates. So, when
you have the dollar running up to the extent that it has here recently, which has been significant, U.S. exports are not as
affordable and attractive to people in other areas. So, it puts a lot of pressure on U.S. exports.
On the other side of the coin, with the diminution in the value of the euro or any other currency, it obviously makes
their goods less expensive to the United States. So, you will see, with some adjustment, disproportionate traffic growth
there given the fact that we've got great sales people on both sides of all of the oceans. So I don't think you should read
into that on these small perturbations anything more than exchange rates adjustments. Now, over the longer haul,
assuming there is good macroeconomic policy, which quite frankly, is not the case in most places around, and
hopefully will be the case with tax reform here, you'll see economic growth. And even with exchange rates, you'll see
volumes growing. And of course, as always, the fact that we think and have said before that we have strategies that
allow us to take market share, particularly in the FedEx Express segment, which we will benefit from in the next
several years.
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: So not very strategic question, but so, if there is any confusion, let me straighten you out.
The accounting standards update for share-based payments, which was a $0.07 benefit in the quarters in the tax rate.
All right? So it's in the tax rate range I gave you as well for the year and some adjustments in guidance I gave you for
the year. As to the gain on the sale of an investment, because this rose to the level that it did, a materiality of $0.08, we
thought we'd alert you to that.
We have hundreds of little bitty items that go plus and minus in every quarter that we don't talk to you about because
they don't reach the level of materiality, but this one did. So it's also in the range, but it's only $0.08, and the range is
$0.50 wide. I would point out in the second quarter, year-over-year our tax rate was higher. And our tax rate is
complicated as we absorb TNT and work through our new tax planning structure, and we'll wait to see what comes out
of Washington. So stand by. That's the one that I got the least confidence about. But we'll keep at it.

Our next question today comes from Brian Ossenbeck, JPMorgan.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one, if you could give us an update on, as
you work through some of these volumes that you've been talking about. How are the non-conveyable package annexes
working? I think you said you had six built out for peak. Is that something that you're also pulling back on or is this
something you might look to add permanent capacity to handle some of those larger packages if you are able to, of
course, price them accordingly?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Great question, Brian. Just a couple of things. One is we've had non-conveyable capacity in our
network going all the way back to, I think, the first year we started in business. I think the change is the rapid growth

rate we're seeing in these things as people get more comfortable ordering just about anything over the Internet. We had
eight annexes for non-conveyables this year at peak. I think only two of those we intended to be permanent post peak.
But I will tell you that we still have some peak left here, but the early reports are this has been a home run in terms of
keeping large, very difficult to handle packages out of our hubs by virtue of the fact that we've had such terrific service
performance this year and our hub productivity has been excellent as well.
So I would say that this is something that we will stick with. I think we still have some work to do in terms of where we
cite them. And I think I mentioned this on other calls in here, there's also some pretty promising advancements in
material handling technology to handle these kind of packages. And as we learn more about that and as we experience
whether the benefits that are promised are actually there, I think the next step will be trying to figure out how we
retrofit existing facilities with that new material handling technology.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: And I would just add that, as you know, we've made several pricing adjustments to make
sure that we are being paid appropriately for the service that we're providing. We'll continue to review the growth in
this segment, and if additional pricing actions are warranted, we'll certainly take them.

Our next question will come from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Amit Mehrotra>: Yeah. Thanks so much for taking the question. My question relates to getting a sense at a high
level just how revenue growth for the company should or could translate to earnings growth over time. I certainly
appreciate that there are a lot of moving parts and some timing items, but if you could just sort of help us understand,
just from a structural standpoint, where you think incremental margins should be or could be because they were pretty
weak in the fiscal second quarter for understandable reasons maybe. But if you could just give us some sense of where
you think it should be, what strikes the right balance between returns and investment, and when do you think you could
get to that sort of optimal level. Thanks so much.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, let me answer this at the strategic level. We have been saying for a couple of
years now that we believe FedEx Corporation's earnings, margins, cash flows and returns will go up. So let me reiterate
that again, that we believe that to be the case. The reason we think that they're going to go up is because the structure of
our networks are such that there is leverage in those networks. And in the Express system, for instance, we're refleeting
much more efficient. We're moving our International economy in non-asset systems. We have much more capacity in
Europe, the pickup and delivery density in Europe.
And the Ground situation, I just mentioned the fact that these investments in these facilities, as more and more volume
goes through there, they are accretive of and by themselves. In the Freight area, we are very confident that the
technologies that we have which, by the way, allowed us for the first time in the history of the LTL business to offer
both a Priority and Economy service. Nobody had the technology to do that. It would have been literally a scheduling
impossibility absent the sophistication of the technology.
Now, we're applying that same technology to get more leverage out of our facilities in terms of throughput, cross dock,
if you will, in Freight. Better loading. We have robots under test that – I could go on here all afternoon. There are just
numerous places where we think we have increased earnings leverage with increased volume. An equal part of that,
however, is to be, as Mike Glenn has said several times, you have to be disciplined. The reality in the transportation
business, and for that matter broadened into the transportation and logistics business, these markets are so huge. You
can get a lot of volume that is completely non-compensatory and just not make any money. And there are a large
number of transportation and logistics companies that prove that every quarter making no money. And some of them
are pretty damn big.
So we just have just a lot of leverage points and that's why we say what we have said. If that changes, we'll say that too.
But we're not prepared to give you, despite my best efforts to do so over the General Counsel's objections, to do what
that is. But Alan is very good at giving you the ranges at the start of the year. And we're very confident that we can

increase our margins, cash flows, earnings per share, and our returns with what we're doing.
I'm going to say one thing again that I said in my opening remarks. This is an enormous enterprise and I can't tell you
on any one given quarter that we're going to have everything lined up in every segment. If I did that, it would be
incorrect and misleading. What I can say is that we think we can manage to those metrics I just gave you.

And our final question today will come from David Vernon, Bernstein.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Thanks for taking the call. I was just wondering if maybe, Henry or Alan, you
could help us think about the Ground margin outlook and the Ground revenue growth outlook over the next couple of
quarters. Obviously, you are taking some more steps to be more selective on which customers you're taking in. Should
we be expecting this mid-single digit volume growth rate or is this just like a one-time anomaly? And then, do you
think that this will be kind of our trough year on FedEx Ground margins with recovery next year? Do you think we may
still be working through this thing as we get to that 2020 goal? Just trying to get a sense for how to adjust our
medium-term expectations on the margin trajectory and the volume growth trajectory at FedEx Ground.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: David, this is Fred. You know, I think we need to leave it with the broader themes
that we laid out there. Again, I know from y'all standpoint, if we could be more precise on a quarterly-quarterly basis,
we will. We expect FedEx Ground volumes, FedEx Ground revenues, and FedEx Ground margins to go up in calendar
2017 and certainly in fiscal 2018 based on the traffic trends and yield trends that we see and the leverage and the
investments that we've made.
So, I don't think you can take one quarter and extrapolate something and – I think I'll just leave it at that to give you the
best guidance I can. And if we could get it better than that, I have to tell you, I'd be happy about it, to see it inside, but
there's just too many moving parts to do it otherwise.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Fred, do you have concluding remarks?
Frederick Wallace Smith
Yes. Let me conclude first by thanking you all for being on this call. I'd like to express the appreciation, not just of
myself, which I'll come back to, but the SMC who's all sitting around here and the Board of Directors who met in our
normal quarterly meeting just a week or so and passed one of the most effusive resolutions of praise I've ever seen in
business, and I have seen a lot of these.
So, all of us, your partners here at FedEx, Mike, thank you for your 35 years. Mike and I have worked together for 25
years directly. Told other people his office was right next door. There's nobody that has made more contributions to this
company's success than you have, Mike, and that includes this speaker. And I have to tell you the professionalism and
industry knowledge, the sales and marketing prowess, in particular, your sense of humor, wry though it may be on
everything other than Ole Miss football results. And I think it's the measure of the man. I've said this publicly that I
think knowing him, all things considered, Mike would have loved to stay here and stayed in the band and had some fun
over the next two to three years because we believe, just as I was saying to David there, we think they're going to be
very, very good years.
But he and Donna have a special-needs child and they're making the right priorities, and I think that says everything
you need to know about Mike Glenn's character and his commitment to his family, and putting priorities in the right
place. So, thanks, Mike, for a job well done. I have Mike for 30 hours – how often? A month. 30 hours a month. So,
we've been calculating, does that start when he comes in the door or when he comes on the fourth floor as a consultant?
And we'll be utilizing that treasure trove of knowledge that he has. So, thanks again, Mike, and well done.
