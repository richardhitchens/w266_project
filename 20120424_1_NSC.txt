Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2012 earnings
conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including Don Seale, our Chief Marketing
Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer and Jim Squires, our Chief Financial Officer, all of whom you will
hear from this afternoon.
I am very pleased to report that Norfolk Southern had an excellent first quarter, setting records in most financial and
operating metrics. Our results included across-the-board all-time first quarter highs for revenues, income from railway
operations, net income and earnings per share. And the operating ratio of 73.3% equaled our best ever first-quarter
performance.
Beginning with the top line, revenues for the first quarter rose 6% to $2.8 billion. Volumes were up 1%,
notwithstanding a 12% decline in coal traffic. The overall volume increase was led by double-digit growth in
automotive as well as metals and construction. Revenue per unit rose by an average of 5%.
On the expense side, a strong focus on efficiency, combined with mild weather, resulted in record income from railway
operations of $745 million, which then translated into net income of $410 million and earnings per share of $1.23.
These results enabled the first quarter dividend increase of 9%, a first quarter record operating cash flow, exceeding $1
billion, and first quarter share repurchases of $400 million.
Stepping back a little, the real story for the quarter was held the diversity of our franchise, along with a network that is
performing at a high service level, helped us to deliver these excellent results. As always, Don will take you through all
of the moving parts of our business, Mark will give you a look at our key operating metrics and the impact of our
increased velocity and reduced terminal dwell times, and Jim will walk you through all of the numbers.
I'll return with some closing remarks before we take questions, but now let me go ahead and turn it over to Don.
Donald W. Seale
Thank you, Wick and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter, our broad portfolio of markets generated
record first quarter revenue of $2.8 billion, up $169 million or 6% versus first quarter 2011, despite a weaker coal
market. This included an all-time revenue record within merchandise of $1.5 billion, up $177 million or 13% over last
year. Intermodal revenue set a first quarter record of $527 million, up $42 million or 9% over 2011, while coal revenue
for the quarter was down 6%, primarily due to volume declines. Overall yield increased 5% and volume grew by 1%,
with 5% gains in both intermodal and merchandise, which more than offset a 12% decline in coal shipments.
Of the $169 million in revenue growth during the quarter, more than 80% came as a result of higher revenue per unit,
including pricing gains and fuel surcharge revenue. Higher volume accounted for the remainder of the revenue
increase.
Breaking out yield, the next slide shows we achieved an all-time high revenue per unit of $1,611, up $80 per unit or 5%
versus first quarter last year, with increases in all business groups. Merchandise set all time record of $2,549 per unit up
$185 or 8% versus last year. Three of the business units within merchandise, metals and construction, paper and
chemicals, also posted all time highs. Revenue per unit within coal was up $125 or 6% over first quarter 2011 and
intermodal was up $22 or 3% in the quarter. During the quarter, we obtained pricing in excess of rail inflation to

support balanced investment across our network and appropriate returns for our investors.
Now, turning to volume for the quarter, despite the challenges in coal due primarily to weak electricity demand, the
strength of the intermodal and merchandise networks drove volume up by 20,000 loads or 1% for the quarter.
Intermodal gains came mainly from the Domestic segment, up 13%, which led to a 5% increase in total intermodal
volume. Merchandise volume also grew by 5% for the quarter on the strength of automotives and steel as well as higher
volumes associated with shale oil and gas drilling.
Now, drilling down into our major business sectors, starting with coal, coal revenue for the quarter of $766 million was
down $50 million or 6%, due primarily to a 12% decline in volume. Notably, the majority of our coal traffic moves in
unit train service, and in that regard, there was approximately a one-to-one relationship in terms of reduced crew starts
and locomotives compared to the volume decline. An improvement in revenue per unit of 6% helped partially offset the
effect of weaker volumes.
As depicted on the next slide, utility coal loads were down 17% during the quarter. This was the warmest first quarter
on record according NOAA, with records dating as far back as 1895. You will note that heating degree days within the
NS service region were down 27% for the quarter as compared to 2011, and also down 26% compared to the normal
range. March in particular was a very warm month, officially the warmest on record in the contiguous U.S. and heating
degree days during March alone were down by 47% versus last year. Based on recent generation trends within our
service region, we estimate that weak electricity demand accounted for roughly 75% of the volume decline in our
utility market, while competition due to natural gas had less of an impact.
Coal burn at Eastern utilities was down over 28% through the first two months of the year, primarily as a result of this
very mild weather pattern and competition from 10-year lows in natural gas prices. Within our utility network, volumes
to our longer haul Southern utility plants were down 24%, while loads to Northern utilities were down 11%. Higher
demand in our domestic metallurgical market, which was up 19% for the quarter, helped to partially offset the decline
in utility coal. Domestic metallurgical volumes were up in response to increased domestic steel production, which was
up 7% in the quarter.
Volume within our export market was down 10% due to the return of Australian supply and weaker global demand for
steel. World steel production, excluding North America, was down 3% for the first two months of the quarter, driven
primarily by weakness in the European market and weaker Chinese production in January.
On the plus side, we handled over 600,000 tons of new export steam coal business during the first quarter. Low
domestic demand for steam coal and excess inventories led producers to opt to ship thermal coals to overseas markets.
And finally, we handled over 18,000 loads of industrial coal in the quarter, which was up 3% due to new business
gains.
Concluding my comments on call, slide nine shows the relative differences in length of haul among our various coal
market segments. Export met coal moves on average, for example, approximately 480 miles, while domestic met
moves about 40% fewer miles. Conversely, in the utility segment, coal to our Southern utilities averages nearly 200
more miles per load than coal to our Northern utilities. Obviously, changes in volume between the market segments
will impact revenue per car for coal in our network.
Now turning next to our intermodal network, revenue in the quarter reached $527 million, up $42 million or 9% over
first quarter 2011, driven by 5% higher intermodal volume and a 3% increase in revenue per unit. As depicted on slide
11, the volume gains in intermodal came mainly from our domestic market, which was up 13%, or nearly 44,000 loads
for the quarter, due primarily to highway conversions.
Our international segment posted a 3% decline for the quarter as volume reductions associated with Maersk were
partially offset by trade growth. And finally, increased demand for truckload services pushed Triple Crown volume up
4% for the quarter.
As volumes within our domestic network strengthened, so did our efficiency. As shown on the next slide, we
experienced marked improvement in the stacking of domestic containers during the quarter, a metric which highlights

loading efficiency and equipment utilization. During the quarter, 86% of all domestic containers in our network moved
on stack cars, a nine-point improvement as compared to the first quarter 2011 creating additional capacity across the
network. And total intermodal crew starts went up by 2% on a 5% increase in volume.
Wrapping up our discussion of the business groups, we'll now turn to our merchandise sector. Revenue for the
merchandise group in the quarter was $1.5 billion, up $177 million or 13% over last year. This is an all time revenue
record for our merchandise sector. A first quarter record was established for metals and construction and new all time
records were achieved for chemicals and agriculture as well. The 13% revenue increase in merchandise was driven by
an 8% gain in revenue per unit and a 5% increase in volume for the quarter.
The growth within merchandise was led by automotive, which was up 23%, and metals and construction traffic which
increased by 12%. A projected 16% increase in North American light vehicle production during the quarter, along with
business gains from Volkswagen and other manufacturers drove the growth in our automotive sector.
Our steel business was up 13% in the first quarter as a result of rising demand from domestic production and increased
import slab volumes from Russia and Eastern Europe. In addition, we saw strong demand for frac sand into the
Marcellus and Utica shale regions which led to a 19% gain in miscellaneous construction materials.
Chemicals volume was flat for the quarter, as gains in plastics and crude oil from the Bakken and Canadian oilfields
offset declines in rock salt for highway treatment due to the mild winter. Two of our merchandise sectors experienced
volume declines for the quarter. Agriculture volume was down 2%, due to our fertilizer comp effect, which was not
cleared until March 1. This was partially offset by a 6% increase in shipments of ethanol, in spite of reduced
consumption of gasoline. Paper volume was down 4%, due to a weaker volume of newsprint, pulp and pulpboard,
which was partially offset by gains in lumber, which was up 15% in the quarter.
Concluding now with our business outlook and our expectations ahead, for coal, we do not anticipate the need for
appreciable inventory replenishment in our utility market, during the shoulder market months since stockpiles remain at
target levels across our region. But we do expect offsetting demand in a robust domestic metallurgical market due to
increased domestic steel production. And on the export front, we expect new steam coal opportunities to partially offset
weaker demand in the European met market. We are also encouraged by recent improvement in high end world met
coal prices, which may be signaling a tighter supply chain for this product. But clearly in the short run, post April 1 of
this year, we are pricing transportation service in this sector in a weaker international met coal market than existed last
year.
In our intermodal sector, our strong service performance and tighter truckload capacity bode well for continued
opportunity for highway conversions. And expectations for international trade remain favorable as consumer
confidence continues to improve. The outlook for our merchandise business is positive, led by growth in crude oil and
waste products as well as higher volumes of ethanol to new terminals. We're also well-positioned to take advantage of
prospects for continued growth in the shale regions, and our outlook for our steel and automotive businesses remain
positive.
In summary, we expect our diverse range of markets to support overall growth ahead despite current headwinds in the
coal market. We remain committed to delivering a strong service product and pricing that product at levels that equal or
exceed the rate of rail inflation.
Thanks for your time and I'll now turn it over to Mark for our operations report. Mark?
Mark D. Manion
Thank you, Don. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with safety, we ended the first quarter with a ratio of 0.70, that's
an 11% improvement over the same period last year. As we continue to reduce injuries and accidents, everyone
associated with Norfolk Southern wins. Our employees have an improved quality of life and from a business
perspective, we reduce our cost and improve our operating performance. Our workforce increasingly drives
improvements in safety and service.

Let me now turn to service, as expressed in our composite service metric. For the quarter, we posted composite
performance of 82.8%; that's an 15% improvement over last year. While led by train performance, all the components –
train performance, connection performance and plan adherence – showed significant year-over-year improvement,
while mild winter weather worked in our favor, improved crew availability has resulted in a big boost in operating
performance. This continues a trend from the fourth quarter, where we've seen the velocity of the railroad continue to
improve. First quarter composite performance, in fact, is just short of the second quarter 2009 record performance of
83.8%, but with 23% more volume.
Similar to composite service metric, train speed for the first quarter improved 2.5 miles an hour or 12% over the same
period last year. Again, we're approaching our record setting second quarter 2009 velocity, but with significantly more
traffic. Like train speed, terminal dwell showed a significant improvement in the first quarter compared to first quarter
of last year, a reduction of 4.4 hours or 17% and equal to our 2009 performance.
Turning to the last page, all of these service improvements also equate to greater velocity and consistency, and in turn
drive productivity. Let me list just a few: train and engine service overtime has been reduced 15%, re-crews have been
reduced a sizable 35%, equipment rents have been reduced as a whole but the portion of equipment rents driven by
velocity has been reduced by 9%, locomotives in service have been reduced by 3%, fuel consumption reduced by 2%,
gross ton miles per gallon improved 1% and gross ton miles per train hour has improved 4%.
This quarter punctuates the importance of having the right resources in place to run the network. Properly applied,
those resources drive service and velocity which not only delivers a superior service product to our customers, but also
productivity to the bottom line.
With that I will turn it over to you, Jim.
James A. Squires
Thank you, Mark. I will now review our financial results for the first quarter. As Wick mentioned, after a balmy winter,
we are off to a strong start, having set first quarter records for most measures.
Let's start with our first quarter operating results. As Don described, our 6% increase in railway operating revenues set
a new first quarter record at $2.8 billion. The $169 million increase included an additional $76 million of fuel revenues,
notwithstanding a $26 million unfavorable lag effect.
Railway operating expenses increased $24 million or 1% for the quarter. Income from railway operations was a first
quarter record at $745 million and the resulting 73.3% operating ratio equaled our first quarter record.
As you'll recall, our prior year expenses included a $58 million non-cash charge related to an unfavorable arbitration
ruling, which contributed 220 basis points to last year's operating ratio. Excluding the arbitration charge, our 2012
operating ratio translates to a 2% or 160 basis point improvement compared to first quarter 2011.
Turning to our expenses, the next slide shows the major components of the $24 million net increase. As expected, fuel
and compensation and benefits accounted for most of the upward pressure on our expenses. As displayed on the
following slide, the $24 million increase in fuel expense was due to higher prices, which were partially offset by
reduced consumption. Our average diesel fuel price per gallon was $3.16, a 10% increase compared to the first quarter
of 2011. Diesel fuel consumption decreased 2% relative to a 1% increase in volume and a 1% decline in gross ton miles
reflecting productivity gains achieved from a fluid network.
Next, compensation and benefits increased by $21 million or 3%. Looking at the major components of this increase on
the following slide, first, pay rates drove expenses up $11 million; second, higher health and welfare benefits due to
increased head count added $6 million; third, payroll taxes increased $6 million; fourth, employee activity levels,
primarily related to non-T&E crafts, increased, adding $5 million. Train and engine activity levels increased negligibly,
despite higher train starts and volumes, again displaying productivity gains from improved train operations. Lower
stock-based compensation partially offset these increases.

Depreciation and purchased services and rents increased $13 million and $8 million respectively. The 6% increase in
depreciation reflects our larger capital basis, as we've continued to invest in our infrastructure and equipment.
Purchased services and rents, primarily reflects increased intermodal operations, repairs and maintenance and other
miscellaneous services, partly offset by lower equipment rents.
Equipment rents benefited from improved velocity, our acquisition of freight cars that had been previously leased, the
plans for which we shared with you last year, and the reduction of leased locomotives. Materials and other expenses
decreased $42 million or 15%, reflecting the absence of last year's unfavorable arbitration ruling, partially offset by
higher materials costs, largely related to equipment and roadway repairs.
Turning to our non-operating items, higher interest expense on uncertain tax positions was offset by net returns from
corporate owned life insurance and other miscellaneous items. Interest expense on debt increased $8 million, reflecting
additional net borrowings over the last 12 months.
Next, income taxes totaled $244 million and the effective tax rate was 37.3%. Income taxes in the first quarter of 2011
were $190 million with an effective rate of 36.9%.
Net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on the following slide. Net income was $410 million, an increase of
$85 million or 26% compared to 2011. Diluted earnings per share was $1.23, exceeding first quarter of 2011 results by
$0.33 per share or 37%. Excluding last year's arbitration adjustment, our net income increased $49 million or 14%
compared to 2011, and diluted earnings per share increased $0.23 per share or 23%. Both measures set new first quarter
records.
Lastly, and as displayed on slide 13, during the quarter, we generated cash from operations exceeding $1 billion, up
$383 million from last year and also bolstered by a return to normal accounts payable flows from the accelerated
activity I mentioned to you last quarter. Cash from operations more than covered our property additions, share
repurchases and dividends. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter equaled $829 million, reflecting $600
million related to our 3% 10-year senior notes issued in March.
Thank you for your attention, and now I'll turn the program back to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thanks, Jim. As you've heard, Norfolk Southern again posted excellent results for the first quarter, driven, as I said
earlier, by our very substantial improvements in operation, velocity and customer service, along with the continued
strength in key components of our franchise.
Looking ahead, we're committed to driving even higher levels of service performance and efficiencies through
continued investments in assets, infrastructure, technology and most importantly, our people. We have long believed
that improving service links directly to greater efficiencies and the numbers that Mark showed you are certainly
confirmation of that.
Looking to our markets, we continue to believe that the United States is on a path of continued, albeit slow growth, and
we feel confident that we can continue to grow our merchandise and intermodal volumes at above the rates of total
economic growth. Coal obviously remains something of a question mark, given our inability to forecast, let alone
manage, the weather, but over the longer term we have continuing confidence in the strength of both our domestic and
export coal franchises.
Our company and the great people who make up our company, are working hard to deliver the best possible value to
our customers and superior returns to our shareholders. We have a great team and our first quarter results are further
proof that we are achieving success in both of those goals.
Thanks and we'll open it up for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Ceraso from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Hello, thanks, good afternoon. Let's see; a couple of items. The strength in your length of haul
in the coal business in Q2 and Q3 of last year drove some nice yields and revenue per unit. How much of a headwind
do you think that creates this year in Q2 and Q3? And then if we couple that with the decline in the export met pricing
and just a decline in export met volumes, do you think it's possible that revenue per unit could go negative in coal in Q2
or Q3?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Chris, this is Don. Certainly last year, we saw Utility South shipments and export shipments
up substantially and we faced that as a comp this year. Those are long-haul higher RPU market segments of coal and
they are under pressure somewhat. I had mentioned that our Utility South segment in the first quarter was down 24%;
our Utility North segment was down 11%. So that's a negative comp with respect to mix within those two segments.
Also, our export market was off 10% in the first quarter, and that's a negative comp as well. So the revenue per unit
based on that mix effect certainly could go negative if we continue to see that mix.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. And then maybe thinking longer term, more the core price in coal for the domestic
thermal, what's your expectation as you look forward as contracts start to roll over? Do you think you may have to
adjust prices downward or is your game plan to maintain pricing in domestic thermal?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Chris, we do not have any utility coal contracts that will be renegotiated this year. So, we will
have to wait to see what the market looks like when those contracts are renegotiated.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: And you're not willing to talk about next year yet?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I think we have a ways to go to see what the market will look like by then.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Great, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Just maybe another question on the export coal market.
From the pricing standpoint I guess most of it will recycle on April 1, I just want to get a sense, could you give us the
order of magnitude, is it 100% of your met business that gets repriced on April 1 or is there some piece of the business
that got redone earlier this year?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We have some of the business that is under contract beyond April 1, but the majority of the
export metallurgical coal market will be repriced after the April 1 date.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. And then when you think about the mix of thermal, you mentioned thermal coming in
and potentially providing some offset to the decline in the met business. I'm guessing that not much of that was moving
in the first quarter, is that a fair statement? I think you had mentioned that you've gotten some in the month of March,
but as you look forward is that the potential to offset that, that we didn't see in the first quarter in the down 10% number
that may come in the next couple of quarters?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We handled 600,000 tons of steam coal into the export market in the first quarter.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay and that could be a bigger number as we move forward potentially?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Potentially. Yes.

<A - Donald W. Seale>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Yagerman from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, guys. First question on the intermodal side, just switching topics a little bit, I'll come
back to coal don't worry. But was curious how you think about the profitability of that incremental double stacking that
you were able to get in the quarter. I mean is that pure profit as you're able to get more containers on those trains or
how should we think about that in terms of the incremental margin in that intermodal business?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Justin, this is Don, we realized increased efficiencies as we densify our intermodal train
network. So, when you look at the metrics of going up nine percentage points in the stack configuration in the first
quarter plus having a 5% increase in volume with only a 2% increase in crew starts, both of those metrics support
improved efficiency and incremental margin.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Got it, so it definitely helps out on that end. And then when I think about the steam coal
on the export side becoming a bigger part of the mix, can you remind us, I guess on a percent basis, what steam coal is
right now as a percentage of your total export? And how does that export price and margin compare to the met side of
the export business? And where exactly is that coal coming from and where is it going?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The steam coal component and the met coal component in the first quarter, we were 93%
metallurgical coal going into the export market. The steam coal that we are targeting is predominantly Western Europe.
Some could make its way to Asia as well, and it originates in much of the same production territory that we originate
the met coal in. So it would be Central App, Northern App Illinois Basin.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Got it and the profitability on that relative to the met?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The steam coal market is a different market than the met coal market. We will do fine on both
segments, but it's a differentiated product.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: If you had one versus the other, which would you rather have?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Both.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: All right. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it, guys.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You bet.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Wolfe from Wolfe Trahan.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Hey, good afternoon, guys.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Hi, Ed.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: What are you seeing directionally in the domestic met yields going forward? What do you
expect? And on the export, your closest competitor obviously posted a 12% decline in April. Is your experience similar
to that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Ed, as you know – this is Don. Again, as you know we have our export pricing contained in
contracts, and the contracts are confidential with producers. So we will not be able to discuss what the price levels of

those contracts will be.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: So you won't even comment on directionally if they are similar to, aggregated together relative to
that negative 2012 number?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Ed, we cannot because they are contained in confidential contracts.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Okay. On the domestic met side – on the domestic side, what are you seeing or expecting, and
how much of that business is contract, how much potentially comes up?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well. We were up 19% in the first quarter on domestic metallurgical coal and we're seeing
our domestic steel market continued to improve. It was up 7% in the quarter in terms of production and steel capacity,
manufacturing capacity, is now running at 80%. They still have room to move up. We have an automotive market that's
extremely good and the steel market is following that. So we see good opportunity in the domestic met market. I'll put
that in the context a little bit. Ed. In the first quarter, we were down essentially 700,000 tons of metallurgical coal going
into the export market. We were up 800,000 tons of coal going into the domestic metallurgical market. So...
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: But in terms of pricing, not volume, obviously the volume is good, but what do you see on the
pricing side and what percentage of that business reprices throughout this year?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We have most of that business priced for the year and we're pleased with the pricing levels.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Okay. Thanks for the time.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You bet.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from JPMorgan, please.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah, good afternoon. I wanted to ask you on export coal that I think there are some
recent data points that indicate maybe the market's improving a little bit on the met side, that pricing – I think $210 a
ton something like that – looked like it bottomed or popped up a little bit. So, as you look at your export met in second
quarter, do you think that that potentially improves and perhaps you can comment on what March looked like; I think
your January-February met export was down, but maybe can you tell us what March looked like?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The latter part of that question first, Tom, this is Don. Our January export numbers were
pretty close to our January 2011 numbers. We were down in February significantly, and then back up close to 2011
numbers in March. So, it was a choppy distribution of traffic.
To the first part of your question, we have seen in recent weeks the metallurgical coal price in the world market move
from $210, an increase of about $10 a ton, back up to about $220 on the high end of met coal coming out of Australia.
So that is encouraging. The second thing we're seeing in Australia is that during the latter part of March, we had heavy
rains, floods and labor disruptions, and we've seen some force majeure metallurgical coal for BHP and others coming
into the market. So we're not declaring that the market has turned, but those signals are positive for us.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. And on the utility side, you sound like you're, I guess, relatively optimistic given
that the environment is so difficult. Do you think that Utility year-over-year is going to get worse in second quarter or
you feel like it's kind of similar year-over-year decline to what you had in the first quarter? And then I mean it's tough
to look at the second half, but if you have a normal summer, you think things might actually improve in second half or
is that tough to figure out from this point?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Tom, first of all, let's talk about the comp. In the second quarter versus the first quarter, our
comp for utility coal for our network will be a little less demanding than it was in the first quarter. We handled 2
million tons more utility coal in the first quarter of 2011 than we did the second quarter, so the comp will not be quite
as high in the second quarter. So, that's favorable, but – by about 2 million tons favorable.

The shoulder months, however, with inventories being as high as they are at the utilities because of the mild winter, we
expect a very soft shoulder month period, with very little replenishment taking place, so the second quarter will be
impacted by that. If we see a normalized weather pattern going into the summer – in fact we're hoping for something
that's under the term hot and sweltery – if that were to be seen, we could see coal pick back up, and certainly the second
half of the year would be on a better track.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, great. I appreciate all the detail. Thanks, Don.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Thanks, Tom.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Troy from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Yes, thank you. Just a quick refresher, I don't think you have any thermal contracts or any major
thermal contracts coming up for negotiation this year. Is that correct?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Mark (sic) [Matt], this is Don. That's correct.
<Q - Matt Troy>: So, if I look at your negotiating strategy, obviously met gas is going to remain low for some time,
no matter whose model or forecast you look at, and stockpiles of 200 or 210 million tons are a record for this time of
year and we are going into the shoulder. Are you getting any change in pasturing from utility customers? Are they
looking forgiveness on take or pay or negotiated minimums? Are they pushing back on price? Just what does the
environment feel like when you talk to utilities that clearly don't want or need any more coal at this point in the year?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: This is Don. We are continuing to have discussion, as we always do, about supply chain
management of their requirements. We are not engaged in contract discussions.
<Q - Matt Troy>: All right, okay. And then, second question would be when we were there about a month or so ago,
we talked about the resource being – the network being adequately resourced from a head count perspective, able to
accommodate probably mid to high single digit volume growth; the numbers today bear that out.
Just curious: as we think about modeling for the rest of year, head count relatively flattish, incentive comp seems to be
a variable, hitting people this year to varying degrees. Your stock did exceptionally well last year, that may be a more
difficult comp later in the year. I was just wondering the moving parts of pieces on labor expense, what should we
expect in terms of wage inflation and any potential exchange and what incentive comp's doing in that labor line? Thank
you.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I think you've already heard from folks that if you look at those components,
health and welfare benefits moderate a little bit this year. Head count, we do feel that we've really gotten our work
force about back up to where it needs to be from a T&E standpoint and we'll still be hiring, but hiring more based on
attrition, so that's flattening out. The incentive comp, we just have to wait and see, it's still early in the year to
understand exactly what it'll do. Jim, your thoughts?
<A - James A. Squires>: Yeah, Matt. We would foresee continued favorability in incentive compensation, but not to a
material degree, so somewhat similar to what we saw this quarter so it knocks out to about $10 million in the quarter.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Okay. Thank you for the time.

<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much, good afternoon, everyone. Just a question: you've dealt with sort of the
pricing effect from your coal and I was wondering if you could look outside your coal market and look at general
pricing and sort of give us an indication of the impact that perhaps mix had outside of coal on your quarter. Was at
favorable or unfavorable and do you expect that mix effect not – again ex-coal going forward – to either continue in
that same trend or not?
<A - James A. Squires>: Walter, its Jim. Mix was unfavorable this quarter overall – not surprising given the growth
rates in the varying commodity groups, and that's been the trend for some time now. So, I see no reason to believe that
that won't continue to be a drag on overall yield as the year goes on.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Any order of magnitude on the – as it comps with your 5% RPU?
<A - James A. Squires>: It was about 2% negative.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: 2%, it's great. And I don't know if I missed it, but head count in terms of just wage inflation,
what are you modeling for this year just not on head count, but on your wage inflation?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We are in the 3% range, something like that, but all of the contracts have been
ratified, and that's giving us a lead on that number.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay, those are my questions. Thank you, very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the Jason Seidl from Dahlman Rose.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Good morning, excuse me good afternoon gentlemen. Quick question, in relation to the weather
in 1Q, obviously there is a little bit of an offset to the negative demand on coal in that your operational metrics will
look a lot stronger because of the decent weather conditions. Could you talk a little bit about, as we head into Q2 here,
and should we still see continued operational performance, but maybe just not along the same magnitude as Q1? Is that
how we should look at it?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah. This is Mark. We expect to continue to see the kind of velocity improvement that's
been ramping up and in fact, that really has been going on since November last year, we saw some pretty good velocity
year-over-year fourth quarter, and fortunately that's continued on through winter and now as we get into the second
quarter, we're seeing the same, where we've got velocity improvements that are pretty significantly better than last year,
even though we are out of the winter season.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I think we feel relatively confident, barring unforeseen events, that we have the assets
and people in place to continue to operate the network at metrics that we saw for the first quarter. There will always be
aberrations, but we think we are adequately staffed and we have good power and all of the systems in place to continue
a high level of network performance and customer service.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. My next question, guys, is on the intermodal side, obviously you lost a contract on the
international front. Could you talk a little bit about your domestic business – the outlook competing with trucks and
also in terms of where we are in the network, how much capacity you have left to grow that before you have to start to
adding some assets?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: This is Don. The domestic segment was a high growth segment again in the first quarter; it
was up 13%. The driver of that is Eastern local intermodal growth, which is highway diversion based, and we see a
very large pool of motor carrier traffic that's available for continued conversion.
As we open our new intermodal terminals this year, we'll be adding close to 750,000 additional lift capacity at those
terminals, so we have good capacity coming with the new terminals. We're handling the business that we have today
very effectively. So we're encouraged by that, we're optimistic about further growth.

With respect to the intermodal train network, it's notable when we look at the train capacity with the densification effort
and the stacking effort that we have underway, our train lengths in the first quarter only increased by about 50 feet per
intermodal train, and we handled 38,000 additional units of business in the first quarter. So less than 1% increase in
train length with a 5% increase in volume.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: And that's all the benefit from the double stacking?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Correct.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay, fantastic. Gentlemen, thank you for the time as always.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the Brandon Oglenski from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good afternoon, everyone. Maybe if I can just follow-up on that, Don. So
what are some of the impediments today that keep you from double stacking more of the domestic container traffic?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well the impediment to this point has been the availability of 53 foot well cars, having them
at the right place, having sufficient containers in the pool to completely move our domestic freight in containers for
stacking. When we talk about our domestic freight, by the way, I'm not talking about our premium segment which is
UPS and FedEx; they move predominantly in trailers. We're talking about our domestic market that is highway
conversions for Hunt, Hub and others, and we're now 93% of that market is moving in containers. So as we've
increased the container pool, increased the 53 foot well car pool, as well as focused on getting the right car at the ramp
at the right time, and getting the right box on those cars, those metrics are moving in the right direction.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Okay. But there is no structural impediments, like clearances or tunnel heights that
you have get across right now?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We're 97% cleared for double stack across our entire network.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Okay. And then just one last one on coal if you don't mind. For the domestic utility
contract I know you said that there is not any that you're going to be repricing this year, but obviously there's step in, or
built in escalation on a lot of those contracts. Do any of them mimic what we're seeing right now with RCAF ex-fuel,
or should we be thinking differently from that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: RCAF as a percentage of our book of coal has become de minimis.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Even the ex-fuel, like core inflation?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Correct, we're not using RCAF to any great degree now on coal contracts.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Hey, great. Good afternoon and solid job on the results. If I can just take on the intermodal
for a second, can you talk about the scaling of these yards as they come on the four yards that you're launching. Is that
all a fourth quarter event? Are we going to see the benefits come on through the rest of the year? Can you kind of just
walk us through the time and the magnitude of that growth?

<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Of the four, Ken, we have already turned on our operation at Mechanicville, New
York for our joint venture with Pan Am. That's been a significant improvement for us because we can now stack all the
way out of Chicago into Mechanicville and only are now restricted into air. That's online. We are optimistic that we're
going to get the new terminal at Memphis up and running to – maybe to a limited degree initially, but up and running
hopefully sometime mid-late summer and then the last two terminals in Rossville – Memphis, Birmingham, and our
terminal at Greencastle, are a order of magnitude all the same in terms of capacity. Birmingham and Greencastle,
Pennsylvania, are fourth quarter completions.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: And, is this an event where you see the growth once it's live, or is there anything
incremental that you work around that as – does it all start on day one when you launch?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: If you look at our existing terminals in that part of the world, we are largely operating
at capacity today. We expect when the new terminals are open that there's a lot of business that will move and it will
ramp up very quickly, but we're not going to see much more incremental growth in those lanes prior to the opening of
those terminals.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: I appreciate that. And then just switching subjects for my follow up on agriculture, is this –
are we – what you do see, I guess Don, in terms of starting to overlap these negative comparisons? Are you starting to
see the planting season go your way? Can you kind of get any early read on how things are trending there?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yes, Ken, the comp that we faced in ag was a phosphate rocks move in Florida, and we did
clear that negative comp March 1. Now, with respect to the crop, we expect a very, very solid corn crop planting. The
season is already off to a pretty good start, weather wise, and if we get the proper amount of rainfall and the type of
growing season that we would normally expect, it's going to be a very large crop. And as you know, the soybean crop
and the corn crop in South America was substandard this past season, so we should see an export market from the U.S.
on the horizon that should be much stronger than the export market that we saw this past year.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Wonderful. Thanks for the insight.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you, Ken.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi, there. Good afternoon. I know your outlook longer-term on the coal business is pretty good,
but if things sort of struggle for a bit here, how quickly can you move resources around the network? Are there friction
costs we need to be thinking about, or is it pretty seamless that you can move to where there's growth?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No, the resources that we employ in that business in terms of primarily locomotives,
obviously can be moved very quickly. In terms of the people, we've managed through that; obviously those are folks
that we can move temporarily if we get short somewhere else, but don't usually do that. And the balance is just coal
cars, which we don't deploy in any other business, so there's really not much in what I would describe as frictional cost.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. And if we had to make a decision sort of longer term about the coal franchise, is there a
lot of CapEx that's tied up in that in each year's plan that you could sort of pull out if you decide, this is going to be sort
of three quarters of the size that once was? How much flexibility you have there?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We actually have a fair amount of flexibility. As you know, Bill, we have been
working on for a few years now, and continue to work on the replacement of our coal car fleet, which is life expiring,
essentially over, and we'll continue to do so over the next five, six, seven years. We can throttle that program up and
down; we can certainly curtail it if we feel that we need a smaller car fleet than we currently have today. So we do have
flexibility in terms of that primary asset, our coal cars, over the next few years to really manage the size of the fleet to
where our business is going to go.

<Q - Bill J. Greene>: All right, that makes sense. And then, Wick, last question is just on the regulatory angle. Last
year the STB looked at various commodities and talked about should they all be exempt and what's sort of the thought
process here. Is there ever a case to make here that because of the fact that natural gas is so competitive now, that
maybe coal regulations need to be revisited, that maybe there is not as much of a reason to be as aggressive there?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, that's a very interesting argument which I'm now going to think through and try
to progress, but it's never been suggested in front of the board that there is a case to be made to do that.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: But that's happened for other commodities, no?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Was anything exempted post the original exemptions that were published?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well this is, Don. The STB in the 1980s after Staggers had product and geographic
competition, right, as two of the tests for regulation of commodities and exemptions. So, I guess if gas continued to be
below $2, we could certainly argue that we're seeing very, very robust competition from a product side as well as
geographic.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Right. The board has, as you say, reexamined exemptions last year has made no
changes but I think Don is exactly right on the criteria. I don't recall them ever modifying, in any significant way, the
exemptions since they were first established.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah, it's probably just pie in the sky, but it was just something I was thinking about. All right.
Thank you for the time.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Keep thinking, Bill.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Gallo from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Thank you. Congratulations. If you're not careful, we're going to start to think that coal
wasn't that good of a business after all. Two questions, both around shale. You mentioned records within metals and
construction. If you stripped out the metals piece of that what did the construction look like, and obviously my angle is
what's going on with frac sand?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We had a very solid quarter in the first quarter with frac sand and related materials going into
Marcellus for the drilling operation.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: And then, I'm sorry, go ahead.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Go ahead.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: I was just going to say as a follow-up, can you give us a little detail behind that? I believe it's
Wisconsin sand, but destination, length of haul and maybe what the competition looks like? I know truck and barge
does very little up in that area; it's mainly other regional railroads although CSX does some. Just a little color around
the competition?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We're handling a lot of Illinois and Wisconsin originated sand that comes to us over the
Chicago Gateway. So, it's an attractive length of haul from Chicago back into the drilling region of Pennsylvania and
associated areas. So the competition – obviously there is some truck competition, but we have a very favorable position
with respect to those bulk commodities hauling at that length of haul, and we expect that volume to continue to grow,
not only in the frac sand, but drilling pipe, drilling pads, as well as the potential for handling waste water.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: And, then do the Canadian rails play up there as well to some degree?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Nesvold from Jefferies & Co.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Good afternoon. Most of my questions in the quarter have been answered. Are you able to
tell us what percent of your revenue for this year has been contracted as of the end of 1Q and what percent of the
revenue by the end of 2Q will have been contracted?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: This is Don. With respect to the end of the first quarter, 75% of our book for the year that has
been contracted. I will wait on the answer to the second part because we want to see that we've got all the negotiations
done before I declare them done in the second quarter.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, the industry railcar data came out yesterday and I
think one thing that was bit of a surprise is that steel coal cars were actually pretty good, which was a little bit of
surprise, given what's happening obviously in coal right now. How do you – I know you talked a little bit about this
earlier your flexibility to redeploy capital if coal as a franchise goes into secular decline. In the nearer term, in the next,
two to four quarters, how do you think about deploying capital into that business? I mean do you hold off on ordering
additional cars until you kind of see where volumes are going, or is it just no change to the base case CapEx scenario
for now?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: In terms of thinking about replenishing our coal car fleet, we look at a couple of
things. One is what is the fallout rate of the existing fleet, and then obviously over the longer term, what's the total
number of the fleet that we – coal cars that we require in the fleet for the business. We have a lot of ability to flex over
the next few years. In the shorter term, we have made some contractual commitments and we are also looking at our
fallout rate and we are ordering accordingly. So every year is a new year: we'll take a hard look at it again next year and
see what we need to order.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey, good afternoon. I just wanted to get a sense for where we are with respect to
automotive volumes on two fronts, first, what you're hearing from customers in terms of how much pent-up demand
remains to be filled, and then on the second side, if you are also hearing that there is additional site relocation closer
into the North American market for new vehicle production?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: David, this is Don. With respect to the first part of the question, our dialogue with our
automotive customers is a very positive dialogue. We are seeing annual production look closer to 15 million units on
the run rate that we are on right now. Certainly, our first quarter volumes being up 23%, and that market reflects that
demand. The average age of a vehicle on the U.S. highway today is 10.5 years old. So, there is still room to run with
respect to replenishing that older fleet. So, what we're hearing from our customers is pretty positive.

With the second part of your question, we continued to have dialogue with manufacturers that are looking at possible
expansion into the U.S. market for automotive production. We're seeing that in a positive way across manufacturing in
general, as we see some of the reshoring activity that's taking place, as Asian production continues – that cost of
production in Asia continues to get higher, the U.S. and Mexico are looking much more favorable to new plant
locations for manufacturing in general.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Any specifics up in the automotive side that's on the planning calendar so far?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, we couldn't comment with respect to any of the manufacturers that might be looking for
plant sites, since that's very confidential information.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right, great. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up for Jim what was the fuel
surcharge revenue in the quarter?
<A - James A. Squires>: David, the fuel surcharge revenue was $325 million versus $249 million in the first quarter
of 2011, a $76 million increase.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman from Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Sal Vitale>: Good afternoon. Sal Vitale on for Jeff Kauffman. Just a quick question on the coal side: can you
provide the breakdown of the utility coal tonnage between north and south?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It generally runs about 50-50, with respect to the split, in terms of the overall volume. Of
course this past quarter we had one down 24%, the Southern utility and the North was down 11%. So it moves
quarter-to-quarter based on that mix, but generally on average, 50-50.
<Q - Sal Vitale>: Okay and then I'm just trying to get a sense for the difference in revenue per car between met coal
and utility coal, that is, if some similar length of haul profile. So if we assume, say, a 300 mile length of haul as a point
of reference, what would be the approximate difference in the revenue per car?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: In fact you can look at the slide that we presented on relative mileages and revenue per
revenue ton mile would track somewhat those relative differences in mileage.
<Q - Sal Vitale>: Right, so if I'm looking at the right slide here, Utility North is roughly half of Utility South; so you're
saying that's a good starting point?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yes we've said in the past our Utility South business is about third higher revenue per unit
than our Northern utility.
<Q - Sal Vitale>: All right, okay. Thank you. Just one other question on the fuel surcharge, has there been any increase
in coverage on the surcharge side? So you said the $76 million was the absolute dollar increase? I was just trying to get
a sense for how much of that is attributable to higher coverage?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Effectively zero, we have a very good coverage in it, the number is not changing.
<Q - Sal Vitale>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. At this time we have no further questions I'd like to turn the call back over to Wick Moorman for any
closing comments.
