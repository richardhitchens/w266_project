As summarized on chart one, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter 2012 net earnings of $84 million or $0.16 per
diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Earnings for the second quarter include after-tax gain of $37 million from
special items. These items are detailed in Chart 2, a GAAP reconciliation of earnings before special items. A gain of
$33 million or $0.06 per share for post-retirement plan amendment. No further gains are anticipated from these benefit

changes, which were effective June 30, and a gain of $4 million or $0.01 per share through the sale of properties.
Excluding special items, the company reported net earnings of $47 million or $0.09 per diluted share.
To provide a better understanding of business operating results, during the second quarter, we began reporting the
elimination of interest segment profit on inventory and the LIFO reserve as part of unallocated items. Previously these
amounts were reported in the business segments. For consistency, segment contributions to pre-tax earnings for first
quarter 2012, as well as prior period has been adjusted to reclassify these amounts as part of unallocated items. These
adjustments are detailed on Chart 14. There is no change to Weyerhaeuser's consolidated net earnings for first quarter
2012 or prior years.
Next turning to our business segments; my comments reviewing the second quarter of 2012 refer to changes from the
first quarter of 2012 for all segments. Beginning with Timberlands, Charts 3 and 4. Timberlands contributed $77
million to pre-tax earnings, $7 million more than in Q1. Fee Harvest volume seasonally increased in the West and
South. In the West, log prices declined nearly $5 per cubic meter as domestic volume comprised a higher proportion of
sales. Domestic log demand was strong. Third-party volumes increased 19% and domestic log prices rose 2%.
Japanese log volumes increased, Japanese log prices were slightly lower. The log export mix shifted towards China
where volumes were higher and prices lower. Southern sales volumes increased and log prices rose 2%. Logging costs
were higher in the West due to more cable logging on steep terrain and silviculture costs were lower in the South.
Wood Products, Charts 5 and 6. Wood Products contributed $36 million to pre-tax earnings, $49 million more than in
Q1. The second quarter included a pre-tax gain of $6 million on a property sale. Lumber price realization increased $39
per thousand board feet or 13%. Lumber volumes also increased 13%. OSB price realizations rose $17 per thousand
square feet or 9%; OSB volumes were 14% higher in Q2.
Engineered Wood products declined 6% for TJI's and 2% for Solid Sections. TJI volumes rose 25% from a very low
level and Solid Section increased 9%, also from a low level. Log costs slightly increased from Q1 and other
manufacturing costs were flat.
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 7 and 8. The pre-tax contribution from Cellulose Fibers was $36 million, $12 million less than
in Q1. Average pulp price realizations were flat in the quarter due to mix. There were 27 days of maintenance
downtime in Q2. Manufacturing issues and the timing of shipments reduced pulp sales volumes 5%. Downtime
increased costs and reduced productivity.
Real Estate, Charts 9 and 10. The pre-tax contribution to earnings from Real Estate before special items was $15
million, $23 million more than in Q1. Single family home closings seasonally increased 46% to 508 homes in Q2 from
349 homes in Q1. Home closings increased 11% from the same quarter last year. Gross margins increased to nearly
20% in Q2 from 17% in Q1. The average home closing price was $374,000, nearly flat with Q1. The closing price
declined 4% from the same quarter last year due to mix.
Unallocated Items, Chart 11. The foreign exchange loss was $8 million in Q2 due to a weaker Canadian dollar. This
was a $14 million swing from Q1. As discussed earlier, the elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory and LIFO,
formerly reported at the segment level, is now recorded in unallocated items.
Now, I will turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. On this cal, I will provide you with a
perspective of our quarterly results. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance during the quarter. All of our
businesses were profitable. Importantly, business improvement initiatives within our Wood Products segment are
yielding clear results above and beyond those realized from an improving housing market.
Our aggressive actions to improve performance are beginning to show the strength of our businesses and to position us
to capture the full benefit of the market recovery as it unfolds. Our work is not yet done and we will continue to focus

on improving our performance to capture the full value of our businesses.
As you know, U.S. housing is very important to us as it affects three of our four businesses; Timberlands, Wood
Products and Real Estate, which I will be referring to WRECO. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter last year,
we've been experiencing a gradual improvement in the housing market that extended through the spring selling season
this year and is continuing into the third quarter. Last quarter, we reported a 30% increase in our WRECO sales
year-over-year. Our momentum continued to build through the second quarter and at the end of the quarter,
year-to-date WRECO sales are up 38%.
During our first quarter call, I noted that we had not yet seen a significant effect on our wood products sales due to the
time lag between new home sales and starts. Now, it's clear that sales by WRECO and other builders earlier in the year
together with improved sales activity in the second quarter are resulting in increased starts across the country, boosting
demand for Wood Products. Improved demand for Wood Products is in turn increasing domestic demand for logs from
our Timberlands. Housing construction is on a path to return to long-term trend levels necessary to meet the needs of a
growing population and household formation, although we are well aware that the recovery is still somewhat fragile.
Now I'll comment on the performance in each of our businesses in the second quarter. In Timberlands, our earnings
improved 10% over the prior quarter. Harvest levels were up 5% overall, somewhat more in the West than the South.
Third party sales volumes increased for both domestic and export customers. Third-party domestic sales volume
increased 16% as a result of increased demand related to housing activity as well as seasonal pick-up in the West.
Export volume grew a healthy 6% during the quarter with a shift in mix among our three primary markets, Japan,
China, and Korea. Japan continues to be by far our largest and most stable Asian market, representing over 75% of our
export volume during the quarter. Log sales volume in Japan increased 5% to meet demand driven by increased
Japanese housing starts. Log shipments to China had slowed in the latter part of 2011 and early 2012 after significant
increases in 2010 and early 2011. We were not expecting much recovery from China until the latter part of this year,
but we were able to capture better than expected demand during the quarter, leading to a 44% increase
quarter-over-quarter. Though a much smaller percentage of our export activity, this increase in volume to China helped
to raise total export volume and offset a decline in Korea shipments.
In Wood Products, we had a strong quarter as a result of improved market conditions and our improvement initiatives.
This was our best quarter since 2006.2. EBITDA was $63 million for the quarter, up $80 million compared to last year.
Sales volumes for all products increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Production rates increased across all
product lines in response to increased demand allowing us to capture production efficiencies. The good news for our
Wood Products business is that there was a spring this year, as buyers returned to the housing market and builders
followed through by increasing housing starts. Our improvement during the quarter was of course helped by increased
housing activity, but we are also seeing the payoff of improvement initiatives across our business. These initiatives
have resulted in increased revenue from new products and new markets and reductions in cost of production and
operations.
Year-to-date, earnings in this segment have improved $103 million from last year, more than half of which is
attributable to our business improvement efforts. While we still have more work ahead of us to improve our
competitiveness, we've made great progress and we are better positioned than ever to profit from improving market
conditions that will come with the housing recovery
Shifting to WRECO, we had a solid quarter with earnings from land sales and single-family operations. Though our
overall community count is down slightly from one year ago, year-to-date closings are up 4% and sales are up 38%.
Our backlog is up 53%, which will lead to a continuing increase in closings in the third and fourth quarters.
Further signs of market stabilization are a 39% decline in our unsold inventory from one year ago and a firming of
house – home prices across most of our markets. Prices for new sales in June were 5% higher than one year ago.
I know that you like to have a bit of color on what's happening in our markets, so here are some highlights of our sales
activity during the first half of the year. Southern California, Las Vegas and Arizona were some of the markets hardest
hit during the housing recession and each are beginning to rebound.

Our sales have more than doubled in Arizona. In Las Vegas, our sales are up over 60% and in Southern California sales
were up nearly 20%. In the Seattle area, sales are up over 40%. Houston has been a steady market for us throughout the
housing recession and sales there are up nearly 20%. And in the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC,
sales are up over 20% and we're underway with our first project in nearby Richmond, Virginia. Based on our own
WRECO experience, our message is that the housing market conditions continue to improve as fundamentals stabilize
and confidence begins to build.
My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fibers business. Demand for our Cellulose Fibers products held
steady during the quarter. Planned maintenance and some unanticipated operational issues, which are now resolved, led
to lower production levels during the quarter. With the exception of these one-time operational issues in this quarter,
this business has been operating extraordinarily well. We continue to make progress during our planned shutdowns to
make changes that will allow us to transition to an 18-month maintenance cycle.
During the quarter, we received regulatory approval at our Longview Mill to move to an 18-month cycle.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss third quarter outlook as well as our financial highlights.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. We anticipate continued improvement in our overall operating results in
the third quarter as compared to the second. The comments regarding the outlook for the third quarter are summarized
on chart 12, and I'll begin my remarks with Timberlands.
In the West, export realizations are expected to be slightly lower. Export prices and volumes to China are expected to
increase, which will result in a heavier mix to China, which lowers the overall export realization. Log exports to Japan
remain strong, but continued to be affected by the weak euro, which underpins the competition from European
laminated lumber.
Western domestic log prices are anticipated to weaken in the third quarter compared to the second as more seasonal
volume is marketed by smaller private land owners. Costs for road maintenance are expected to be seasonally higher,
but will be partially offset by lower fuel costs. In the South, realizations for logs are likely to be somewhat lower with a
heavier mix to Pulp wood. Fee harvest volumes should increase seasonally, although the increased income will be
offset by higher silviculture spending. Minerals revenue will be slightly higher. Non-strategic land sales are expected to
increase. Overall, third quarter Timberlands income is expected to be comparable to the second quarter results.
In our Wood Products segment, we expect third quarter sales volumes to be flat to slightly down compared to the
second quarter. Sales realizations may soften seasonally especially for lumber, although overall channel inventories
remain thinly stocked. Log costs are projected to increase in Canada, be flat in the South, and lower in the West.
We expect the Wood Products segment to be solidly profitable in the third quarter, although earnings may not be as
strong as second quarter results. As Dan mentioned, our business improvement initiatives have resulted in much
stronger performance. We continue to focus on driving improvements in our operating results in addition to taking
advantage of the market recovery.
In Cellulose Fibers, pulp prices are expected to experience downward pressure as the weak euro and the uncertain
international economic environment persists. We expect pulp sale volumes to increase, offsetting the effect of weaker
prices. Pulp production is forecasted to increase if there is only one maintenance outage in Q3 versus two in the second
quarter and reliability is expected to improve. As a result, maintenance cost is also expected to be lower.
Cost for chemicals, energy and fiber are all expected to decrease, although freight is expected to increase slightly.
Overall results in our Cellulose Fibers segment should be substantially higher in the third quarter compared to the
second. In our Real Estate segment, single family home closings are expected to improve by over 25% from 508
closings in the second quarter to approximately 640 closings. The higher closings reflect seasonal increases as well as
the stronger home sales from earlier in the year, which are now making their way into home closings. Average prices

are expected to decline slightly due to mix while gross margins are expected to approximate 20%. Selling costs will
likely increase due to higher closing volume.
Earnings from single-family operations are anticipated to increase in the third quarter as compared to the second
quarter. Earnings in the second quarter included $12 million from land and lot sales. It's possible that the third quarter
could also include some land sales, but the amount and timing is difficult to forecast.
Now, I will wrap up with some overall financial comments. We ended the quarter with cash of $861 million, an
increase of $133 million since the end of the first quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter totaled $75
million. This brings to the total for the first six months of this year to $139 million including reforestation. Major
capital projects include a pulp converting facility in Poland, replacing evaporators at our pulp mill in Grande Prairie,
Alberta, Canada and a fiber line upgrade at our Columbus, Mississippi pulp mill. We still expect total capital
expenditures for the year to approximate $290 million.
During the third quarter, we expect to spend approximately $180 million for debt maturities and approximately $110
million for interest which includes semiannual payments. This can be seen from Chart 13. Our debt maturities for the
next five years total approximately $600 million, well below our current cash balance. In addition, we have a $1 billion
line of credit with no borrowings outstanding.
In summary, we have very strong liquidity, improved operating performance and a strengthening housing market all of
which should enhance future cash flows.
With that, I will turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Patty. The housing recovery looks and feels real. We've continued to make improvements across all of our
businesses and I'm encouraged but not satisfied by the progress we've made. We are focusing on what we can control,
improving our operating performance and our relative competitiveness. We are well positioned to take full advantage
of the long-term economic recovery that lies in front of us.
And now, we welcome your questions and your comments. Kathy?

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning, Gail.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Just a couple of quick questions and one maybe a little more strategic. Was there – can you
quantify any land sale and mineral income that you saw in the second quarter in Timberlands?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: With respect to minerals income, minerals income were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter,
Gail. What we saw was a decline in income from our gas properties and some of our hard mineral properties offset by

increases in revenues from oil shale activity in the Tuscaloosa Basin where we have property. With respect to
dispositions, dispositions were on a quarter-over-quarter basis relatively flat.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And just strategically thinking about it, last year I know you talked about seeing a
material change in your homebuilding business with the talk around the fiscal debt ceiling debate and I'm just
wondering, is your sense this year with the fiscal cliff to be kind of looming that the market would be more resilient, as
that rhetoric kind of ramped up or do you have fear or worries from the trends that you are seeing that we could repeat
what happened last year?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, last year we did see a setback in market confidence surrounding the debate about raising
the debt limit, and it had a real impact on consumer confidence and housing sales. This year, there has been a lot of
discussion, just – I think last week, Fed Chairman Bernanke was in front of Congress, talking about those very same
issues. At year-end, we have an expiration of the Bush era tax cuts. We have the Congressionally-imposed
sequestration process that will take over at the beginning of the year if nothing is done and then we have a longer-term
challenge around fiscal policy.
So, we are concerned and that was fundamentally the message that Bernanke had to Congress. We risk an upset in the
economy if we're not able to deal with those issues. The good news for us this year is that the housing market seems to
be shaking off that concern at this point in time. Given the numbers that we reported this morning and the
year-over-year activity, we're encouraged, but I think we still have a confidence issue to deal with among home buyers
and the general public because it not only affects homes sales, it affects retail sales and overall employment.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And just maybe one last one on China. I'm surprised to hear that you're kind of
ramping up your volumes given what we've heard from some others. Someone suggested yesterday that perhaps
inventories were starting to build up in China again; can you just give a little bit of color there?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Our experience has been that inventories were building late last year and early this year,
which is when we saw a significant fall off in volume as well as some pull back in price, and as I mentioned in my
remarks, we had been assuming that we would see a pickup come back in the latter part of the year and in fact, we're
encouraged to see the opportunity to increase our export activity more towards the end of the second quarter. So, we've
been developing strong relationships in China. The customers appreciate the quality of the logs that we're shipping and
the dependability of our entire logistical chain and we expect that that activity will increase over time.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Anthony.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: A couple questions on Timberlands. The first is Southern saw log prices have obviously
been depressed for a number of years, and with the strength that we've seen in lumber and housing starts picking up, are
you seeing any of that strength kind of flow back to the stump and what is the kind of lag that you would expect
between strength in lumber and strength in saw logs?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, it ultimately does flow back. In the South, in particular, we are more dependent on
domestic demand as compared to our position in the West where we have export markets. We have had some recovery
in pricing, as Patty mentioned in her remarks as we go forward to the third quarter, we see average realization decline,
but that is more of a mix issue as we expect to be selling more pulp wood. In general, in the South, you want to look at
U.S. housing recovery and that's what's going to translate into timber values.

<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. And then in the West, you referenced lower expected export log realizations in 3Q,
and is that purely a mix issue as well or apples-to-apples, are you seeing some deterioration of export prices into July?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Really, Anthony, that's more of a mix issue. So, we will have more volume as a percentage
going into China. Our Japan volumes continue to be very strong. Japan has an uptick in their housing starts this year
based upon the very low mortgage rates that they have, but also some concern about consumption tax increases a
couple of years out. So, as well as the rebuilding from the tsunami which we haven't seen a lot of yet, but appears to
maybe starting to make its way in. So, it really is more from a realization perspective the fact that there is more mix
going into China on a relative basis, but all of those volumes are still pretty strong.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. And maybe just one last quick one, in Engineered Wood that you saw volumes rising
sequentially, but it looks like prices kind of fell a little bit sequentially and I'm wondering if you could just talk a little
bit about what you are seeing in solid section and TJI's and if you are seeing any kind of pickup in that business? Thank
you.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We have seen a pickup in volume as housing starts begin to recover. As we've explained in
the past, our Engineered Wood relies more heavily on new construction as compared to our OSB business and our
Lumber business, which has a much broader mix of markets. And so the volume pickup is – we would believe is
related to the early stages of housing recovery. With respect to price, there is still – there are lower operating rates in
that industry than in Lumber and OSB. It's a competitive marketplace and we are seeing some signs of some pickup in
pricing as we move into the third quarter.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks, hi, everyone. Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Morning, George.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Morning, George.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: How are you doing? I just wanted to maybe pick up on Anthony's question. In terms of
operating rates within your other Wood Products business, could you comment at all in terms of where you stand and
are there any areas that are still troubling to you, ex-EWP which you already covered?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: During the second quarter, our operating rates for Lumber business were in the high 80%
range, up quarter-over-quarter from the first quarter. Our OSB business is operating in roughly the low 80%s, George.
Engineered Wood business overall, still less than 50% if we include a couple of facilities which have been indefinitely
curtailed; as we look at the operations that we are manufacturing in today, we'd be in the 50% range. So, we got a lot of
room to flex up. I'm not concerned about our ability to respond to increased demand because we do have the ability to,
especially in Lumber, add some shifts and we have been pleased with the uptick in productivity.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Dan, I'm not sure that we would be able to actually model it, but just to understand, if we
continue to see progress in obviously the housing markets and therefore the product markets for you, holding price
constant, should we see the same level of incremental profitability with that improvement in volume and utilization
rates and Wood and OSB? Or in theory, might you see actually an incrementally higher rate of profit dollars as demand
comes in and why or why not?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We have a lot of cost inputs, George.

<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: And so, it is a function of not just log costs, but also energy costs, chemicals, but as we
increase volume, we do enjoy operating efficiencies and so, we fundamentally have covered fixed costs. We need to
cover variable, but there should be a corresponding uptick in margin assuming that input costs are held constant.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: So, what I'm hearing from you is basically holding those constant, your incrementals will
stay basically at the same rate as long as volume keeps moving up. I guess the last couple of questions I had for you,
one, why are you seeing a mix towards pulpwood in the South since we are seeing an improvement in housing, since
hopefully that would be driving higher saw log prices -- or demand I should say. And then to Cellulose Fibers, would it
be possible to parse out what the, if you will, exceptional factors were in the second quarter that hopefully don't recur in
the third quarter, what the profit dollars associated with that – those items were? Thanks.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, George, I'll take those. I think from the standpoint of a little more mix of pulpwood
in the South, we have our thinning that goes on as well, so I don't think that it's any type of big change driven by
pricing in those two but more just the silvicultural regime of a little more thinning volume. In terms of pulp, to help you
a little bit of getting from the first quarter to the second quarter or from the second quarter to the third, as I said in my
remarks, we have just one outage in the third quarter compared to two and we had about 27 days of downtime in the
second quarter.
So, let's just say we have half of that, so about $14 million and as I've said in the past, maintenance expense runs for
just the maintenance cost itself about $1 million a day. So, we should have $14 million left in just maintenance cost.
And in the second quarter, we also finished up a couple of things from the first quarter shut. So, maybe maintenance
cost itself is around $14 million, $15 million less quarter-over-quarter, then we also have the increased productivity as a
result of producing more pulp which is similar in amount. And then as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll also have a
little lower chemical and fiber costs. So all in all, I would expect that profits in the third quarter should be roughly
twice what they were in the second quarter.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. Patty, thank you. I will turn it over.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thanks. Two things, Patty, you didn't sound as optimistic about land sales next quarter as I
might have expected. Are you seeing a meaningful pickup in conversations with builders who are short land as we
talked about a year ago and I'm just curious how that opportunity looks to you now versus a year ago?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, Mark, we do continue to have land sales that we do market. It really was more a
function of not optimism about it but the ability to really tell you what the amount and timing of those will be. So, we
are still in the market with, as you know, we have a longer pipeline than most of the other builders. So, it wasn't a
comment about optimism; it was really more a comment about the forecast of timing and the amount of those.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay. And one more question, just on fluff pulp, are you still selling primarily to the same
customers? I am trying to get a sense whether the new capacity that's coming is just lowering prices or whether there is
also a customer reshuffle going on as well that's going to impact you?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Mark, we've not had any significant change in the customers. In fact, the customers that we
work with rely on us; they need our product and we are part of their growth plans, not just in the U.S. but also in the
global market. So, we have not experienced any significant shift in customers.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Hi, Chip. Good morning.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: First question is for Patty, are there going to be any changes that you anticipate next year and
maybe you can give us some magnitude in your pension funding based on the Highway Bill provision?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Chip. As you referenced, Congress did pass an amendment along with the Highway
Bill in June, which basically changed the way that the discount rate was computed for purposes of determining
minimum pension contribution funding. So, we had disclosed that we would have about a $60 million contribution due
no later than the middle of September 2013 for our U.S. qualified plan and based upon the legislation, we don't believe
that that contribution will be needed.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Got you. And then on a separate note, I'm having a little trouble, maybe I just missed something
that's different about you guys, but I'm having trouble seeing the doubling of income in pulp. All the numbers you gave
add up, but we left out price and we have been seeing an unusual situation where soft wood has been, if you will, softer
than hardwood prices and so, I didn't know how that came into the mix?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Chip, what we've got going from the second quarter to third quarter is, as Patty mentioned,
lower maintenance, more uptime because we don't have the same number of scheduled maintenance shutdowns. We
also encountered, as we noted, some operational issues during the second quarter that impacted our volume by about
5%. Those were one-time issues. They have been resolved and so, as we look forward into the – going from second to
third quarter, we recover that 5% volume plus we add volume that we lost during the second quarter related to our
annual shutdowns.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: We also had a little more in-transit inventory at the end of the second quarter for pulp on
the water that didn't close out in the second quarter that will come into the third quarter. So, the weaker pricing
basically just gets offset by the increased volume in terms of that's why you don't see that adding up in the numbers.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Got you. Thank you very much.

<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Good morning everybody.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: So, first of all on Wood Products, clearly a very solid quarter there, but just looking at your price
realizations, if my numbers are right, I think you sold lumber for $58 more per 1,000 board feet relative to last quarter,
would imply that just from the lumber pricing, you should have seen that type of pickup in the EBIT? And is there
anything going on on the cost line in that Wood Products business that held back the pricing leverage that I think you
should have seen in the second quarter?

<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: No, there is nothing significant there. We had a slight uptick in log costs during the quarter,
but not significant, manufacturing costs quarter-over-quarter were about the same. So, the increase that comes through
in Wood Products generally is a combination of all of our products.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Okay. Is any of the log cost linked to the lumber price in the Wood Products business?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: No, no, we don't have a tying arrangement or indexing. The logs that are purchased by our
Wood Products business are purchased at market prices from internal sources or external sources and so there is no
indexing. Some of our competitors have started to move to that. We are not doing that.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Okay, that's helpful.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Alex, as you think about the leverage, we did see significant leverage in the Lumber
business as well as the OSB business. So, in terms of getting those numbers through in the second quarter, those
certainly came through. We did not see the same kind of improvement in Engineered Wood and our Distribution
business, so that's probably the piece that you are missing.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Okay, that's helpful, Patty. And then just the commentary around seasonally lower profitability,
certainly makes a lot of sense in the context of lumber prices always seasonally softening in the third into the fourth
quarter, but if we were to hold the lumber price constant where it is today, how should we be thinking about the
profitability level in Wood Products in the third quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: I would say that if prices stay constant that you would see because volumes we're saying
are flat to maybe slightly down a little bit. We took a little bit of downtime in the Southern lumber system, Fourth of
July holiday, but I would say that results would be similar to the second quarter.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Okay. Thank you, Patty. And then just last question -
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: And we hope that's the case, Alex.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Yes, same here. And just on WRECO, a number of the homebuilders have been taking reversal to
tax valuation allowance, that have been established through the very deep recession in housing. Can you just remind us
how much of the book value in real estate was written down through the downturn, and whether there is an opportunity
for you to be able to do that as well?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We do not have the same situation as the public homebuilders because that fundamentally is
their only business and we file a consolidated return and so we didn't have the same tax effect that they would have
had.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Okay. Thanks, Dan.

<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning, Mark.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: The first question I had – looks like there was about $100 million worth of land and lot
sales in the second quarter. Is it possible to get some sense of where and why on that?

<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The land and lot sales during the quarter were primarily related – this is a WRECO question, I
assume.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Yes, it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: So, that was the sale of Cross Creek Ranch, which we actually talked about on the last call,
but the closing took place in the second quarter. So, that was a master plan community that we had developed in
Houston. We sold that property and so that's what was going through the WRECO books. We booked income on that.
As part of that transaction, what we did is we actually – the benefit of that was not only bringing cash back to our
balance sheet so that we could redeploy it elsewhere, but we capitalized on the value that we had created and also
established a relationship with the buyer where we have the opportunity to buy lots from that same buyer, not just in
Cross Creek in the future, but also other properties.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay, all right, that's helpful. Second question, Patty, the tax rate in the quarter was a
little bit higher than we would have expected, especially if you back out the Timberland earnings. Can you give us a
little more color on that?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah. As you really think about the tax rate, Mark, probably the easiest way to get there
and the way that we compute the rate is as you mentioned on our REIT Timberland earnings, we won't pay any tax and
so, we look at the tax rate for our TRS earnings, in this case, year-to-date, it's a TRS loss. So, if you take our
year-to-date earnings which are on Chart 1 of the package, so you have and exclude the special items, you've got about,
pre-tax earnings about $200 million and back out the interest expense which is around $170 million.
So, you end up then with a TRS loss of $115 million, give or take, and then if you back out all the tax on the special
items and those are also delineated separately for you on Chart 2, you will get to a tax rate for the quarter on that,
year-to-date on that computation of a little over 20% and our year-to-date effective rate or effective rate for the TRS for
2012 is just under 23%. So that will get you pretty close in the ballpark. So, I don't know how you did your
computation, but those would, if you take that, back out the Timberlands earnings, back out the special items, and the
tax effect of the special items, you will get the adjust – almost that 20%.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay, all right. And then the one other question, Dan, I noticed on the announcement
around the Forest Capital sale a couple of weeks ago, that they specifically pulled out about a quarter million acres of
gas and oil rights down in Louisiana. And I know that you've got, like, over a million acres in Louisiana as well as
about 600,000 or 700,000 acres up in Arkansas and some more over in Texas. Have you guys looked carefully at what
you think the potential value of mineral rights across the South is? Because I think all of your land pretty much has
mineral rights?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: All of our land – I mean, I can't say 100% we have mineral rights on every single acre of
property, but in fact, we have mineral rights on more property than we own across the U.S.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Yeah, that's what I thought.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We have roughly 7 million acres of mineral rights as compared to roughly 6 million of
Timberland. We do have properties in the South in the areas that you've discussed. Some of our properties are in the
Haynesville Shale area, which we have talked about in the past and we where we have active leasing activity and
drilling activity and what we do – just to remind everybody in the call, is generally we'll enter into operating leases
with exploration companies. They spend the capital to develop the resource and then we have a royalty interest that we
receive over time.
So, our income stream is a combination of front-end leases and royalties. We also have lands in the Tuscaloosa Oil
Basin, which is subject to a lot of higher level of interest right now, because oil is more attractive to the industry than
shale gas, but we manage those properties aggressively. We are actively monetizing those properties. We have had a
historic practice of not selling those rights, but rather retaining them and monetizing them with annual steady income,
which we happen to favor. I cannot put a value on all of our mineral rights and I specifically can't give you number for
what our properties would be worth in that region, other than to say that we've got active leases. We've got active

exploration going on, and it becomes a fairly steady part of our Timberlands P&L.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: And are you – how satisfied are you that you are really kind of – you're maximizing
value right now? I guess, or is it – how far long are you in the process of really understanding exactly how much value
you've got and then extracting it?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, we know what we have. One of the things that has emerged over the last five plus years
is the development of new technology, so, fracking – that opened up the shale gas opportunity, not just for us but really
for the entire United States. And then we're seeing that same technology used in the oil shale basin. So, what we do is
we enter into highly qualified – leases with highly qualified operators. They develop the resource. If they are
successful, then in fact we receive those royalties over time.
So, I'm confident that we know what we've got. I am really optimistic about the potential future income stream from
those properties and I'm very encouraged about what the development of those resources mean for this country. We are
fast becoming energy independent and that's a good thing for us, generally as a country and we'll also – we're already
starting to see the impact on some onshoring of jobs because of low energy prices.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: No, I'd agree. Good luck.

<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. One quick technical and then one bigger strategy; on the unallocated, since
you've changed the accounting, should we still be using a $20 million to $25 million or does that actually go up a little
bit?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Over the course of the year, Mark, it will basically pretty much wash out. It'll maybe be a
little bit higher this year as we build inventories. A lot of that reduction comes from – when we sell from one segment
to the next, we sell at market price. But for anything that's left in inventory, we have to back out that inter-company
profit. So, the reason that we brought it into the unallocated segment was really to give you a better view of what the
standalone business results were by segment.
So, as you think about our Wood Products business, for example, in the first quarter where we are building inventory,
they would be unduly penalized and then they would get that back when they sold that inventory later in the year. So, to
take that noise out of the system, that's really why we pulled it out of the segments and put it into unallocated, so you
could track it very easily from one to the next. But I would expect that as the year progresses, that will likely stay at a
pretty low level and then you'll see another piece come back in the first quarter of 2013 similar to the larger amount
that you saw in the first quarter of this year.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay, thank you. And then on the...
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: The other thing, Mark, that really jumps around in that segment, you can see it there as
well is the foreign exchange. So, the unallocated number really increased over what our guidance typically would have
been because of the change in the currency, Canadian dollar. So, that was a $14 million negative swing
quarter-over-quarter.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. And then on the dividend, you've articulated how over the course of time, you
expect to pay out roughly 75%, et cetera, and now things are getting better. Are you likely to view where the dividend
should be on a looking kind of a trailing of what you have achieved or is it more an outlook of where things seem to be
going? Because obviously, we're at a point where hopefully things are getting better and are you going to likely be

proactive on the dividend or more reactive?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Mark, I don't want to get ahead of our Board on this one. You articulated our policy very well.
So, we set the dividend at a target range of 75% of our funds available for distribution over the cycle. We are focused
as we set the dividend not on looking back but looking forward, and so what we are looking at it as we review the
dividend level is our future earnings potential, our view of market conditions. We take into consideration the certainty
or the level of volatility in forecasts, and those are the areas that the Board focuses on as we look forward. So, I would
say – really quick answer, we are not looking back, we are looking forward, and we are targeting that 75% over the
cycle. So, we're looking forward to seeing our earnings and cash [ph] flow (52:36) increase and we're looking forward
to the opportunity to increase the dividend.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Thanks, most of my questions have been answered, but I did have one on Engineered Wood
products, you kind of touched on it. But, the fact that prices fell when – especially for I-beams, when the inputs – the
flanges and web stock were rising, just is troublesome. So, is it just too much production or is there anything else?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I would simply observe that it's market pricing by a range of competitors and I can't comment
beyond that. As I said, we are starting to see some increase as we move in to the third quarter, but I've got nothing else
to add.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Got it. And then just, you only have one sawmill left in British Columbia, and I should
know this, but is Princeton on the interior, are you having significant issues with sawdust that's very fine?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We are not, we're very – we've had some significant issues, the industry has, in British
Columbia, a lot of speculation about the sawdust and is that or is that not related to beetle wood. We do not have that
problem, our mills we believe are operating safely. They've been inspected closely by all appropriate authorities, and so
it has not been an issue for us.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: And Princeton is in an area, Steve, that is less affected by the Mountain Pine Beetle than
most of the other BC mills.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Yes. I was kind of interested because of those two catastrophic events and...

<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Hi, Josh.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning to you.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Two quick questions. On the Timberlands side, you mentioned that you'll have some, I may
have missed this before, but some non-strategic sales in the third quarter, can you just remind us what the total acreage
is that you would still classify there as non-strategic?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: It's actually a very small percentage of our acreage, Josh. We include that number I believe in
our Fact Book. It's certainly less than 10% overall. And so when we talk about non-strategic, we identify what's core,
and what's not. We do not have significant acreage that we would consider to be non-strategic.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Okay. And on the homebuilding side, it looks like capitalized interest moved up pretty
decently this quarter. Is that more directly correlated with the backlog in the home closing or is that more reflective of
increased community count?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I can't answer that question.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, Josh, could you ask your question one more time?
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Yeah, the capitalized interest on the home – on WRECO.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: On the rollout of capitalized interest?
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Just the absolute amount of capitalized interest. Is that – it went up fairly significantly this
quarter. Is that more reflective of additional backlog and closings in the quarter or does that have to do more with future
community count and -?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: I think most of that is a result of the Cross Creek sale. So, it was a large sale that took
place in the second quarter. So, we also had to roll out the capitalized interest with it at the same time. So, that's more
of an aberration of the size of that sale more than anything else.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Understood. Thanks very much.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: So, Josh, the rollout occurs as we have closings, not as we have sales, and you made the
comment about backlog, just to be clear, it happens as we roll out, as we have closings. So, over time, if closings go up,
you'd see that number move.
