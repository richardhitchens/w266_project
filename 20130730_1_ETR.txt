MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Teleconference. Today's
call is being recorded. And at this time, for introductions and opening comments, I would like to turn the call over to
Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Paula Waters. Please go ahead.
Paula Waters
Good morning and thank you for joining us. We'll begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO, Leo
Denault; and then Drew Marsh, our CFO will review results.
In an effort to accommodate everyone with questions this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two
questions. As part of today's conference call, Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve a number of
risks and uncertainties and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or
implied in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these factors is included in the
company's SEC filings.
With respect to the plannedspin-merge transaction, ITC filed a registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer
and sale of shares of ITC common stock to be issued to Entergy's shareholders in connection with the proposed
transactions, and the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on February 25, 2013.
ITC is expected to file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement, and ITC shareholders are urged to read
the prospectus included in the ITC registration statement and the post-effective amendment to the ITC registration
statement when available, for important information about TransCo and the proposed transactions.

In addition, on July 24, 2013 our subsidiary, Mid South TransCo LLC, filed the registration statement with the SEC,
registering the offer and sale of TransCo common units to be issued to Entergy's shareholders in connection with the
proposed transaction. This registration statement includes a prospectuses of TransCo related to the proposed
transaction. Entergy also will file a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with the SEC related to our planned
exchange of shares of Entergy common stock for the TransCo common units. Entergy's shareholders are urged to read
the prospectuses included in the ITC registration statement and the post-effective amendment to the ITC registration
statement when available, the TransCo registration statement, the tender offer statement on Schedule TO when
available and any other relevant documents because they contain important information about ITC, TransCo and the
proposed transactions. These documents and other documents related to the proposed transactions when they are
available can be obtained, free of charge, from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. The document when available can
also be obtained, free of charge from Entergy upon written request.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Leo P. Denault
Thanks, Paula, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I laid out our roadmap for 2013, the seven strategic
imperatives we are focused on that will bring sustainable value for our owners, our customers, our employees, and the
communities we serve. This morning, I'll update you on progress on each imperative over the last three months. As a
reference, the seven strategic imperatives are listed on slide two to the webcast presentation.
Starting with execute on MISO and ITC. The targeted December 19th cut over date for the utility operating companies
to join the Midcontinent Independent System Operator is approaching quickly. Many operational and regulatory
activities are ongoing in parallel to ensure a seamless transition. Last month, we received additional orders from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on certain key MISO-related issues. We appreciate the FERC's timely action
on these items. Also in May, on the implementation front, we ran simulation on processes, situations and
communications that employees will handle when MISO integration is complete. Over 100 participants from Entergy,
MISO and ITC were involved over a two-day period. The exercise did highlight areas to work on, more importantly,
however, we confirmed we are well on track for accomplishing what will be a step change in how we plan and operate
our system.
Regarding the spin-off and merger of the transmission business with ITC, in the second quarter, we received key
transaction approvals from the FERC and the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service confirming the
tax-free nature of the transaction structure. These items come in addition to the April 16, ITC shareholder approval, I
mentioned last quarter.
This brings us to the retail regulatory approvals. We entered the final, critical stages in the second quarter. After careful
consideration of the input from parties in all of the retail proceedings, we and ITC offered a package of rate mitigation
and other commitment, including a total of $453 million in rate mitigation over the first five years across all
jurisdictions as detailed on slide three, and a test to ensure customer benefits exceed ITC's higher return on investment
capital before rate mitigation ends.
These proposals align a realization of the benefits the transaction offers to customer and the rate effects resulting from
ITC's higher cost of capital. They transfer the risk of achieving the benefits of what we believe is a superior business
model from the customers back to the company. We are not asking our regulators where our customers to make a bet
on us. We've been held accountable for delivering benefits, exceeding the cost of ITC ownership.
We strongly believe this transaction would yield a more reliable, more efficient, grid than joining MISO alone, as I
reviewed in detail last quarter. The better grid benefits customers through fewer and shorter outages, reduced
congestion and line losses and greater access to lower-cost power. The rate mitigation and other proposals commit us
and ITC to delivering both performance and economic benefits that exceed the rate effects on ITC's higher cost of
capital. Rate mitigation will continue until they do. These proposals were developed and offered jointly by us and ITC.
We are not in a position to discuss all of the details, but I can offer a few points about how we and ITC planned to

allocate the rate mitigation between the two of us.
The Entergy operating companies and ITC will share in the $387 million of the wholesale and retail bill credit
component of rate mitigation in the first five years. This is the part that is not attributable the forward test period. The
Entergy operating companies will bear 65% to 70% of this component, ITC will bear the rest. The Entergy operating
components will fund the $40 million of mitigation associated with the forward test year in the first three years.
The balance of rate mitigation is comprised of net [ph] operated (7:10) costs. For years six through 10, the rate
mitigation is still required, the Entergy operating companies and ITC will split those costs 50-50. After 10 years, the
Entergy operating companies' obligation will be fixed at a modest amount and ITC will be responsible for any balance
required. Finally, the Entergy operating companies' responsibility for rate mitigation will end after 20 years.
As I've said before, we believe that the benefits for our customers, employees and communities are real. This rate
mitigation proposals puts us and ITC on the hook to deliver them. We do not shrink from being held accountable.
In the last two weeks, we were encouraged by the coalition of cities in Texas. After considering our commitments,
many of which were directly responsive to their concerns, 14 cities to-date have passed resolutions in favor of the
transaction. The cities made a filing to the Public Utility Commission of Texas, supporting a finding of public interest
for the transaction provided that Entergy Texas and ITC meet certain conditions.
The PUCT will consider our application at their Open Meeting next week on August 9. We are hopeful that the benefits
of the transaction, including the rate mitigation plan, combined with the cities resolution and East Texas Electric
Cooperatives recommended support will provide the Texas commission the basis it needs to approve our application.
We are in various stages in other jurisdictions.
Upcoming dates for filings and hearings are shown on slide four. Based on current schedules, decisions by all of our
retail regulators are anticipated in fall. We believe in this transaction. We are convinced it is the right approach and the
facts in important public policy considerations and support its approval by our regulators.
The next strategic imperative listed on slide two is to optimize the organization through Human Capital Management.
We refer to this effort internally as HCM. In July, we completed a comprehensive review of our organization design
and processes. This effort resulted in new organization structure, designed to provide optimal service to our
stakeholders. This process is a critical part of our ability to be successful at our goals of being more efficient,
continuing to control our costs and improving service levels. Other opportunities to make our organization more
flexible and adaptable to business changes are under consideration.
In the long run, these changes will ensure our employees are in the right jobs, have the right skills to be successful and
the right tools and resources to meet the changing business needs. Near-term, however, workforce reductions are a
difficult but necessary step. We have identified approximately 800 positions throughout the company, which we expect
largely will be eliminated by yearend. In addition, the organizational redesign effort will reduce contractor spending.
Difficult decisions like job reductions are sometimes a result of making long-term fundamental improvements in the
way a company works. The redesign process was led by a team of Entergy employees and had the full involvement and
oversight of the entire executive leadership team.
In addition to realizing sustainable savings, the teams are tasked with the goals of improving the way we work, placing
the right people with the right skills in the right roles. The process is comprehensive, thoughtful and focused on being
fair and responsive to the needs of all of our stakeholders.
While we spent a lot of time on organizational design and process this past quarter, we are evaluating additional
opportunities to obtain savings including compensation and benefits, procurement and non-employee operating
expenses. As a result of progress to-date, we have set a financial goal of $200 million to $250 million in savings to be
implemented by the end of 2015, and fully realized by 2016.
I know you have more questions about these savings targets, Drew will cover those details to the extent they are
currently known. As we continue this effort, I want to reemphasize that safety, security, customer service, reliability

and compliance will never be compromised.
The third strategic imperative is to maintain financial flexibility. Since I introduced this on last quarter's earnings call,
many of you have questioned, what we mean by this one. I want to be clear, we mean simply what it says, maintain
financial flexibility. Today we need and expect to continue to meet our financial flexibility objectives. Gross liquidity
stood at a healthy $4.1 billion on June 30. The credit ratings are stable at both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. And our
current financial outlook, which extends through 2014, supports deploying capital in meeting our obligations without
the need to issue traditional common equity, maintaining alternatives and headroom to avoid the damaging effects of
dilution on our owners remains the central focus for the board of directors, me and the rest of the executive leadership
team. This and the other strategic imperatives are simply about being better positioned to pursue more customer and
owner focused actions in the future over and above our current plans and commitments.
The next two strategic imperatives I will talk about are related; growing the utility business such as through economic
development and continuing to develop and implement productive regulatory constructs. To be successful at one
requires attention to the other. For example, effective regulatory constructs can provide utilities with the financial
stability needed to make necessary investments and take actions to deliver reliable service to customers, while keeping
rates reasonable. Low rates helps to keep existing businesses competitive and attract new investments tour region.
Higher growth can be cycled through the regulatory constructs to spread fixed cost over more volume. Defining and
pursuing this path is one of the keys to addressing the risks from so called disruptive challenges faced by the utility
industry. I'm sure you noticed in Table 4 of today's investor news release, quarterly weather-adjusted sales were down
in all customer classes. On the residential side, increasing interest in energy efficiency and demand side management
are contributing factors, something we anticipated and said in 2013 expectations.
On the topic of energy efficiency, in New Orleans, Arkansas and Texas, the jurisdictions where programs are up and
running, the cost recovery through a rider or through base rates, as well as performance incentives in all three
jurisdictions, and recovery of lost contributions to fixed costs, but limited point of decoupling in Arkansas and New
Orleans. Sluggish economic growth also contributed affecting all segments. Industrial sales were disappointing once
again this quarter, near-term factors such as inventory liquidations and slowing exports have reduced industrial
electricity usage, principally in the small to mid-sized segments in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi. While
near-term challenges exist, new industrial development activity is a bright spot in our future expectations beyond 2015.
Surely after our last earnings call, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana announced a long-term contract with Cameron LNG
to supply an additional 200 megawatts for 10 years to 30 years to their proposed LNG facility. Construction is expected
to begin next year. This is just one example of the large pipeline of new capital investments for manufacturing and
other economic development projects. Our region has an attractive business climate, led by its access to an abundance
of natural resources, reasonable cost of living, including electricity rates, tax and other business reforms enacted at the
state and local levels, and programs such as the comprehensive workforce training program in Louisiana.
To update statistics from April, we now have over $50 billion in high probability investment projects in various stages
in our service territory. This represents approximately 1,500 megawatts of load and more than 27,000 new jobs, of
which nearly 11,000 would be direct. Obviously, all these projects may not happen, we may not supply all of these
projects and some may not be completed. The point is, this much in the pipeline illustrates the potential for growth for
our customers and our communities.
I know I don't have to remind you that we have a number of regulatory proceedings underway in each jurisdiction,
including rate cases, formula rate plan filings and strong recovery. I'll give you a brief update on major developments.
All the usual details are provided in our release and the webcast slides. In Mississippi, Entergy Mississippi and the
Mississippi Public Utility Staff filed a stipulation settlements resolved the 2012 test year formula rate plan proceeding.
The stipulation called for a $22.3 million annual revenue increase. The rate change provides funds necessary for
increased reliability, capacity for economic growth and the ability for flexible use of the power plants on the grid. It is
the first FRP increase in four years and even after Entergy Mississippi's rates will remain well below a number of other
utilities in the southeast and more than 10% below the national average. The next Mississippi Public Service
Commission meeting is scheduled for August 13. If approved, the rates would be effective beginning with September

goings.
In May, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the settlement in the proceeding relating to Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana's natural gas operations. The settlement extended the gas rate stabilization plan for an additional
three-year term through the 2015 test year. The return on equity mid point was revised to 9.95% down from 10.5% and
the plus or minus 50 basis points range was maintained.
This settlement resulted in $678,000 rate increase for customers relating to the 2012 test year. In addition, the LPSC
order directed the company and staff to work towards the gas infrastructure investment rider. The LPSC has a
longstanding practice of using formula rate plans and riders for electric and natural gas utilities. The quests for new
three-year formula rate plans are a component of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana rate cases filed
earlier this year.
Regarding the rate cases, the Entergy Louisiana companies have requested LPSC review of administrative law judge's
denial to consolidate the two rate cases. As part of this request, the companies are seeking a 60-day delay in the
procedural schedules to allow all parties to explore a framework for a more efficient review of the rate case request and
possible resolution and to set a new procedural schedule should the Louisiana commission approves the motions to
consolidate the two rate cases. The consolidation matters on tomorrow's LPSC business and executive meeting agenda.
Given these developments to ALJs and the Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana rate cases suspended
the upcoming August 3 there.
Riders are another construct our regulators have approved to support actions to benefit customers and the companies. In
early May, the Public Utility Commission of Texas included a new rule adding a purchase power capacity rider as
another tool available for Texas Utility. This rider will be available for Entergy Texas in the future. However, based on
a review of the company's financial status and expectations, Entergy Texas expects to file a base rate case in the third
quarter.
Turning to the EWC business for the strategic imperative listed on slide two, improving EWC results. We have a
number of options we are exploring. On the revenue side, foreign energy prices declined in recent weeks, but New
York's Rest of State capacity market continued to improve. Second quarter's spot auctions cleared the $4.40 per
kilowatt month, roughly 60% higher than first quarter of this year, more than 2.5 times higher than second quarter of
last year.
Capacity market improvements were driven by the effects of successful mitigation meaning projects with contracts
were reflected at fair prices in the auction and plant retirements and mothballings.
In addition, a new capacity is owned for the Lower Hudson Valley remains on track to begin next summer subject to
FERC approval. New York Independent System Operator identified the need for this new zone to address transmission
deliverability issues and improve grid reliability. The FERC's decision is expected in the near-term. Indian Point is
located within this new zone where prices are expected to be higher than the rest of state market, where it currently
resides.
While we remain encouraged by the progress made related to the Lower Hudson Valley capacity pricing, we remain
concerned about some of the overall market design issues in New York and New England. We are committed to
continue to work towards promoting fair and competitive power markets in those regions. From the cost efficiency
perspective, EWC completed a reorganization this month as part of this strategic imperative to improve results,
reducing costs going forward. It would handle separately from the Human Capital Management optimization efforts
due to the financial realities the business is facing.
Reorganization efforts in nuclear operations at the nuclear plants and nuclear headquarters are part of the overall HCM
effort, additional ideas and opportunities for efficiency and productivity improvements at the plants are in various
stages of review and implementation. Regarding our nuclear operations, we were pleased to announce the election of a
new director in June, Retired Admiral Kirkland Donald. His tremendous experience, including important positions in
the Navy's nuclear program will enhance an already strong oversight by the board of directors.

Our actions and success in the final strategic imperative aligning corporate culture can best be judged by our results.
However, we execute on the other strategic imperatives requires alignment throughout our organization and successful
execution requires a skilled and focused organization from top to bottom that is designed and managed to perform and
achieve.
We recognize there are a lot of complexities to our company today, that's inherent in these seven strategic imperatives
for 2013. It's a busy year for us and we know it is for you too, tracking the numerous filings, regulatory decisions, and
management execution. We are aiming for success in all of our strategic imperatives to support a step change in our
customers' value proposition and that of the company. Next year should provide a clear picture of who we are and
where we are headed as a company.
Next year, we plan to be part of MISO delivering benefits to our customers estimated at approximately $1.4 billion in
the first decade upon integration into the MISO [indiscernible] (22:14) market. Next year, we will not be working on
the ITC transaction. We remain firmly committed to this transaction because we believe the ownership of our
mid-south transmission business will create the most values for all of our stakeholders withheld by ITC. For our
customers and communities, it will lead to lower delivered energy prices. For employees, better job opportunities in a
largely singularly focused business. This represents incremental value over and above what the transmission brings to
Entergy and its stakeholders today. That said, if the transaction does not close, we will continue to operate efficiently
and make economic and reliability investments to optimize through our Human Capital Management imperative and to
continue to seek out productive regulatory constructs and grow the business.
By early next year, the pending rate cases in Arkansas and Louisiana will be resolved. Rate cases are a basic part of our
business. We'll have two others pending in Texas and New Orleans, but the uncertainty caused by the number of
outstanding cases and jurisdictions will be behind us. Nevertheless, we will continue to seek out productive regulatory
constructs that reward efficient operations and facilitate access to capital on reasonable terms in order to maintain
reasonable rates. Next year, we will be well into the implementation phases of our Human Capital Management
optimization efforts. The new organizational design will largely be in place. This is a central component to the effort,
but not all of it. Further development of other opportunities continues, some of which will likely also be in
implementation stages by then.
We are working to have better clarity before next year on the direction of the EWC business. We are considering a
number of avenues and options to adapt to the current business and market realities. While we are working to
strengthen the business financially. We also know the plants are valuable to all stakeholders, including to employees
and communities for the direct and indirect jobs they provide, to customers and communities for the environmental,
grid reliability, and field diversity benefits from their operation and to owners for the option for power price recovery
they represent.
As we consider strategic alternatives for EWC, all options are on the table. Our focus today is on streamlining for 2014
and beyond for all stakeholders by aligning our organizational design, functions and processes. Our owners reducing
complexity makes us an easier company to follow, predict and value. For employees, redesigning our organization to
be more efficient and aligning our corporate culture will create a more productive, engaging work environment,
ultimately making it easier to execute. These benefits help to maintain reasonable costs and safe reliable products and
services for our customers, as well as economic development, philanthropy, volunteerism and advocacy in our
communities. We understand uncertainty creates a discount and 2013 is the year for us to reduce some of that
uncertainty.
One last item before I turn the call over to Drew. Typically, we would not mention to you the retirement of our human
resources leader. However, in the current case it's different. In September, a long-term Entergy employee and maybe
longer-term friend of mine, Renae Conley will retire. For the last couple of years, Renae has been our HR leader, and
prior to that, she led our largest jurisdiction for a decade through some of the most difficult times the company has
faced, for example, in 2005, during Katrina and Rita. Many of you, however, will recall that Reane was the driving
force behind training Entergy's Investor Relations Group into the high quality organization that it is today.

And if you've been in the business as long as I have, you probably remember her filling the Investor Relations roles at
both [ph] synergies (25:56) and before that PSI. For those of you that know her, you realize how capable she is, you
know her tenacity, her strength, her intelligence and her kindness. I know many of you listening that are investors will
recall her many contributions and I hope you will feel free to contact her during the next month to wish her well. And I
know many more of you who are employees feel the same sadness as I, that she is leaving us, but also with tremendous
happiness for her as she enters the next phase of her life. All I can say is, she will be greatly missed.
And now, I'll turn it over to Drew.
Andrew Marsh
Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover quarterly financial results, and
expectations for 2013 and beyond. This will include a discussion on Human Capital Management.
Now, let's turn to the quarterly financial results. Slide five summarizes second quarter 2013 results on an as-reported
and operational basis. Operational earnings per share were $1.01 versus $2.11 a year ago.
Second quarter as-reported earnings in both periods included special items for expenses associated with Human Capital
Management in 2013 and the spin-merge of the transmission business with ITC in 2012 and 2013.
Turning to operational results, slide six summarizes the major drivers by business. Utility operational earnings per
share were lower in second quarter 2013 due largely to a tax benefit and associated regulatory credit in the comparable
2012 period. Together these two items provided a net benefit of approximately $0.44 in the second quarter of last year.
Excluding these items, the quarter-over-quarter operational results declined approximately $0.15. The overall decrease
is attributable to the net effects of higher non-fuel O&M expense and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by
higher net revenue. A portion of the increased non-fuel O&M and depreciation expenses, as well as the increased net
revenue reflect investments placed in service in 2012. Previously identified higher benefit costs, primarily from pension
discount rates also contributed to the quarterly O&M variance.
Second quarter 2013 net income also included approximately $7 million incremental pre-tax expense as a result of the
ANO industrial accident. This amount reflected incremental non-fuel O&M less than estimate recorded for expected
insurance proceeds and reduced refueling outage amortization expense.
On the topic of ANO, I'd like to give a quick update. First, recovery efforts of ANO – for ANO have progressed well.
Unit 1 could return to service as early as August, testing and recovery continue going well. Second, we've updated cost
estimates for the assessment, restoration, re-removal and replacement of damaged property and equipment to be in the
range of $95 million to $120 million. This estimate does not include replacement energy and may change as we
continue restoration activity.
Finally, Entergy Arkansas recently filed a lawsuit in Arkansas State Court seeking to recover damages relating to the
ANO event and is continuing to assess other options for recovering damages, including insurance and other legal
actions.
Now, turning back to results for the quarter at the Utility. Utility net revenue increased due to the prior period
regulatory credit noted earlier and pricing factors.
As with first quarter of 2013, pricing adjustments included regulatory actions or major generation investments placed in
service in 2012. These investments benefit customers through improved operational efficiency and favorable
environmental profile. Utility retail sales volume on both and as-reported and a weather-adjusted basis declined
quarter-over-quarter.
Leo reviewed certain sales drivers in his earlier remarks. In setting 2013 guidance, we anticipated declines in
residential and commercial sales from energy efficiency and growth in industrial sales from expansion. However,
year-to-date results have been below expectations for all segments, especially in the industrial segment. We expect
better industrial performance over the balance of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter as a large expansion is

scheduled to start up.
Longer-term, we still see support for 1% to 1.25% sales growth. At EWC, operational earnings were $0.33 per share
lower than the second quarter last year. This period-over-period decline was due largely to the lower operational
adjusted EBITDA drivers, which I will review shortly.
EWC results also reflected higher decommissioning expense through an item reported in the second quarter of last year,
partially offset by lower income tax expense.
Slide seven summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for second quarter 2013 and 2012. The $66 million
decrease was due primarily to the lower net revenue driven by decreased output from EWC nuclear fleet. The nuclear
fleet had 26 additional outage days from both refueling and maintenance outages.
While second quarter day ahead Northeast Energy prices were roughly 35% higher than prior year levels, we saw a
large decline in prices over the course of the quarter, due in part to reversion of New England natural gas prices from
high winter levels to the level that meets supply and demand conditions in the broader natural gas market.
Including the impact of hedges, average energy price for the quarter – the current quarter and EWC's new build
portfolio declined approximately $3 per megawatt hour versus second quarter last year. Leo has already reviewed the
underlying drivers for the capacity market. I'll note that we continue to expect to see these constructive fundamentals
going forward in New York with new Lower Hudson Valley zone, though regulatory intervention risk remains a risk.
Slide eight summarizes our cash flow performance for the second quarter. Operating cash flow was $572 million; $15
million lower than the same period a year ago. There were several drivers, both positive and negative. While the overall
decrease is $15 million, the variance by segment was significantly higher. This was in large part due to inter-company
taxes, because Entergy files a consolidated return, income tax obligations are routinely settled between our legal
entities as issues are resolved.
In the current quarter, the inter-company activity was largely due to fact that I mentioned, which we reported in the
fourth quarter last year related to the tax treatment of our utilities' decommissioning liabilities. Ultimately, timing of
payments to the IRS will consider many factors, including storm loss carrybacks, utilization of NOL and the taxable
income of other entities in the consolidated tax group.
Slide nine summarizes our 2013 operational earnings guidance of $4.60 to $5.40 per share. I know you're familiar with
the drivers, so I will not repeat them today. Operational guidance does not reflect the two special items I discussed
earlier.
Now, I'd like to turn to a discussion of drivers for 2014 and beyond as they are shaping up today, starting with HCM on
slide 10. Human Capital Management is designed to create sustainable value for our four key stakeholders. We'll have
a real lasting impact on Entergy by changing the way we work, while reducing ongoing spending and retaining or
improving safety, security and reliability.
As Leo noted, we expect total annualized savings from our HCM initiatives to be in the range of $200 million to $250
million by 2016. While execution of the initiatives and realization of the savings will occur over the next few years, the
bulk of the savings will be realized in 2014. Savings realized at the utility operating companies will be recognized
appropriately in our regulatory filings in those savings and the cost to achieve are known and measured. This process
will vary by jurisdictions.
Estimated savings are primarily from new organizational redesign effort, which will be largely completed by the end of
this year. The savings estimate also includes cost reductions from the other areas Leo discussed.
On a preliminary basis, the total $200 million to $250 million savings goal is expected to be split approximately 80% to
90% non-fuel O&M and the balance in capital spending. And approximately 60% to 65% net utility and the balance
largely in EWC.

In order to implement our HCM initiatives, we expect to incur one-time cost to achieve in the range of $145 million to
$185 million. The majority of these costs will be incurred in 2013 and will be classified as a special item. The level and
timing of HCM savings are important in considering future O&M level. Our future spending and earnings trends will
be affected by other factors as well.
Slide 11 summarizes our non-fuel O&M and refueling outage expenses over the past few years. The 2013 baseline of
approximately $3.5 billion represents our current expectations excluding past and future costs associated with HCM
implementation and the ITC transaction. Considering all these factors, we expect a three-year compound annual growth
rate up to 2013 base of around 1.5% to 2.5%, including HCM savings. Growth rates can vary from year to year.
In addition to the level of HCM savings, other factors to consider for future O&M levels include the effects on the
proposed ITC transaction, variations in pension discount rates, spending on initiatives such as energy efficiency,
inflationary pressures and incremental regulatory compliance costs. Some of the factors driving changes in O&M
expense, such as MISO costs, energy efficiency costs and storm reserve have corresponding offsets in net revenue.
Looking ahead to 2014, slide 12 summarizes preliminary major drivers to consider based on where we stand today. For
the utility, whether or not the spin-merge is completed is a key factor in 2014. Excluding that transaction, we are
affirming our five-year compound annual growth rate for utility net income of around 6% for 2014.
In addition to HCM, many initiatives underway now will determine our ability to deliver on this financial outlook.
Those include the outcomes of pending rate proceedings in Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, and to a lesser degree,
the to-be-filed rate case in Texas. The level of sales growth is also a factor to watch.
As I noted earlier, 2013 sales to date have been lower than expected. However, we still believe that over the longer
term, annual retail sales growth of 1% to 1.25% is achievable, even after factoring in energy efficiency [ph] and the
Human Capital Management effort (37:25). As Leo explained, our service territory has strong economic development
activity signaling the potential for long-term growth. Recent contracts combined with other major projects that our
economic development teams are working on could have a significant impact. Even with higher growth in the lower
priced industrial segment, there's still incremental revenue and customer benefit from spreading fixed costs across
higher volumes. For EWC, energy and capacity markets are a major factor for the financial performance of that
business.
The 2014 average revenue per megawatt hour for EWC's nuclear fleet is expected to decline approximately $2 per
megawatt hour based on the June 30 forward market. A 23% open energy position combined with market variability in
certain hedge positions leads to a range of possible price outcomes, as you can see in the price sensitivities outlined in
Table 7. Variations in nuclear plant outages both planned and unplanned can also affect EWC's earnings.
We now expect to have forward fueling outages next year as a result of moving the power saver fueling outage from
fall of this year to early 2014, and our ability to identify and execute on opportunities to improve EWC results is
important for that business. This includes the O&M factors as I discussed earlier. Income tax expense is also an item
that tends to vary from year and year and by segment. And we always have the potential for portfolio management
activity. Through all of this, we are focused on managing the strategic imperative and positioning ourselves to take
advantage of any opportunities to face any challenges that come our way, while maintaining a firm commitment to
deliver sustainable value to all our stakeholders. And now the Entergy team is available for your questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Angie Storozynski at Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Thank you very much. I wanted to start with slide 22, the illustrative adjusted EBITDA for

know that there is a reduction in energy prices, but I would still expect a bit of a stronger projected EBITDA for that
business.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah, well, the reality is that we're still facing lower prices overall. So as Drew
suggested, on a per megawatt hour basis, we're seeing a reduction. So while we're encouraged, and we've seen some
uplift from areas such as the Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone, the fact is, in a lot of the other markets, specifically
in the New England market, we're not getting appropriate rents in terms of capacity prices. So net-net, you're correct,
we're still looking at decline in total EBITDA for EWC for 2014.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: So that bar already fully incorporates cost cutting and MISO's projections for the capacity
price uplift?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I don't believe that it includes all of the HCM efforts, but it does reflect our point of view
on current market conditions.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. And then on slide 12, could you just explain a little bit, what is the – this potential
portfolio management activities, what do you mean by those?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Well. As we look at that portfolio, as Leo mentioned, we consider all options and we do
this on a regular basis. So obviously we look at a hold and optimize scenario where we are taking steps to reduce our
cost and be as efficient as we can, at each and every facility. We also explore market opportunities to determine if any
asset or portfolio of assets would be better owned by another party and we also continually evaluate the potential for a
shutdown of a facility. So those are – when we talk about options, those are kind of the three different areas that we
constantly look at and that's similar to what we've always done.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. But why is it mentioned under corporate and not under EWC?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, that's – this is Leo, Angie, that's primarily given who kind of leads some of those efforts
and they work in conjunction with the folks within the business units, so the kind of people who do all that kind of
activity primarily are driven out of the corporate organization, so that's more just our organizational structure than
anything else.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. I know I was supposed to ask only two questions but last one is, so we have the –
those projections of O&M cuts target of projections by 2016. Can you explain to me the timing of this announcement,
vis-à-vis your pending rate cases and ITC transaction? I mean should it – these things facilitate the ITC deal and your
pending rate cases or I mean how will all the action incorporated in your pending regulatory filings?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: I'll let Rod take that. Rod West, who is our Chief Administrative Officer, all of the HCM efforts
are being directed under his organization. So I'll let Rod take that.
<A - Roderick K. West>: And to be direct in answering your question, the timing is not designed to facilitate or feed a
regulatory point of view. The timing of the HCM announcement really does reflect where the company's planning
process has evolved, where we think we have a clear point of view on the savings and our confidence around being able
to articulate what we think the bottom-line impact would be. And so as we begin this process, Leo, I recall, announced
at [ph] EEI (44:12) last year as we were formally beginning to publicly at least execute on our point of view around
MISO and ITC. We had perspectives around where the organization needed to be, on a going forward basis, and as we
evolved, as the analysis evolved, we felt more and more comfortable about when we'd be able to communicate, so the
timing – it just reflects where we are.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you, Angie.

[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Dan Eggers at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Hey, good morning, guys. Just following up on the cost cutting program and kind of the
numbers out there, the overall savings are pretty significant relative to maybe we are seeing it...
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Dan, could you speak up? We are having trouble hearing you.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Yeah. Sorry about that. Just on the magnitude of cost savings. Could you share a little more
color on where you guys expect to find the savings. I know we've seen past M&A transactions recently, their savings
have been in line or smaller than what you guys are talking about today. So just kind of trying to bucket those a little
better, would be helpful I think.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Sure, Rod?
<A - Roderick K. West>: Sure. Dan, I think as we've discussed in prior conversations, what you know and what we
call the HCM process has been centered around four work streams, and both Drew and Leo alluded to them. The first is
the org in process, and I think that one answers your question in terms of where we think the lion's share of at least
what we've communicated today rests, particularly as we look to what's meaningful in 2013, going to 2014. Then you
have comp and benefits, procurement cost management and then a non-employee related operational expenses. And so
the lion's share of the savings, order of magnitude half to two thirds perhaps comes from our org in process point of
view.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: And I guess just you guys reiterated the 6% earnings growth at the utilities; that it'd then include
the 2014 savings, I guess. So was there a bit of a backfill on supporting that 6% growth or is that number actually
biased higher because you'll have more savings in those numbers for next year?
<A - Roderick K. West>: We're not considering it additive to the 6% as I mentioned. There could be some small
benefits short-term, but ultimately we expect it to be recognized in the filings and when it's sort of known and
measurable within the regulatory process the utility. So, we are not counting it really as incremental to the 6% target.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Okay. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Just to clarify on the ITC mitigation plan. As proposed, how would you envisage kind of
those credits flowing through the financial statements or not? I mean how...
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Drew.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: It's – we're still looking at it. Preliminarily, we would expect it to be part of – it would be
reflected in the net revenue. But there's – it could change with final orders that we ultimately get. The only change that
we would see would sort of be whether or not we would recognize a liability on the balance sheet for the first five
years, after that everything is contingent. And so, clearly wouldn't be a balance sheet liability. But at this point, we
expect it to flow through in net revenue.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Just flow through in net revenue as incurred basically?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Correct.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay, and then my second one on page 12. On the EWC, you have this – you mentioned
depreciation as a driver for 2014 and then declining useful life of nuclear assets. Can you clarify that latter part of that

statement?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Yeah. That was related to a potential change where – currently we have accelerating
depreciation as we get closer and closer to the end of the life of the units, and we may make a change where we flatten
that out a little bit. But that's – I think that's the primary thing we're talking about there.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So that would be beneficial to earnings? Sorry it's...
<A - Andrew Marsh>: No, well, it would be beneficial to the end tail of the earnings. It would be against earnings, it
would be harmful to earnings.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So it's a negative 2014 driver?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Yes.

<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: Okay. Is that better?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: That's much better.
<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: Okay. I apologize. Just on getting back to the cost savings, so on the EWC side, you have 35%
to 40% of that segment would realize the cost savings. And then as you said, you have the EBITDA on that slide kind
of coming down in 2014. And then you were kind of vague on whether ultimately the savings were going to be
incorporated in 2014. So does that mean that we'll see them in 2015 or – I just kind of need some clarification and then
I have one other quick follow up.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: I think, Andy, the clarification was that the EBITDA number did not include HCM, but we
would anticipate there would be some...
<A - Andrew Marsh>: In 2014, yes. The bulk of the savings we'd expect to see for EWC in 2014.

<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: Perfect. Okay. And then the other thing, just moving on to ITC very quickly, you have all
these kind of rate mitigation things for the various states. Can you give us a breakdown on how much of those savings
are from, let's say, the system agreement versus just kind of other savings?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Could you repeat that question, Andy?
<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: On the ITC Entergy deal, there are savings from the system agreements going away, right, and
then there is just savings. And so, I'm just wondering what the breakdown of that is? So let's say, I'm going to start out
with a number, let's say in Louisiana, it's $100 million of rate mitigation that's going to the customer. What kind of a
breakdown of that?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Andy, are you referring – this is Theo. Are you referring to the avoided cost column?
<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: Yes, exactly.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: On page three, slide three.
<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: I don't know if it's on page three, but...
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: If you're referring to the avoided cost column, it includes cost that would go away as a
result of the transmission business going away and therefore there is no more MSS-2 transactions potentially...
<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: Exactly.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: ...between the various operating companies. And also I think it also reflects maybe some
impacts of zonal change in that pricing zone structures. I don't have in front of me the various pieces and parts as it
relates to those two components, but I think we could follow-up and get that to you.
<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: Okay. Thank you very much. I'll let someone else go.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.
Operator
And we'll go next to Greg Gordon at ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks, guys. So when I think about the HCM program in terms of its impact on your utility
businesses, should I just think about this as being – driving the ability for you guys to have a higher confidence level in
earning at your authorized returns across the jurisdictions prospectively? I think your guidance this year for instance
presumes a significant level of under earnings. So the HCM program would have two benefits. So one, it would reduce
the necessity for rate increases, but also keep your cost profile from creating regulatory lag. Is that the right way to
think about it?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: That's fair, Greg. The major component is to become more efficient and through that efficiency,
we should end up with lower rates, lower cost to our customers, and have a better shot at earning the rate of return that
we are allowed, that's correct.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Right. And if – my one follow-up. If you were to be ordered to implement the rate mitigation
plans by establishing regulatory liabilities, as opposed to running it through on a – running it through the P&L, we
should assume then that's an offset to rate base, right? That lowers your rate base? Is that right?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Drew.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Well, we would only get to do that if we got a rate order or a rate deferral. I would think of it
more as a regulatory asset that we would be able to realize over time on the one-time incurred costs.

<Q - Greg Gordon>: Well, if you had a regulatory liability, right, that would flow through as a contra expense, but
you'd have a reduction in revenue, so you'd wind-up having sort of an upfront rate down and then flow the cash –
there'd be a cash impact as you flowed the credits back, but not an earnings impact, right?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: This is Theo. I think what would happen if in fact you booked it upfront, you would
recognize the liability, but the cost obviously would be recognized as an expense at the time you booked the liability. If
in fact that was the case, as Drew said, that's not what we're saying at this point in time would be the case. And if in fact
you had a liability as part of a regulatory construct, I would imagine that you're not likely to see that as it relates to
regulatory rates that in going forward.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. Okay, so, you think that the most likely outcome should these mitigation plans be
approved is they'll flow through as you flow back the – as they flow back to customers you'll incur the expense. Your
cost cutting plans allow you to sort of plough through that and still close the gap between your current ROEs and your
future authorized ROEs?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: As you state, I mean, if in fact, it happens as we see or expected today, you would see
the impact for the rate mitigation flowing through currently as reduction to revenue, which obviously would have a –
put downward pressure on ROEs. You would also have, as the regulatory processes move forward, you would see the
impacts of cost cutting making their way through the regulatory process that could happen at various points in time.
Obviously, as that happens, Leo mentioned earlier, we would see rates being adjusted to reflect those changes in cost
structure within the utility. So for a period of time, there is a potential that you could have offset, but again, as you go
forward and the regulatory process encompasses those rate reductions within the setting of rates, the rates would be
adjusted commensurate with that and those benefits would flow back to customers at that point in time.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. Very clear. Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.

We will go next to Steven Fleishman at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Yes. Two questions in ten parts. No. Just on the percent O&M increase, could you possibly
breakout that 0.5% to 2.5% just for the EWC business?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: I don't have that in front of me, right now, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then also on the target of 6% growth, but in 2014, if you achieve that in 2014
would you generally be earning your allowed returns in your regulatory jurisdictions overall or would you still be under
earning?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Steve, this is Theo. I believe if we achieve that, we would – I think we'd be – I think,
yes, I think the answer is, yes, we'd be – we'd pretty much be earning our allowed ROEs within the constructs of the
jurisdictions.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. So in theory that cost cutting is kind of helping you to get to earn it and will in the
future at the utilities I guess. One last just thing on the HCM, the compensation benefits procurement that you
mentioned, are those included in the $200 million to $250 million or not?
<A - Roderick K. West>: Steve, this is Rod. They are currently included. I was just making the point earlier that the
lion's share of that number was in the Oregon process, but all four work streams are and will continue to contribute to
our point of view on the $200 million to $250 million.

We'll go next to Charles Fishman at Morningstar.
<Q - Charles J. Fishman>: Hi, on the rate mitigation plan, in year six when it's determined by the savings, who is the
arbitrator of that savings? Is it MISO, is it the state commissions, do you hire an independent consultant? In other
words, who is making that decision of what the savings are?
<A - Roderick K. West>: Charles, I think if you look at what has been filed as a part of that rate mitigation plan, I
think what we would – what has been proposed is you would have an independent third-party that would be approved
by some regulatory – would be mutually agreed upon between ITC and some regulatory – a regulatory body.
