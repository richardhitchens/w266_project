MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Company first quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call.
Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate.com. Just as a reminder, there may be a slight
delay before the question-and-answer session begins due to the web simulcast.
At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations,
Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Delia H. Thompson
Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With
me this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman, and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate
Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.

and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ

This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results
prepared in accordance with GAAP. We'll discuss organic sales growth, which is net sales growth excluding foreign
exchange, acquisitions, and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A as a percent of
net sales, operating profit, operating profit margin, net income, and earnings per share on a diluted basis excluding the
impact of the described in the press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in
the press release and is posted in the For Investors section of our website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.
We're delighted with our results for the first quarter. As we exited 2013, we said we were excited about continuing our
momentum and that has indeed happened. Our organic sales growth was at the high end of our target range of 5% to
7% on top of strong growth of 2% in the prior year, and was a good balance between volume and price. In fact, our
pricing increase of 1.5% was against the highest level of pricing performance for any quarter last year, and we expect
this good performance to continue.
In light of precipitous declines in currencies versus the dollar during the quarter, we're pleased that our gross profit
margin was even with last year's levels. While we had forecasted an improvement year over year, the lack of growth
was primarily due to the transaction costs associated with the aforementioned currency headwinds. However, our
Funding the Growth program is as robust as it has ever been and, as you know, an integral part of our company culture.
So as we are able to take pricing as we go through the year to offset the sudden currency moves, we expect to see our
gross margin improve each quarter.
We're particularly pleased about the savings being generated from our global growth and efficiency program. As we
told you when we announced the program in the fourth quarter of 2012, we felt it would serve us well as we entered
turbulent times, and indeed it has. We also said that the bulk of the savings would be reflected in overhead expenses.
And in the first quarter we delivered a 30 basis point reduction in overhead spending, which allowed us to increase our
advertising as a percent of net sales to support what continues to be a very robust pipeline of innovation around the
world. Our balance sheet is solid with strong cash generation as well as excellent working capital control; so a good
start to the year, which bodes well for the remainder of 2014.
So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. We're particularly pleased with the solid organic sales
growth in North America. This growth of 3.5% was against 5.5% in the year-ago quarter, which was the strongest
quarter for 2013. A full array of new products across categories contributed to the results. And as referenced in the
press release, we grew our market shares in manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, dish liquids, liquid cleaners, and fabric
conditioners.
Colgate Optic White toothpaste is continuing to grow share from 2013 behind new products, with strong marketing
campaigns and more impactful claims. This February we began to ship an uber-premium priced toothpaste line,
expanding on our original Optic White Whitening toothpaste. Optic White PLATINUM Whiten and Protect, our new
product in the line, adds stain prevention technology with whitening power of the original Optic White formula to help
maintain whiter teeth.
In addition, we relaunched Optic White Dual Action as Optic White PLATINUM White & Radiant, which contains
extra polishing brighteners to add shine. An impactful media, print, and shopper campaign to support the Optic White
PLATINUM launch emphasizes whiter teeth in just one day by using the entire Optic White regimen, including the
Colgate Optic White Toothbrush and built-in Whitening Pen.
Along with these new toothpastes, we introduced Colgate Optic White mouthwash with WhiteSeal Technology. The
new formula combines stain prevention with the whitening power of Colgate's original Optic White mouthwash along
with a significantly enhanced taste profile.
The launch of Colgate Optic White Toothbrush and built-in Whitening Pen, which we told you about last quarter, has
been very well received. In March, it achieved an 8.1% share and has been driving almost the entire manual toothbrush
category growth year to date. And as you would expect, we have continued strong commercial support planned for the
remainder of the year.

The regimen approach has served us well with our Colgate Total franchise. Colgate Total mouthwash, launched in May
of last year behind record retail support, has been driving overall category growth. Trial and repeat levels are outpacing
other competitive launches, contributing to an overall mouthwash share of over 6% on a year-to-date basis, up from the
year-ago period. And we've also reinvigorated the graphics on our Colgate Total toothpaste line and have increased our
professional marketing efforts with dental office sampling and detailing aids as well as advertising in dental and
scientific journals.
As I said, our market share in dish liquid was up in the quarter. Driving this in part was the launch of Palmolive Dish &
Sink, which helps eliminate odors to freshen the air around the sink as you do the dishes. A strong marketing campaign
only began in April, but we saw excellent results right after our launch.
As you know, our business in the Hispanic market is very strong. And a number of years ago, we launched Suavitel
Fabric Conditioner, the leading brand in Mexico, in the U.S. In the first quarter of this year, we launched a new variant,
Suavitel Fast Dry, with a breakthrough patent-pending formula that softens clothes and contains moisture wicking
polymers that allow fabrics to quickly shed water so that clothes dry 30% faster. This has contributed to an all-time
high national fabric conditioner share of 17.5% in March, with over 1% coming just from this new product. More new
product activity is expected for the third quarter of this year, which you will hear about soon.
Turning then to Europe-South Pacific, we're very pleased with the organic sales growth of 1.5% in this region, the
strongest growth in five quarters. Innovation played a key role in the results. And from a macroeconomic standpoint,
we are cautiously optimistic. While Southern Europe still remains a challenge, it appears that Northern Europe is
showing modest signs of recovery.
Our market shares increased in many Oral Care categories, up in toothpaste, battery brushes, and electric toothbrushes.
We're very pleased with the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer, the biggest
innovation against cavities since the introduction of fluoride more than 50 years ago, and we're off to a good start. After
only six weeks in market in Denmark, we've achieved a 3.8% share, after two weeks in Norway a 3.2% share, and after
two weeks in Portugal a full point. And in Australia, our latest four-week share is 5.4%. We'll continue to roll out this
product across the region.
We told you last quarter about the launch of Colgate Max White One Optic toothpaste. This quarter we have
relaunched our Colgate Max White One mouthwash with an advanced stain prevention system to seal out the stains and
seal in the natural whiteness. And as you would expect, this is being supported by a fully integrated marketing
campaign in synergy with the toothpaste.
Also launching this quarter is Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal toothbrush, first developed in Asia, which has 17 times
slimmer tip bristles with charcoal for better cleaning between your teeth and along the gum line.
An interesting opportunity for us in the Personal Care category is the entry into the kids' body wash category, where we
currently have no offering. This subcategory is growing around 8%, outpacing the overall category growth of 2%. And
the bundle, to be launched in the second quarter, uses playful graphics to appeal to children and a mild, natural formula
with a pediatrician-approved claim to appeal to their parents.
A seasonal launch expected to provide additional distribution is Palmolive Sensação do Brasil.
This line of shower gels seizes on Europeans' passion for football and the resulting interest in
Brazilian culture, heightened around this summer's World Cup. A combination of unique fragrances, natural
ingredients, and attractive graphics should deliver heightened impact in the store.
Our Home Care business in Europe is strong with leading brands such as Ajax and Soupline. Under the Ajax brand, we
are launching Ajax All Usage Gel, one cleaner to clean your entire house. The formula has a concentrated efficacy, and
the bottle has a versatile press and dosage cap.
Turning to Latin America, momentum continues across the region with another quarter of double-digit organic growth.
This solid innovation has allowed us to maintain our strong leading shares in toothpaste and toothbrushes. And our

mouthwash market share was up 0.5% year to date behind successful launches such as Plax Tea Fresh and Plax 2 in 1.
Market shares increased as well in fabric conditioner, hand dish, and liquid cleaners.
In Brazil, our year-to-date toothpaste share remains over 71%. As you know, this was one of the lead countries for our
launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with NeutrAzucar toothpaste. Shipments started in October of last year.
And our 2014 share year to date is 2.2%, with the most recent read at almost 3%. Our leading Brazilian toothbrush
share reached a record 33.1% on a year-to-date basis, fueled by good performance in our premium end of the business.
Our Brazilian bar soap business achieved a record market-leading share of 26.5% on a year-to-date basis. New products
in both the Palmolive and Protex lines have helped achieve this result.
In Mexico, we saw a standout performance in our underarm protection business, with our year-to-date share increasing
30 basis points to 19.6%, the highest in almost a decade. We told you about the launch of Men's Speed Stick Stress
Defense Deodorant last quarter, and we have more innovation slated for the second quarter.
In fact, new product activity is planned for the second quarter across categories throughout Latin
America. Building on the insight that many consumers think about toothpaste as taking care of their teeth and not the
rest of the mouth, we have launched a new integrated marketing campaign to support Colgate Total, which explains its
benefit of protecting all areas of the mouth to give 100% confidence. In the whitening category, we are launching
Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothpaste, with the benefit of three shades whiter teeth with the same whitening
ingredient dentists use. And of course, we will continue the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar
Acid Neutralizer toothpaste across the region.
In Personal Care, we're launching Protex Omega 3 bar soaps, liquid soaps, and shower gels. Its formula with
moisturizers helps keep your family's skin healthier while eliminating 99.9% of bacteria. As well, we will be
introducing Lady Speed Stick Aclarado Perfecto plus Vitamin E Deodorant. Its formula, with vitamin E and mother of
pearl extracts, helps show your natural skin tone while blocking sweat.
And in the Home Care category, we have taken an idea from a Palmolive launch in the U.S. market. In Latin America,
using the Axion equity for hand dishwashing liquid, we launched Axion Good Bye Odors. Residues from dishes and
sponges can cause bad odors, and this new product eliminates the bacteria that may cause these odors.
Turning then to Asia, organic sales growth in Asia continues to be robust, increasing 7.5% in the quarter. New products
supported by an increase in advertising have driven top line growth and market share gains. And across the region, we
increased our market shares in manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, and shampoo.
In India, our toothpaste market share is up 60 basis points to 53.8% on a year-to-date basis, even in the face of
heightened competition. Our toothbrush shares there are up as well, up 140 basis points to 44.5% year to date. Strong
communication and trade plans have helped drive these results.
In China, we remain the market leader in toothpaste by a wide margin at over 34% year to date.
Our Chinese toothbrush shares increased as well, up 70 basis points to over 26% year to date.
Malaysia was our lead market in Asia for the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid
Neutralizer toothpaste. That new product, introduced in February of this year, as well as other premium bundles, helped
lift our toothpaste share 60 basis points to 73.4% on a year-to-date basis.
In the second quarter, we will be rolling out into new markets some of the innovation that has already helped drive
growth elsewhere in the region: Colgate Total Charcoal Deep Clean toothpaste; Colgate 360 Charcoal toothbrush; and
Colgate Slim Soft Dual Action toothbrush.
Africa and Eurasia, organic sales growth continued to be robust in this region. As mentioned in the press release, some
of the strength came from Russia even in the face of all the turmoil in that country. Our innovation in this region
continues to drive growth as elsewhere.

In the toothpaste category, innovation in Russia has helped us to maintain our market leading share of over 32% year to
date. Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste was launched there recently. Altai is a region of Russia known for its herbal
remedies. As a companion product, we also launched Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash, which has driven our
year-to-date mouthwash market share up almost two full points to 27.6%.
Our shower gel market share across this region is up over 1.5 points year to date. In Russia and Turkey, where we
launched Palmolive Gourmet Spa, our year-to-date market shares are up two points and 3.6 points respectively to
23.1% and 39.1%. You may recall this line of shower gels is highly experiential, with chocolate, vanilla, and
strawberry fragrances. In South Africa, Palmolive Thermal Spa Skin Renewal shower gel has contributed to a three
point share increase to 27.1% on a year-to-date basis.
Our innovation continues in the second quarter. In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Optic White Instant with
optical brighteners for a whiter smile and instantly visible whiter teeth.
I mentioned earlier the launch of Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste and mouthwash in Russia, where the Altai region is
well known for its herbal ingredients. Capitalizing on the success of this launch, we will be launching Palmolive Altai
Herbs bar soap, liquid hand soap, and shower gel. This mini-line of body cleansing is inspired by Altai authentic
recipes, and its formulas contain natural extracts of herbs to revive body and spirit. Also in Russia, in the underarm
category we will be launching Lady Speed Stick Altai Herbs Freshness, an antiperspirant in sprays, sticks, and roll-ons
that give your skin a superior feeling of natural purity and long-lasting freshness to keep you confident and active.
Hill's, we're very pleased with the continued solid results in our Hill's business, both domestically and overseas. An
important driver here in the U.S., as you know, has been the launch of Hill's Ideal Balance, and that continues to meet
with success. Consumption at the superstores is strong and growing – up 50% year to date over the prior year, and has
been helped by a wide array of innovation in the Naturals category.
In February, we launched 11 new dry variants, nine wet and three treats in both dog and cat: for dogs, Ideal Balance
Slim and Healthy and Ideal Balance Active; for cats, Ideal Balance Indoors, Ideal Balance Hairball, and Ideal Balance
Slim and Healthy. To support this innovation, this quarter we will continue with not only media but in-store support in
the superstores with impactful pallet displays as well as coupons offered by brand ambassadors and nutritional
consultants.
Our Hill's Science Diet business is strong as well. An interesting new marketing campaign is being implemented as we
speak at PetSmart, Paws for Health. Based on the shopper insight that pet parents know they don't take their pets to the
vet as often as they should but it is important to them to do what they can to ensure their pet has a longer, healthier life,
in-store consultants educate pet parents about the importance of preventative care for their pet and drive awareness and
provide trial sizes of Hill's Science Diet products in the Life Care product grouping.
Our Hill's Prescription Diet business is also doing well. We've told you about our Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic for
weight control. That has been met with terrific acceptance. We will continue the momentum on the business with
in-clinic activities, testimonial campaigns to drive vet endorsement, and sampling and new client starter kits.
As you know, the science behind our weight control is uniquely innovative. As mentioned above, we've leveraged it
with our Ideal Balance line and have launched weight control products in the Science Diet line as well.
And our robust new product program will continue throughout the year. We will be launching Hill's Ideal Balance
throughout Europe, where the Naturals category is just beginning. Another exciting innovation referenced in our press
release is Hill's Prescription Diet Stews, a breakthrough in wet food technology. The proprietary processing technique
and natural ingredients produce a therapeutic food for dogs and cats with delicious appearance and superior efficacy.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the way 2014 has started out. The momentum we saw as we exited 2013 has
continued in all regions of the world. Our new product pipeline is full across all categories. And our ongoing savings
programs as well as our global growth and efficiency program are providing funds to support that robust innovation.
And as we implement our global growth and efficiency program, our people are becoming even more focused on
winning on the ground each and every day. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go forward

throughout the year.
And now, Nancy, I would like to turn the call over to you to start the Q&A session.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: First, just a clarification. Bina mentioned you expected gross margin improvement each
quarter this year. Are you still expecting 75 to 125 basis points for the full year?
And then the real question is your toothpaste and toothbrush market share momentum looked like it slowed this quarter.
The toothpaste year-over-year share change was the worst we've seen recently. So I was just hoping for more detail on
what's driving that performance, particularly which geographies, and your view on if the share losses will continue
going forward or if that's more temporary factors in Q1.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay, Dara. Before I get to the gross margin, let me put the gross margin position in a broader
context and underscore a couple of the points that Bina has already made. First, we're very pleased with the first
quarter's top line performance, and we would reaffirm our target range of organic growth for the year at between 5%
and 7%. We think that is going to be a very strong range, particularly as our categories remain range-bound in Europe,
growing at between 1% and 2%, and similarly so in North America. And in our emerging markets, we see category
growth rates slowing slightly from a 6% to 8% range previously to now 5% to 7%. And the things we think will
continue to drive that organic rate of growth are innovation and of course the advertising, which was up absolutely and
as a percent to sales this quarter. And we expect it to be up absolutely and as a percentage to sales for the year.
Now very importantly of course, Dara, as you correctly point out, is the gross margin and what our expectations are for
gross margin during the year. We are still comfortable with a gross margin expansion of between 75 and 125 basis
points. But obviously, given recent foreign exchange volatility, which we have to react to and are, we would say that
our margin expansion will be at the lower end of that range, more in a 70 to 100 basis points band.
Our Funding the Growth program remains strong. And I think some were a little bit questioning our ability to take
pricing in Latin America in the fourth quarter. And I think you see in the first quarter what is the usual sequence in
these events, which is there is a lead/lag between the foreign exchange impact, particularly when it is as precipitous as
we saw in this first quarter, and you will see pricing continue across the balance of the year. And all of that led us to
reiterate our EPS guidance of 4% to 5% on a dollar basis for this year or double-digit currency neutral.
And on reading some of the earlier notes this morning, let me just walk through that reiteration. I think most of you will
remember that in our release at the end of January when we announced our fourth quarter results, we expressed growth
of EPS in line with the consensus of external analyst estimates at that time. And then in February, February 18 to be
precise, we made our disclosure and announcement on Venezuela and indicated from that prior position that the
Venezuela impact would be between $0.11 and $0.14 to EPS on the year, with the first quarter at $0.03 to $0.04. And
then of course, today we disclosed that the first quarter was $0.03, and we expect the rates going forward to be at the
same $0.03 per quarter, $0.12 on the year, consistent with the prior range and at that 4% to 5% dollar and double-digit
currency neutral rate.
To come to market share, a couple of comments on toothpaste; first of all, the shares that we talk about are dollar
weighted. That's the way we collect the data and aggregate it. And in Venezuela, we have an extremely elevated market
share. We're still trying to find the three Venezuelans that don't brush with our toothpaste. So given the currency moves
in Venezuela, about a third of the share decline that you highlighted, Dara, the 1.3%, is simply mathematical to do with

that dollar weighting.
The other two geographies of an operating nature are the U.S. and Mexico, as we have said before. And we said that
our innovation and some adjustments to our marketing program to meet the competitive promotional activity we saw in
both of those markets would be taken, and they have been taken. I think on the U.S. side, you had already commented
on the more recent consumption and share data that the toothpaste progress for Colgate is good. We continue to see that
in the near-term weekly data, and we expect that to continue going forward. The same actions have been taken in
Mexico, and we expect the same forward progress to strengthen our share in the 80% range. And in addition in Mexico,
we have just this month introduced the Superior anti-cavity toothpaste which, as been highlighted, has done very well
everywhere we have launched it.
Toothbrushes are affected by the same Venezuela calculation. Indeed, the modest 30 basis points decline you
highlighted, Dara, is entirely driven by the Venezuela mathematical calculation. All of our divisions are either flat to up
in market share with the exception of Africa-Eurasia, where we're responding to in South Africa and Russia specifically
local market activity which we fully expect to be reversed over time. So no, we do not expect or plan for those share
positions to continue as you laid them out.
Operator
Before we move to the next question, I'd like to remind the audience to limit yourself to one question. We'll go next to
Steve Powers with UBS.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Hi, Ian. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi Steve.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: I guess it was another solid quarter, as you said, of organic growth, 6.5% overall and
especially 10% in the emerging markets. How do you think about that relative to some of the outsized inflation that
we're seeing in certain markets, especially Latin America? If you agree with that characterization, especially in
Argentina and Venezuela, for example, how do you estimate that as adding to your organic growth? Or conversely, do
you believe it's really not that additive given the degree of volume and mix tradeoff in those same markets? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I would say if you look at the underpinning of volume in Latin America, for example, we view
that as very healthy. When you talk about outsized inflation in Venezuela, remember that is true from a macro point of
view. But by law in Venezuela, we're extremely restricted on our ability to take pricing across most of our business. So
I think we're very pleased with the progress. We view it to be real, substantive, and we see it continuing.
Operator
We'll move to the next question with Wendy Nicholson with Citi.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Wendy.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Good morning. I don't want to beat a dead horse on this pricing in Latin America thing,
but that's my question too. And the question is historically when there has been currency pressure in Latin America, the
pricing you've been able to take on an annual basis – I get that there's a lag. But on an annual basis, it's pretty much
close to a one-for-one offset. And my question is if you look at the 6% pricing you got in the first quarter versus the
16% currency headwind, how much of that is Venezuela, how much of that is just timing? If we're going see let's call it
a mid-teens currency headwind in Latin America, can you take anywhere close to that pricing ex-Venezuela? Because I
think everybody is just nervous that maybe the competitive dynamic is preventing you from taking as much pricing. If
you can answer that, that would be great.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay, the answer is no. It's not driven by competitive. As I said when we posted just over 2%
pricing in the fourth quarter, I think that question was raised. Are you now limited in terms of your ability to take
pricing? And the answer is no, we're not. and I think the first quarter demonstrated that in quite a healthy way,
remembering that we were not able in the first quarter given the move of some of the changes to take the pricing as
quickly as the exchange takes the costs up for transaction reasons.
In Venezuela, you frankly have to take Venezuela out of the equation because, for the majority of our business, we're
unable by law to take pricing. But we have demonstrated in the past. And I think with Venezuela to one side, as far as
the rest of Latin America is concerned, we have demonstrated an ability to price to offset the foreign exchange. Indeed
in the more recent term, the Brazilian exchange has turned a wee bit positive. But our plan would be, as it has been in
the past, to be able to offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange with pricing and Funding the Growth.

We'll move to the next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Actually again, I'm so sorry, but it's around this issue. I'm looking at Asia and Eurasia, where
the currency impact looked substantially worse than we were expecting. I guess there was deterioration towards the end
of the quarter. Do you expect to be able to get pricing in those markets as you move through the year?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: The answer is yes. The answer is yes. We will be able to take pricing in those markets. One has to
say exactly as you said, Caroline, that the precipitous nature of the currency moves in some of those geographies – I
come back to everyone's estimation of the year. I'm not sure I saw anybody planning on the Crimea and the impact of
Crimea on the Russian ruble, so some of those moves were really quite precipitous. But we have the capability to take
pricing. We have done so in some geographies already. And we have plans and indeed are right now taking pricing in
some of those markets to address the headwind of transactions. So we continue to have pricing capability. There is just
a natural lead/lag in terms of how quickly you can practically respond, particularly when the foreign exchanges move
so quickly. And I think in the world that we're in, our ability to plan for gross margin expansion of between 75 and 100
basis points attests to that capability.

We'll take the next question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey, thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey, Ian. I guess I wanted to ask you about the slowdown you just cited in developing and
emerging markets. And a point I guess is not a huge deal considering what we've seen elsewhere. But can you talk a
little bit about – is that isolated to any specific geographies? And what do you think is driving that specifically besides
maybe the obvious macro situation and maybe it's just that? And then also, why do you think you can gain more share
than you have been and sustain that top line growth rate in the face of a slower market relative to say what you thought
a couple quarters ago?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I guess, Chris, we're talking about fine differences here. We wanted to indicate that indeed we
have seen a little bit of a slowdown. Other comments I've read from others suggest sharper than we have seen certainly
in our businesses. I think it traces to the macros finally in these cases. There's nothing untoward that we have seen so
far in terms of consumer behavior. And I think our 5% to 7% range fits very nicely even with that slowdown. So I don't
think it puts any more pressure on our desire, need, or ability to build market share.

We'll move next to John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thank you. Ian, in looking at how your reported top line growth will track over the course of
the year and given the seasonality of the business, it's a little tough given the first quarter performance to get to the low
end of the range from a gross margin standpoint. Can you walk us through sequentially how we should think about this
progressing through the year and what the big changes are from Q1 to the balance of the year, if it's just more efficacy
from the additional pricing, what have you? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay. I can't resist, John. I thought you were one that was questioning whether we could deliver
the gross margin expansion. But let me start.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Okay.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: You can come back at me at the end, John. Let me start with the traditional roll-forward, just so
that we have that as a starting point. And then I will try and answer your question from there. Obviously, it's flat, so the
start point was the same 58.6% as it is this year. We picked up 0.5 point from pricing. We picked up 1.4 points from
our Funding the Growth and a little bit of restructuring. Material prices was a headwind of two points. A large part of
that, as we have already discussed, was transaction. There was a modest 10 bps from other, leading us to the 58.6%.
So I would say the three main buckets of progress for the year, quite obviously, are pricing, where we expect to get
more pricing and therefore more contribution the gross profit; our Funding the Growth along with a little bit from
restructuring. And you know that our Funding the Growth tends to build over the year, and that would be the second
major aspect of building our gross margin. And by talking about 75 to 100 basis points, all I was trying to do was to
frame coming off the high end of the range. We're not suggesting a 75 basis point increase in gross margin.

We'll take the next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thank you, I appreciate it, one quick question on housekeeping. Is it fair to assume that net
interest expense will be similar to the Q1 rate going forward, or were there any anomalies to call out this quarter?
And then on Hill's, I noticed that the margin was up for the first time in the last five quarters. In the press release, you
did cite a number of puts and takes, but one of them was lower ad spend. So was this just a function of comping against
heightened spending a year ago as you prepped for the new line or is there a shift in timing of spending, or do you think
there's just not a need to spend as much behind pet as you did before? If that's the case, does the changing of hands for
Iams change your thought process in any way on that? Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Changing of pools I guess for Iams. But on your housekeeping question on net interest, the net
interest expense we think will go up on the year. We'll probably be in the $35 million to $40 million range for the year,
largely due to changes in capital structure, as we have taken on some longer-term debt at very attractive rates, planning
ahead to a world where rates are likely to increase, so yes but planned fully as part as readjusting our capital structure.
Hill's is timing. Bina talked about some of the innovation on the Hill's business, and the spending will readjust. First
quarter was strong last year because the timing of the innovation was earlier. So no, we're very committed to our Hill's
innovation flow, which is very strong and frankly doing very well in market.

We'll move next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi, guys, so just a quick clarification and then a core question. The clarification is, Ian, I want to
give you the opportunity of setting Venezuela to the side and just, if you could, tell us what volume and organic growth
would have been in Latin America ex-Venezuela.

And then the other question, so you say the EPS growth of 4% to 5% – in fact, I think the thing that since February at
least for the year is still above consensus. And I know you guys in the background, your team does a really good job of
picking over our models and looking at it. And I'm trying to understand if you guys have a perspective on where you
think consensus is too high. Is it just currencies, or are there other things that you'd like us to be pointed to?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks for the opportunity to separate LatAm growth from Venezuela, but I shall politely decline
that. We don't break it out in that way. I would say that we think, if you think about where Venezuela was three, four
years ago, as you well know, it is a substantially smaller portion of our corporation than it was then. And the Latin
American growth we think is very, very strong overall.
In terms of the second point, Ali, yes, you're right. The 4% to 5%, as we tried to reemphasize at the beginning of the
call, has been where we have been. And there is nothing in that reiteration of guidance for the year that reflects
anything other than foreign exchange. And I would clarify and say that is the foreign exchange that analysts reacted to
in January of the year with the Venezuela change, which by the way, I think, makes our Venezuelan reporting more
conservative than some who have stayed at the VEF 6.30 per dollar rate. And it remains double digit in terms of the
EPS growth in local currency terms. And in fact, for the year looking forward after Venezuela, we see the currency
impact for the year at around 5%, which was pretty much where we had it beforehand. So there's no incremental
currency. It merely reflects actions taken through February of this year. So it is entirely currency related; there's
nothing else.

The next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, how are you?
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: I'm good. So the cash balance is massive, right. It's 2x what you've done historically.
What's the plan with all that cash because you certainly don't need it? Working capital is getting better. You're super
cash generative. I know you talked about rates going up and wanting to lock in some fixed rate debt. But is there a use
for all that cash?
And then second part of the question is – well not even the second part of the same question but a second question, is
there a plan or a way to get Venezuela profitable again? I know it lost money this quarter. But is there anything you
could do either structurally or strategically to get that to turn positive again? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, the cash balance, entirely timing, entirely timing. It's related to when we took the debt. It will
be washed out as we go through the year. Debt and cash will get back in balance. Net debt will end up in the same
place, so nothing strategic, merely timing.
With Venezuela, it is, as you say, modestly, it was a very modest negative for Venezuela in the first quarter. And
obviously, we're in very constructive dialogue with the government at this time about the need for relaxation of the
pricing laws and for some pricing in order to make business in Venezuela profitable again. And we're hopeful that
those discussions will lead to a productive outcome. And that outcome of course, which has been our usual model in
the rest of Latin America, allows one to offset the gross margin pressure and see that translate through on the bottom
line. So those are the issues. You know of course that the first quarter was hit particularly by the historical one-time hit.
And that will come out across the balance of the year anyway, so we'll be in a better position than we were in the first
quarter. But a step change would be driven by pricing.

<Q - William B. Chappell>: Good morning. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: How are you? A question on or the comment on the sugar – I always get the name wrong
– but the cavity protection toothpaste that you're rolling out. The comment that you're moving more throughout Europe
and maybe to Australia, are there plans at least in the near term to go to UK, Germany, France, some of the bigger
countries maybe in the next quarter or two? And is it contributing to the overall European growth at this point, or is it
still really too small?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: To answer the last part of the – actually, you don't have to get the name right, Bill, you just have
to buy it.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: I can't yet.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: That's true; travel. In terms of Europe, it is too early. We can say that in countries like Brazil,
Turkey, Australia, as Bina said, it has added to share nicely. We're expanding in Mexico, as we've said. You will see
continued expansion across Europe, and some of the other emerging markets you could expect across the balance of the
year. So we'll be moving quite broadly with this product. The reaction seems so far quite positive.

We'll take the next question from Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning. My question relates to raw material costs. I noticed that in most regions, they
were essentially a headwind to margins in the quarter, except in Europe where they were a tailwind. I wonder. Is that all
due to currencies, or are there other differences, for example, in the portfolio composition, as well? And then related to
that, do you expect a similar headwind from raw material costs for the remainder of the year?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Let me react to both. I would say what we saw in the first quarter was indeed largely driven by
foreign exchange, which is why we saw such positive progress in Europe. I think framing raw materials overall, we're
expecting for the year raw and packing materials to increase by between 1% and 2% for the year. That's raw and
packing for the year. And as I had mentioned earlier, our ability to deliver the gross margin expansion that we're
planning is going to be driven by pricing, which we have already to a certain extent and will deliver going forward to
offset that foreign exchange impact on raw and packing materials.
Operator
We'll move to the next question. It comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Hello, good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions, one on the restructuring. It seems
like it was a big chunk this first quarter, about 40% of what you planned for the year. Does it mean that you are taking a
faster pace than originally planned in order to navigate this issue of the currency?
And the other question has to do with Hill's, certainly very good performance. To what extent does that has to do with
the changes in planogram that PetSmart did? Shall we continue seeing that at least for another quarter, where we're
going to see strong growth from Hill's? Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks, Javier. No, there's nothing particular about restructuring in terms of – it's just timing. Our
full year, full program ranges remain the same, both at the cost and the benefit end. We don't manhandle the
restructuring to try and address foreign exchange issues. I think the point we made when we announced it was it would
simply give us some agility and flexibility knowing that, given the volatility of foreign exchanges and therefore costs,
quarters might be a little bit lumpy.

Indeed on Hill's, you are correct, Javier. In the U.S. we had some quite meaningful planogram resets which have been
positive, which underpin the increase that Bina talked about a little bit earlier. And we continue to feel good about
seeing our Hill's business go forward mid-single digits organic, as we have spoken before. And the reasons, the
planogram reset is good. What will get you the planogram reset is the quality of the innovation and trial generation that
you can create for that innovation. As we have said before, we think we have a very rich innovation pipeline now
which is moving to the market.

We'll move to Alec Patterson with AGI.
<Q - Alec Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Alec.
<Q - Alec Patterson>: Hi. So just quickly on the 75 and 100 basis points, I think I'm crystallizing this into it's
predominantly a move to the lower end because of currency; in other words, the other components, pricing that you've
been planning all along, commodity costs that are basically dollar commodity based, raw and pack, and then anything
from Funding the Growth productivity haven't changed.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Correct, correct.

It looks like we'll take our final question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey. Good morning, folks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Thank you for allowing the question.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Sure.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Two quick ones, first a quick housekeeping question. Can you quantify how much the
advance customer shipments in Japan contributed to pet growth this quarter?
And then the other question is back here at home, North America. We've been seeing solid growth both out of the
measured data as well as clearly in your reported results today. When we slice and dice the measured data, around 70%
of the growth has been coming from mouthwash; market share up year on year but running stagnant, flat-lined
sequentially at 6%. Two months from now, you'll start rolling over that 7% share that you got on the initial surge trial
building. So how should we think about growth on a go-forward? What are the initiatives that can maybe get
mouthwash another leg higher or that can kick some other categories into a higher growth mode to drive more
contribution for them? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks, Jason. On mouthwash, as you know, I talked about the toothpaste change in momentum.
Obviously, the toothbrush business share up over 41% is terrific. That of course is the second largest category in Oral
Care. Mouthwash, we're pleased where we're. Two things will continue to grow our business in mouthwash; number
one, innovation and the variants that come with that innovation, which we have seen; we will continue to see. The
second is interesting. In the U.S., there are always packaging sizes in terms of retail environments and consumer
purchasing habits. You will see more of that as the year unfolds. And most importantly, trial generating devices; we
know the repeat rate of the business is high. We know that it takes over two years to build your trial curve, and we will
continue to be putting money behind that. So we have a great product. We can add to the product, and we will be
focusing on building trial.

In terms of Japan, no, we don't break out at the country level. Suffice to say on Japan, I think it was Ali on the last call
was questioning the trajectory of that business. We've had some folks in Japan only a couple of weeks ago going
through a thorough review of that business. And there is confidence I would express that notwithstanding the pull
forward that we have our Japanese business now for Hill's on a solid footing and a positive underlying trajectory, and
we will see that in the coming quarters.
