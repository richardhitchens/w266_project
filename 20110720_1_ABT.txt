In today's conference call, as we do always, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help our investors
understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be
available on our website at abbott.com.
I'd also like to call your attention to a supplemental slide deck that we'll be posting to our website after our call
concludes today. It includes highlights of Abbott's recent pipeline progress and a more detailed list of information
on-related market opportunities. And while these slides are not intended to be a comprehensive overview of our
broad-based pipeline, our goal here is to provide investors with additional color on certain opportunities across our
emerging portfolio. And we plan to build on this supplemental information as we go forward, in future quarters. So,
consider this a starting point and we hope you find it useful.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, John. Today we're pleased to report strong second quarter results as we delivered ongoing earnings per share
of $1.12, up 10.9% and at the high end of our previous guidance. And we raised our full-year EPS guidance range,
confirming our outlook for double-digit growth in 2011. We're also pleased with the progress we have seen from our
broad-based pipeline so far this year. We have launched a number of new products or indications across the company,
advanced two promising compounds into Phase III development, submitted three significant new products or
indications for regulatory review, and added a mid-stage biologic for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis
to the pipeline.
Sales growth in the quarter was 9%, including a favorable 4.6% impact from exchange rates. Growth in the quarter was
led by a 13% increase in Proprietary Pharmaceuticals, including strong global performance from HUMIRA, which was
up nearly 19% before exchange. And our emerging market sales in the quarter were nearly $2.6 billion, an increase of
more than 23%, underscoring the contribution of these markets to Abbott's overall growth profile.
Durable Growth business sales increased 7.5% driven by double-digit growth in International Nutritionals,
Point-of-Care Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals. And innovation-driven device business sales increased
3.1%, including double-digit growth in molecular diagnostics.
Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 60.2%, ahead of our previous
forecast, driven by improved product mix. The ongoing tax rate of 15.2% was in line with our previous forecast for the
quarter.
Turning to our outlook for 2011, today we're raising our ongoing earnings per share guidance for the full year to $4.58
to $4.68. The midpoint of this guidance range continues to reflect double-digit ongoing EPS growth for 2011. For the
third quarter, today we're issuing ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.16 to $1.18. The midpoint of this EPS
range represents more than 10% growth over the prior year. We forecast specified items of $0.18 in the third quarter,
primarily reflecting integration costs from past acquisitions and costs of previous restructuring actions. We're
forecasting low double-digit sales growth in the third quarter, including an estimated favorable impact from exchange
of approximately 3.5% and we're forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 60%. Also for the third quarter,
we're forecasting R&D investment approaching 10% of sales and SG&A of around 28% of sales.
Regarding our tax rate, we're continuing to forecast a full-year 2011 rate approaching 15% with third quarter between
14.5% and 15%. So, in summary, we're pleased with our performance through the first half of this year. We have
delivered on our commitments, raised our guidance range, and confirmed our strong outlook for 2011. We have made
steady progress in our broad-based pipeline with new approvals, regulatory filings, and late-stage trial initiations. And
we continue to see strong results from our strategic actions to expand our emerging markets' presence across the
businesses.
With that, I'll turn it over to John and Larry for the business operating highlights. John?

John B. Thomas
Thanks, Tom. Today Larry and I will walk you through as we did last quarter, our three business categories. Let me
start with our durable growth and innovation driven device businesses, and then Larry will give you an overview of our
Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business, as well as our pharmaceutical pipeline.
Sales growth will be discussed on a reported basis, which includes the impact of foreign exchange. Let me start with
our durable growth businesses. In Established Pharmaceuticals, which includes international sales of our branded
generics portfolio, we reported global sales of more than $1.3 billion. More than half of EPD sales are in emerging
markets, which this quarter were $775 million, up 25%. Our large portfolio of established pharmaceuticals consists of
hundreds of branded generic products spanning primary care therapeutic categories. The depth of our portfolio, and the
diversity of our geographic footprint help us drive durable, sustainable performance. We expect more than $5 billion in
Established Pharmaceutical sales in 2011.
In our worldwide nutritional business, global sales increased 5.4% this quarter driven by double-digit growth
internationally. In the United States, as we've have mentioned previously, we planned for a difficult comparison in our
U.S. Nutritional business during the first half of this year as we worked to recapture share in our infant formula
business. U.S. Nutritional sales, as a result, were down 3.5% in the second quarter, which was in line with our forecast,
slightly better. We continue to hold the number one infant formula share position in hospitals, which drives
consumption at the retail level. And we're making good progress in our efforts to return our retail share to pre-recall
levels. And we anticipate better sales growth for the U.S. Nutrition business in the second half of the year. PediaSure in
the quarter grew strong double-digits driven by continued success of our new SideKicks brand.
In our U.S. adult nutrition business, we saw continued momentum from the new line extensions of our Ensure brand.
Outside of the U.S., Nutritional sales increased 14% this quarter. Growth was driven by continued strong growth in
emerging markets, which comprised the majority of our international Nutrition sales.
This quarter our emerging market sales for the Nutritions business were $630 million, up 16%. This was driven by
strong performance in Asian and Latin American markets where we continue to launch new products, increase
penetration, and capture market growth.
For the full-year 2011, we're forecasting more than $2 billion in emerging market nutritional sales, which we expect to
double over the next five years. In China alone, we expect nutrition sales to reach $1 billion by 2014.
So as we look ahead to the third quarter in our global Nutritions business, we expect worldwide sales to accelerate to
double-digit growth, with U.S. sales up mid-single-digits and international sales up strong double-digits.
In our global diabetes business this quarter, worldwide sales increased 2.7%. U.S. sales increased more than 4%, and
international sales were up approximately 2%. We received CE Mark in May for our new FreeStyle InsuLinx blood
glucose monitor, which includes a meal time insulin calculator. InsuLinx is designed to help provide suggested insulin
dosing advice for patients with diabetes who require insulin to manage their condition. So, as we look ahead to the third
quarter in global diabetes, we expect high single-digit revenue growth.
In our core Laboratory Diagnostics business, which includes immunoassay and hematology, global sales increased 8%.
U.S. sales increased 4.4% driven by strong growth of our ARCHITECT platform. Outside of the U.S., we saw strong
growth in emerging markets, up 9% in the quarter. This was driven by double-digit growth in Asia, including strong
sales in China. So, as a look ahead to the third quarter in our core Laboratory Diagnostic business, we expect high
single-digit growth.
In our Point of Care Diagnostics business, sales this quarter increased 17%, driven by strong troponin, and the Chem8
test cartridge sales. For the third quarter in Point of Care Diagnostics, we expect another quarter of strong double-digit
growth.

I'll now turn to our innovation driven device businesses. Starting with Molecular Diagnostics, where global sales in the
quarter increased more than 18%, driven by international sales growth of more than 30%. During the quarter, we placed
our one-thousandth m2000 analyzer.
One of our core strategies in Molecular Diagnostics is to advance the field of companion diagnostics or personalized
medicine. On that front, we developed a molecular test to pair with Pfizer's drug in development for non-small cell lung
cancer. We recently submitted this ALK gene test for regulatory review in the U.S. and Japan.
Also in the quarter, we received FDA approval for a real-time PCR molecular test for measuring the viral load of
hepatitis C, completing our core menu on the m2000. So, as we look ahead to the third quarter in Molecular
Diagnostics, we expect strong double-digit growth.
In our vision care business, worldwide sales this quarter increased 7.5%. Globally, we continue to gain share in our
cataract business with our TECNIS multi-focal and mono-focal IOLs. We also continue to grow share in our corneal
business with our new RevitaLens contact lens solution, which is doing quite well, and has gained approximately 6%
share points since the beginning of the year. As we look ahead to the third quarter in our vision care business, we
expect high single-digit sales growth.
In our vascular business, worldwide sales in the second quarter were $835 million, slightly ahead of the expectations
and outlook we provided last quarter. In our international vascular sales, which is more than half of our total vascular
sales business, we saw 25% growth in emerging markets. International markets comprised two-thirds of the global
drug-eluting stent market, and in emerging markets, procedure volume is growing on average at a mid-teens rate.
Abbott is particularly well-positioned internationally, and we've seen impressive performance with both XIENCE and
our next-generation XIENCE PRIME drug-eluting stent.
Our global DES franchise sales, which includes XIENCE sales, as well as third party DES revenues were
approximately $485 million in the second quarter. Global XIENCE sales increased both sequentially and
year-over-year. This was offset in the quarter by a double-digit decline in third party DES revenues. XIENCE remains
the number one drug-eluting extent globally with worldwide market share of approximately 35%.
In the quarter, we continued to advance our leadership position with the U.S. launch of XIENCE nano, our stent for
small vessels. The small vessel segment of the market represents approximately 10% of all the vessels that are treated,
so this is a new market segment where we can now compete with XIENCE nano. We expect this new product will help
us continue to gain XIENCE share over the next several months.
Our Endovascular and Other Coronary businesses, which comprise approximately 40% of our vascular sales, also
performed well in the quarter. We have had multiple new product launches in numerous new geographies over the past
year, which has helped drive good momentum through the first half. The first quarter launch of our new TREK balloon
catheters in the U.S. and Japan, following a successful launch in Europe last year drove double-digit sales growth of
our balloon segment in the quarter.
Solid endovascular sales also positively impacted the second quarter, led by sales in vessel closure and our Armada 14
balloon line. An expanded indication for our RX Acculink Carotid Stent also contributed to positive momentum.
In our vascular pipeline, XIENCE PRIME, our next-generation drug-eluting stent, continues to perform well
internationally as we expand our global DES leadership position. PRIME provides physicians with enhanced
deliverability on a best-in-class DES platform. We now expect approval and launch of PRIME in the United States in
the first half of 2012.
MitraClip is our minimally invasive device approved in Europe, Australia, Singapore, and other countries for the
treatment of select patients with mitral regurgitation. In the U.S., it's currently under FDA review. As part of our
ongoing dialog with the agency, we're providing them additional information and analysis. Subsequent to this review,
we'll be in a better position to estimate timing.
Also in our vascular pipeline is our ABSORB bioresorbable vascular scaffold. It's designed to slowly metabolize and
eventually be absorbed by the body after providing support to the vessel during the healing process, leaving no

permanent metallic implant behind. It received CE Mark in January and a full-scale launch in Europe is planned by the
end of 2012. So, as we look ahead to the third quarter in our global vascular business, we now expect mid-single-digit
sales growth.
So with that, I'll turn the call over at this time, to Larry for a review of our Proprietary Pharmaceutical business and a
few pipeline highlights as well. Larry?
Larry Peepo
Thanks, John. As a reminder, earlier this year we globalized our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business creating one
division to allow for streamlined commercial efforts and coordination between functions.
Worldwide Proprietary Pharmaceutical sales increased 13% in the quarter driven by growth of 9% in the U.S. and 19%
internationally. In immunology, global HUMIRA sales increased more than 18% before the favorable impact of
exchange. Performance was driven by international sales growth of 19% before exchange and U.S. sales growth of
more than 18%, consistent with the underlying trends we saw throughout the quarter.
Demand for HUMIRA continues to outpace the global market, and new competitive entrants are tracking in line with
our expectations for these products. Internationally, double-digit market growth continues in the major European
countries where HUMIRA holds the number 1 share position. And HUMIRA growth in the U.S. continues to outpace
the market.
We're continuing our development efforts for HUMIRA, including the study of new indications and product
enhancements. Our regulatory applications for ulcerative colitis are currently under review, and we're evaluating other
indications currently in mid to late-stage development. We also continue to introduce new indications in geographies
around the world. We recently received approval for our fifth indication in Japan for HUMIRA, juvenile idiopathic
arthritis, or JIA.
With an outstanding clinical profile across our full range of indications and more than 14 years of clinical experience,
we continue to be well-positioned for success in this market. HUMIRA is off to a strong start this year, and based on
this performance, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our forecast. We expect high-teens
reported global sales growth for HUMIRA in 2011, up from our original expectations of low-teens growth.
Moving on to our lipid franchise where sales of Niaspan were $247 million. While it is still early, we have seen a
modest impact to prescription trends beginning late in the quarter following the discontinuation of the AIM-HIGH trial
in late May. Physician feedback from experienced Niaspan users and key opinion leaders continues to be favorable
regarding the value of Niaspan and treating HDL.
U.S. sales of TRILIPIX/TriCor increased more than 3%. Global sales of AndroGel and CREON were $227 million and
$149 million, respectively.
During the quarter, Abbott received FDA approval for AndroGel 1.62%. The new low-volume formulation provides
patients with a more convenient application process, delivering rapid and sustained improvements in testosterone levels
with less gel than the previous formulation.
CREON maintains a leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market, and over the past year we've captured
significant market share in the U.S. We continue to garner the vast majority of new prescription starts in this category.
Last month, we received FDA approval for an infant specific dose of CREON. This new dose provides the lowest
approved dosage strength in the class and enables more precise titration.
Moving on to two consistent performers within our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals portfolio, Synthroid and Lupron, U.S.
sales of Lupron were up 12%. Last month Abbott announced FDA approval for a new six-month formulation of Lupron
Depot, expanding dosing options. We expect more than $750 million in total global Lupron sales in 2011. And U.S.
sales of Synthroid remain strong at $140 million. We expect more than $450 million in total U.S. Synthroid sales this
year.

So as we look ahead to the third quarter in our global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business, we expect high single-digit
sales growth, including mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. and another quarter of strong double-digit growth
internationally.
Moving on to our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals pipeline, where, as Tom mentioned, we continue to make good progress.
We currently have more than 20 new compounds or indications in Phase II or III development across oncology,
immunology, HCV, neuroscience and pain management, and other areas of significant medical need.
Let's start with chronic kidney disease or the loss of kidney function, which is on the rise driven by higher rates of
diabetes, obesity, and an aging population. We're leveraging our decades of expertise in renal disease to address this
highly prevalent condition. Last month, Phase II bardoxalone data were published in the New England Journal of
Medicine and presented at a European renal meeting. These data showed that bardoxalone produced sustained
improvements in kidney function over 52 weeks in patients with moderate to severe CKD and type-2 diabetes. And last
month, we initiated the global Phase III clinical program for bardoxalone with our partner company. Results from this
1600 patient study are expected in 2013 with potential commercialization in the 2014 timeframe.
We also continue to make significant progress with our internal hepatitis C program. The HCV treatment landscape is
expected to continue to evolve considerably over the next several years, and we believe we're in a position to become a
significant player. We have three mechanisms of action in Phase II development, including protease, polymerase and
NS5A inhibitors. Over the past year, our HCV program has moved quickly and will continue to progress throughout the
year as we have a number of combination trials underway, including studies with and without interferon.
In neuroscience, we're developing compounds to address conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's,
schizophrenia, pain, and MS. A Phase III study of daclizumab, a next-generation biologic being evaluated in MS is
currently underway. Abbott and our partner company expect to present Phase II data for daclizumab at a European
clinical meeting in October.
We are also continuing development of an intestinal gel known as Duodopa internationally for advanced Parkinson's
disease. It's currently in Phase III development in the U.S. and is already on the market in most European countries
where adoption of this novel system is continuing to grow. We recently presented interim data from a Phase III open
label study of Duodopa showing patients reported an increase in the amount of time when disease symptoms were well
managed.
In immunology, we're leveraging our experience with HUMIRA to identify novel approaches to improve therapeutic
outcomes for patients with autoimmune diseases. We continue our work on HUMIRA and plan to introduce a cadence
of new indications over the next several years. Beyond ulcerative colitis, we have two additional indications in Phase II
or III studies, including uveitis and a chronic skin disease that most commonly affects the sweat glands. All told, we
expect new indications to drive more than $1 billion in incremental peak year sales.
Our pipeline also includes early development work in oral DMARD therapies and biologics. And our proprietary
DVD-Ig technology brings the capability of uniting two antibodies in a single agent. We expect our first combination
biologic to move into Phase I clinical trials by year-end.
Last month Abbott entered into an agreement with Biotest to develop and commercialize a novel anti-CD4 biologic,
which is currently in Phase II clinical trials for RA and psoriasis. Our goal with this agreement and all of our R&D and
licensing efforts in immunology is to raise the bar with differentiated efficacy.
Endometriosis and fibroids are both associated with a multitude of symptoms, including pain and infertility. Our
partnered compound, Elagolix, has a unique profile that provides symptom reduction while avoiding significant bone
loss or other adverse effects that can sometimes be associated with current treatments. We're working with regulators to
finalize the Phase III clinical program for endometriosis, and the Phase II clinical program for fibroids with a target of
trial initiation near year-end.
We also continue to make good progress in oncology. Our pipeline includes 11 new molecular entities for more than a
dozen different cancer types. Elotuzumab has demonstrated very good response rates in multiple myeloma, the second

most common blood cancer in the U.S. We recently began the Phase III program for elotuzumab with our partner
company.
Our multi targeted kinase inhibitor seeks to cut off the blood supply to a tumor to stop the progression of cancer. A
Phase III study of this compound in liver cancer is underway. And our PARP-inhibitor, which may enhance the
effectiveness of cancer therapies, is being studied in mid-stage trials for a variety of cancer types.
So in summary, this quarter Abbott delivered strong double-digit performance with ongoing EPS growth of 11%, at the
high end of our previous guidance range. And we raised our ongoing EPS outlook for the full year reflecting
double-digit growth over 2010 at the midpoint of the range.
So with that, Tom, John and I will be glad to take your questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Thank you. Maybe just a couple items just to clarify. One, you had a very good quarter
for HUMIRA, and you raised your HUMIRA guidance for the year. So, if you could provide any color on what you
think is going on in the underlying markets both in the U.S. and OUS that would be appreciated.
And then second, one item that we're struggling a bit with is if we look at the international pharmaceutical
performance, HUMIRA as we noted was very strong, but it looks like there's a pretty meaningful drop-off in sales of
other products once you kind of back out HUMIRA, and then some of the other products that you list in the press
release. So, if you can give any color there as to what's going on. Are those old Solvay products that are dropping off?
Any insights would be appreciated. Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, this is Tom. For HUMIRA we're seeing really globally good market performance
to start with. In the U.S. in particular, growth rates have picked up this year. And that is certainly bolstering the
product. And in international, as you know, growth rates have been quite a bit stronger than the U.S., and they have
continued to be in mid-teens or even better growth rates. So, certainly that is helping support the product.
We're also executing quite well in the businesses in terms of share performance. Most significantly in the derm, and the
gastro areas, but we're also seeing some progress in RA as well, despite the fact that there's a fair amount of
competition in that space. So, globally we're just seeing good market growth, good share performance, and very good
execution on the part of our business people.
And, you know, on the question on pharma growth, I think if you look at most of the products, you know, we're seeing
pretty strong growth across them in the quarter. So, maybe you could be a little more specific about exactly what your
question is in pharma growth.
<A - Larry Peepo>: This is Larry. Kaletra had a good quarter, so did HUMIRA obviously. There's not that many
products actually in the proprietary business any longer. Again, a lot of the Solvay products other than say Duodopa
have moved over into the established pharma business. So, you know, most of the other products, as Tom said, had
pretty good quarters.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Well, if you look at – I'm sorry, but just to dive in here, but if you looked at international
pharma, and you backed out HUMIRA, and you backed out Kaletra, and let's say Lupron just for kicks as well, you
would get that the balance of that international pharma piece is down about $250 million year-over-year. So, about a
$600 million business last year is now about a $350 million business once you strip out the stuff that you guys report.
So, I was just hoping to get some color on the products that are going away. Is that old Solvay business that you guys
have decided to stop marketing? Because that is pulling down your international pharma growth by a fair amount.

<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, certainly within established pharmaceuticals, there are a handful of products that
are at the end of their life. Lansoprazole, for example, in a couple markets has gone off patent. But in terms of Abbott,
those are relatively minor. There's been a little bit of Solvay-related turbulence, shall we say, as we work through the
products that are remaining in the portfolio, compared to those that are going to be – you know, we're no longer going
to be promoting. But I would only – it's very selective, relatively minor, and really I'd say that anything that is – that
you're talking about is really being worked through in the first half here and is not representative of what we expect in
terms of growth rates for these businesses going into the third and fourth quarters, so there was a little bit of that, Mike,
but really not significant to our performance in the quarter.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay. And then on the emerging market numbers that you guys are now providing, so
you reported 23% emerging market sales growth, Tom, do you have any kind of estimate on what that would be if we
looked at it on an organic basis? So if we tried to adjust for currency and for the timing of the Piramal deal?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, in terms of M&A, the only impact in there is Piramal. As you know, we fully
lapped Solvay. So, that does not have an impact. And you have a pretty good idea what our annual sales through
Piramal are. You know, exchange generally speaking is lower in the emerging markets than it is for the overall
company. Obviously, the positive currency in the quarter was mainly due to yen and euro. So, I don't have a precise
number for you, but I think you can factor in less exchange in those businesses than what you're seeing broadly across
Abbott and just adjust for the quarter of Piramal that we didn't have in the 2010 base.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay, great. I'll let some others jump in.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Thanks, Mike.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Hi, David.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Good morning.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Just a quick question on stent dynamics. Obviously, this particular quarter you're facing a very,
very challenging comp, but considering competitor issues, I wonder if you could update us about what expectations you
have sort of the next three to four quarters in the stent market, specifically on opportunities for share, and then
secondarily price stabilization potentially?
<A - John B. Thomas>: Yeah, well, as I mentioned in my call remarks, we've done quite well internationally with
XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME launching. And we're continuing to gain incremental share there as well, and we're
optimistic with the launch of XIENCE PRIME and approval coming here in the first half of 2012. DES pricing has
been stable, I would say, down low single-digits sequentially and upper single-digits year-over-year as expected. It's
been a little bit better so I'd say overall we feel pretty good about that market in terms of its moderation and price.
And with the – one of the main competitors leaving the market, that obviously opens up an opportunity that's about 400
million, particularly in the small vessel stent area with our recent launch of nano, so we expect to gain some of that
share and take some of that market as well.
You know, I think the thing that people forget about is international sales and markets for our overall DES portfolio
make up more than 60% of our total global sales now. So, we continue to see better growth in emerging markets and
PCI volume obviously in those markets is growing mid-teens versus flattish here in the U.S.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Tom, just thinking about margins in the quarter, Miles made a comment earlier on in the year
that I interpreted as his comfort or visibility on double-digit earnings growth for 2012. And I think about your progress

through the first half of this year, I wonder if you would be able to sort of update us on your visibility on double-digit
earnings growth for 2012 based on the performance in the first half?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, it's clearly too early to talk about 2012 today. I mean, we've had a great quarter, a
great first half of the year, and obviously, we're feeling good about the business as we've increased our guidance range
for the year. So, the momentum is good. Obviously, HUMIRA I think is outperforming most expectations this year.
We're seeing really nice momentum in that product. Our ex-U.S. nutrition, I think you're going to see accelerated
growth in the second half, so that bodes well going forward. Same thing in our established pharmaceuticals: you're
going to see stronger growth in the second half as we work through some of these kind of transitional issues.
So I think the momentum is good. I think we've got a lot of growth drivers. We've talked a lot about operating margin
opportunities, which have been dampened down a little bit this year by some of the headwinds we talked about earlier
in the year that we're overcoming quite nicely with our performance. And so while operating margins this year are only
expected to improve modestly, we think there's still – there's going to be much more opportunity going forward, there.
So, I think we've got a lot of things going our way to have another strong year in 2012, but it's a little too early to start
forecasting until we get deeper into this year and get through our budgeting processes.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: And Tom, maybe just a quick follow-up on your comment on nutritionals. As that business
recovers, is it possible for Abbott to expand the nutritionals market through M&A either in the U.S. or OUS, or do you
think existing market share becomes an impediment to that?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I don't think we need to do things like that. We've done a really nice job the last four or
five years in terms of organic growth and investment of commercial resources and infrastructure in these various
markets as we have grown them so strongly. So, we have great brands. We play both obviously in the infant side and in
the medical side. A lot of the competition doesn't have that, you know, both sides of the business, and the strong
performance. This business is very committed to innovation, and if you look at whether it's formulations or packaging,
we've done a very nice job in terms of enhancing our market position through our R&D efforts.
So the answer is we don't – we don't need to do any M&A activity to be successful there. And, but we like the business.
It's a core part of the company very important to us, and we're always looking for any opportunity to grow the business.

<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Hi, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: Hi, Tom. The – can you discuss just generally the pharma had obviously a solid quarter.
Can you talk about the impact of pricing or inventory stocking destocking in the quarter, how that helped or dragged or
anything there?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: We had very, very stable inventory, very, very comfortable levels for us throughout the
quarter. So, there was really no impact of inventories in the quarter.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: And pricing?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, there was some price obviously going positive in the quarter.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: Okay. Gross margins, obviously were very solid and you're giving us good guidance again
for the third quarter. Can you give a little more color on what's driving that? And it's been a long time coming sort of

getting to that 60% mark. Are we sustainably going to be at 60% going forward, as best you can judge today?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, that is my forecast. But we talked a lot about this, this year in particular, and it's a
bit frustrating, because we're executing extremely well in terms of efficiencies and product mix. You know, exchange
has been a bit of a headwind this year. It probably took two points out of our year-over-year comparison in the quarter.
So, we were over 60% despite that. But the mix is improving, and that's what helped us get to the 60% level this year.
I think we're going to work through the – you know, the impact of European austerity and some of these things that we
talked about earlier in the year by the end of 2011, so once we're through some of those one-time transitional issues,
certainly our expectation is to stay sustainably above 60%, and expand it. And that's part of our growth story as we
move into 2012 and beyond.
So product mix is really helping. I think some of the – some of the things going on this year are masking real progress,
and we've made good progress, and not as much as we might have. But I think you're going to see more of that as we
go into next year.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: That's very helpful. Just one last quick one, maybe for John. John, you talked about
MitraClip briefly, U.S. under review. Any sense of timing? And remind me where we are internationally, and am I
misremembering that maybe there were some manufacturing issues? Are they resolved? Where do things stand? Thank
you.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Right. We can't be specific on timing yet. We're still optimistic about a panel. And it's less
likely that panel is going to occur in 2011, but it's, as you know, up to the agency. So, we'll be talking with them on that
going forward, and we've provided additional information that they're looking for. So, we'll update you on that as soon
as we know something. Internationally, we did have a recall of MitraClip. It was based on the tip of the catheter. We've
resolved that, and we expect to have that back on the market here in the third quarter.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: Thanks so much.

Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Two questions. First on Niaspan, you know the script data has trended down since we've
seen the AIM-HIGH study, and you had a good quarter with Niaspan, and my guess is it's because of pricing. So, I'm
wondering, is 2Q – do you think 2Q is the peak of this product? Should we model down sales going forward? So just
your thoughts on Niaspan going forward, and then I had a follow-up question for Tom.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Sure. This is Larry. Certainly we've been watching the scripts, and everybody has seen what
they've done. Six weeks after AIM-HIGH relative to six weeks before, we'd say that they're down about 5%. So, a
pretty modest impact at this point, but we certainly continue to watch those. We believe that we've incorporated a
reasonable estimate here for the second half, you know, for Niaspan and our outlook for 2011, and to your point, price
will still play a bit of a positive role here in the second half.
But still, six weeks out, it's a little bit early to make an official call on it. We continue to watch it, but at this juncture,
down 5%, six weeks before, compared to six weeks after is, you know, again, a fairly modest decline at this point. But
we feel like we've got a pretty reasonable expectation for the second half.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: And so should we assume sales decline here from the 2Q level? Is that fair assumption?
<A - Larry Peepo>: I don't know if I can specifically guide you to that at this point. Again, price will play a little bit of
a role. We'll see how it plays out. Again, scripts are down about 5%.

<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, I think at this point we'd expect positive growth out of Niaspan in the third quarter.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. Great. And then Tom on the tax rate, third quarter, you're saying that the tax rate is
going to be a little bit lower than the full year, full year around 15%, but 3Q in the 14.5 to 15%. So, what's bringing
down the tax rate a little bit lower in the third quarter?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, you'll remember on the first quarter call when we talked about Puerto Rico, which,
you know, there's this excise tax for our operations there, we're incurring expense up in the cost of sales line, which is
another item that is holding back our progress in gross margin transitionally this year. But, anyway – so we have the
gross expense up there, but we have the credit ability reflected in the tax line. That's the way we have to do it. And so
for the full year, in the first quarter, we had brought down the full year tax rate to reflect that credit.
And what you're seeing is just the progression of these changes through the P&L over the quarter. So, again, for the full
year, consistent with what we said in the first quarter, approaching 15% tax rate average for the full year, and you cited
our guidance for the fourth quarter – or for the third quarter.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. So, maybe a little bit tick-up in the tax rate in the fourth quarter then?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, I think you should just look at the full year approaching 15%, and the math will
take care of itself.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.

Thank you. Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Morning.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: I was wondering if you could discuss the operating margin outlook for some of the segments:
nutritionals, diagnostics, and established pharmaceuticals, although I know that's a little bit early perhaps at this stage.
But maybe if you could quantify, to the extent you're comfortable with at this point, where you see those in 12, 24
months from now, that would be helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, when you look at the businesses, there's a lot of good stories there in terms of
operating margin improvement. Probably leading the pack is our diagnostics business, which a couple, three years ago
before the team really focused on margin expansion, we were running in the upper single-digit range. You know, in this
quarter, we're in the upper teens range. They've made tremendous progress in terms of manufacturing efficiencies, but
also product mix and pricing and really managing the business better top to bottom. So, that's a very good story for us.
Our vascular business has done a very nice job in the last few years. You know, we were in a negative position about
three, four years ago, and moving to the upper 20s in terms of operating margins in that business. I think there's a little
more room to go there. I mean, clearly, we have made a lot of progress, and I would remind people that that operating
margin includes about $150 million of non-cash amortization expense. But we've made significant progress there, and
there's probably a little bit of room to go.
Some of our smaller businesses, but still significant, medical optics, diabetes care, still great opportunities there. In
particular, diabetes has executed on nice margin expansion, and we think more of that will continue going forward.
You know, nutritionals this year is artificially depressed by the impact of the infant formula from last year. But we're
recovering very nicely from that, as John mentioned in his remarks, and we should see a better operating margin this
year. The one thing I will say is that that's a business we do continue to invest in commercially, so some of the gross

margin improvements we expect there will be invested back in the business because we continue to see really great
growth opportunities across these markets, and they're pretty responsive to commercial investments. And so while we
expect progress this year and in future years on margin, it will be a little bit slower in the nutrition business because of
the ongoing growth opportunities in that business.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Great. That's very helpful. If I could just follow up with one on HUMIRA. I think if I heard
you correctly, you mentioned $1 billion of revenue from new indications, and I was wondering if you could just go into
a little bit more detail on that in terms of timing of indications beyond ulcerative colitis, which I think is for the end of
this year.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Right. We would expect action by the agencies, Europe, and the U.S. here towards the end of the
year on ulcerative colitis. You know, we're also working in Phase III in uveitis. That has a potential market entry in the
2013 timeframe. The Phase IIIs are ongoing at this point. You know, we've got, again, this other indication in the skin
disease that most commonly affects the sweat glands known as HS. That could be a potential market entry in 2014.
And then we kind of have this umbrella indication for inflammatory joint diseases, which include a number of sub
groups that don't have, call it, a major indication at this point, but like reactive arthritis and a number of different other
smaller indications that when you collectively look at those, again, over that period of time probably later this year for
UC, '13 for uveitis, '14 for HS, and the spa indication could be an entry into 2012. The peak there is in excess of $1
billion in our minds, and we think that each of those probably have a several hundred million dollar opportunity over
time. So, that's kind of how they break down at this point. But greater than $1 billion of incremental from here is pretty
significant.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Yeah, thanks so much. I appreciate it.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: All right. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Sara Michelmore from Brean Murray.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Morning, Sara.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: Larry, this is, I guess, the second quarter you have broken out AndroGel and CREON. Can
you just talk about the growth trajectory of those products and just in terms of addressable market sizes, et cetera, just
so we can get a sense of how big they could be eventually?
<A - Larry Peepo>: Yeah, I don't think I can put a total cap on where they could go. But certainly AndroGel is
becoming a fairly significant product here with the sales that I talked about for the quarter if you annualize that.
CREON a little bit smaller, but the growth rates on both of them continue to be very strong double-digits. And both
products have leadership in their respective categories. So, we're very optimistic for our proprietary pharma business
with both of these two products.
A new formulation of AndroGel that we just got approved is also very helpful. Again, it's lower volume, and it is a
much improved product for patients. So, we're very pleased. And then, again, this infant dosing indication that we got
for CREON as well gives us a nice opportunity, albeit in a smaller piece of that market, but nonetheless, an advantage
and a uniqueness to CREON that others don't have.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: Okay. And then just in the pipeline, you guys have clearly gone out in the last 12, maybe 18
months, and assembled a series of partnerships here to kind of fill in the pipeline in terms of externally sourced Phase II
moving into Phase III-type of candidates. Where are you in that process in terms of building the pipeline? Should we
continue to expect you to be active there, or have you done a lot of activity and things should slow down from here?
Thanks.

<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: No, I think we're still open to opportunities to further expand the number of bets we have
in the late-stage pipeline. You never can have enough in proprietary pharma. As you know, the regulatory and clinical
processes are challenging. I do think we have done a very nice job of supplementing the portfolio with four or five
really, really promising late-stage programs, and we're real happy with where we stand now. And I think even
compared to a year ago, our late-stage pipeline is significantly more advanced and promising than people would have
expected. So, our licensing organization is very good at this. They work closely with the business to identify good
opportunities that we can leverage Abbott's capabilities, and we continue to be open to opportunities there.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: And it seems like a lot of the activity is aligned with your commercial strengths rather than a
therapeutic category-type strategy? Is that a fair assessment?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I'd say in today's world, it's the quality of the science that's really the first screen. You
can't be overly selective in terms of therapeutic areas of focus. It's finding compounds or biologics that really have
proof-of-concept and have a good chance of making it to market, is really the first screen, because we've shown
through HUMIRA for example, that we can build commercial presence fairly readily, particularly in specialty areas, if
you have a high quality product to bring to market. So, that really is the first screen.
The other thing I'd say is our international proprietary organization in particular, is extremely strong and well-respected
in the markets and well-established. And that is – that international distribution asset is one that we do explain to
potential licensing partners very extensively, and we've made some pretty nice progress identifying opportunities to
bring in there. So, it's a combination of our strengths, and things we bring to the party, but also, if there's good science
that we think we can commercialize, we're open to something that might be a little outside of our wheelhouse from
time-to-time.

<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: We can now.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: All right. Technical difficulties on my side. Sorry about that.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Take it off mute. [Laughter]
<Q - Jami Rubin>: That was probably the problem. So, just quickly, Tom, you had talked about, of the established
pharmaceuticals business, $775 million of that $1.3 billion was emerging markets, which grew 25% year-over-year. Is
that right?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yes.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: My question is this: The remaining $560 million or so of that $1.3 billion, I mean, you're showing
operational growth of just $3.2 billion, and I know there's a lot of noise there. But if emerging markets is up 25%, what
– can you just describe the performance of the remaining $564 million in sales?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, we're lapping some issues in the quarter. Reductil is one. That's a product that has
been assigned. As you know, we have no Reductil sales in 2011, but we did have a fair amount of Reductil -

<Q - Jami Rubin>: What were the size of those?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I don't have that at my fingertips here, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: There were some smaller products, and I mentioned in Mike's question, lansoprazole, for
example, in a few markets went generic during the quarter. There are a couple others of those. So, there were definitely
some transitional products during the quarter that dampened down the non-emerging markets growth of established
pharmaceuticals, but we think that that's going to really work its way out of the system in the first half this year, and we
do expect a nice pick-up.
You know, another product that was off a little bit growth-wise, compared to the prior year was clarithromycin. And as
you know, that's a product that goes up and down with the seasons, depending on the year. So, there's some noise in
there, but we do think it's going to pick up, and we have worked through a number of these.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: So you would expect operational sales growth in the third quarter to pick up from the 3.2%,
because that 3.2% also includes Piramal, which wasn't in the numbers a year ago?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Absolutely. You'll see better growth than that.

Thank you. Our next question is from Damien Conover from Morningstar.
<Q - Damien Conover>: Thanks for taking my question. Good morning.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Good morning.
<Q - Damien Conover>: Just a question on the global anti-TNF markets penetration. In previous quarters, you have
talked about penetration rates in RA in the mid-20s in the U.S., mid-teens internationally; for Crohn's in the low-20s in
the U.S. and low-teens internationally and lower for the derm markets. I wonder if we could get an update on where
those penetration rates are currently? And then also what kind of strategies are you using to kind of increase the
penetration? And also, what are the key areas of potential resistance given the relatively low penetration rates for the
class?
<A - Larry Peepo>: Sure. Damien, this is Larry. You know, your penetration rate assumptions are fairly accurate at
this point in time as I look across them. In the U.S. rheum would kind of be in the mid-20s. Ex-U.S. is probably in the
mid-teens, maybe a little north of 15, in that 15 to 20 range. Derm, as you mentioned, I'll give you a number. You said
it's lower. It's actually low singles in both the U.S. and ex- U.S., kind of in that 5%, 6%, 7% range, depending on when
you measure it. So, there's a lot of opportunity there. And in gastro, I think you were right on with low-20s in the U.S.
and kind of low-double-digit or low-teens ex-U.S. So, you were very close.
You know what? I think the key really that continues in the international markets is the overall cost-benefit of a product
like HUMIRA in single payer systems that really makes a lot of sense to them in that a product like HUMIRA saves
considerable downstream costs, whether that's unemployment costs, surgical costs, things like that. The upfront
investment of treating a patient with HUMIRA certainly pays significantly downstream.
The penetration rates in derm in the past have probably been down in this range. In Europe they don't quite treat it as
severely as a disease state, the moderate to severe psoriasis patient. In the U.S. we tend to treat them just a little more
frequently. Although the penetration rate in the U.S. is still fairly low. But I think that overall the strategy of
cost-benefit is really the key for us, and that plays certainly very well when you're discussing a product like this with

<Q - Damien Conover>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: You're welcome, Damien.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Operator, we want to be respectful of people's time here and keep it to an hour so we'll take
one more question.
Operator
And our final question is from Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Catherine Jayne Arnold>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Morning.
<Q - Catherine Jayne Arnold>: Hey, I wanted to ask you a quick question on nutritionals, and then if I had time for a
follow-up on the pipeline. On nutritionals you said a lot about that business, Miles, but I'm just wondering, you have a
competitor that has disclosed sort of operating margins more in the 20 – mid-20s range. And I wonder, is that an
operating margin target that is reasonable for your business as your geography and your mix of products evolves over
time? And then I have a follow-up on the pipeline.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Right. Well, absolutely we have greater aspirations on margins in our nutrition business.
Before we had the kind of transitional year here, we had as we recover market share in the U.S., we were in the
upper-teens range. And then obviously with the recovery in the domestic market, we have gone down a little bit this
year and we expect that to recover somewhat in the second half, but still be below 2010. I don't know any reason
structurally why we couldn't be at levels at or close to the competition, and we've talked a little bit about this publicly,
that that particular management team is very, very focused on operating margin expansion.
We're kind of running a balance there between investing in growth, as I have talked about on this call, and driving
operating margin. So, we're going to try to do both. But there are a lot of initiatives going on in the logistics,
manufacturing area to drive costs out and get our operating margins much closer to some of the levels you're seeing in
other companies. So, I think that is certainly over a medium term an achievable objective, and the management team is
very focused on delivering on that.
<Q - Catherine Jayne Arnold>: Right. And then just a follow-up on the pipeline, could you talk about your strategic
interest and investment in the cardio metabolic area? Obviously you're moving towards the exclusivity loss of niacin
and TriCor, and of course, you have bardoxalone. But is this an area of a strategic importance for you guys?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, the cardiology, the primary care products we have in lipids and those areas are
clearly mature for us. And as we look at the development of science in these areas, it does seem that there's not a lot of
new opportunities, and a lot of the needs have been met by the existing products. So, we are focused more in other
areas, both from an R&D perspective and from M&A perspective. And I think you're going to see the mix of our
portfolio shift to more specialty products. We talked a lot about them today in the pipeline review. You see
immunology products. HCV products, a lot of other areas where we think there's more opportunity to deliver more
benefits for patients than there is in the cardiology space.
<Q - Catherine Jayne Arnold>: Excellent. Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Thanks.
