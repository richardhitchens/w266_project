Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Sean and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'll begin with a review of U.S. Bank's results
with a summary of the quarter's highlights on page three of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.5
billion for the third quarter of 2014 or $0.78 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew 6.3% year-over-year
and 1.4% linked quarter. Excluding the impact from the Charter One acquisition we completed in late June, total
average loans grew 5.9% year-over-year and 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis. In addition, we experienced strong growth
in average deposits and credit quality remains strong.
Total net charge-offs decreased by 3.7% on a linked-quarter basis. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets,
declined on both the linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. [Audio skip] (2:25) generate significant capital this
quarter. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as if fully
implemented, was 9% at September 30. We repurchased 16 million shares of common stock during the third quarter,
which along with our dividend, resulted in a 78% return of earnings to our shareholders in the third quarter.
Slide four provides you with the five-quarter history of our performance metrics and they continue to be among the best
in the industry. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.51% and return on average common equity was
14.5%.
Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.16%, in line with our
guidance. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 52.4%. We expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s going
forward, as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continuing to invest in and grow our
businesses.
Turning to slide five. The company reported total net revenue in the third quarter of $5 billion, a 2% increase from the
prior year. The increase was due to higher net interest income, as well as higher revenue in most fee businesses,
partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking revenue.
Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by almost $15
billion or 6.3% year-over-year and 1.4% linked-quarter. Adjusting for the Charter One acquisition, total average loans
grew 5.9% year-over-year and 1.1% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, which is a runoff portfolio,
average total loans grew by 7.7% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter.
Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial
loans, which grew by 13.6% year-over-year and 3.1% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also
increased over the prior quarters, with average loans growing by 6.1% year-over-year and 0.8% linked quarter.
Residential real estate loans grew 5.8% year-over-year and 0.3% over the prior quarter. Average credit card loans
increased 4.9% year-over-year and were up 2.1% on a linked-quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 3.6%
year-over-year and 1.6% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans.
Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace,
increasing year-over-year by 12.9% and 3.2% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat again in the
third quarter. Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion, or 7.4% over the same quarter of last year and 3.3%
over the previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remains strong at 5.5% on a
year-over-year basis and 1.7% on a linked-quarter basis. Growth in low-cost savings deposits was particularly strong on
both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis.

Turning to slide seven and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 3.7% on a linked-quarter basis and rose
modestly on a year-over-year basis due to an unusually high recovery in the third quarter of 2013. The ratio of net
charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.55% in the third quarter. Non-performing assets, excluding covered
assets, decreased by 6.2% from the third quarter of 2013 and were essentially flat on a linked-quarter basis.
During the third quarter, we released $25 million of reserves, equal to the reserve release in the prior quarter and $5
million less than in the third quarter of 2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net
charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Andy will now give you a few more details about our third-quarter results.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Richard. Slide eight gives you a view of our third quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods. Our
diluted EPS of $0.78 was 2.6% higher than in the third quarter of 2013 and equal to the prior quarter. The key drivers
of the company's third-quarter earnings are summarized on slide nine. The $3 million or 0.2% increase in net income
year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue driven by increases in both net interest income
and fee-based revenue. The company also achieved positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis.
Net interest income was up 1.3% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by a
lower net interest margin, including lower loan fees. The $31.4 billion increase in average earning assets year-over-year
included growth in average total loans, as well as plan increases in the securities portfolio. Offsetting a portion of the
growth in these categories was a $1.4 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage
origination activity versus the same quarter of last year. The net interest margin of 3.16% was 27 basis points lower
than the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, lower loan
fees and lower rates on new loans, partially offset by lower funding costs.
Lower loan fees were due to the previously communicated wind-down of Checking Account Advance, our short-term
small dollar deposit advance product. Non-interest income increased $65 million or 3% year-over-year, due to higher
revenue in most fee businesses, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. We saw growth in retail and
corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges and treasury
management fees, commercial products revenue and investment product fees.
Non-interest income increased year-over-year by $49 million or 1.9%, primarily due to an increase in compensation
expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities. Net
income was lower on a linked-quarter basis by $24 million or 1.6%, mainly due to the increased non-interest expense,
partially offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses.
The second quarter of 2014 included two previously disclosed notable items impacting other non-interest income and
other non-interest expense, that together had no impact to diluted earnings per common share. On a linked-quarter
basis, net interest income increased 0.1%, due to an increase in average earning assets, mostly offset by a lower net
interest margin, including lower loan fees.
Net interest margin of 3.16% was, as expected, 11 basis points lower than the second quarter, principally due to growth
of lower rate investment securities and lower loan fees due to the Checking Account Advance product wind-down. On
a linked-quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $202 million or 8.3%, primarily due to the second quarter
Visa stock sale, lower mortgage banking revenue and lower commercial products revenue, partially offset by higher
deposit service charges, corporate payments products revenue, and trust and investment management revenue.
On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest expense decreased by $139 million or 5% due to the second quarter FHA DOJ
settlement in other expense, partially offset by Charter One merger integration costs and higher mortgage-servicing
related costs.

Turning to slide 10, our capital position is strong. Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements
effective for the company follow Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years
to full implementation by January 1st of 2018. In addition, beginning with the second quarter of 2014, the advanced
approaches portion of Basel III became effective for the company.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach, as if fully implemented at
September 30, was 9%. At 9%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per
share rose to $15.66 at September 30, representing a 13.3% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.6%
increase over the prior quarter.
I'll now turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I'll turn your attention to slide 11. We remain focused on extending
our advantage, which is our theme for 2014. Our consistently solid financial performance is a result of our adhering
closely to the core fundamentals of controlling expenses, of managing capital prudently and selectively investing in
initiatives that generate steady long-term growth and expanding existing customer relationships.
That was certainly the case in third quarter, as our disciplined approach produced positive operating leverage. As we
head into the final quarter of the year, we remain diligently focused on executing our plan, even with the ongoing
economic headwinds, with an emphasis on providing our customers with the trusted products and services to help them
build more secure financial futures backed by the financial strength of U.S. Bank.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer any questions from the audience.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Hi, guys. It's Jessica Ribner in for Paul Miller. How are you?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Jessica; good morning.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Good morning. We just had one question. Just taking into account the recent changes
announced by the FHFA in terms of the 3% downpayment and some reps and warrants clarity, does that change the
way that you think about originating down the credit spectrum in the mortgage space or how do you guys view that?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: It really doesn't. This is Richard. It's a good sound bite, but I think the test comes in whether
or not there's a private market for investors to pick up these loans with lower or no downpayment and I'm not sure there
will be. So we're going to continue to stick with the FHFA, Freddie and Fannie deals that we originate, that we sell off.
We'll continue to originate loans that we hold on the balance sheet for our more well-heeled customers and we'll
continue to watch the progress in this space because we like very much to feel more comfortable making loans with, I'd
say either a lower FICO or with less downpayment.
But unless we're convinced that the rules are going to be permanent and there's not going to be a lookback or a
reachback in future times or that there won't be a market for this, we're simply going to stay on the sidelines in the
concerns of both compliance risks and other uncertainties and we'll just continue to do what we're doing now, which I
think is sufficient for the near term.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: And what do you – just a follow-up to that, what do you think would – what do you
think that they would have to say or come out with to make you more comfortable in that space? Because you were

talking about a reachback or something like that.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Right. Right. That's a great question, Jessica, and I'm not sure I have the answer because I'd
have to see it or believe it and then test it. And so it's going to take a while for me to have a belief that this litigation
risk isn't as great as compliance risk, which used to be both less important than credit risk.
So when you think about all the risks we have, credit risk, we can manage, we've done that through the whole cycle and
we did it well before. In terms of litigation risk, that's kind of the new uncertainty and with the statute, I think, of time
coming upon us, there may be softening of some of those lookback, reachback.
But I'll end where I started, there's a private market out there that's got to say they want to buy these loans without the
guarantees and they've got to be willing to take those loans on with those lesser quality customers under the risk that
perhaps they won't repay. And that's going to be a market that's going to be tested over time with a number of players
that will have a chance to come in. And once we see that appetite, that will probably be the first evidence we'll be
looking for.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Great. Thank you so much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: You're welcome.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning, guys. I'm just wondering about the outlook for the net interest
margin next quarter. Andy, could you give us some of the puts and takes for the margin and what kind of outlook you
have for net interest margin and net interest income growth?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure, John. So, if you think about the third quarter versus second, we were down 11 basis
points and that was three things. The first if 5 basis points for CAA and that's done, so that won't repeat in the fourth
quarter. The second was about 3 basis points for the securities build and that will continue in the fourth quarter. We
ended this quarter at about $96.5 billion. We'll end the fourth quarter at just over $100 billion. So we'll have additional
migration down because of that 3 to 4 basis points. The third factor was the loan mix. Most of our growth was in
wholesale, as opposed to retail and that was two to three basis points of pressure. That will continue likely into the
fourth quarter also. So all in, down 5 to 7 basis points for the fourth quarter, but I still expect net interest income to
grow and then finally that pressure on securities build will diminish, it will go away beginning in 2015.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. You'll be done, you think, by the first quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Our expectation is that we'll end this year at or above 100% on the LCR ratio. So our net
securities growth will be more consistent with the overall balance sheet growth as opposed to building additional to
meet the LCR ratio.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So, John, all that remains for 2015 is loan mix and interest rates in general, but we've really
gotten rid of the other variables that have been moving all through this year, taking the number down.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And, Richard, could you give us some color on your feelings about loan
growth from here, both just kind of the absolute level of growth you're looking for and then the mix factors?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'm feeling pretty good, actually. I should say this to all of you. First, I'm glad to see that
you're even on the call. I thought being last might not have anybody come to our party. You know, we always
announce our earnings...

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Well, I'll tell you what, who cares about what we have to say now, right? We have always
announced earnings on the Wednesday after our board meeting and the board meeting has always been the third
Tuesday. So the first time in my years as CEO, my eight years as CEO, that [ph] we created (16:38) the fourth
Wednesday. And so that's why we're so late in the cycle and talking to all of you a week later. We've amended that with
the board and we're going to go back to announcing on the third Wednesday. So this will be the last time we – this
trailer, keeping you from writing your final reports. And so, I just want to make that clear.
By the same token, though, I have great visibility and clarity I've never had before on what the other banks have been
saying. And so I'm going to say we're generally positive about loan growth. I'm saying that for the following reasons.
As Andy indicated, we had the 1.4% linked-quarter growth. If you take out the Capital One acquisition, it's 1.1% and
that's right in the range of what we telegraphed and we're going to telegraph that again for quarter four. We think we're
in that same place, as we are still moving into the early stages of the fourth quarter.
We're seeing it across the board too, John. I mean, we're seeing in wholesale banking. We're seeing people continue to
support capital expenditures, particularly in large ticket leasing and in corporate banking. We're seeing the pipeline
across all industries stronger as the year ages, which is pretty positive. We're also seeing the leveraged portion of the
market remains pretty fast growing but we don't anticipate much in that. And as you know, there's a regulatory
oversight that's more heavy at this point in time and so it doesn't affect us near as much. And the strong market – the
bond market is still strong, so that does take some of the loan volume away. But overall, we don't see anything less than
we've seen in the last couple of quarters.
Commercial real estate is still pretty strong. If you look at the East Coast and you take kind of the smile down to Texas
and you move around, we see it's pretty active across most property-buying areas. We're seeing some investors getting
into the central part of the country, Minneapolis, Denver, Phoenix, places like that. Property types are looking good.
Apartments, retail offices, lodging properties and we're seeing people get lines of credit and using their lines for
property acquisitions.
And then we've seen also nice strength in home equity. For the first time, we're actually putting more on the books than
are running off, now that we're at that part of the cycle. Auto loans continue to be a strong point for us and credit cards
are growing nicely and are expected to, as you might expect in the fourth quarter seasonally, get even stronger. So, I
mean, 1% to 1.5% and probably around this 1% to 1.2% that we've been at isn't robust, but it's pretty solid and what
we're seeing is nice consistency and our pipelines would reflect not only what we're hearing anecdotally but the real
facts that we've got some loan growth still well into our future.
You know, having low interest rates isn't great for income, but it's pretty good for lending and people continue to see
that benefit and we have that cost of funding advantage we've told you about, allow us to lend to the highest quality
customers at a preferred price and we're going to keep doing it.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And a little bit more – thanks for the color, a little bit more led by the
commercial, which is the loan mix impact on the NIM?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I think it's very much the same, what you've seen in the last few quarters will be very
much the same, dominated by C&I, but starting to see – consumer starting to vie for its position now. Quarter four will
be strong consumer with credit card, but we'll still be heavily mixed towards C I, which will still put some pressure on
NIM. But as we talked, it starts to wane later into the process.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And one quickie on non-interest income, the credit and debit card revenues
were a little lighter than expected. You mentioned rewards costs in the write-up. Is that kind of the new cost of business
in a reward-centric world here? Is there any kind of one-time catch up in there?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: This is Andy, John. So, two things, one is, just the number of processing days this quarter of
2014 versus the third quarter of 2013, caused a couple percentage points decline. It was 90 days versus 94. So that's just
a nuance with the number of business days. And the second thing was the rewards, which is a little bit elevated, but I
would expect it to be at this level or slightly downward in the future quarters. But if you think about it, cards on a core
basis, ex the processing days was up closer to 5% to 6%.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Sure. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David George of Baird.
<Q - David A. George>: Hi, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Richard, I wanted to dovetail to
John's question. It's more big picture, but this is a very popular macro topic and that's rates.
I wanted to get, not so much your views on rates but more from the perspective of how you're thinking about running
the company, allocating capital, making incremental investments, et cetera. Do you run the company any differently if
rates stay here longer than people think? And any kind of industry implications that you think could emanate from that
to the extent that macro backdrop persists. Thanks.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, David, that's a great question and we're still evaluating our final view on what the rates
will be; because just a couple of weeks ago, it might well have been a different scenario, right? Based on the prevailing
view was that rates would start moving up in the middle of the year. And now, people are thinking later next year.
Here's how we have been running it this year. So it was February 15, I remember the exact date. It was exactly the
center of quarter one, and I remember it was a very tough winter quarter for every business and we decided to adjust
our plan all of 45 days into the year. And we placed a hold on FTE in the company. Let me repeat this, I told you about
this last time, too, it's responsive to your question.
By placing a hold on FTE, we didn't put in a hiring freeze. So if you have 881 people in your division, you can have
881 people. And in fact, I'm going to encourage you now more than ever to make sure that they're the 881 best people
you can possibly have because there's no limit on the quality of the people in the organization. But you can't go to 895
and you can't get to 906 until we see a revenue environment that's a little bit stronger.
And so – but for compliance and compliance-related activities where we didn't put any kind of a hold, based on what
we think is appropriate regulator focus, we've been doing that with quite good success. You might imagine one of my
challenges is to have the employees of this company feel proud that because they're working harder is why we're doing
well. As opposed to make them wonder why we're doing so well, why am I working so hard? And we were trying to
get that conversation organized properly. But I wouldn't hesitate to ask the employees to continue to do that well into
next year if that's what the environment is going to state. Because we really do want to give you guys, positive
operating leverage to our shareholders on an annual basis, I've always said, not on any one given quarter. And the way
to do that is decide what your revenue guardrails will be and then to stay within those based on your expenses.
And with the cost of health care and the cost of merit increases, what's left is to make sure you've got enough to not
overspend before you have the revenue. So we will do more of what we did this year, the longer rates stay low or flat
next year. By the same token, the minute we believe that they're on their way up, we'll start to release some of those
levels of limits and start moving forward more quickly.
Let me also clarify before I hear it my own way, that we're not slowing down on our investments or our capital
expenditures or some of the longer term necessary things you need to do to be ready for our future. So we're putting all
that into the long-term view of what's most important and prioritizing, so we're still spending money. And as you know,
our expenses are still growing just at a level less than our revenue. And that's how we'll continue to do it. But I will
agree that the minute rates start moving up, when we see evidence, it gets a lot easier to run a company this long into a
recession and a downturn.
<Q - David A. George>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.

The next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Yeah, thank you. Good morning. My first question is, Richard, you have always taken
advantage of increasing your market share when your peers are challenged. And based on Governor Tarullo's speech, it
sounds like some of your larger peers may have to contend with higher buffers on Common Equity Tier 1. I guess I'm
wondering if that does transpire and you have some of your larger peers operating at 11.5%, 12%, 12.5%, do you think
that presents a further opportunity for U.S. Bank, seeing that you would be under that G-SIB requirement?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'll tell you, Erika, I think it's just a continuation of the benefits we've experienced. Because
first of all, you know that even if that occurs, it doesn't have to be overnight. And not unlike us, most banks, as we
continue to get healthier, are creating capital. So I don't think that's a real burden for them in the getting there and I
don't think it's any different than it's been for the last couple of years as we've been a SIFI and they've been GSIFIs.
But I do think that at the end of the day, our ability to be more profitable, be more attractive to shareholders and have a
simpler, easier company to understand and invest in, I think that continues to become more and more obvious. And
that's why we think we're in a particularly good position where we are as the first non G-SIB. And I think there are
advantages, many of which are continuing and some which might get a little stronger. But I don't think that very event
changed any near-term outcome, and it just continues to remind us how fortunate we are.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And just a follow-up question to that. As we think about long-term capital return
prospects for the company, which ratio should we think of as your binding constraint, the standardized CET1 or
advanced?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Standardized, Erika. So, our advanced ratio is 200-plus basis points above our advanced. So
our standardized will be our binding constraint and our target is 8%.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. How are you?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So a couple questions. One, a follow-on to that on the funding side. Is there an opportunity
here with the rate environment to maybe reset, redo some of the longer-term funding costs that you've got?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes, Betsy, so when I gave you my expectation for rates into the fourth quarter and stability
into next year, it reflects the fact that we have some long-term debt coming due and that we'll be repricing it at a lower
rate.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And you could even take advantage to do more than just what is coming due or no?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: No, I think our focus will be on what is maturing, which is planned over the next 12 months.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then separately, in the payments space, obviously, you've got a great position
with effectively a closed loop or pretty close to a closed loop. Could you give us an update on how you're thinking
about your own digital wallet, as well as broadening out use of tokenization for security-related purposes beyond just
payments?

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Well, those are different questions. Digital wallet, I think you know we continue to invest in
virtually every scheme we can find and each partner that we have, many of which we don't announce, it's not our plan
to announce things until [indiscernible] (27:42). But I'll just remind you that we're both a leader in mobile banking, but
even more so mobile payments, because as you said it, we have a closed loop capability. We've got all sides of the
equation and we're leveraging that.
I might also say that it wouldn't surprise you, but we do a lot with customers. We have certain customer groups that
we've put together that help us think through the next best ideas. And we gauge the tenor and interest of some
customers, both small and large, into what kind of things they may want. A closed loop, as you know, has to be a large
enough critical mass that there's enough interest in all parties to see the benefits of staying outside of the, we'll call it,
the normal freeway. And we still haven't found that combination yet and I don't know that we will, but we're going to
keep looking for it and do our very best to use the digital environment that's advantaged to us with the [ph] firing
(28:28) business to check it out.
As it relates to tokenization, we're at the very front of that because not only are we involved in it, but particularly
through the Clearing House, we're working on a tokenization project for all the 24 largest volume banks in the country.
Clearing House, as you know, is a half-owner of the ACH system, the other half being the Federal Reserve, and so
we're working with them on tokenization.
And answering a question you didn't ask, tokenization really will solve a number of these issues, which in the interim
look like they're being solved by the chip card or the EMV solution. Those are really just a different alternative to a
magnetic stripe. And at the end of the day, it's tokenization that's going to give us all the protections we're seeking.
You think of the Apple Pay, that's tokenization plus biometrics, which allows for a different kind of protection. There'll
be all kinds of combinations. But look, banks are going to seek whatever we can to have lower fraud losses, because as
you know, most of these hacking circumstances, whether we issue the cards now or later, if there's any losses, the
banks take those losses and they're substantial amounts of money that have been in our run rates for years. And to the
extent that we can find a way to make the customer safer, not make them feel burdened by having to become safer, it
reduces our fraud on the other side and it creates a safer environment. Tokenization is going to provide a great [ph]
solve (29:47) to that and then cybersecurity also gives some advantages to higher levels of authentication.
So I'll just say, in answer to your question, we're at the leading edge of all of those topics, either because of our position
in the association or because of our capability of being a full-on payments provider and we're testing all kinds of
different scenarios. And yet, I have nothing grand enough to announce to you here because we haven't found the Holy
Grail yet on closed loop and we're continuing to watch for it.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. But also on tokenization, just to be clear, you could see the opportunity to use that
technology, not only in payments but also in your own internal peer-to-peer or customer access to funds and funds
transfer?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah and it's probably not tokenization as much as there could be a number of versions of
closed loop, more protected interchanges between, let's say, large banks that could do things much more quickly. That's
a different answer as we're talking about a faster payments network.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yeah.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And moving away from the 24-hour cycle and we're announcing, I think very soon, that
we're all going to be working on faster payment cycles. The precursor to that, though, could be bank to bank or large
entities to large entities doing intra-day transfers on a trusted basis, like you would with a friend and accelerating what
would otherwise be the natural and final evolution of the entire payment system from a 24-hour cycle to a real time.
That's probably a couple of years away, but following the path of some other places around the globe and following the
favor of customers, we're all working on that. And I think that's something that you'll be hearing a lot more about in the
next couple quarters

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, especially given the Fed white paper that asked for ten years,
which seems way too long.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: You got it.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So then, last question, just slightly separate topic. But progress on the near prime push in
auto, could you just give us an update on how you're thinking about that and how that's impacting pre-tax margin?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yup. I'm going to have Bill answer that question.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah. Hi, it's been successful. It's enabled us to provide a broader spectrum of yes answers in the
dealership office. And we've expanded our presence in the used car market as well. And it's positive on the overall net
interest margin on our indirect dealer book. So it's doing well and it's performing as we expected.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And broader context, if you recall, instead of just being a prime lender to an auto dealer, now
that we're doing used auto and some near prime and the prime, we get a higher shot at getting their floor planning and
getting the rest of their business because now we're in all the categories they want, not just selectively picking prime.
So there's another advantage. And I also should say, we've been a leasing bank for 61 years, which is back when
leasing started. So we've got a long tenure there that I think, in a less competitive environment for auto leasing and
we're going to continue to expand that. And as rates go up, trust me, that's one of the first things you'll see is people
flipping from loans to leases for payment.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yep, exactly. All right, thanks a lot.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jeffries.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a correction on the expenses, Andy, I heard your
comments about kind of in the other – there seems to be kind of a plus or minus, some offsetting. So is this the kind of
the right base for expenses going forward? And to Richard's comments about staying in the low 50s efficiency ratio,
what does that imply for the ability to deliver operating leverage? Is it really just about getting rates up at some point
from here?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right, Ken. So in the third quarter, we had a couple of items that are not going to repeat. We
had about just under $20 million of conversion-related expenses, recently related to our Charter One acquisition in
Chicago. Those will not repeat into the fourth quarter.
The third quarter also continues to build our tax amortization for our CDC company and that will continue to increase
in the fourth quarter. That's just seasonal and in the fourth quarter, typically, it's about $75 million or $80 million higher
than the third quarter. So you'll see that and that again comes down in the first quarter. All in, though, I do expect
positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter and I do expect our efficiency ratio to continue to be in the low 50s.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: You know what else, Ken? We're not there yet, but I think the – we're probably at the highest
level of total compliance in audit-related costs we're going to have over the cycle. I don't see them coming down right
away, so I'm not saying that but they aren't sustainably this high for the long term. So, there will be another advantage
and it will happen probably sometime next year, where just the run rate and the expenses start to come down a bit based
on some of the focus we've all had in certain categories that will settle. And so it's not immediate, but I think it would
be improper to believe that our current expense base related to all that to this very quarter or the ones you've seen in the
last couple are the normal high rate because they're not going to be that high.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Understood. Okay, great. And just a second question on just the mortgage business. This
quarter you had a huge jump in origination volume and it looks like the apps are pretty flat and it looks like the MSR

hedge came down as you had forecasted for us a quarter ago, so can you just walk us through the drivers from here on
the revenue side in the mortgage business?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So as you mentioned, in the second quarter, we had a gain on servicing that did not
repeat in the third quarter. If you strip that out, we were relatively flat. And actually, application volume was also
relatively flat. Fourth quarter is typically seasonally lower and I would expect that to occur this year and that will result
in revenue being a little lower, I would call it somewhere between 5% and 15%, principally due to seasonality.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay, got it. Thanks, guys.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Ken.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Bill.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William Carcache>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question on your funding advantage. It hasn't arguably
been as much of an advantage as it could be, given the strong deposit growth that we've been seeing across the industry.
But I wondered if you thought that might change, particularly if QE is indeed over after this month and deposit growth
starts to slow, not necessarily turn negative, just slow. So, I guess, a two-part question. First, do you think deposit
growth will slow with the end of QE? And then secondly, would your funding advantage become more valuable in that
kind of environment, assuming that loan growth continues?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So, Bill, we do assume that at end of QE or when rates start to rise, we do assume an
outflow of deposits. That's part of our rate sensitivity analysis and I do think the funding advantage will become more
explicit and clear when that occurs. It's there now because we still have some debt on the books and I think that
advantage shows itself, but it will show itself more as more debt replaces deposits as rates move up.
And importantly, about 15% of our deposits are corporate trust related, which are less sensitive to rates moving up, so
it's more a function of the operating model of the corporate trust business. So that helps us retain a core level of,
particularly DDA deposits that will be helpful as rates move up.
<Q - William Carcache>: That's great. But I was hoping maybe to follow up on that, Andy, if maybe you could
separate for us the rise in rates which there's some concerns that that's being pushed farther out and the end of QE,
which many believe is still going to happen this month. So if we have that scenario where maybe we just set the higher
rates aside for a second and just look at the impact of QE coming to an end. Would that alone be enough to slow
industry deposit growth and bring the funding advantage to play more of an important role?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: You know, I think what will slow the deposit growth will be a growth in the economy and as
businesses start to invest more in growth and expansion and such, I think the first place they'll go is their own funds,
which are currently on our balance sheet and I think that will be the principal change. And then secondly, as rates start
to move up, the opportunity cost of having money in DDA goes up and I think you'll start to see a shift out of DDA.
But when the economy starts to grow, the first place – before we see loan growth, we'll see deposits declines.
<Q - William Carcache>: Got it. And I wanted to also follow up on some of your comments about auto. Regulatory
intervention has been in focus in auto finance and I was hoping maybe you could just share any thoughts on the
potential for the CFPB to bring non-bank auto finance companies under its oversight and what that could mean for you
and the rest of the banking industry, I guess, particularly to the extent that there are some non-bank lenders who either
get pushed out or see their cost of compliance rise.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: You know, Bill, this is Richard. I think until we see any evidence of the CFPB ring-fencing
any activities of the non-banks, we're just going to presume it will stay the way it is. As you can see, it didn't stop us as
a banking industry to stay in the business. We're dealing with a little higher level of risk as it relates to the fair lending
rules on things that have been said, but I think we've all gotten better at it and know what the risks are. We still are the
best, I think, providers of lending to the auto businesses because of our cost of funding and because we aren't more
traditional banks.
I've heard the same thing you've heard and I appreciate the fact that they're going to get to some of the non-banks. And
I do think that if they were, that would be net positive just because the operating paradigms will be the same for all of
us. But it won't change in the near term. It wouldn't change anything we're doing at all. I don't think, until we see
evidence of it for some period of time, like a year or more, any of us are going to adjust any of our thinking based on
that. So, it will take a while for them to decide which part of the space they want to get into, what it means to oversee
them, what adjustments they may make and it will take, I think, just a substantial amount of time that I wouldn't expect
any adjustment for at least a year because it takes that long for something like that to cultivate.

Your next question comes from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Jon.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Hey, good morning. Just a few follow-ups. Bill, can you just touch a little bit on auto
charge-offs and what's normal for your portfolio? There's a little bit of an uptick. I'm sure it's explainable, but just
maybe give us an idea of what's going on there.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Well, part of that is related to the expansion that we talked about earlier going into the near prime
space, so some of that's come into season. And then seasonally, there's usually higher losses in the wintertime than in
the summer months. So that's all relatively normal. And just most of our book is still – even though we did expand the
low end, most of the book is still very prime, high prime portfolio. So the level of losses you see this quarter, it will be
pretty stable from there.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. Good. Andy or Richard, just on the risk and compliance spending, I think that's good
news that we're maybe at the peak. But can you give us an idea of the magnitude maybe year-over-year in terms of
spending and FTEs that you've devoted to risk and compliance?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I think about in third quarter versus a year ago I would say we have somewhere between $30
million and $40 million of additional expense in the run rate related to risk and compliance.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. All right. But you're thinking that that is near the peak at this point?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes, but I also said it stays there for a while.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Yeah.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So in the midterm, it goes down. There's a new permanent level. You didn't ask Andy for
three to five years ago, but it would be probably three times what it was a couple of years ago. And so we're getting to
that place now and we'll just reassign some of the parties. Because compliance, as you know, isn't just, it isn't just a unit
or a division, it's crossed every part of the business line. So even my sales team in the front line all need have more of a
compliance view, we'll call it the first line of defense. So every employee has to be thinking more appropriately about
doing things perfectly the first time and therefore, there's an extra cost in each incremental FTE. So it's not just a group
we bring in, but it's a way of doing business and we've been adding that to everybody's job over the last couple years.

Plus, we've been having outside third parties and we've added a bulked up staff in certain places to deal with our
regulatory issues to align with the new higher bar of [ph] heightened (42:07) standards. But once we get that settled, I
can see some of that going back down a bit as we get more efficient, and as you know, we're pretty efficient once we
know what the rules are.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. And then just one more on capital return, Richard. Your sometimes quotes get taken
out of context, but you're on the record of saying that you think 2015 could take off. Wondering if you feel like the
capital return in the current range is appropriate for next year. Do you feel like you can potentially return more? Do you
feel like you need to retain some more for some maybe greater expected balance sheet growth in 2015? Just walk us
through that.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, Jon, that's a hard question, right? But I'll tell you, to the extent that we can operate and
have now for at least five years in this very low interest rate, slow economy, I think we've proven our ability to
withstand a more challenging environment. But we're looking forward to the moment when – I think when rates move
up, it's less a proxy for the fact that we're poised to do better when rates move up. It means that the economy is doing
better; we get way more benefit out of that.
And so for me it's a proxy of when the economy starts to turn up. We certainly think we can protect our capital
positions. That's for sure, because we know how to manage in an environment like this. But the sooner rates move up,
and again, it's a proxy for the economy doing better, the sooner we'll be able to telegraph that we'll be increasing our
capital distributions.
Until we see that, I'm going to stay pat and just indicate there's a positive bias as soon as we see the economy improve.
We're certainly safe on what we have, but we're going to be careful on telegraphing when we can move up until we can
see a more sustained revenue environment which allows us, therefore, to project a higher level of capital return.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just maybe, Andy, a question for you
related to expenses next year. Questions have come up on a couple of earlier calls about pension expense. I think you
guided this year the pension expense will be down about – will be down a bit from the prior year, and I'm just curious, I
realize we're not at year end when you set the pension rate or the discount rate and the pension expense, but how are
you thinking about pension expenses affecting your overall expenses in 2015?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure, Matt. If you think about 2013 and 2014 because of the increase in the discount rate,
we actually had a lower pension expense of about $130 million on an annual basis. If I were going to reset the rate
today, I'd lose that $100 million or so, because rates are back to where they were a year ago. But as you said, we won't
know that until the end of the year.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And just a question, Richard. I think you mentioned home equity loans were growing,
that that's a relatively new trend. Could you give us a little more color on where that demand is coming from? Are there
any geographies that are growing faster in that product specifically than you've seen in the past? And I'm just curious
about any color you can provide on competition from either larger regional banks or maybe some of the smaller local
banks who are looking to get into that space as well.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep. So, Matt, let's go back to the beginning. U.S. Bancorp balance sheet doesn't have an
oversized home equity portfolio. Never have. And if you look back to just the mortgage business, one of the things we
didn't have going into the recession was an overly active subprime or near prime mortgage business either. So we're not
feeding off of a lot of runoff. We don't have a lot of deals that are coming due at their five or seven-year mark, that

might have been originated in the earlier days. So we actually have a pretty core, steady book.
So for us, it's simply a matter of the paydowns now are being outpaced by the new originations. And again, you'll look
at the size of our portfolio. It's pretty average and that's okay because the quality is very high. The application levels are
particularly high right now and we are very aggressive in a marketing campaign with an intro rate pricing feature and
that's across the entire 25 states. And that's serving us quite well.
I think when I always talk about our pricing advantages, everyone on the call rightfully jumps to wholesale banking and
thinks about the advantages we have on cost of funds based on our highest debt ratings. And that transcends into better
rates and competitive issues on adjustable rate. But we can do it too on things like consumer products, as long as we
match-fund it properly. And so we have a very strong new account pipeline going now, and the activation rate is even
more impressive. So give you an example.
Our six-month activation rate a year ago was 61%. So we get a line of credit on and 61% within six months later was
being used. That's now up to 77%. And so that means that we're finding better customers who really want it and need it
and are using it. And increase that with the rate – fixed rate lock option, which is another feature we've included in our
advertising, and we are spending money to talk about it in both social media and in traditional marketing, [ph] let
(47:17) that be one of our leading products.
If you lived in our market, like [ph] John (47:19) does, you'd see the commercials and you hear the commercials and
you see some of the social media. So we're putting a lot of energy because we really want that to turn permanently. We
think that that's one of the best core quality types of loans that you can have. And it's across the whole state, the whole
country for us, particularly, most notably in the Western part, where the balances on markets are growing faster as the
home appreciation is related, which totally makes a lot of sense.
And I'd say our outlook for quarter four is to continue to see some growth in both the originations and the balance
sheet. So it's a pretty positive story. Also, kind of a slow starting point, but with some permanence around it now,
which up until recently, might have been just one or two months and then a fall backwards and I think we're on a
sustainable growth pattern to grow.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio of KBW.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Good morning, Richard and Andy. How are you?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Chris, good morning.
.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Good. Andy, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the merchant acquiring business,
the underlying trends. What I'm trying to get at, when I look at acquiring revenue per transaction, it's down about 5%
year-over-year and the acquiring spread is also down about 6% year-over-year, and probably a bigger – a longer trend
of deteriorating of those two metrics, can you kind of give me some color of what's going on in that business from a
kind of margin and spread perspective?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, so the DIA rate this quarter was about 40 basis points. And it is down a little bit from
a year ago. Two reasons it's down. Number one is a little bit of margin pressure, as you talked about. I think that's
beginning to stabilize, but we did see the last 12 months have some pressure on pricing. The second factor is the mix of
businesses that we acquire for. So to the extent that [ph] for our (48:59) large retailers or airlines, in particular, there's a
little thinner spread there. But I would say the decline related to margin pressure is beginning to stabilize. The rest of it

Final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of from CLSA.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I had a few follow-up questions. First, what do you estimate to be your deposit beta?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Mike, this is Andy. It ranges from 5% to 90%, depending upon the deposit product. So it's
not just one number. We very detail by product, by line.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And on average?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: On average, it depends on the deposit mix we have at any point in time, but if we think
about a few years ago, where it was, let's say 20% to 30%, it's above that now because of the higher level of DDA and
other activities we have. So it's higher than it was in our modeling.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. Richard, you talked about the capital advantage and that gives you a pricing advantage
with higher quality borrowers. And you said it's not really anything new, it's a continuation, but can you somehow
quantify that? I mean, you do have required regulatory capital that's significantly below your much larger peers. And
I'm just trying to figure out to what degree does that give you a pricing advantage, which in turn allows you to gain
market share?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So Mike, if you think about it, we're assuming our SIFI buffer is about 50 basis points. We
don't know that, that's our assumption, that's where we get to our 8%. So if you're a G-SIB that has a 250 buffer, so let's
call it 200 basis points more and you go through the math, we would have about a 30 to 35 basis points advantage to
achieve the same return or less than that and get a higher return. So it is not insignificant. It's a pretty significant
advantage.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And, Mike, additionally, which we've talked about, when we go into the market, if we have
to issue any kind of a debt, we have an advantage to every other bank. And whatever that time period is and however
much that raise was, we have that much delta to offer up. And as I said earlier, it could be the wholesale, it could even
be the consumer businesses and there's a net positive.
But here's the trick. You only use it on the highest end quality customers, because otherwise you start to dip down into
things with loan losses and compliance costs and things you may not really understand. So for us, I'd expect you to hear
on other calls that the pricing competitiveness is still high and pretty peaked. You haven't heard that here because we
either are part of the problem or we choose to use our funding advantage to be more competitive on price, not on
underwriting. And for the most part, most of the pricing seems to be pretty stable in the competitive environment as we
see it. So we're not feeling disadvantaged by it either.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So you go to the table and you're competing to get a large, high quality corporate client and you
say, we'll price this loan 30 basis points less, give us your business. Or 25 basis points less, is that the conversation?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: You know, I would say that's the conversation more for the middle market. In a large client,
it's more of a national funding market. And in that example, I think what the outcome is, is we have a higher return for
the same price.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: That's right.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Isn't that somewhat similar, though, to other regional banks that also have a capital advantage
versus the largest peers.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Capital, yes. Debt rating, no.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: It's the twofer.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then, the last question, Richard, to follow up before, you said 2015 can take off. It's right
around the corner. I think there's some quotes and that all looks great and we're all thinking, okay, if Richard Davis is
right, this economy is set to take off. And then you look at the ten-year bond which is saying the opposite. So who's
right, Richard Davis or the ten-year bond?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Wow. I've never met the ten-year bond. I'm going to go with me, but I'll tell you what. I do
think and I've said this before too, I think the stock market is a head fake of people using that as a measure of the
quality or the wealth – of the intention of consumers to start spending and acting. In fact, in some respects, the stronger
the stock market just because there's nowhere else to put it.
So, I'm not changing my view that in 2015 things turn around quickly and start to take off because when they do take
off, I think it's pretty likely they will be fast. And again, the pipelines that I'm talking about, customer intentions I'm
talking about, [indiscernible] (53:23) waiting for the final decision when the rates start to move, which will create this, I
think, a tsunami effect of people acting quickly. I'm going to stick to what I said before and I think it's next year and
when it does, it happens fast. I don't have any evidence that says otherwise and I'm not responding to the vagaries of
two weeks of either ten-year interest rates or stock market variances. I'm just going to stick with it.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, Mike.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Mike.
