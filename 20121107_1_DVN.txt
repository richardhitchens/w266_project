MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Devon Energy's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the prepared
remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn
the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Sir, you
may begin.
Vincent W. White
Thank you, operator, and good morning everybody. Welcome to today's third quarter 2012 earnings call and webcast.
Today's call will follow our usual format. After I make few preliminary comments, I'll turn the call over to our
President and CEO, John Richels. He will provide a overview of the third quarter and his thoughts on the upcoming
quarter and year ahead. Then Dave Hager, the head of Exploration and Production, will provide the operations update.
And following that, our CFO, Jeff Agosta, will finish up with a review of our financial results and an updated outlook.
After Jeff's discussion we'll have a Q&A session. Our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols; as well as Darryl Smette,
the Head of Marketing, Midstream and Supply Chain, are both with us today to help out in the Q&A. And as usual,
we'll keep the call to about an hour. A replay of this call will be available later today on our website.
During the call today we're going to provide an update of some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual
results that we've seen over the first nine months of the year and our revised outlook for the fourth quarter. In addition
to these updates we will file an 8-K later today containing the details of the updated fourth quarter estimates. To access
this guidance, you can just click on the Guidance link found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Please note that all references today to our plans, forecasts, expectations and future estimates are forward-looking
statements under U.S. Securities Law. And while we always try to give you the very best information possible, there
are many factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those estimates. You can find a discussion of risk

factors related to our estimates in our Form 10-K.
Also on today's call we'll refer to certain non-GAAP performance measures. When we use these measures, we're
required to provide related disclosures, which are available on Devon's website.
During the third quarter we recorded a noncash property impairment charge of $1.1 billion, or about $700 million after
tax. This charge resulted primarily from the lower natural gas prices over the last 12 months and under full-cost
accounting rules, the carrying cost of our oil and gas properties is subject to a quarterly ceiling test. And I just want to
clarify that this writedown is simply an accounting exercise and is not reflective of the fair value of our assets, does not
relate to any specific reserves. It also has no impact on our cash flow or cash balances, nor our credit agreements. It's
worth noting that this charge is not unique to Devon. Beginning last quarter, that is the second quarter of 2012, and
extending into the third quarter, several companies in our peer group have taken impairment charges.
With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to John Richels.
John Richels
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. First of all, the organic conversion
of our asset portfolio to a higher oil weighting remains on track, as evidenced by our continued growth in oil
production. We continue to invest the majority of our capital in high-margin, North American oil projects. Over time
these high rate of return projects combined with the greater capital efficiency that's provided by our joint venture
structures should result in superior growth of cash flow per share adjusted for debt. Devon's third quarter performance
reflects our continuing progress towards this goal, so let me give you a few highlights of the quarter.
Driven by better than expected price realizations and low overall unit costs, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow
per share for the quarter came in well above the mean Street estimates. Company-wide oil production increased 14%
over the third quarter of 2011 and this was achieved in spite of scheduled plant maintenance at our Jackfish 1 Oil Sands
project. Jackfish 1 maintenance reduced third quarter oil production by about 10,000 barrels per day. Without the
impact of the Jackfish turnaround, oil production would have increased more than 20% over the year ago quarter.
Our U.S. oil production, which is our highest margin product, grew 26% in the third quarter, and that was driven
largely by our success in the Permian Basin. With the expansion of our Gulf Coast fractionator's facility now complete,
our midstream business resumed full operations in the third quarter and our marketing and midstream operating profit
reached $109 million; that's right at the top end of our guidance range.
Devon also delivered a strong performance from a cost containment perspective. Third quarter 2012 pre-tax cash cost
per BOE declined 2% from the second quarter. And our recent decision to close our Houston office and consolidate
those operations into our Oklahoma City headquarters will result in additional savings beginning in 2013.
In September, we closed our $1.4 billion joint venture arrangement with Sumitomo in the Midland Basin Wolfcamp
and Cline shale plays. With the closing of this transaction, Devon has now successfully closed two exploration joint
ventures during 2012 with a total value approaching $4 billion.
We generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow in the third quarter. And when combined with the upfront proceeds
from our Sumitomo joint venture and other minor asset sales, total cash inflows reached about $1.9 billion.
On the liquidity front, we exited the month of September with $7.5 billion of cash and short term investments and a net
debt-to-cap ratio of 15%, thereby continuing to maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in the peer group.
And lastly, with the recent rise in natural gas prices, we have meaningfully added to our 2013 natural gas hedge
position.
In the third quarter we did however have some setbacks. Our third quarter top line production came in at 678,000 BOE
per day, or about 1% below the midpoint of our guidance. The shortfall was driven by two key factors. First, we had
lower volumes from our liquids-rich gas projects than in our initial plan; and second, the ramp-up of production at our

Jackfish 2 project has been slower than expected. Dave and Jeff will cover both of these items in more detail later in the
call.
Looking ahead to 2013, we are currently in the process of working through our capital budgeting process. Directionally
speaking, we expect next year's E&P capital spend to be significantly less than 2012, driven by a sharp reduction in
spending on leasehold capture and exploration. Even with this reduced level of spending, we expect to maintain an
oil-focused drilling program with activity levels similar to those of 2012. We expect to see significantly higher drill-bit
activity on our joint venture projects. You recall there, our partners will fund roughly 80% of total well costs. And in
2013 we will continue to aggressively pursue our Permian Basin opportunities, we'll move our oil sands developments
forward in Canada and we will accelerate activity in our emerging Mississippi Lime play.
As we've done in the past, we will finalize our 2013 budget in the coming months and provide detailed guidance during
our fourth quarter call and through a subsequent 8-K filing.
As we sort through the various alternatives for capital deployment, we remain unwavering in our commitment to our
top strategic objective. That is to maintain the maximized growth in cash flow per share adjusted for debt. We're
confident that the disciplined pursuit of this objective will allow us to deliver significant value as we move forward.
In addition, we believe the long-term growth potential of Devon's oil projects, both light sweet crude in the U.S. and
heavy oil in Canada, married with an option on natural gas provided by our world-class gas resource plays
differentiates us from the other companies in our sector.
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager. Dave?
David A. Hager
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to the highlights of the quarter, I'll begin with a quick recap of
2012 capital expenditures for our exploration and development activities.
E&P spending was $1.7 billion for the third quarter, bringing E&P capital through the first nine months to $5.3 billion.
We expect fourth quarter expenditures for exploration and development to be approximately $1.7 billion, pushing us
outside the top end of our full-year guidance range by roughly $400 million. Roughly half of this increase is a result of
capturing more acreage than previously budgeted in the Permian, Mississippian and other oil-focused plays. The
balance is related to accelerated activity to evaluate and build out a infrastructure on our Mississippian acreages outside
of the Sinopec JV. Of course the $1.3 billion in cash that we've received this year as a result of the JV is not netted
against capital expenditures, for reporting purposes.
Moving now to area-by-area highlights starting in the Permian, our Permian production averaged a record 65,100
barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, up 30% over the third quarter of 2011. Looking specifically at our
Permian oil production, it grew by 35% over the same period with light oil now accounting for nearly 60% of our total
Permian volumes. We continue to be very active in the basin with 20 operated rigs focused on drilling high-return oil
opportunities.
Our Bone Springs horizontal program in New Mexico continues to yield excellent results. We have six rigs currently
running in the play. In the third quarter, we brought 18 Bone Springs wells online with average 30-day IP rates of 565
barrels of oil equivalent per day, 80% of which is light oil. We've been very active in the Bone Springs over the past
couple of years, drilling more than 130 wells including some 90 wells this year. However, in spite of this high level of
activity, we have not burned through our drilling inventory. Through our ongoing geological evaluation we have been
successfully regenerating our opportunities. We have identified 300 remaining risked Bone Springs locations in the
second and third Bone Springs formations. In addition we are currently testing the first Bone Springs potential on a
portion of our New Mexico acreage and the early results are encouraging. If successful this could add materially to our
existing multi-year drilling inventory.

Also in the Permian, we continue to have very good results from our two-rig program targeting the Delaware oil
formation. We brought seven wells online during the third quarter with an average 30-day IP rate of just over 600
barrels of oil equivalent per day. Roughly 80% of this production stream from these wells are also light oil. To date, we
have identified approximately 200 additional risked locations in the Delaware and we are optimistic that with additional
geological work we can expand our drilling inventory here as well.
In the Wolfcamp Shale in the Southern Midland Basin, we brought five Wolfcamp horizontal wells online in the third
quarter. These wells had average 30-day IP rates of 556 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which over 80% is liquids
and almost 60% is light oil. These IPs are right in line with our type-well profile for this play. Our production from the
Wolfcamp Shale has almost quadrupled since the beginning of the year. We are – and we're continuing to drive down
well costs in this play and expect our next few wells to be in the $6.5 million range.
The continuing improvements we're seeing from both a productivity and cost perspective give us confidence we can
achieve consistent economic results in the play. We have almost 100,000 net acres prospective for the Wolfcamp in the
Sumitomo JV.
In the Cline Shale area on the eastern flank of the Midland Basin, we've been steadily ramping up drilling activity. I'll
remind you that this acreage is prospective for the Wolfcamp and the Mississippian formations, in addition to the Cline
Shale. We had three operated rigs running at the end of the third quarter and just last week added a fourth rig, where we
tied in our second Cline horizontal well during the third quarter and saw encouraging results.
Virginia City Cole C #1H located in Sterling County, had a 30-day IP rate of 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our
third Cline horizon well is just starting to flow back and we have five additional wells in various stages of completion,
including one well targeting the Mississippian formation. Consequently, we should have a lot more detail for you in the
next quarter. The 556,000 net acres in this area within the Sumitomo joint venture represents thousands of risked
locations.
Shifting now to our thermal oil projects in Northeastern Alberta, third quarter aggregate production from our two
Jackfish projects averaged 44,300 barrels of oil per day, net of royalties, in the third quarter. As we indicated in our last
quarterly call, Jackfish 1 was taken down for three weeks during the third quarter for scheduled maintenance. Plant
operations were restored on September 11. However, it takes a few weeks to fully restore the steam chambers and ramp
production back up. Accordingly, fourth quarter production at Jackfish 1 is expected to average about 23,000 barrels
per day net of royalties.
Looking ahead to 2013, we now expect to reach payout at Jackfish 1 at some point in the first quarter. The operational
success of the project, combined with high oil prices, have resulted in a fairly short time to payout. With the WTI price
in the mid- to upper-$80s, we would expect our post-payout royalty at Jackfish 1 to be between 20% and 25% versus
our current 5% to 6% pre-payout rate. In spite of the significant step-up in royalty rate, we expect Jackfish 1 production
to average between 25,000 and 27,000 barrels per day in 2013 net of royalties.
At Jackfish 2, third quarter production increased 7% over the second quarter, averaging 19,800 barrels per day net of
royalties. However, it has now become apparent that the maturation of steam chambers on a couple of our initial well
pads is progressing at a slower rate than originally expected. This is a result of some localized interbedded shales and
silt stones delaying the development of the steam chambers. Although these obstacles have slowed steam chamber
development, the chambers will eventually develop, enabling the reserves to be fully recovered. However, in order to
accelerate production and utilization of our plant, we are currently drilling the first of two additional well pads and
expect to begin steaming the first pad late next year. Until then, we'd expect our production from Jackfish 2 to average
between 20,000 and 25,000 barrels per day net of royalties, except during the routine plant scheduled turnaround –
routine plant turnaround scheduled for 2013.
It's important to understand that even among the highest oil quality oil sands reservoirs, like we have on our Jackfish
and Pike acreage, it is not uncommon to see some variability within the reservoir. We encountered similar variability at
Jackfish 1, but the strength of our earliest wells offset the potential timing issues that can result from reservoir
variability. In hindsight, additional wells at the of outset of our Jackfish 2 project would have bridged the timing gap

and ensured full utilization of plant capacity within the expected timeframe. The delayed ramp up should impact the
total project rate of return of Jackfish 2 by a little less than 3%, with a project return based on current pries of roughly
20%.
We will incorporate this lesson into the Jackfish 3 and Pike projects. The cost of adding a couple of spare well pads on
this project at start-up is a relatively minor capital acceleration in the scope of the overall project and can help ensure
that normal variations and well pad performance do not have the potential to significantly impact production ramp up.
Jackfish 3 construction continues to progress well with the project approximately 45% complete at the end of the third
quarter, putting us on track for a start up around year end 2014.
At Pike we continue to work with our partner on the evaluation of construction execution strategies with the goal of
providing greater cost and scheduling certainty. Given the pressure on labor in the region, we are currently exploring a
more modularized approach in the use of Jackfish. This would allow more of the labor to be done in the manufacturing
facilities rather than the field and should show – should result in significant efficiencies. We expect to finalize our
development plan by the middle of next year. We plan to drill 35 stratographic wells and shoot approximately 55
square miles of seismic during the 2012/2013 winter season.
With the majority of the Pike 1 resource already identified, the data obtained from this year's winter drilling program
will substantially complete the evaluation of the first phase of development for Pike. Engineering work is ongoing and
we hope to obtain regulatory approval by the end of 2013. As a reminder, the Pike 1 development project will have
gross production capacity of 105 barrels of oil per day, and Devon operates Pike with a 50% working interest.
Moving now to the Cana Woodford Shale in western Oklahoma. We brought 25 operated wells online in the third
quarter at Cana with average 30-day IP rates of 6.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 483 barrels of
liquids per day. These wells have averaged EURs of 9.3 billion cubic feet equivalent, making them some of the best
wells ever drilled at Cana. These wells were much stronger than the type curve we presented at our Analyst Day last
April, which called for an IP of 4.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day and EURs of 8.3 Bcf equivalent.
In contrast, the Cana wells we drilled during the second half of last year have underperformed our expectations.
Because we're in a regional drought, we use smaller fracs to reduce water consumption. Industry data at that time
suggested that we would not sacrifice much in the way of rates or recoveries. However, as we have brought these wells
on and observed their performance for the first three quarters of this year, we are seeing that the smaller fracs
significantly impacted well performance. We now believe the wells drilled in the second half of 2011 have EURs that
are only about half of the Cana core type curve.
In early 2012, we added surface water facilities that secured plenty of water for our Cana completion operations,
mitigating the impact of the drought This allowed us to return to our previous stimulation program. And while Devon's
third quarter 2012 production from Cana increased 42% over the third quarter of 2011, our volumes at Cana are
currently running about 8,700 barrels equivalent per day below our previous expectations, attributable to the
performance of the wells drilled in the last half of 2011 and to some variation from plan in the timing of bringing on the
well pads. Even though it is short of our original forecast, we still expect sequential growth in the fourth quarter Cana
production of more than 10%.
We began the third quarter with 15 operated rigs at Cana. After initially moving three rigs to the Mississippian oil play
in Oklahoma early in the third quarter, we later made a decision to move five additional rigs to the Miss and ended the
quarter with seven rigs at Cana. The Cana rigs were a logical choice for redeployment in the Miss because of close
geographic proximity of the two plays makes for a relatively easy and inexpensive move. However, given the strong
performance of the 2012 drilling program, it is likely we'll add additional rigs to Cana in 2013.
Shifting to the Barnett Shale in north Texas, in the third quarter we had 10 operated rigs running in the liquids-rich core
and the oil window. We tied in 67 wells, driving our average third quarter net production to 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day,
up 8% from the year-ago quarter.

Moving west to the Texas Panhandle, in the Granite Wash area we continued to see solid results. We brought seven
operated wells online during the third quarter. To date, our drilling is focused primarily on the Granite Wash A and B
sands and the Cherokee. However, in the third quarter, we drilled our first operated well in the Hogshooter formation
with excellent results. The Brown 8-7H, located in Wheeler County had a 30-day average IP rate of nearly 2,200 BOE
per day, including 1,688 barrels of light oil and 170 barrels of NGLs. Subsequent to quarter end, we tied in our second
Hogshooter well. The Lott 3-2H has been online for just 14 days and has averaged 4,400 BOE per day, including 3,200
barrels of oil per day.
We currently have two additional Hogshooter wells in various stages of drilling and completion. Further geoscience
work and drilling is needed to fully assess our potential, but our preliminary work suggests up to 100 additional
locations. With this kind of productivity and a drill-and-complete cost of roughly $8 million, the returns on these wells
are very strong. We plan to move a fourth rig to the Granite Wash later this year.
Our Granite Wash production has grown from about 6,700 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2010 to 18,500 BOE per
day in third quarter this year. With the impact of our Hogshooter program, we would expect further volume growth
going forward.
On the exploration front, we continue to see encouraging results in the Ferrier quarter of Alberta where Devon has
roughly 240,000 net acres prospective for Cardium oil, the liquids-rich Glauconite and other Lower Cretaceous zones.
Given the strong economics from the more than 24 horizontal wells we've drilled to date, we are currently evaluating a
potential development plan that would include the construction of a gas processing facility. We expect to make a
decision as a part of our 2013 capital budgeting process, and we'll keep you updated as we move forward.
In the U.S. we continue to move forward with the evaluation of a number of exploration plays, including those within
the Sinopec JV. As we begin to gain clarity on which of these plays will effectively compete for capital within our
portfolio, we will determine how to monetize the positions we don't plan to pursue. Keep in mind that JV has allowed
Devon to look at these plays with very little impact from a net capital perspective.
Let me provide a brief update on the current status. Looking first at the Rockies oil exploration, we've had encouraging
results from wells testing several different formations, including an oil well we've just completed in the Powder River
Basin that's been on production for seven days, averaging 1,100 barrels of oil per day, a very encouraging result. In the
Ohio Utica, as we indicated last quarter, the results from the wells on the western portion of the oil window had been
disappointing. We have since shifted our drilling efforts further to the east and expect to have three or four wells down
on this more eastern acreage by year-end.
In the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, we tied in our third and fourth wells in the northern portion of our acreage position
during the third quarter. The Murphy 63H, located in west Louisiana parish, had an average 30-day IP rate of 260
barrels of oil per day from a 4,700-foot lateral. Roughly 40 miles to the east in Tangipahoa parish, The Thomas 38H
was brought online and had a 30-day IP rate of 470 barrels of oil per day from a 4,900-foot lateral. We would need to
see improvements in both cost and recoveries to make this an attractive play going forward.
Finally, in the Mississippian oil play located in north central Oklahoma, we currently have 13 operated rigs running.
Devon has 545,000 net acres in the play. We significantly ramped up our drilling activity in the third quarter, drilling
both salt water disposal wells to prepare for full-scale development and a number of producers. We are currently have
20 operated Mississippian producers awaiting completion, so we expect to have a more robust update for you next
quarter. However, we did tie in The Bontrager 1-28H in the third quarter with an average 30 day IP rate of 545 BOE
per day, including 480 barrels of oil per day. These results continue to support a type curve with a 30-day IP of roughly
300 BOE per day and an EUR of 300,000 to 400,000 BOE at a cost of $3 to $3.5 million each per well. Our 545,000
net acres represents many years of drilling inventory for us. We currently estimate that the risked resource potential net
to Devon at over 800 million barrels of oil equivalent.
In summary, our 2012 capital program continues to drive strong oil production growth while simultaneously evaluating
a wide range of exploration prospects.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?

Jeffrey A. Agosta
Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. This morning I will take you through a brief review of our third quarter
results, and the impact on our outlook for the upcoming quarter. The first item I will cover is production. Our third
quarter production totaled 62.4 million oil equivalent barrels or 678,000 BOE per day. This represents a 3% increase
compared to the same period last year.
The oil side of our business delivered most of our year-over-year growth, outpacing the decline in natural gas. In total,
oil production increased 14% over the third quarter of 2011 to an average of 143,000 barrels per day. Once again,
strong year-over-year growth in our Permian and Jackfish project areas drove the performance.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue growing our oil with average daily production approaching
150,000 barrels per day. This implies 2012 oil production growth of almost 20% over last year. We expect to achieve
this, in spite of the impact from the Jackfish 1 turnaround of about 10,000 barrels per day and the delays in the ramp up
of Jackfish 2 that Dave discussed.
On the gas side, downtime at third party facilities during the fourth quarter, the impact of the 2011 Cana drilling
program that Dave discussed, and the underperformance of a Cotton Valley Taylor development program that we are
no longer pursuing will result in a decline in our fourth quarter natural gas production of about 3% compared to third
quarter.
Net-net, we now expect company-wide production of oil, gas and NGLs to be essentially flat with this year's third
quarter at 670,000 to 680,000 BOE per day.
Now for a brief review of our revenues. In the third quarter, production growth, along with improved Canadian heavy
oil realizations and higher natural gas prices drove our upstream revenue up by 7% over the prior quarter to $1.7
billion. In aggregate, oil sales, not including NGLs, once again accounted for 50% of our total upstream revenue in the
quarter, while revenue from ethane continues to be minimal at just 4% of total sales.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect regional price differentials to be generally in line with our previous
guidance with a couple of notable exceptions. Better pipeline availability and increased demand for heavier crudes
during the first half of the fourth quarter resulted in much lower differentials. We are back in a season of heavy refinery
maintenance and downtime and the supply of heavy crude is up, so differentials have temporarily widened again.
However, the average fourth quarter realizations will still be better than previously forecasted. We now expect our
fourth quarter oil price realizations in Canada to range between 64% and 74% of WTI.
For natural gas liquids, high inventory levels at Mont Belvieu, along with continued growth in NGL supplies continue
to put pressure on NGL realizations. We expect fourth quarter realizations to range from 29% to 34% of WTI.
Looking briefly at the impact of our hedges, in the third quarter our hedge position delivered cash settlements of $243
million. In total, these cash settlements enhanced our average realized prices by $3.89 per BOE, an uplift of 14% to
company-wide realizations. For the fourth quarter, we have approximately 90% of our forecasted oil production locked
in with a weighted average floor price of $96 per barrel. We also have more than 80% of our expected gas production
in Q4 hedged at a protected price of $3.64.
John mentioned earlier that the recent upward movement in natural gas prices has provided us with a good opportunity
to add attractive hedges for next year. For the full year of 2013, we now have roughly one billion cubic feet per day of
natural gas hedged with both swaps at costless collars. Of this amount, 518 million cubic feet per day have swapped at
an average price of $4.19 per Mcf. The remainder is collared at a ceiling price of $4.33 per Mcf and a floor of $3.53.
These gas hedges, coupled with our 2013 oil hedges of 76,000 barrels per day at a protected price of nearly $97 per
barrel provide a good foundation on the hedging front for next year. For more details on our hedging positions please

Turning now to midstream business, our marketing and midstream unit generated $109 million of operating profit in
the third quarter, enhancing our company-wide margins by $1.75 per BOE. Improved gas prices and cost containment
efforts helped us reach the top end of our guidance range. These solid results were also aided by the resumption of our
operations at our Gulf Coast fractionator's facility in Mont Belvieu following the completion of a recent plant
expansion. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect our midstream operating profit to range between $90 and
$110 million.
Shifting now to expenses, as John said earlier, we continue to do a good job of controlling costs. In third quarter,
expenses in several categories were lower than guidance, most notably LOE and G&A. In aggregate, our pre-tax costs
were $14.04 per BOE, about 2% lower than last quarter. This is an especially positive result considering our continued
focus on higher margin, but higher cost oil production and the negative volume impact on the quarter of the Jackfish
turnaround. Our scale and core operating regions and consistent focus on cost management allow us to maintain one of
the most competitive cost structures in the industry.
Moving now to DD&A expense, our third quarter DD&A expense was $716 million or $11.46 per BOE, right in line
with our expectations. Looking forward, given the weakness of natural gas and NGL prices over the past 12 months
there is a chance for an additional but much smaller impairment charge in the fourth quarter. Should this occur, our
fourth quarter DD&A rate would not be impacted. For Q4 we now anticipate our DD&A rate to be between $11.30 and
$11.50 per BOE.
Cutting to the bottom line. As John mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings, which exclude the asset impairment
charge and other items that analysts generally do not attempt to forecast were $0.88 per share, $0.19 higher than the
Street's mean estimate. Stronger than expected price realizations and lower pre-tax cash costs were the key drivers of
the beat. This level of earnings translated into cash flow per share of $3.01 exceeding the Street's expectations by 7%.
Before we open the call to Q&A, I will conclude my remarks with a quick review of our financial position. During the
third quarter our operating cash flow approached $1.4 billion. When you combine that with more than $500 million of
proceeds from closing the Sumitomo joint venture and other minor asset sales, our cash inflows for the quarter totaled
$1.9 billion. This cash allowed us to comfortably fund a robust capital program while maintaining excellent financial
strength. As mentioned earlier, we exited September with a net debt to adjusted cap ratio of only 15% and one of the
best liquidity positions in the E&P sector with cash and short-term investments of $7.5 billion. While Devon clearly
possesses a great deal of financial strength and flexibility, we are fully committed to exercising capital discipline,
maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength, and optimizing our per share growth and cash flow
adjusted for that debt.
So with that, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?

Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for the detailed rundown. I wonder if I could ask
you – I don't know if you're going to be able to provide a lot of detail on this. But the rig allocation that you have
currently, I wonder if you could maybe give us a quick summary as to where you are now. But more importantly, given
John's comments about spending being substantially lower next year, I wonder if you could give us an early steer as to

how you expect activity to be allocated across your plays next year? Obviously I'm anticipating it's 100% on liquids
again. But given the new acreage areas and the success you've had, I'm just trying to get an idea as to how that's going
to shake out. And I have got a follow-up, please.
<A - David A. Hager>: Sure, Doug. This is Dave Hager. I'll give you an idea for where the rigs are right now and then
where they'll be next year. But just a summary comment before I go into all the numbers. I wouldn't expect a great deal
of difference, but we are going to continue to ramp up the Permian activity next year. And we're going to be very active
in the Mississippian next year. So we have two very high quality oil plays there. And we're going to – you will see
some increases there. But everything else I think would be fairly static with where we are.
But to complete the picture for where we are right now, we currently have 20 rigs working in the Permian. Of those 20,
about nine are working in Bone Springs and Delaware plays, about five in the Wolfcamp Shale and the Cline Shale
combined, three in the Wolfberry, and three in the Central Basin platform. We have 10 rigs working in the Barnett,
seven rigs working in Cana and we'll probably ramp that back up a little bit more next year also. Mississippian, as we
said, we have 13 rigs working there. We have a total of seven rigs working in what we call our Southern Division and
that includes the work we're currently finishing up in Ohio and Michigan. Three doing Canadian exploration. Three
doing Granite Wash, and we mentioned we're going be going up to four rigs there with the success of our Hogshooter
program. Four in the Rockies, one in Lloydminster and one other doing conventional work in Canada, for a total of 69
rigs.
<A - John Richels>: And, Doug, It's John. Just let me put a little bit more color around what Dave said and reflect
back to what I was saying earlier. We are going to be cutting back – we do expect our 2013 CapEx program to be cut
back. But because of the impact of the JVs and the additional capital that comes from those joint ventures, our activity
levels, as Dave said, will stay pretty high.
<A - David A. Hager>: And a substantial part of the cutback is going to be on the leasehold side, not the drilling side.
So we're going be very active on the drilling side.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it. I appreciate that detail, thank you. I guess my follow-up's kind of related and it really
comes down to capital allocation and how do you think about this very long-term. Some of your competitors have
talked about how they're prepared to allow gas production to slide next year, I'm thinking specifically of EOG and
Chesapeake. And on the other hand, if we look where you're allocating capital outside of the U.S. and obviously the
Lower 48 is going pretty well. But Canadian differentials continue to be under pressure. And if you listen to what the
refineries are saying, they're anticipating that it's going to stay that way for quite a while.
So I'm just kind of wondering as to – now that you've had the exploration success in the Lower 48, how do you see
balancing capital between Canada, particularly longer term on Pike, relative to accelerating the Lower 48 until things
shake out in terms of where those differentials are going to be?
Because obviously it's a number we're trying to get our head around as to what is sustainable going forward while we
have differentials.
<A - John Richels>: Well, Doug, in Canada, as you're probably aware, we are not spending a large amount, or not
allocating a large amount of our capital into areas – into the conventional; we had very little activity there. And so
almost all of our expenditures in Canada have been towards these heavy oil projects. And as you know, they're very,
very long-term in nature. So for example, Jackfish 3, I think Dave mentioned we're about 47% complete or 45%
completed on that, that's going to continue over the next couple of years. And as we move into Pike, we'll do our
detailed engineering and won't even start that for over a year.
And so we're really taking a much, much longer view on that than where the differentials may be over the next couple
of years. So I think that we're pretty committed to that program in Canada. We really think that – the heavy oil program
in Canada. We really think that Pike and Jackfish are in a very, very good part of the oil sands where we can have very
good results over time and we'll continue to allocate some significant funding to that.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great, and on gas, John, on the production outlook, if you could give or say a few words about
that?
<A - John Richels>: Yeah, and on the gas side, we're really focusing on the higher margin products. And so where
we're drilling gas, we're drilling liquids-rich gas, trying to drill in the areas where those liquids are, the ones that are
providing the best returns. And if that drops off our gas a little bit, then we're not – that doesn't concern us.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Great. Thanks for answering the questions, fellas. Appreciate it.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, next question.
Operator
Next question comes from Dave Kistler from Simmons & Co.
<Q - David W. Kistler>: Morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey A. Agosta>: Morning.
<A - John Richels>: Morning.
<Q - David W. Kistler>: Probably a bit early to be asking this with the election just behind us, but can you give us
kind of latest thoughts or kind of plans with respect to repatriation of capital? And maybe even in the past you talked
about divestitures of those Canadian assets that it sounds like you might be moving to a development program. So color
on both of those would be very helpful.
<A - Jeffrey A. Agosta>: Well, Dave, this is Jeff Agosta. I'll take a crack at the first one there about the repatriation.
As we've said repeatedly that we will wait to see how the legislation process plays out. I think that it's prudent to see
how any compromise gets made with Congress and the administration on the tax front. So we're still hopeful that we
get some rational tax legislation out of our government. And it's prudent to wait. And I think it's also important to note
that our financial flexibility is not at all impeded by that; we're able to borrow in the current short-term markets at very
attractive rates. So it just makes sense to wait it out.
<Q - David W. Kistler>: Great.
<A - John Richels>: And on the other side, Dave, on your other question, yeah we've been – we're very open to
everything that's going create value. I think we always have been, we've never been shy about that, we've taken some
bold moves. And so we're always looking at ways to increase value. So I can't tell you anything specific, but we're
looking at all of our assets and making sure that we manage them in a way that over time creates the most value.
<Q - David W. Kistler>: Great. Appreciate that. And then this kind of follows up, and Jeff maybe touched on a little
bit, but thoughts with respect to cash outflows, in terms of either providing increased dividends or share buybacks – or
you're going to have to think about that relative to legislation – and use of capital?
<A - Jeffrey A. Agosta>: You know Dave, we've been very consistent over the past, I don't know, 18 years of
increasing our dividend and being very shareholder friendly through buying back 20% of our outstanding stock since
2004. We've consistently raised that dividend every year with the exception during the financial crisis in 2009 and 2010
when we were going through our repositioning. And we will continue to look at that, all with a view towards
maximizing cash flow per share adjusted for debt.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Yeah, Dave, this is Vince. I might add that really thoughts around share repurchases are
undertaken in conjunction with our capital budgeting process, which is currently underway.
<Q - David W. Kistler>: Okay. Appreciate that color, guys. Thank you.

Next question comes from the line of David Tameron from Wells Fargo.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Hi. Good morning. Can you guys talk about at the Analyst Day you guys laid out that
five-year CAGR, 6% to 8%. Can you talk about any change given – I know there's been some temporary disruptions,
but given some of the disruptions of the production this year, can you – any change to that longer term?
<A - David A. Hager>: David, I think you're referring to the analyst day we gave an illustration of what our assets
could do under a specific set of assumptions. Those assumptions included price outlook, price realizations relative to
benchmarks and the performance of our assets. If you look at things that have changed since that date, we've got NGLs
and our expectations for NGLs as a percentage of WTI have come down. I think gas prices have probably ticked up a
little bit. Oil prices are a little weaker. And the changes to our portfolio, we've seen the delay in the Jackfish ramp-up,
should not affect the multi-year period. And we've also seen some good progress in de-risking some of our major oil
plays. So all those things go into the mix.
I mean ultimately how much we grow top line depends on how much capital we spend, and we're always trying to
optimize the per share growth not the top line growth and it's a continually evolving picture.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: All right. Okay. And let me follow-up, let me go completely unrelated. In the Cline Shale,
can you talk about where – I know you're drilling on that eastern shelf, if you will, I assume that's where's the Cline
Shale – can you say specifically what area of that acreage you're targeting? And the five horizontals you mentioned that
are in various stages, can you just talk about where those have been drilled, what counties?
<A - David A. Hager>: Sure. And the plan is to get a good representation of wells across our entire acreage position so
we can evaluate it all. The first three wells that we have drilled have been located in Sterling County. Since that time,
we've actually gone up and drilled a Mississippian well that I mentioned up in Fisher County where we have quite a bit
of acreage as well. And we have a couple wells we're currently drilling and completing in Mitchell and Nolan County
as well. And so if you look at our acreage position it is – those are the four main counties where we have it. Sterling,
Mitchell, Nolan and Fisher with a little bit in Scurry County as well.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: All right. That's helpful. Thanks for the answers on both.

Next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - John Richels>: Morning, Brian.
<A - Jeffrey A. Agosta>: Morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: On the acreage portion of your CapEx budget, how much is that now up to for 2012? Do you
see and/or expect additional joint ventures to offset at some point, some of that? As we look ahead to next year, it
seems like over the last couple years, there have been a number of upward revisions to your budget for the purposes of
acquiring acreage. Is there anything different now in terms of thinking about a year from now having a budget that's
meaningfully down versus the budget versus 2012?
<A - Vincent W. White>: Brian, this is Vince. I'll take the first part of the question. The acreage spend this year is
about $1 billion before any recovery to the JVs. That was the gross number, that's through the first nine months of the
year.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: And then there will be another $200 million coming in the fourth quarter, so $1.2 billion?
<A - David A. Hager>: We've recovered about $1.3 billion up front the two JVs this year.

<A - Vincent W. White>: No, but his question was, the incremental spend, we spent $1 in the first nine months, he
said another $200 million in Q4. Is that a fair assessment?
<A - David A. Hager>: That's correct. That's correct.
<A - John Richels>: And Brian, on the joint ventures we are developing some additional areas if they're right for it. I
mean these joint ventures have been very good for us and we hope good for our partners and it's something that we will
continue to be open to. It certainly improves our capital efficiency, it's something that we would do. We have allocated
a lot to leasehold over the last couple years and when you think about it, as we got out of the international and deep
water and moved onshore, we always said we would take some of those funds – and I think we got a good return on our
investments internationally and in the Gulf of Mexico – and we said we'd take some of those funds and reinvest them in
a project onshore to continue to build a good inventory of future growth, particularly on the oil side and that's what
we've been trying to do. So I think it's been a judicious reallocation of proceeds of those dispositions. And now we have
a big – pretty big asset base when you think about it and we're pretty excited about a number of the areas and optimistic
about a number of these areas, not the least of which is the Mississippian and the Cline and some things that we're
doing in the Rockies. So we've got a lot of running room right now.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: That's great. And I guess going to Canada and then Jackfish, with the two wells – the two pads
that are kind of having issues, are you confident that that is just isolated to those two areas? Or do you see any wider
implication for either of the pads that you're drilling, or kind of thinking about some of the other leases like Pike?
<A - David A. Hager>: We're very confident. We understand now what the issues are that created this. And really, you
can see it on the logs that there was some interbedded nature to the logs. What was not fully understood until we started
producing – and remember we – these pads were originally designed and approved from a regulatory standpoint four to
five years ago. When – what was not fully understood is just what would the impact of this interbedded sands and shale
have on the initial steam chamber development?
So we're confident now, we understand that, we've seen this. We've actually observed it with, not only here, but at
Jackfish and some other industry projects in the same area. So the fact that this happened – we understand the nature,
we're very confident we can overcome this. The reserves are there. We're still going to get all the reserves. It's just a
delay on these pads and getting the production up to full speed. And we know how to place future pads to avoid these
issues.
<A - John Richels>: And one other thing, Brian, I'll just throw into what Dave has said, is it's important to understand
that as we drill an additional couple of well pads, all we're doing is moving that capital forward. We're not adding a
bunch of capital. And that's because over time, we do believe that we'll recover all of the reserves in these first two well
pads. So it's not like we're adding a bunch more wells. We're just moving them forward.
<A - David A. Hager>: And I'd like to add, we're very confident still that the Jackfish and the Pike areas are really
top-tier projects. If there was a mistake that was made, it's just that we didn't add enough spare wells initially to make
sure that the plant was full. But from a geological perspective, there is no question, these are top-tier reservoirs in the
best part of the SAGD development.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: That's helpful color. Thank you.

The next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Good morning, guys. Kind of a tough morning to report your results, but. A question, and

it projected to bounce back up? I note you didn't change your guidance on the LOE. But if you could just talk about in

[indiscernible] (56:20) terms?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, I would not expect the LOE to go lower. We are very proud of our performance on LOE
because even as we're making the shift to a higher oil percentage as part of our overall production – everybody knows
that oil's more expensive to operate than natural gas – and so the fact that we've been able to really mitigate the impact
of that through our LOE is good. But because we are continuing to shift to more oil as a higher percentage of our
production, I wouldn't anticipate it going lower on a per-barrel basis. But we – it's something we work every day and
we think we're pretty darn good at it.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Got it. Thanks. That's exactly the detail I was looking for. And then the second question,
this goes back to Jackfish a bit. As I look back at my notes from the – from your Analyst Day, I think back then you
were expecting to go post-payout in late 2012, and that's now shifted into 2013, and I guess that would make sense
because oil prices are a little lower – have been lower than they were then. But does that then give you a little bit higher
oil take in Q4 because of that? Or is that even a meaningful piece that we should think about?
<A - Jeffrey A. Agosta>: Well, we were expecting, Brian, we were expecting payout – I'm sorry Charles – we were
expecting payout in – at right around year-end, and so it really doesn't have an impact on fourth quarter expected oil
production. Now we expect it to be some point in the first quarter, not exactly sure when. It will depend on oil prices,
so.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: All right. Thank you, Jeff. That's answered my question.
<A - Jeffrey A. Agosta>: Thank you, Charles.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Christensen from Buckingham Research.
<Q - Robert Lee Christensen>: Thank you. First question is on the structural things that hurt Canadian differentials
and pipeline projects. Are you optimistic about more Canadian pipeline projects, Enbridge and Keystone, working in
your favor over the next couple of quarters, years? I mean what intelligence do you have that that's happening? And
then I guess on the demand side, the Upper Midwest refineries, are those enlarging, expanding, on schedule to close
differentials?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Yeah, Bob, this is Darryl Smette. Obviously as we went through this year, we had supply of
heavy oil and pipeline capacity and refining capacity pretty well in balance. Actually had a little bit more pipeline
capacity and refining capacity than we had supply. However, we had a number of unplanned outages, both in terms of
refineries and pipelines in the second and third quarter that widened those differentials. They really started to improve
in September as some of that unplanned outage come back on and some of the pipeline capacity come back on. So
those differentials Jeff mentioned narrowed starting in September and narrowed pretty significantly through September,
October and into the first part of November.
As we got to the middle of November, we have, both in the U.S. and Canada, about 1 million barrels a day of refining
capacity that has went down for turnaround. And so we have again seen those differentials widen about $10 to $12 a
barrel. That refinery maintenance should be completed sometime early in the first part of the – first quarter of next year.
So we should get that refinery capacity back. In addition to that, we have two refineries that are coming on-stream. One
in December, a Marathon refinery in Detroit that's going to bring about 80,000 to 90,000 barrels additional of refining
capacity. So that's coming on. And then the Whiting refinery that's converting to heavy oil should be on sometime in
the second quarter; that's about 250,000 to 270,000 barrels a day of capacity.
So although we're seeing some increase in production in heavy oil, the increase in pipeline-refining capacity is actually
exceeding what we're seeing in production. And so we do think as we get through the first quarter, we will start to see
some downward pressure on those differentials.

In addition to that, we are actually seeing an increase in rail activity out of Canada. It's actually increased from about
800 railcars a day up to about 1,100 to 1,200 railcars a day. A lot of that oil is being railed to the West Coast and the
East Coast and not going to the mid-continent. So we have a combination of things that are looking better as we get
through the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year; as we get into the second quarter of 2013 and beyond, it
starts to look a lot better.
<Q - Robert Lee Christensen>: And my second question is, maybe Vince answers, I don't – Jeff answers. The cash
flow per debt adjusted share, do you have that calculation for the third quarter versus a year ago? Has it been growing,
that metric? Has it been improving?
<A - Vincent W. White>: You know we're – first of all, I don't have it at my fingertips. We do monitor that. And the
prices have a huge impact over the short-term and – as well as our product allocation. But I can't give you that
comparison right off.
<A - Jeffrey A. Agosta>: I would say yeah that due to product prices being much lower in the third quarter of this year
than they were last year, it has probably gone down for us and the industry.
<Q - Robert Lee Christensen>: Okay. Fair. Thank you.
Vincent W. White
