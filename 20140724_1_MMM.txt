Now please turn to slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 3M performed strong in the second quarter,
once again posting organic growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. Our team delivered record sales
and rising margins, and did so while continuing to build for the future. Let me take you through a few highlights for the
quarter.
Earnings were $1.91 per share, up 11.7% year-over-year. Sales rose to $8.1 billion, which marks the highest quarterly
sales in 3M history. Organic local currency growth was 4.8%, led by Electronics and Energy at 6%. Health Care,
Industrial, and Safety and Graphics each grew 5%, and Consumer grew 4%.
Geographic growth was paced by Asia Pacific at 7%. Europe/Middle East/Africa and the United States both grew 5%,
followed by Latin America/Canada at 3%.
Premier margins remain a hallmark of 3M. In the second quarter, margins rose to nearly 23%, up 80 basis points from
last year. I'm pleased that all five business groups delivered margins greater than 20%, demonstrating the breadth of our
strength. As you know, we are managing toward a better optimized capital structure. This will enable us to invest more
in the business and return more cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we returned $2 billion to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases.
And as you see on slide 4, last week we announced our plan to acquire the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary
at a price of $885 million. This business is a leader in many of our Industrial divisions, plus Electronics and Energy. In
addition, we see significant opportunities in Japan's addressable markets for our Health Care, Safety and Graphics, and
Consumer businesses. Upon closing of the deal, 3M will have full control of one of our largest and most successful
subsidiaries. We look forward to growing this business even further in the future.
Now please turn to slide 5. Today, we're reaffirming our earnings and organic growth outlook for the full year. We
continue to expect earnings per share of $7.30 to $7.55 and organic sales growth of plus 3% to plus 6%. Currency
impacts should reduce full-year sales by approximately 1%. And we still estimate a tax rate of 28% to 29% with free
cash flow conversion at 90% to 100%.
I'd like to mention a few other notable things from the second quarter. In April, 3M earned a United States
Environment (sic) [Environmental] Protection Agency's ENERGY STAR award for the 10th consecutive year. No
other industrial company has been so recognized by the EPA. Research and development is the heartbeat of our
company. And in May, we were pleased to receive our 100,000th patent.
And last month, we appointed Nick Gangestad as our Chief Financial Officer. I would like to take this opportunity to
thank David Meline for his contribution over six years, including three years as CFO, which followed three years as
Chief Accounting Officer. Nick now becomes CFO, also after serving three years as Chief Accounting Officer.
Previously, Nick held key leadership positions in multiple business groups around the world and is well prepared for
this, his new role. He's a 27-year veteran of 3M, and I've personally known and worked with Nick for the last 10 of
those years. He has worked directly with me on executing our financial and operational strategies, and I'm happy to
have him as our CFO. And by that, I give the call over to Nick. Nick?
Nicholas C. Gangestad
Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Let me just say that I am excited to lead 3M's finance team and to help
the 3M leadership team create even greater value going forward. And to those of you on the line that I have yet to meet,
I certainly look forward to meeting you in the future.

Now please turn to slide 6, and I'll take you through our income statement. The company operated well in the second
quarter, with sales exceeding $8 billion for the first time in our history. Compared to last year, sales were up 5%,
operating income up 9%, and earnings per share up 12%. Productivity was particularly strong this quarter, which
helped fuel more investment in SG&A and R&D as we continue building for the future. And, at the same time, we
expanded operating margins by nearly one point.
I'll go into a little more detail on the margin change. Leverage on organic volume added 30 basis points to second
quarter operating margins, and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 1.2
percentage points year-on-year. Selling prices continue to be supported by technology innovation, which is a key,
fundamental strength of the company and helps drive unique customer solutions and an increasing flow of new
products. We also began raising prices in mid-2013 to help offset currency weakness in select developing countries.
This will result in our price performance moderating in the second half of the year beginning in Q3. And, on the raw
material front, we are benefiting from lower market prices and from our sourcing team's efforts to reduce costs even
further.
Reduced pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to second quarter margins. Strategic investments this
quarter reduced margins year-on-year by 40 basis points. This included increases in new, disruptive R&D programs,
business transformation and ERP costs, and restructuring. Foreign exchange impacts, excluding the positive price
recovery I just mentioned, reduced margins by 60 basis points. All in all, second quarter earnings increased 12% to
$1.91 per share. Foreign currency impacts reduced earnings by $0.04 per share, and a higher tax rate reduced earnings
by another $0.05 per share. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's second quarter, which
added $0.09 to second quarter earnings per share. All things considered, this was a good quarter for the company.
Slide 7 outlines the details of our second quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 4.8%,
with volumes up 3.5% and selling prices up 1.3%. Our businesses have done a good job of executing on their growth
plans. Acquisitions added 10 basis points to sales growth, and foreign exchange had no impact on the second quarter
worldwide sales. On a total U.S. dollar basis, sales rose 4.9% versus the second quarter of 2013. As was the case in the
first quarter, organic sales growth was positive across all major geographic areas.
Asia Pacific organic growth was 6.6%. Organic growth was again broad-based, with all five business groups growing,
led by our Electronics and Energy and Consumer businesses. Organic growth was 7% in Japan, or 2% ex Electronics.
China/Hong Kong grew 6% organically in Q2, or 10% excluding Electronics, which was an improvement versus the
first quarter's underlying growth rate.
Organic growth in EMEA was 4.8% in the second quarter. West Europe grew 3.5%. Central/East Europe grew high
single digits, and Middle East/Africa grew at a double-digit pace. EMEA's growth was strongest in Safety and
Graphics, Electronics and Energy, and Industrial. Our teams in EMEA are executing well in 2014.
In the United States, second quarter organic local currency growth was 4.5%, up from Q1 and led by Health Care and
Safety and Graphics.
Finally, Latin America/Canada grew 2.7% organically, with Electronics and Energy and Health Care leading the way.
Mexico generated double-digit organic growth, and Brazil was down slightly. Organic local currency growth was 7%
across all developing markets and 4% in developed markets.
Now let's turn to cash flow. Turn to slide number 8. Looking at first half 2014 results, free cash flow was $2.1 billion,
or $143 million above 2013 levels. Operating cash flow was up $59 million, and capital expenditures were $84 million
lower versus the prior year. We expect the full-year CapEx to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in 2014,
down slightly versus a previous expectation of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. We are encouraged to see that our portfolio
management efforts are providing greater clarity regarding business unit priorities and their related CapEx needs.
Improved plant productivity is also freeing up capacity, as we continue to improve our plant efficiency and add Lean
capability over time. Through the first six months of 2014, we converted 85% of net income to free cash flow, versus
84% in the first half of 2013. We continue to expect full-year conversion to be in the range of 90% to 100%.

At our 2013 December investor meeting, we articulated plans to manage toward a better optimized capital structure
going forward, and to allocate capital accordingly. The plan calls for additional balance sheet leverage, which we'll use
for two purposes: first, to invest in order to expand and improve our businesses; and second, to increase cash returns to
shareholders. We are executing this plan in 2014, evidenced, in part, by last week's announcement that we will acquire
the remaining 25% noncontrolling interest in Sumitomo 3M, which Inge covered earlier. We will finance this deal with
non-U.S. cash, and we expect it to close in the third quarter.
We also paid $1.1 billion in cash dividends in the first six months of 2014, up $246 million year-on-year. Gross share
repurchases were $3.1 billion during that same period. For full-year 2014, we expect gross share repurchases will be in
the range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion versus a previous expectation of $4 billion to $5 billion. Net debt at the end of
June was $2.8 billion, up $1.5 billion versus year-end 2013. During the second quarter, 3M issued $625 million of
five-year debt at a coupon of 1.625% and $325 million of 30-year debt at a coupon of 3.875%.
Next I'll go through the results for each of our business groups, starting with Industrial. Please go to slide number 9.
Our Industrial business continues to perform nicely, with second quarter sales of $2.8 billion and 5% organic local
currency growth. Our 3M purification business again grew at a double-digit pace in the second quarter, and we also
posted nice growth in automotive OEM, aerospace and commercial transportation, abrasive systems, and industrial
adhesives and tapes. On a geographic basis, Industrial organic growth was 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in both the U.S.
and EMEA. Latin America/Canada was down slightly in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $617
million. Operating margins were 21.9%. Recall that each of our business groups is absorbing incremental investment in
2014 related to business transformation and ERP implementation. This had the effect of reducing Q2 margins for each
of our five businesses by 30 basis points.
Let's now look at Safety and Graphics, found on slide 10. You'll see that Safety and Graphics' sales were $1.5 billion in
the quarter, with organic growth of 5%. Personal safety is a Heartland division in 3M and one of our largest in terms of
sales. It was once again the fastest-growing business within Safety and Graphics, posting high single-digit organic
growth in Q2. We also saw positive growth in commercial solutions and in traffic, safety, and security systems. Sales in
our roofing granules business declined versus last year's second quarter. Safety and Graphics grew organically in all
major geographic areas, led by EMEA at 7% and U.S. at 5%. Operating income was $353 million in the second quarter,
and operating margins were a solid 23.6%.
Please go to slide 11. Electronics and Energy also turned in a good second quarter performance. Sales were $1.4
billion, up 6% in organic local currency terms. Our electronics-related business posted organic local currency growth of
11%. Growth was strong in both display materials and systems and in electronics materials and solutions. In our
energy-related businesses, sales increased 1% organically. Second quarter organic local currency growth was 9% in
Latin America/Canada, 8% in Asia Pacific, and 6% in EMEA. The U.S. was flat year-on-year. Operating income rose
23% to $293 million, and the operating margins were 20.6%.
Next I'll take you through Health Care, found on slide 12. Building on a strong first quarter performance, our Health
Care business once again delivered strong growth and profitability. Second quarter sales were just over $1.4 billion,
organic local currency sales growth was 5%, and margins were strong at 30.7%. All businesses contributed to Health
Care's growth in the second quarter. Health information systems, critical and chronic care, and infection prevention led
the way. In April, we also further strengthened our health information systems business by acquiring Treo Solutions, a
leader in using data analytics to redesign payment structures and help transition health care providers to value-based
care models. Integration efforts are running ahead of expectations. Health Care's organic sales grew in all geographic
areas, paced by Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific at 7%, the U.S. at 6%, and EMEA at 3%. Operating income
was $434 million, and, again, operating margins were 30.7%. Adjusting for Treo, operating margins were 31.1%.
I'll wrap up with the Consumer business group, found on slide number 13. Sales in the Consumer business group were
$1.1 billion, with organic local currency growth of 4%. Our construction and home improvement business delivered
strong, double-digit organic growth in the second quarter, and we also posted positive growth in our Consumer health
care and home care businesses. Stationery and office supply sales were basically flat year-on-year. Second quarter
organic growth across Consumer was 4% in the U.S., which was up from Q1. Back-to-school activity began in late Q2,

so we're off to a good start there. Elsewhere, Consumer's organic growth was 8% in Asia Pacific and 4% in EMEA. In
Latin America/Canada, sales were down slightly in organic local currency terms. Operating income was $241 million,
with operating margins of 21.1%.
That wraps up my review, and now I'll turn it back to Inge.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Nick. As you can see, there's a lot to like this quarter across the entire company. In Industrial, for example,
our automotive volumes grew four times the rate of global auto builds. And in 3M purification, formerly known as
Cuno, organic growth was 13%, and we see this business accelerating in many areas of the world. I'm encouraged by
the growth in Consumer after a modest first quarter, which includes a nice improvement in the United States. Our home
improvement division, together with Consumer health care and home care, all showed good growth. Our Safety and
Graphics business performed well. Personal safety, for example, grew 9% globally, including more than 25% in China.
In Health Care, we continue to expand worldwide, with 12% growth in developing markets this quarter. I'm pleased
that all Health Care businesses grew on a global basis. Finally, in Electronics and Energy, our portfolio management
actions continue to pay off. Over the past couple of years, we have consolidated several divisions to better align with
customers and improve our competitiveness. Those actions, along with strong volumes, drove margins higher in the
second quarter. Through six months, margins were 19%, and we expect the full year to trend towards 20%.
So, overall, I want to thank our entire 3M team for delivering another strong, broad-based performance. And going
forward, we will continue to gain even more value through our three strategic levers: portfolio management, investing
in innovation, and business transformation. Those levers are helping us deliver solid results today while also building a
stronger foundation for long-term success. Thank you for your attention, and with that we now welcome your
questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Not much to pick on in the quarter. It was solid overall. But one thing that wasn't clear in the
slides, at least on slide 9, Industrial, was margins were down 60 bips, and you explained 30 bips of it, but I would have
thought with organic growth of about 5%, you would have had some operating leverage on that. So maybe just some
clarification on why those margins were down.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Hi, Scott, this is Inge. Well, when you think about our business group in Industrial, that's
the biggest business group for us and also the business group that we are historically and still today entering first when
we go into new markets, based on the size and scale and so forth. And that's the way we have talked about how we
build out businesses from infrastructure, Industrial, Safety, Consumer, and Health Care, as the economies evolve. So if
you think about that business on a global scale the way we operate it, that's like 32% of total company. When you go to
developing economies, it's slightly more. It's 35%, 36%. And then you go to emerging markets, which is closer, I would
say, to 45%.
So when we looked upon it – and just as you said, so why was this happening? The real reason there is actually they
had a bigger slowdown in the emerging market in the developing world. So I'm not concerned at all about it. In fact,
which I looked upon Industrial in terms of the growth, which is the important element, we saw 5% growth in United

States. We saw 5% in Europe/Middle East/Africa, and we saw 11% in China. So when I looked upon it overall, I'm
pleased with Industrial, but the reason is the 30 basis points, as you call out, and then as that portfolio in that type of
emerging market, as we all know at the moment, there is some small turbulence, I would say, if you think about
Central/East Europe; we have a little bit of impact in Latin America, et cetera, that's the reason. But I am not
concerned, and I don't think you should be concerned either. We have a very good team there that are running those
businesses very well. And you saw, automotive very good, purification, again, a fantastic quarter. So all core
businesses are doing well there.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. That helps a lot. And, Inge, just because you referenced macro, I mean, I think we've had
15 companies report so far this quarter, and I can't tell whether the world's getting better or the world's getter worse.
What is your view on global macro, maybe by region?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, first of all, there is the macro picture and then how we will – how we expect to
perform in that world, if you think. So, first of all, I would say in West Europe, if you think about us, we guided the
year from flat to 3%, and we came out first quarter with 3%, actually this quarter more or less the same, and we still
think that that will be the range for us for the year. So that's a little bit on the positive side for us in terms of our
execution.
In Asia, we saw a slight improvement in China, our what I would call base business, and for me, that base business, so
we talk the same language, is if I take out Electronics because that is moving around Asia in between countries. Our
base business in China consequently went from 8% to 10%, and has a big improvement versus a year ago. And our
Japanese business, in fact, in total grew 7%. And if you, again, look upon the base, that was 2%. So I would say Asia is
going sideways, slightly up.
West Europe, as we expected. United States, small strength, and we had a better second quarter than first. And as you'll
recall, I said at that time I'm not concerned about U.S. because I had a feeling it would come back in the second and
that was correct.
I think the place where we see a little bit more of a challenge in Latin America, where we said before for the year 8% to
11%, and we think now maybe mid-digit for the year. So slightly – slightly down, but it's offset for us by other regions
of the world. So I think that's what we are saying, still 3% to 6%. So I would say that I don't see much of a movement
versus what we have talked about earlier. Latin America slightly slower. West Europe slightly better. U.S. slightly
better. And those are big geographical areas, so that will compensate more to what you can see. As I will identifies a
temporarily slowdown in Latin America.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, that's great. I will pass it on. Thanks and good luck, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning. Inge, very strong results in Electronics and Energy. Can you
give us a little more color on the margin expansion you've had in the first half, and I guess a little bit more margin
expansion in the back half to get to the full 20% you're guiding to?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, first of all, as you recall, we looked upon our portfolio and it's almost two years
ago now and we consolidated many businesses that was related to Electronics and Energy in the company, that in some
cases we had in different components of the company. So we tried to streamline the organization and consolidate in
order for us to be faster to market and be able to respond to the customer need. So we did that, and we combined the
division. And the outcome of that is that we got a lower infrastructure to work with. We have got better utilization of
our assets, and we are faster to respond to markets. And we have moved, I would say, from, in some cases, product
sales to more system sales, which is now paying off.

So I think it's – we had 11% growth in Electronics, and a lot of that is coming through the new approach with this
display material system division that is now selling components into solutions for the electronic market. So I would say
it's a combination of efficiency in the organization, better utilization in manufacturing, and then we had the volume
upticks that came direct, based on the work we're doing with a customer. So we think about where we are taking that
business for the last 18 months or so from 15% to 17%, and actually this quarter it did over 20%. But the plan is to go
towards 20%, and that's where we are for the year. I think the plan is 19%-plus, and I think that's what we'll end up for
the remainder of the year. And so it will be a good year for that group, and they have really responded well to our
portfolio management initiatives.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Very good and impressive. And one more thing, Inge, just on Safety. This double-digit
growth you've seen in personal protection, how sustainable is that growth in the back half of the year?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, we have a very strong position in that business historically. It's a fantastic platform for us,
and it's very global in scope. And we are, I would say, the leader in that whole space relative to respiratory protection.
It's sustainable, and I think the trends are positive for us. And if you think about some parts of the world where it's very
strong regulations, like United States and West Europe and so forth, and we're doing well there. And then you have, I
would say, developing economies, and I would put China into developing economies. So if you think about China in
terms of mega-trends in China, it's air pollution, it's water, and it's food safety. On air pollution, it's playing very well to
our very strong position in this business. So when you see 9% growth for a quarter, 25%-plus in China, it's sustainable
as a business on a global space. And one other reasoning – we have scale, and we have a very professional team in
place, and it's a regulated business, so it's good for, us generally speaking.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Hey, thanks, and good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steven.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Inge, just a quick question, or Nick. On the Sumitomo impact, you said it's closing
September 1. You've got a 12-month $0.08 impact. You're not changing guidance. So that first four months, which I
guess I would have assumed would be more cost than benefit, you're just making up for that elsewhere? Or how should
we think about the dilutive or accretive impact before the end of this year?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Steve, this is Nick. You're correct. We've said that's approximately an $0.08
benefit over the 12 months, and we are expecting this to close on September 1. At this point, we felt it was premature to
change our guidance at this point. We're halfway through the year. Everything's going right down the middle of what
we're expecting. And just as this is a slight upside to our original expectation, we have other things that are on a slight
negative, for example, FX impact. We started the year thinking that would be flat to hurting us by $0.05. We're now in
the $0.07, $0.08 range of impact. So all in all, we think everything is staying very close to our original guidance.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay, and then -
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Steve, this is Matt. Maybe one follow-up, the transaction should not have a lot of costs
associated with it from a integration standpoint, but third quarter we expect really de minimis impact on earnings. And
assuming we close on September 1 as expected, we'd expect some slight accretion, and you could think about it on a
straight-line basis, using that $0.08 as a guide.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Fantastic. That's very helpful. The other point is on CapEx, that roughly, what, $200
million lower guide than last quarter, and you called out some of the Lean and other impacts that you're having. But
this strikes me as a really potentially massive shift in terms of what you're getting out of this. Can you maybe talk also
– are there any things that you're deferring, what you aren't doing? Even year-on-year it's lower now. And should we

kind of rethink our business model on the CapEx side for 3M going forward, based on what you're getting as indicated
here or am I making too big a deal out of it?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Steve, I appreciate the question. Our business model over a longer period of time is we
invest between 4.5% and 5% of revenue in CapEx. And we started the year with an estimate on the high end of that
range. As we've gone through the year and we're seeing those benefits, which I talked about earlier, we're seeing an
opportunity that we don't need some of the capital that we started out the year anticipating we may need. There's really,
I would say, Steve, to your question, should we change the modeling going forward? No. We're basically in that 4.5%
to 5% range, and we expect to stay there. As a temporary – what we're seeing of the benefits this year, and really
reflects great results that the team is doing so far this year.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: We don't hold back on any investment relative to our growth. So there we continue them as we
have laid out. But, again, for me, this is a positive sign relative to the operation here, in terms of, in some cases, better
utilization around the world, right? And if you think about our strategy, it's the fourth strategy that – as we laid out –
where we talk about intensify capabilities to achieve regional self-sufficiency. I think we've been able to start to move
in that direction. But it's too early to change the model by definition. But I think it's this year. This is what it look for
us, and then we think it's the right time now we have to correct that for the year.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hi, yes, good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes, just want to follow up on Steve's question. Just thinking about Energy and Electronics, I
know this was a big focus for the team in terms of improving efficiency of this business. You guys have alluded to
sourcing initiatives. You have alluded to planned productivity initiatives. Do you care to quantify the impact of those,
and when – if not now, when do you think we will hear about sort of more discrete items there?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Andrew, in terms of productivity, in the past we've shared in our margin walk how we
see productivity impacting or – positively or negatively our results. If you think back to a year ago, we were showing
with utilization a negative impact on our financial results. This quarter, we're not showing that. Year-on-year, we're
seeing a benefit by that lack of headwind. And in measuring productivity in our plants, something that was slightly
negative in 2013 has turned slightly positive for us in the first half of this year.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Okay, but it just seems it's sort of a broader initiative than just quarter-over-quarter change. But I
guess we can take that offline. The other question, though, on the CapEx question, you did cut CapEx. Yet you left
your cash realization target intact. So is there extra cash consumption on the working capital side, or are you being
conservative right now?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: I think we also like to keep the flexibility as we go here. So the way I think about it and we
think about it, we're like six months into the year, and we would like to keep the flexibility as we go. There's two more
quarters, and we were able to hopefully talk more about it on the next quarter as we move ahead.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Terrific. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Nick, you mentioned the expectation of pricing would start to lap tougher comps. What about the
other side of the equation, raw materials? It looks like raw materials are pretty flat year-over-year in 2Q. I'm just
wondering what you see in terms of trends in some of your key raw materials?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Nigel, on the raw materials front, we've been seeing our raw material prices in
aggregate drop between 1.5% and 2%. We saw that in the first two quarters of the year. We expect that to continue.
And if you think back to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, we expected raw materials to benefit us by
$0.05 to $0.15 for the year. We still see ourselves in that range, probably tracking closer to the high end in that range.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. So you said raw materials still down year-over-year in the second half of the year?
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Yes, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, okay. And then secondly on the ERP, just wondered if you could maybe just talk about where
you are versus plan on the rollout this year. I noticed that the sort of early phases resulted in lower corporate as you
were allocating costs more to the segments, and I noticed the corporate was a little bit lower year-over-year, and I'm
wondering, is the ERP continuing to have that impact between corporate and segments?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yes. We're on plan relative to the rollout. We had talked about it earlier. We're rolled out now
in five countries around the world. We have, in addition to that rollout, four distribution centers in West Europe or
Central/East Europe. So we have done one in UK. We have done one in France. We have done one in Poland. And, just
beginning of this month, we roll out the biggest one, which is in Jüchen in Germany, our biggest distribution center in
West Europe. And I was, in fact, myself over there just a week before and then followed up slightly after that and
walked the floors relative to make sure with the team that we were prepared for that cut-over. And I'm very pleased to
say that it's going very well relative to that execution. So I would say that even – as you know, when you make those
moves, right, you always learn a little bit on every place, and we have. And I would say that we just take those
learnings and we step up our mitigations and the team in place in order to be more effective as we implement as we go
ahead.
But in terms of the financials, you see there in terms of cost, is still accurate. There's no change to that. And I would
say that as we move ahead, probably we would like to make sure we maybe can accelerate some of the implementation
in places where we can get even better financial benefits. So maybe not change the figure in terms of end goal, but see
if we can capture something earlier and get more focus around it. But so far so good. But, again, as you know, there's
always a little bit of change management as you do those type of things, right? But I think the important thing – the
prime metric for us is customer satisfaction.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Right.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: And, Nigel, to add – this is Nick. I want to add one point on that. The 30 basis point
increase in spending that we're seeing in our five businesses are from spending that we are now putting into the
businesses to do this. And this is not a shift between corporate miscellaneous and the businesses. If you're looking at
the corporate miscellaneous piece, the year-on-year change there is really driven by a reduction in our pension expense,
largely, as we had laid out at the beginning of the year.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Was hoping to get more color regarding the growth investments. You said it was a 40 basis
point hit. That's broadly across 3M. But how does that impact the individual segments, and what kind of return are you
expecting on both the pure new products but as well as the restructurings?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Well, Deane, our strategic investments come in – there's multiple categories there. One
is our invest in innovation, as you're alluding to, and that is still an investment mode where we're working to develop
those new technologies for the future, and we're not expecting a accretive benefit to growth from those investments in
2014 and little in 2015. For the rest of our strategic investments that we've talked about, part of that is restructuring,
and part of that is our incremental investment in business transformation and ERP. Those are tracking approximately
where we've expected. On the restructuring front, we're about halfway through the year, and we've spent about half of
what we expect to spend for the year on restructuring. Benefits in the last half of the year, we still see in low single
digit millions of dollars. We expect more benefit from that into the teens of millions of dollars in 2015.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great, thank you. And for Inge, it was interesting. At the very end or your prepared remarks,
you cited some upside in the business, the Cuno filtration business. There was a big multiple paid in that business a
while ago, but it looks like it's beginning to deliver the way you all had envisioned it. So what is that longer opportunity
for Cuno in the portfolio? And you've hinted in the past you might be interested in doing more water investments. And
how do you see that opportunity?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, I think, first of all, that what we call now purification, right is a business that
during the last couple of years really improved for us. So let's put out a little bit of perspective.
You talk about when we purchased that that the multiple was high and so forth, right? I think initially when that was
purchased we didn't integrate it fast enough into 3M. So if you think about what we are looking for as fundamental
growth drivers for any business, it's around technology, manufacturing, global capabilities, and brands. Those are the
things that we need to capture when we purchase something. I think in that case we hold – and that's now many years
ago, right? But I think we hold it aside too long before we really start to drive the value that 3M will add in those four
categories.
The last three years, that have now taken place, and they have done a fantastic job in my mind relative to efficiency and
operational excellence, consolidation of manufacturing, start to lay in some of the technologies that can help them –
and then start to use the global capabilities in terms of our footprint. That's why you now see, quarter on quarter
sequential, good growth. They were 13% this quarter, was very similar first quarter of this year, and in many markets,
we see huge opportunities as we go ahead, based on our current portfolio. So it's difficult to give you a figure as you
look upon it, but, again, I go back and say that it's clear that clean water and clean air is a very important element in
most parts of the world, and specifically, I would say, in developing world. And that's also where we see a fantastic
growth rate for this business. So this is a very good space for us, and I'm very pleased where we stand today with that
business, and we will continue to invest as we go ahead for more growth and also efficiency in the organization.

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Laurence.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: China and – or your Greater China business, how fast is that growing now? And in the
comment about the energy-related businesses growing only about 1% and telecom being the leading part of that, can
you talk about how weak the rest of that business was, and were there any other end markets that decelerated in the
quarter?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, well, let's start with what we call China/Hong Kong in terms of that operation. We had –
in this quarter, we moved from Q1 8% growth to 10% growth in the quarter for China. So – and if you compare that on
that base business, that was only 1% Q2 last year. So year-over-year, good improvement, and over last quarter also
slight improvement. So that's moving forward positively. And, again, you see in businesses there that – you take
Industrial was 13% growth in the quarter, Health Care was 17% and Consumer and Office 20%, and you have Safety
and Graphics just over 10%. So it's moving ahead very well, and I think we have passed a time where China was at
25% growth for the quarter, but we're running that now at 10% and – with slight uptick. So that's good, and we feel
good about where we stand today in China.
Relative to the energy piece, there's some tender business going on in that business, and that can hit us a little bit. So
you saw telecom had 4% growth, and then some of the other businesses was down. But it was not much big figures on
the down side. And there is some, I would say, tenders that is going because some of it is government related and utility
related, so it can move a little bit in between quarters, but nothing to be really concerned about. And we have – one of
our Heartland divisions is part of that, right? So it was not much down, just a little bit. We're very pleased about
telecom -
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Thank you.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: – telecom grew 4%. That was a good figure for us.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Hi, Jeff.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Morning. I was wondering if we could just go back to the cash flow discussion a little bit. A
good discussion so far. I just wanted to kind of talk about working capital a little bit. Nick or Inge, as I think about kind
of the ERP and the distribution centers and the like, is there a release of working capital that we should be expecting, if
it's not this year, into next year? So you've got really kind of very little operating cash flow growth year to date, right?
So I don't know if that's tied to these distribution centers or if you could just kind of comment on how that plays out
going forward?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Jeff, on the cash flow and the working capital, managing our inventory continues
to be one of our important priorities, and improving our inventory turns. Making some progress there; we expect more
progress on that in the coming quarters. Specifically to your question about business transformation, ERP, and the
impact that could be having over the long term, we are convinced that where we're going with business transformation
and ERP that we have significant opportunities to improve our working capital and in particular inventory management
and generate benefits there. In the short term, in particular in the second quarter, with some of our go-live activity we
had, there was minimal, I'll call it, in the $10 million to $30 million increased inventory in some the channel in
anticipations of go-live activity.

<A - Matthew Ginter>: But if, Jeff, your question was the longer term, it was a little hard to tell on our end. We have
talked about a longer-term opportunity in working capital, but that bigger win is not something we'd expect in the next
year or two necessarily. We've sized that at about $500 million.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. Thank you for the clarification there. And I'm just wondering on share repurchase, kind
of, is there – we obviously can do the math on the share price and figure out what a dollar buys these days, but is there
any additional pressure on just kind of other dilutive effects, option exercises, or anything else that kind of eats against
that gross number?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: No, there's nothing out of the ordinary there, Jeff, that's happening on a dilution basis.
We did pick up our activity some in the first half of the year. We saw it as a good opportunity, and on the dilution front,
very, very similar to trends what we've seen in the last year.

Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Hey, thank you. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Ajay.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Just maybe on energy, so the work you're doing on consolidating the divisions. I guess, showing
in the margins here, so the question is, is this improvement, is this a couple-quarter phenomena, or do you think this
could be – it could be a run rate for a couple years here? And the business has been below company margins, so do you
think there's opportunity to take margins up to more near the company average levels?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, think about it in this way. We are running around 22% to 23% margin as an enterprise.
We have some businesses that is running in the middle of that, and you have two that is type of – one is higher, which
is Health Care, and then you have Electronics and Energy that is lower. And as you'll recall, when we started the
journey, this was around 15%-plus. That industry, by definition – that's a good margin in that industry by definition,
and yet there will always be a differentiation. So I would say that this move from 15% closer to 20% over this period of
time was our expectation. If it will go more up in the area of 25% to 30%, I don't think that's realistic for that market in
order for to us do that. But I think any business in 3M, our expectation is that you should be close to the average of the
company. And our organization there today is more streamlined, and I think we are better prepared also to deal with
some eventual volatility in that market on the Electronics side that we know will come from time to time. That's part of
that business, and we play in that business, so that's okay.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Good. That's helpful. And then Treo, could you maybe provide some color on the margin profile
there? And then how should we think about the trajectory and the impact on segment margins as you kind of integrate
that business?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, first of all, that's an integration into our health information systems. So that
business has been growing – health information systems has been growing very well for us the last five to 10 years.
And you should think about it in terms of that this acquisition is actually an addition in order for us to get more
relevance into different parts of the segment. So health information systems today is a growing business, and we are
doing that for providers, encoding, grouping and analytics, and that's through hospital providers. Now we will get
access to a vast set of payers that then they can help to connect the two of them. So that's – the model is moving from
volume-based to quality outcome. This is where it will help. So I will look upon it as an integrated part of the current
business we have. And it's a relatively small business, as you know. So it's more for us to be able to get access and
connect the two entities together.

<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So my first question is just on price-cost. Clearly another good quarter, above 100 basis
points, but it looks like Lat Am FX was a benefit. Can you just quantify the tailwind that you caught in the quarter from
FX on the price-cost piece?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Joe. Thanks for that question. For the quarter, on the top line, we really saw no
impact from FX. Everything netted out to nothing. What we're seeing as a negative impact on our margin this year,
year-on-year, is the fact that we had significant hedging gains a year ago as part of our strategy, and the lack of those
gains is causing that margin year-on-year erosion, margin erosion. Really has nothing to do with 2014. It has to do with
the gain we took last year on our hedging.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay -
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Hey, Joe, is part of your question how much price we may have gotten due to currency?
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Yeah. That's right, Matt.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Yeah -
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah. As we've said last quarter, about half of our price we really see as currency
related, and we think that will be running its course soon. We instituted a lot of price increases related to currency in
the middle of last year, and so that's the primary driver why we're saying we expect that price growth to moderate in the
last half of 2014.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. That's helpful, Nick. And one follow-up maybe for Inge. Inge, you mentioned that
you brought down your growth expectations for Lat Am. It looked like you had negative volume growth in the quarter.
And so maybe if you could just provide some positives and maybe areas of weaknesses that you're seeing in the region
today.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, Latin America, first of all, we have probably the best portfolio mix in that part of the
world. So we feel very good relative to our overall platform as we move ahead. And, as you know, we have been doing
business in Latin America since – I think 1946 was when we started in Brazil.
When you look upon it now, there was a little bit of temper, specifically in Brazil, I would say. Brazil was flat to down.
Mexico was up 12%. So I would say Brazil had an impact for different reasons. And then for us, at least, what we are
selling, personal safety into the mining, was also in the lower end. So I think that Brazil was for us the downturn this
quarter specifically, and then Canada was flat. So you have: Latin America/Canada together; Canada, flat; Brazil,
down; most other up; and Mexico up 12%.
But, as I said, this is a part of the world that is the most developed of our developing regions, and we know how to do
business there. So, [indiscernible] (63:29) for me, always when I look upon Latin America, over the years, and I follow
that – as you know, I led international for eight years before I came into this job. We have a constant growth over time
in Latin America, but there could be a little bit of [ph] bip (63:47) in the quarter, but that's not a overall concern for us.
We are just, short term, stay the course and capitalize on the future.

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Hello, Stephen.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Just on the price-cost thing on the deflation, I guess, on your raw materials. How much of that –
I guess you said 100 to 150 basis points for the first half – how much was it precisely in the second quarter? And then
how much of that do you think is blocking and tackling and kind of structural, like every year you can kind of bang out
a certain amount of that? It's just seemed to be kind of a nice tailwind for a while now.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: I appreciate that question, because it gives me a chance to make it clear here that the
benefits we see on raw materials are not just a passive benefit that 3M gets by being in the market. There are some
benefits we get thanks to the market, but a lot of this, Steve, is driven by what our sourcing team is doing in 3M to
bring about those benefits. So, of that total 1.2%, 1.3% benefit that we're seeing in the second quarter, there's a portion
of that that's raw materials, probably a little less than half of that that's raw material driven. And that raw material
portion is made up of several components. One is just outright market conditions where we're enjoying that benefit.
Second is what we're doing from a 3M perspective to drive those benefits and use our power in the market to benefit
there, and then the third is there's a portion of that that involves us substituting one raw material for another to 3M's
advantage. So it's a broad perspective of what's driving that number, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: So I guess out of the 1.2% to 1.3%, how much is just – and maybe just to narrow it down – how
much is just kind of market exposure related? Like 25% of that, or – ?
<A - Matthew Ginter>: I think it's around half, Steve. As we looked at the raw material deflation this quarter -
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yeah.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: You could think of it – and it varies a little bit from period to period. But it's about half market
and half due to the additional value we can add.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: That's very helpful. Then one just quick follow up on Electronics. These cycles have been kind
of notoriously tough to predict, and I'm not sure if there's a good way to forecast this, but how do you feel about the
growth there in the second half? I mean, sequentially, it was definitely stronger than we were expecting it, up high
single digits? Should we think about normal seasonality in the back half of the year? And what's your sense of kind of
inventories of customers at this stage of the game?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. You start on the inventory side. We don't see any build-up in the channel. So I think it's
at a normal level, as in the past. So if we start there, based on your last point of your question. Otherwise, I would say it
looks like – you can think about it in normal way of a season, but also for us, we work with all suppliers in that
industry, and it will all be dependent on the end market demand in the end. So, for us, that will be the growth driver, or
less-growth driver, as we move ahead. But I don't think there's any change for us at this point in time relative to the
outlook for the growth of Electronics and Energy in that business.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, guys, one last quick one just on the – you have an easier comp in the third quarter, a
tougher comp in the fourth quarter on growth – or I think they may be the other way around – but anything in the
comps that move around as far as stability of growth rates in the second half?
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Are you talking Electronics or total company?
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: No, just total 3M organic. It looks like the midpoint averages around 4% growth. That may be
conservative or not, but should one quarter be better than the other because of the comparisons?

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: No, I think you can think about it in the following way. If you go back to 2013, first half, we
had 2% organic local currency growth. Second part we have 4%. First part of this year, we are close to 5%, and I think
you should think about as we move ahead of the year that based on the range we're giving, it's 3% to 6%. So I think it
will be very much in that range for the last quarter.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Simple. Thanks, appreciate it.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Thanks, Steve.
