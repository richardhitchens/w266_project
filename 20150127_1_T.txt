And so with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Randall
Stephenson. Randall?
Randall L. Stephenson
Hey, Mike. Thanks, and good afternoon. We're all fighting colds around here. Laurie may end up having to handle this
call for us.
Before John takes you through the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and frame where we are. 2012 to
2014 was really a period of unprecedented investment for AT&T and for the industry for that matter. And during this
period, we built our LTE network to cover more than 300 million people, we expanded our U-verse broadband
footprint of 57 million customer locations, and we deployed fiber to 725,000 business locations. And at the same time
we reengineered our mobile network and we now deliver the strongest LTE signal in the U.S.
Now at the same time, we've been aggressively repositioning our wireless customer base. We're giving our customers
now a choice of moving away from heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly prices. And as a result, our
customer satisfaction continues to climb and defections continue to fall, and you can see that by our record low annual
postpaid churn rate. And we also delivered our best ever full year adjusted EBITDA service margins.
We've also made a significant investment to migrate our wireline customer bases to the new platforms. At the end of
2014, 76% of our broadband customers were on our fastest IP-based platforms. And our strategic IP-based business
services now represent a $10 billion annualized revenue stream, and it's growing 14% when you adjust it for the
Connecticut sale.
And that brings us to 2015, because with these foundational investments largely behind us and several strategic
investments announced to-date, the groundwork's now been laid for 2015 and beyond. And today our customers are
expecting us to deliver video across all of our platforms, whether it's traditional linear video or over-the-top on U-verse
broadband or video to the mobile device. So we've been assembling the pieces that we need to do exactly that.
DIRECTV quickly and significantly shores up the economics of our U-verse video product and it brings us the best
content relationships in the industry. Our fixed broadband footprint will quickly begin expanding to 70 million
customer locations in the U.S. when we complete the DIRECTV transaction. And then the Cricket acquisition, it's
proven to be a cost-effective way to strengthen our Spectrum portfolio, which is a prerequisite for being in the mobile
video delivery business.
We also laid the groundwork for expanding these capabilities outside the U.S. We've always believed the demand for
the mobile Internet and economic benefits experienced in the U.S. would be repeated throughout the world. And so
with that, we've been looking for opportunities to gain a wireless foothold in key markets for the regulatory and the
investment climate is right. And Iusacell and Nextel International's Mexico assets give us this opportunity. The changes
in the Mexican legal and regulatory framework make it attractive for a new entrant to invest, and we closed on Iusacell,
and then once we complete Nextel, we'll have a very deep Spectrum portfolio, and this is the first element needed for a
robust mobile Internet offering.
We will now have the ability to extend our U.S. network directly into Mexico, building one seamless network that's
spanning 400 million people. And whether it's cross-border businesses, Latino customers of either Cricket or AT&T or
Mexican consumers, we will be the only company with mobile Internet capabilities spanning both countries. And don't
forget, DIRECTV brings the premiere video business in Latin America.
So the byproduct of this is represented on slide five. And you go 12 months from now, AT&T's revenue mix is going to
look very different. It will be much more diversified. The way we integrate our products and services will be different.
And when we end 2015, post-DIRECTV, our revenues will come from four areas. Our largest will be business
solutions. That includes both fixed and wireless services, and it's growing nicely. In fact, in the fourth quarter, that area
has grown nearly 6%.

The next area will be our consumer, TV and broadband business. Then third will be our consumer mobility business.
Then obviously our Latin American businesses, with satellite TV and then the Mexican mobility businesses will be our
fastest growing area. And we like this mix a lot. And by the end of the year, we're going to be uniquely positioned in a
world of high-speed connectivity, dominated by video, and it's going to be a very different business.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to you, John, to go through 2014.
John J. Stephens
Thank you, Randall. Hello, everyone. Let me start with our consolidated financial summary, which is on slide six. We
finished the year strong with solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues grew to more
than $34 billion, up 4.5% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut Properties. This was driven by strong
wireless growth as we continue to reposition our business model and adjusted revenue growth in wireline, thanks to
gains in strategic business services and U-verse.
For the full year, we saw adjusted consolidated revenue grow by more than 3%. This helped drive strong EPS growth.
Reported EPS for the quarter was a loss of $0.77. However, when you exclude the significant items we disclosed in the
last weeks, earnings per share was $0.55. That's up nearly 4% from a year ago.
And if you consider that last year included about $0.02 of equity income from our divested América Móvil interest, that
percentage would have been closer to 8%. Adjusted EPS was up slightly for the year, even after a $0.06 impact from
the sale of our América Móvil investment. These adjustments include $0.94 of non-cash pressure from the year-end
mark-to-market charge for our benefit plans. This was almost the reverse of last year, when we had a strong
mark-to-market gain. The actuarial loss was largely driven by a decrease in the discount rate, but was partially offset by
strong performance of our benefit plan investments. We also had a $0.25 non-cash pressure from the write-off of
certain network assets, which we told you about earlier this month. And we had $0.13 of costs associated with wireless
integration, DIRECTV transaction costs and a loss in the sale of the Connecticut Properties.
Now, let's turn to our operational highlights, starting with wireless on slide seven. Before I get to the quarter, it's
important to take a look back at the full year and see how far we've come with repositioning our wireless business. It's
been almost a year since we first introduced our Mobile Share Value plans and began to accelerate the move of our
smartphone base off the subsidy model to AT&T Next. Since that time, the results have been dramatic.
First, we had nearly 3.3 million postpaid net adds. Thanks to strong growth of phones and tablets. That's our best
full-year gain in five years, and this includes more than 700,000 postpaid phone net adds during the year. These
postpaid gains along with an end of year surge of connected device subscribers, thanks mainly to the connected car,
helped drive 5.6 million total net adds, our strongest growth in three years.
Just as impressive, we added nearly 5 million new smartphone subscribers during the year. These high-value,
high-quality customers have an ARPU of about twice that of non-smartphone subscribers. At the same time, we had our
best ever, full-year postpaid churn. That's a remarkable achievement any time, but even more so when you consider the
intense competitive environment we faced during the year.
We also had our best-ever full-year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We achieved that even with record full-year
smartphone sales. This is the impact of AT&T Next. Already more than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base are
on equipment installment plans, and more than half of our smartphone base has moved off the subsidy model pricing.
These are the long-term results we have talked with you about throughout 2014. Our repositioning of the smartphone
base is working, with nearly 70% of our postpaid base now on Mobile Share plans.
Now, let's look at fourth quarter results starting on slide eight. Let's begin with net adds where we had another strong
quarter. We added nearly 2 million total subscribers led by postpaid and connected devices. We added more than
850,000 postpaid subscribers, thanks to strong growth of tablets. These tablet gains more than offset a slight decline of
feature phone subscribers, but we also grew high-quality postpaid smartphone base by another million in the quarter.
This includes upgrades and migrations which we don't include in our net add number. Connected devices also

continued their strong growth as the Internet of Things begins to evolve. Nearly 1.3 million connected devices were
added in the quarter, including 800,000 connected cars.
Prepaid showed a loss in the fourth quarter; however, the Cricket brand is showing momentum with positive net adds
after losing customers in the pre-acquisition year ago fourth quarter. The Cricket integration is going strong.
Distribution has been expanded. Churn is improving, and now nearly three-quarters of the customer base has
transitioned to the AT&T network.
The fourth quarter is traditionally a strong sales quarter, and you see that in our results. We had record smartphone
postpaid gross adds and upgrades with more than 10 million smartphones sold in the quarter. That includes record total
upgrades, those customers choosing to stay with AT&T and commit to new device plans. Our upgrade rate exceeded
11% in the quarter. Smartphones were 94% of all postpaid phone sales, another record for us in the quarter.
As expected, postpaid churn was up in the quarter. The fourth quarter traditionally sees increased levels of churn for all
carriers. And when you add in the intense competitive activity in the quarter, it's no surprise to see churn at these levels.
But even with all this noise in the market, postpaid churn levels were comparable to two years ago, the last time a
fully-refreshed iPhone hit the market. And this was the first time that all major carriers were able to sell that phone
during the busy fourth quarter.
Now let's look at revenue gains on slide nine. Total wireless revenues grew nearly 8% as the revenue mix shift we have
seen throughout the year continued to play out in the fourth quarter. Equipment revenue growth topped 70% with
strong AT&T Next sales. Service revenues were pressured as customers continued to sign up for Mobile Share Value
plans and move away from the traditional subsidy model. We now have more than 18 million smart Mobile Share
accounts covering nearly 70% of our postpaid subscribers and about 58% of our postpaid smartphone base is on
no-subsidy pricing.
Mobile Share customers continue to buy up to larger buckets of data. Half of our accounts are on the plans of 10
gigabits or larger. That compares to 27% a year ago. And we're seeing a move to even larger data plans. Nearly 20%
are on plans of 15 gigs or more, that's three times more than a year ago. This helped drive an 18% increase in data
billings. The take rate for AT&T Next increased to 58% in the fourth quarter, or about 5.9 million new Next customers.
This impacted cash flows, but we consider this an investment in a great customer base that we are more than willing to
make. We also had about 400,000 customers bring their own devices onto our network.
The Next take rate was a step up from prior quarters. While we continue to see strong customer response in our
company-owned stores and agents with a Next take rate of about 90% of upgrades, the take rate for Next to our other
retailers was much less. The strong holiday sales played a role here. We typically have a higher percentage of our sales
with other retailers in the fourth quarter. These stores are still becoming familiar with Next plans, and our sales show
that. Plus with the rush of the holiday season, sales personnel with these retailers don't always have the time to take the
steps necessary to close the Next transaction. We'll continue to work with these stores and expect the take rate at those
locations to pick up in the future.
As expected, the strong Next take rate helped drive the second consecutive quarter of sequential ARPU growth, when
you factor in Next billings. When you add in Next billings, you get a more accurate idea of what an average customer
pays us every month. The average monthly Next billings were up about $28 per month, even with the introduction of
the Next 24-month line. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. Nearly 27% of our smartphone base is
now on AT&T Next.
Now let's move to our wireline operations on slide 10. The transformation of our wireline networks to IP technology
has helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth. Let me say that again, it's helped drive year-over-year
wireline revenue growth when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut operations. We're really seeing the overall
revenue impact of the strategic business services and U-verse. Total adjusted U-verse revenues increased by more than
20% and are now about two-thirds of consumer revenues. And strategic business service revenues grew by more than
14%, and are now 30% of total wireline business revenues. Growth was even stronger when you adjust out the impacts
of foreign exchange.

Overall, adjusted wireline consumer revenue increased 2.4%. Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 1.8%.
However, if you adjust for the impact of discontinued Global Hubbing businesses and foreign exchange, that decline
would have been just about 0.5%. We're still dealing with the impacts of an uneven economy, but enterprise revenues
were up slightly. However, the lack of new business formations continue to pressure small businesses. Wholesale also
saw pressure in the quarter in part due to our focus on profitable sales. These results help drive a sequential
improvement in wireline margins, which were up 120 basis points over the third quarter of 2014. That's a reversal of
trends in recent years when we had seen sequential declines between the third quarter and fourth quarter.
U-verse subscribers also grew in the quarter. We added more than 400,000 high-speed broadband subscribers, and now
added 2.1 million for the full year. We finished the year with 12.2 million high-speed broadband subscribers or more
than three-quarters of our broadband base. The transformation to IP broadband is a remarkable accomplishment for our
entire wireline team. U-verse TV subscribers net adds came in at 73,000. Net adds were impacted by a strategic move
to improve the profitability of our wireline consumer business. With our high content costs, we targeted profitable
long-term value subscribers with lower churn rates while still taking market share.
Now let's take a look at margins on slide 11. Let's start with our wireless margins. Wireless margins were pressured by
strong smartphone gross adds and upgrades, investment-related expenses and wireless integration costs. We mentioned
earlier that we had our best ever full-year adjusted service margins even with record sales, thanks to AT&T Next. We
also see the impact of Next on our quarterly results. While our wireless EBITDA service margin was down slightly
when compared to a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 saw 2.6 million more smartphone sales than in the previous
year. And if you compare the results to two years ago, when smartphone sales were comparable, service margins
improved over 700 basis points.
Wireline margins improved from a year ago. Wireline margins usually are flat or down between the third and fourth
quarter, but that trend changed last quarter. There was pressure from investment expenses and content costs, but this
was offset by growth in wireline revenues and solid execution on cost initiatives. For the quarter, our adjusted
consolidated margins were 14.2% compared to 15.5% in the year-ago quarter and just under 13% two years ago. Strong
smartphone sales also pressured consolidated margins but our continued efforts for cost efficiency helped offset some
of that pressure.
Now let's move to cash flow, that summary is on slide 12. For 2014, cash from operations totaled $31.3 billion and $5.7
billion for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $21.4 billion and $4.4 billion for the quarter, and free cash flow
before dividends was $9.9 billion and $1.3 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was impacted by the nearly 6 million
AT&T Next sales in the fourth quarter. We pay upfront for those devices while our customers pay us back over time.
The record upgrades and strong iPhone sales with a higher sales price mix made an impact as well. This speaks to our
willingness to invest in our premium smartphone customer base.
We aren't going to turn away good business to manage to a cash flow number. We have the financial strength to finance
devices for our best customers, who have the lowest churn and higher ARPU, and that is our focus. At the same time,
our Next receivables significantly increased while our bad debt ratios stayed at traditionally low levels. These are
high-quality receivables. We did monetize $1.2 billion of the Next receivables in the quarter, as there continues to be
great interest from financial institutions, and we do expect future sales of those receivables.
Also in the fourth quarter, we sold our Connecticut wireline operations to Frontier for $2 billion. Our asset sales
strengthen our balance sheet and cash position. In fact, we had more than $10 billion in cash and short-term
investments on hand at the end of 2014. We had more than $3 billion in combined free cash flow and asset sales during
the fourth quarter with $18 billion for the full year.
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $9.6 billion for the year, and we continue to have one of the strongest yields
around. We also announced a dividend increase last month. This is the 31st consecutive year that we have increased the
dividend. That puts us in a small and select group of companies. That should give you a good idea of how we look at
our dividend. Saying the dividend is important to us is an understatement. We consider it a very important aspect of our
shareholder return and are committed to it.

At the same time, we maintained the best credit ratings in the industry. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was at 1.75
times, and as we told you at the end of last year, the company will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance
sheet, but expect that with pending investments, in the near term, we may go over our 1.8 times net debt-to-EBITDA
target. Also as we've told you earlier, after we close the DIRECTV transaction, our focus with free cash flow after
dividends will be on paying down debt.
That's a look at the fourth quarter and at 2014. I would now like to turn it back to Randall to talk about our 2015
outlook.
Randall L. Stephenson
Okay. Thanks, John. We're going to provide more definitive 2015 guidance after we close the DIRECTV transaction,
and we do expect that to happen in the first half of this year. But let me frame for you what you can expect from us this
year, and I'm going to start by talking about AT&T on a standalone basis, that is before our Mexico and DIRECTV
acquisitions.
What we expect to deliver is continued consolidated revenue growth. Our adjusted EPS growth will be in the low
single-digit range. We will have expanding margins, consolidated wireless and wireline margins. We will also have
improving free cash flow and improving dividend coverage. And then capital expenditures will be in the $18 billion
range, the same as we guided earlier and that's thanks to the completion of a lot of the Project VIP initiatives.
Now if we include Mexico and DIRECTV, the first thing I'd want to note is that we now expect to achieve even higher
multi-year synergies that we had communicated and anticipated when we announced the DIRECTV deal. And so when
you add Mexico and DIRECTV, we anticipate no dilution to our adjusted EPS, meaning our adjusted EPS growth
including Mexico and DIRECTV will be in the low single-digit range.
We will exit 2015 a very different company. We'll be a company with the ability to deliver video to any device. We'll
have a unique capability to integrate solutions across a diversified base of customers, geographies and technology
platforms that are mobile, fast and highly secure, and we will have a path to profitable TV growth. And we'll have a
nice set of growing Latin American businesses positioned well in video and the mobile Internet.
So that's where we're focused for 2015 and beyond. We're very excited about the opportunities that are ahead here for
us. And so with that, Laurie, I think we're ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Hodulik with UBS, please go ahead.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks. A couple of strategic questions for Randall if I could. First,
Randall, you've been able to put together a Mexican strategy at a very reasonable cost. Is that all we should expect in
terms of Mexico, given the expectation that AMX is going to be spinning off a large piece of their business over the
next year or so? And then if we could expand that, you also have a large footprint now in South America, especially
Brazil, what are your thoughts on that market? And then maybe the same for Canada, you talked at least in the release
about a North American calling market. If you could sort of comment on your view on the attractiveness of those
markets, that would be great.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Sure, John. Thanks. I'll start with your question on Mexico. And the América Móvil
asset sale has been one of those things floating out there. Nobody really yet knows what that's going to look like. And
for us, if we wanted to move into Mexico, there were a couple of really unique opportunities in front of us, and to try to
flush out what was going to be required by América Móvil to sell their assets seemed like an uncertain process. So we
pursued Iusacell and then with the Nextel Mexico asset. What we have here is a set of assets, a Spectrum portfolio that

is really a robust Spectrum portfolio, a nice cell site grid that'll be a very nice place to start and a nice customer base.
And so we have the makings for what we need for a very viable and strong Mexico strategy, whether América Móvil
sells assets or not. And so that's what we tried to do is chart a path that would get us into Mexico and get us a platform
that would sustain itself. And we like these assets. We think these assets are more than sufficient to compete in Mexico
and to go in and compete aggressively and take share. So feel good about the assets we've got.
On South America and Brazil, it's too early to say, John. What we have down there is the best pay TV business in Latin
America. And it's a business that continues to grow. It's got a great brand name down there. DIRECTV has done a very
nice job of assembling some nice Spectrum in various Latin American markets, where they're doing a fixed
wireless-type solution for broadband. So there are number of markets where they have line of sight and the ability to
bundle broadband with the TV product. And their brand is strong enough that where they do that, they have really,
really good success. And so we're actually anxious to get the transaction closed and leverage those assets in Latin
America. And it is, it's a really good product, a really good footprint, a really good brand. So we're excited about
getting it.
On Canada, I think right now we have about as much as we as a company can handle. I'm not prepared to start talking
about going north of the border right now. We've got a lot to execute on. The DIRECTV, get the deal approved and
then we've got some serious integration efforts that we need to get busy on and then obviously building out Mexico is
going to be a full-court press for the next couple of years. So we've bitten off more than we can chew right now and
you will see us focus on what we've consummated to date.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Great. Thanks, Randall.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: You bet.
Operator
We go to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Hi, guys. Thanks. Yes, Randall, I guess just following on, you started out the
conversation with the discussion around revenue diversification. What is your thought just as you look at the U.S.
wireless landscape into 2015 with respect to how bad can it get from here with respect to pricing and promotion? From
an AT&T standpoint, is share loss okay, willing to accept [ph] lower end (30:59) share loss?
And then maybe one for John, just thinking about free cash flow into 2015, if we ex out DTV and the acquisitions, just
to be clear, just frame out the moving parts there to give us a little more comfort on dividend payout? And also maybe
just a comment on whether or not you've talked to rating agencies about the appetite for how high leverage can go?
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yes, Mike. In terms of the wireless business, when you look at 2014, there was some
aggressive pricing in the marketplace. But, John, I thought, did a nice job of giving a good basis of compare to 2012.
And so fourth quarter of 2012 there were three competitors with an iPhone in the marketplace. That was the last time
there was a major iPhone launch. And our churn rate this quarter was very comparable to what it was in 2012. And this
quarter everybody in the market had an iPhone. And so the churn rates in the fourth quarter, relative to what we've seen
in the past, were fairly consistent. When you look at the churn rates for the year in light of what I think was a very
robust pricing environment, we had our lowest churn rates ever.
Now as we move forward, what we are really going focused on is the smartphone base. You're going to see us continue
to penetrate our customer base with smartphones. We added a million in the fourth quarter by itself. And you're going
to really see us focus more and more intently on the business side of the equation. And you're seeing how we're laying
out what our business segments will look like as we move into 2015.
And we've had a lot of success really focusing on the business segment with our wireless products and bundling that
with VPN solutions and security solutions. And as I mentioned in the opening, that when you put those two areas
together – or not put the two together, but when you look at our enterprise business segment, both fixed line and

wireless combined, it's growing 5.8% in the fourth quarter. That business segment, that segment of customers, churns
lower than any other segment of the marketplace. It is price competitive, but it's interesting when you bundle it with
VPN and other product sets that you have a very, very nice business that grows very nicely. And as John showed, we're
expanding margins as well.
So we're really focused on a high-end customer base. The area where we're seeing a lot more pressure in the market is
in the feature phones. We churn feature phones much higher than our traditional smartphone base. And so that's what
Cricket serves the purpose to do is to help us address that end of the market with a very robust and aggressive prepaid
product.
And as John pointed out in his comments, Cricket, we're getting through the transition. It is now growing. Our prepaid
base is growing. That customer base is obviously a very nice complement to what we're doing in Mexico. We're
looking forward to taking advantage of the Mexico footprint with Cricket. And as you noticed in the last week, we've
announced that free unlimited calling from the U.S. to Mexico, and you'll see more and more of those offers materialize
going the other way as we build out the Mexican footprint and the Mexican network.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So, Mike, this is John. With regard to free cash flow, let me frame it up this way. As you
know, we've announced we're committed to do about an $18 billion range for CapEx next year. So that's about a $3.5
billion reduction in the CapEx or improvement in free cash flow. That's step one.
Step two is with all our CapEx spending and investment, there comes some trailing expense. With a reduction in our
CapEx we'll see a reduction in that trailing expense. That will not only help us with margins but it will also help us with
free cash flow. So those are two major steps.
The third one is we have invested significantly in our customer base with regard to Next. High-quality receivables, the
banks continue to be interested in them, but we have a portfolio of those that we'll be able to securitize this year, and
we'll see some turnaround in payback of cash for those that we haven't securitized.
So we're optimistic about that. That will be pressured. Those things will be pressured by the continued success of Next.
So we may reinvest some of those Next dollars that we [ph] grow (35:39) this year, we may reinvest in our customer
base. We'll make those judgments as we go. And then we'll see some increase in taxes but not significant. But we will
likely see some increases in taxes. With all of that being said, feel very comfortable about the increasing free cash flow
and improving dividend coverage guidance that Randall mentioned.
We constantly talk to the credit rating agencies, work with them on our plans and try to be transparent with what we
have going on. I would expect we'll see some – they've made some announcements on their own and I'm sure they will
make their decisions as we kind of go through the rest of this year. And the final DTV integration plans that we have,
they will come out and make their viewpoints known. But I would tell you that those conversations have been
productive and constructive, but they're well understanding our strategies and our approach.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Yes, John, I guess without a crystal ball, but thinking about the phone-only ARPU level,
is there a level of penetration of the value plans inside your base where we should start to see that more stable? I know
in the past you've talked about maybe stability as we get into 2015 on various moving parts, but I guess just isolating
phone-only ARPU, getting a sense for when that might be more stable.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yes so, Mike, as you know, on the phone-only ARPU, when I think about that, I think of
phone-only ARPU plus our Next billings. And if you look at that, sequentially they grew. And the difference between
the historical service ARPUs and the service ARPUs plus Next billings, that gap has been closing. You guys can figure
out the math, but quite frankly, when you sell almost 6 million phones in the fourth quarter on Next and you start
billing those for the entire first quarter and throughout next year on a $20 or $30 a month basis, you can understand our
optimism about improving ARPUs as we define those.
And remember, we define them that way because that's what the customer is paying us in cash every month. So we feel
real good about where we're going and where the process is. We're not predicting or giving a guidance with regard to
when ARPU plus Next billings will be greater than they were in the prior-year quarter. But we look forward to getting

through this year and continuing the progress, especially after having a fourth quarter where the sales team just did an
outstanding job of adding almost 6 million customers to the Next program.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thanks. And we'll go to Phil Cusick, J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess the – a couple of things I want to hit. One, if you could just clarify
guidance. Is guidance to revenue and EPS growth really just if we pull Connecticut out of 2014? And if so, what are the
base revenue and EPS numbers?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yes, it is pulling out – we pull out Connecticut, as you say. We're not giving detailed analysis
of the product line or sub-products, but your assumption, Phil, that it is without Connecticut is correct. That is the
baseline.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Okay. Thanks, John. And then second, if you could talk about Next, 58% in the fourth quarter,
what's going on in distribution? Are you going to expand that further? And do you expect the working capital drag in
2015 to be larger or smaller than 2014?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yes, so the Next sales go like this. In our company-owned stores and our authorized agents,
great performance, more than 80%, nearly 90% as we mentioned. Great take rates in a busy fourth quarter. Quite
frankly, on the large national retailers and the manufacturer-owned retail stores, the take rates were smaller. But in the
fourth quarter, they had a lot of activity for us. They sell a lot of our phones, a higher proportion in the fourth quarter
because of the holiday season, than any other quarter. So we are optimistic about Next take rates increasing overall
through the year, and we're also optimistic about working with the national retailers and the other retailers to provide
them additional support on how to sell Next and how it works. So we're still real positive about Next and believe that
we'll get the number of customers on the non-subsidy plans in line with the number of customers on Next plus bring
your own device. So we're really moving dramatically out of the subsidy business. That's a good thing long term and
short term.
With regard to the free cash flow impacts, we'll have the flexibility to monetize. We expect to have the flexibility to
continue to monetize large blocks of these securitizations. It's worked very well. The banks continue to have very much
interest. And as we've stated before, we want to continue a regular pattern of doing this so that we build a history for
this entity to keep us with flexibility in financing going forward.
I would suggest to you that the activities we have going on now are not intended to be looked at to generate cash flow
in and of themselves to pump up cash flow in any way, shape or form. It's really more of just a prudent management
process throughout the year. We'll have flexibility to push forward or pull back depending upon continued interest
rates, continued attractiveness from the banks and so forth. But so far, the process has gone extremely well. We've been
very pleased with not only the demand but also the financial terms.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Phil, we continue to be confident this Next take rate is going to move up. As John said,
in our retail channel, we're now hitting 90%. It's a learning curve. People learning how to sell this and the mechanics
and the process for doing a handset financing program. We then moved it into our agent channel, which is a very
extensive agent channel. And in the beginning, it was not very impressive. And the agent channel is now beginning to
perform at levels that look like our retail channel.
So then you move into the Big Box retailers. It will follow a similar curve, and we've come through the holiday season.
And John mentioned it and they're pushing volumes. And this takes a little bit more time to sell a handset that's
financed rather than just one in a box. And so it's just going to be a learning curve and we're going to stay patient, but
we actually feel very good that the numbers continue to move in the positive direction.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Okay. Thanks, Randall.

Thanks. We go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Hi. Good evening. Randall, you talked a little bit about DIRECTV. Could you just give us a
little bit more insight into your process? The 180-day clock expires in March? I think you referred to a first-half close.
So how that's going? And any updates on the synergies? I think you talked about higher numbers. Is that content
synergies? Is that more bundling synergies? Is that something that's going to come in early on versus later?
And I think you also talked about video to any device. I know Verizon has talked about an over-the-top rollout in
midyear. So is this something that you're going to have a similar type offering this year? And is that contingent on the
DIRECTV close? Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Okay. Yes, Simon, hi. First of all, deal process, you nailed when – the 180-day clock is
running again, but obviously there is a legal challenge going on between the content providers and the FCC, and that's
kind of the big unknown in our process right now. You know we're hopeful that the two parties, the FCC and the
content folks, can get that deal settled in short order. I believe there is a court proceeding that's due here soon that will
help determine the pace at which that progresses. But even with that, Simon, we're still fairly confident that this thing
gets done first half of the year. And so I can't get any more refined than that because of this issue. So this issue would
be the only issue that would cause a delay in the 180-day clock to our knowledge right now.
As it relates to the synergies, there's a fairly predictable formula with us when we do these large-scale deals. And when
we're doing the deals, we tend to be fairly conservative and we obviously have begun with the DIRECTV management
team some power discussions and getting to a level of detail that's appropriate within the confines of a DOJ review and
so forth. And so we're starting to see details on channels and channel costs and so forth. And as a result, as you start
drilling down through it, it's fairly much across the board. We're seeing better opportunities than what we baked into
the original deal economics. And so that's why we're feeling pretty confident that we will exceed the merger synergies
that we announced at the time that we did the deal. And across the board they are looking good.
There are even revenue synergies. When you have 20 million DIRECTV customers that are very, very high-end
customers, and seeing what the wireless penetration rate that we have in that customer base, it looks really good the
opportunity to be able to sell mobility into those channels and so forth. So across the board, cost synergies, a few
revenue synergies, it's all looking better to what we had anticipated when we announced the deal.
And then in terms of video to any device, this is one of the key opportunities that we were pursuing when we did this
deal. Our customers are demanding video to be delivered across any device. And so one of the primary objectives we
will have coming out of the close of the deal is taking advantage of the content relationships that DIRECTV has and
our wireless customer base. We envision customers being able to walk out of our stores with content available to them
on devices that they have purchased in our stores. You are familiar with the Otter deal that we have done with The
Chernin Group where we are developing over-the-top content with them and taking advantage of ways of delivering
that to our customers as well.
So it's going to be a multi-faceted approach in terms of how we bring video to our customers. But we're looking at
multiple channels and channel lineups that we would be able to accommodate into our wireless customers both tablet as
well as handsets as well as our broadband customer base, 60 million broadband customers. And so stay tuned. There
will be more to come. But this is a high priority for us is getting the content delivered to the mobile handsets and
tablets.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thanks for the color.

We go to Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Thanks. A couple follow-on questions if I could. John, if there was an attractive
opportunity in Latin America, maybe something sizeable like América Móvil is expected to be, given your funding
requirements over the next few years, do you think you could do a transaction like that and stay within a comfortable
leverage range? Or should we expect some equity component for a sizeable transaction?
And then, Randall, part of the strategy of allowing the base to move to new pricing with the help on the churn side, and
while we saw the benefits of that, over the prior two quarters we did see churn return to levels similar to two years ago,
as you pointed out. Are you comfortable with the current pricing strategy in place right now? And do you think this
fourth quarter was more of a one-time-ish in nature, or should we expect churn to remain at elevated levels as we move
throughout 2015? Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yes, hi, Joe. I'll answer John's question on Latin America. Look, the América Móvil
thing is just too uncertain to even answer a question on. And I will say it again, we've got all we can handle right now
in Mexico and we are going to be focused on getting Nextel International closed, integrating that network, integrating
those customer channels, integrating the distribution channels and getting ourselves scaled in Mexico. So anything else
is just kind of speculation and probably isn't worth conversation at this point.
In terms of churn, I would tell you, I'm comfortable with the performance we had in the fourth quarter as it relates to
churn. And I'll say it again, when you compare it to two years ago, which was the last major iPhone launch and only
three national carriers carrying the iPhone, to have a comparable level of churn with the kind of pricing moves we're
seeing in the marketplace versus two years ago, I think that's pretty good performance. And it is performance that for
the quarter we're comfortable with.
We are, as I mentioned before, really focused on that area of our customer base that tends to have lower churn. And
that is our business customer base and high-end consumer customer base. Where we are experiencing the churn is, as
John said, in the feature phone side of the house and we will address that with our Cricket platform. And so right now
who can call where pricing goes in this industry. I haven't the slightest idea. It moves. It's very volatile. But right now,
we like the value equation we have in the marketplace. We have a customer base that demands reliability, that demands
speed and that demands quality. They demand a very sophisticated consumer channel and business channel. We have
probably the most sophisticated business channel in the industry for B2B, and we think it's very important. And we
think also that that B2B customer segment is more and more demanding security solutions integrated all the way to the
cloud with our NetBond strategy. And that's proving to be a very powerful combination in the marketplace. So that's
where you'll see us focus. And like I said, I can't predict where pricing will go.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: That's it. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll go to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first one just, Randall, obviously your
kind of views have been expressed on this Title II as a way to get to the net neutrality issue. But I guess from the
investment community standpoint, are you of the view that there's going to be really anything different about the
business in terms of the business you do or how you do it or the investments you're making kind of on a middle to
long-term basis? If you could kind of talk us through the investment side of that equation. And then, John, just a
question on the write-down of the copper plant, could you talk a little bit about what that was, where it was and kind of
what kind of expectations we have for that going forward? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure, Dave. Let me give Randall a break, and I'll take the copper question first. We went
through a study. And in our business there's active pairs that are copper pairs that are connected to customers and

serving customers. There's spare pairs in our network that are available that are in great working condition and
available to be used if needed. And then there are what we would consider dead pairs or pairs that need significant
repair work that are not connected to any customers and need significant repair work and investment to make
functional. We did a detailed study across our network by our network engineers, in conjunction with them, identified,
marked and made the decision to abandon those ineffective pairs, or what the engineers would call dead pairs. We have
plenty of capacity to serve our customers with our active pairs and spare pairs, so we don't expect any limitations on
that. That's how we went through the process. It was a very extensive process. It was a very unusual process to go
through.
We don't expect any further write-offs like this. We're not aware of any. We just felt it was appropriate to recognize this
fact, and anybody who's followed our business and seen the change in our access line customer base over the last five
years or six years can understand that we would have pairs that would be inactive, and in this case, ones that were not
economical to activate, not to mention the fact there's not demand for us to make that investment. So that's the
background on it, it's across our traditional wireline footprint.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: My favorite topic, Title II.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sorry, Randall.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Look, I'll address it from a couple of perspectives. First, net neutrality, I mean, what
this debate started out to be pursuing was, how do we protect net neutrality, a neutral Internet? And I would tell you, I
don't know of anybody in the industry who really argues that we shouldn't have net neutrality. And indeed, the
President laid out four principles for what that meant. And we look at those four principles and said, you know, we're
okay with those. Those four principles, if what resulted from all of this was the FCC were given authority to enforce
those four principles. It has no bearing or impact on our investment decisions. None whatsoever.
What causes us pause is if the way you affect those four principles is by categorizing the Internet and wireless services
as Title II communication services, that's a different deal, all right? And that's something we have to say, what does that
mean? And what are the implications of categorizing these services as Title II services to our industry? The example I
give is we are right now trying to obsolete our old legacy telephone services, moving to IP or to all wireless. And there
is a very specific process one has to go through to obsolete those services and replace them with the new advanced
services. And we're working through that with the FCC. It's a very collaborative process. It works, but it takes a lot of
time to make that happen. And we think that we might be able to get to a point where we can obsolete these services
and begin replacing them with the new services by 2020. That's an aggressive timeline.
The idea of beginning to put our wireless services and our broadband products under those categories and subjecting
ourselves to that kind of regulatory oversight is what causes us pause. And when we say we are pausing investment
until we understand where this is going, that's what we're referring to. Now if Chairman Wheeler can find some
creative solution of categorizing these as Title II, but doesn't cause the industry to slow down, doesn't cause investment
cycles to slow down, does not cause innovation cycles to slow down, then it will give us some confidence and relief to
continue investing at the same pace we have.
But until we kind of have clarity, and we're saying we're just on any new investments, we're in a bit of a pause mode,
but it's really up in the air right now. There are a lot of ways of getting at what the President has articulated he wanted
to accomplish. One of them is Congress is working on it, and that is that Congress would pass legislation that would
give the FCC the authority to enforce the four principles that the President articulated were important. That works to us.
That puts us very similar to where we are today and probably doesn't change our investment thesis for anything we're
trying to do.
But these really strident, heavy-handed regulations on wireless and broadband, if we go down that path, that's what
causes everybody some apprehension and uncertainty and begins to change investment theses and so forth. So it's up in
the air. Right now, we're just anxious to see where the FCC comes out, so we can all begin to formulate our plans.

And we'll go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much, and good afternoon, folks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Hi, Amir.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: I was wondering if we could chat briefly about your commentary that post the completion
of some of your pending acquisitions and some other initiatives that seem to be on the table, your debt-coverage ratio
may go over that sort of 1.8 times level. Could you perhaps give us a sense on where that could go? And perhaps what
is your priority maintaining your near-term credit rating? It sounds like discussions with credit rating agencies have
been constructive, but I was hoping to get some clarification if possible?
<A - John J. Stephens>: I'll take that. If you look at the DIRECTV transaction, based on some of their most recent
published financials, you'll know that there's a cash piece to the transaction that would approximate about $15 billion.
And I think if you go back to their last published financial statement, their gross debt level could be in that $18 billion
to $20 billion level. That would be the debt we'd be adding on as well as any impacts from closing Nextel and Iusacell,
as compared to our first quarter. And then we've got some other – as we mentioned, we can't talk about the spectrum
auctions, and so we won't do that, but we'll have other impacts from matters ongoing that will impact our debt ratings.
With regard to that, it is very conceivable that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would go above 2. I think that is assumed,
and possibly somewhere in between the 2 to 2.5 range. I know that's a wide range, but that's where we feel comfortable
right now, stating it. Those are the kinds of levels of debt that we would expect that could occur once we close all the
transactions.
What we would then focus on doing is because we would have accretive free cash flow after the DTV transaction, as
we said before, we would take the excess cash flows after dividends and use that, commit that to paying down debt as
quickly as possible. We've suggested that over the kind of a course of a three-year cycle that ought to get us back to
what is more traditional levels. For us that's the 1.8 times net debt-to-EBITDA.
And if you look at our current cost of borrowing, some of our recent transactions, but quite frankly our entire portfolio
today, we have after-tax cost of debt well below 3%. So, it's producing interest expense at a very acceptable level at
1.8, where just a few years ago interest expense rates were higher. You might have gotten a comparable answer with a
1.5 or a 1.6 net debt-to-EBITDA. So, that's where we're at. We'll let the debt-rating agencies deal with it as they see fit.
But we're comfortable with where we're going, and we understand the implications.
The last thing I would say, Amir, is as we announced last week, we've set up a facility with a collection of banks, an
18-month, three-year, five-year terms for over $11 billion. The net after-tax cost of that debt averages less than 1%.
And we have been very transparent with our plans and activities such that reasonable people of the banks are in this
process are still very interested in providing us significant funding at very attractive rates with an ability for us to
pre-pay it without penalty, and ability just to leave the, if you will, facility open until such time as we need it. So we
feel real good about where we stand in the credit markets. We'll continue to work on it, but we continue to feel good
about where we're at.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much, John. And then just one additional follow-up if I may. In addition
to your significant acquisition activity, you folks have also been successful in monetizing some non-core assets over the
last 12 months to 24 months. I was wondering if we should consider this element of your strategy? And how it may fit
into your priorities for 2015?

<A - John J. Stephens>: Yes, Amir, that's a great question. I'm not going to comment on the specific items. I think we
started talking about monetization of assets back three years ago. I think the first major transaction we did there with
Yellow Pages transaction. So if you think back from that timeframe to today, you understand that – you clearly
understand the multibillions, tens of billions of dollars we generated.
I'll say this, we have a $300 billion of assets on our balance sheet. We have a history of being 10 – you know, Fortune
100 type publicly traded companies. We're not done yet. We have an opportunity to do more. We will continue to
evaluate. And as management we have an obligation to maximize returns on our assets. So getting the high utilization
and high results, that's part of our responsibility. We'll continue to focus on it. But with a balance sheet as large as ours,
it would be inappropriate to claim that things are complete. There's always opportunities.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much [ph] for your direct (1:01:55) color.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Laurie, we'll take one more question.
Operator
And that is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. So, earlier Randall was talking about lessons learned as
you move up the curve with Next. One of your competitors, T-Mobile, has learned that they can change the way they
provide credit to their customers and are placing a higher priority now on payment history than some of the traditional
credit metrics. Have you learned the same thing? And is there any change in the way you're extending credit to your
customers as they adopt Next? Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yeah, I don't think there are lessons learned. I think all of us over the years in this
industry know that you know your customers better than anybody else does. And customers that have been with you for
a period of time, regardless of what their credit scores are, you tend to treat differently. And we have for many years
done that, whether it be on the fixed-line side for broadband, U-Verse, customers who pay us well and may have lower
credit scores, we have actually gone ahead and extended them services like U-Verse which require significant upfront
investments and so forth. You do it on the business side of the house too. You know your customers well, and so you're
willing to invest in your customers that you know who may have credit scores that are weaker than what a new
customer, you would be willing to do with a new customer coming in with a low credit score.
So, there are not any new games in this business. We've all been playing this credit-scoring game for a long time. It's a
fairly predictable process. We know our customers well. We know when we tweak credit policy what to expect and
within what timeframe to expect bad-debt reactions. And it's actually gotten fairly mechanical and arithmetic to be
quite honest with you. So, I don't think there's any new science out here on this.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Are you finding that the things that you're working with are recognizing those lessons
that you've learned in the way they finance your receivables?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Absolutely. We've gotten very high. It's one of the reasons why we have high demand in the
securitization process, and we are able to get the pricing levels that we are able to get. So we absolutely recognize that.
And quite frankly, all of you know all you have to do is go to our financial statements and look at our provision for bad
debts and understand with a company that has over $130 billion worth of revenues, you can clearly see just how
effective we are at managing, particularly in a difficult economy, how effective we are at managing our receivables.
The team has done a very good job across the board. Business consumer through process is just like Randall described.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: You bet.

Thank you, Brett. And thank you, everybody, for joining us and taking the time to listen in on the call. As we
articulated at the beginning, we feel very good about where we're going in 2015. As we get to the end of 2015, we're
going to be talking about a very different business and a very different company and we're excited about it, and look
forward to working with you over the course of this year. So thanks again for joining us.
John J. Stephens
Thank you all very much. Take care.
