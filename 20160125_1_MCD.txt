Stephen J. Easterbrook
Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We begin 2016 in a much better place than we were 12 months ago.
Today, we're more aligned as a system, franchisee cash flows in our major markets are improving, and we have a
strong commitment to executing our turnaround plan.
Our near-term priorities are clear. Our turnaround plan is the first step to fortifying the fundamentals of our business
and re-starting growth. It's grounded in running great restaurants, driving operating growth, creating brand excitement
and enhancing financial value. These actions ultimately position us to strengthen and grow as a more competitive and
more modern business. We'll build on this foundation as we position McDonald's for long-term growth that will drive
shareholder value in 2016 and beyond.
Different markets are in different stages of turnaround. The U.S., our largest market, is currently in a trajectory-change
phase. While we are pleased with the recent positive momentum in the U.S., it will take at least six more months of
positive comparable sales and guest count growth to progress through the sustained and prolonged growth phases of
our turnaround. I'm confident in the actions we're taking, and the traction is beginning to take hold.
Most importantly, customers are noticing a difference. Our customer feedback systems are showing improvements in
many important aspects of the customer visit, including food quality, order accuracy, speed and friendliness.
In many ways, 2015 was a year of two halves. The first half of the year, our performance fell short of expectations. As I
stepped into my role, my priority was to objectively assess our business, diagnose our opportunities and develop a
leaner organizational structure.
The second half of the year was about execution. The new operating structure that went into effect on July 1 sharpened
our focus through a greater accountability and removed distractions and bureaucracy to speed up decisions and increase
our ability to move winning tactics quickly across markets. As markets adjusted to how they think and operate, we
began to get traction, ending the year on an upwards trajectory.
Comparable sales were up 5% for the fourth quarter and 1.5% for the full year. Operating income was up 16% for the
quarter and earnings per share increased 26%, both in constant currencies. Various current and prior-year items outside
our normal operations impacted earnings comparisons. Kevin will share more details. Excluding these items, earnings
per share would have been up 10% for the quarter in constant currencies.
Now, let's turn to segment performance. The U.S. remains fundamental to our turnaround given its significant
contribution to consolidated results. U.S. comparable sales increased 5.7% for the fourth quarter, marking the best
quarter in nearly four years. For the full year, comparable sales grew 50 basis points, an encouraging change in trends
after two years of declines. While we've seen recent improvements in comparable guest counts, they remained negative
for the full year. We need to do even more to increase the frequency of visits from our loyal customers and win back
customers we've lost.
Strong partnership with franchisees as we execute our business-building initiatives has resulted in growth in
restaurant-level cash flows for both the quarter and the year. This is just one more indication of the progress we are
making. Our formula for success in the U.S. is consistent with many other markets; a focus on operational excellence
coupled with relevant menu news, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees.
The foundational steps we took to enhance menu quality, simplify restaurant operations and offer even more
convenience to customers led to a palpable shift in momentum in the third quarter. All Day Breakfast builds on this
momentum in the fourth quarter, exceeding internal expectations during the launch phase.
It's driving incremental business. Many customers who otherwise would have gone elsewhere are coming to
McDonald's to enjoy some of their favorite breakfast items like our Egg McMuffin and Hash Browns at lunch and
throughout the rest of the day. At the same time, existing customers are adding breakfast entrées to their regular orders,
boosting sales and average check.

In addition to benefiting top and bottom line growth, All Day Breakfast positions us to regain market share we've given
up in recent years. In fact, since the launch of All Day Breakfast, we've experienced positive weekly comparable sales
gaps relative to our QSR sandwich competitors and we ended the quarter with a positive gap of 2.9%.
Another priority in the U.S. is the establishment of a consistent national value offering. We began testing McPick 2
earlier this month. This value offer gives customers the flexibility to bundle their choice of two items at a compelling
price point. While still early, the offer appears to be resonating with customers. We'll continue to listen and apply what
we're learning as we work towards a more permanent national platform later this year to complement the ongoing
regional efforts.
I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention that the U.S. and several other large markets also benefited from mild weather in
the quarter.
Let's now turn to the International Lead segment, which continues to operate from a position of strength. Fourth quarter
comparable sales increased 4.2% and comparable sales were up 3.4% for the year. Strong fourth quarter comparable
sales marked the UK's 39th consecutive quarter of growth as the market outperformed both the competition and the
wider retail sector.
Performance was driven by a number of customer-oriented offers. Successful promotions featuring premium products
like the new Big Flavour Wraps and the Chicken Legend drove growth in average check.
A strong focus on our core menu items continued to elevate customer perceptions around quality. And steady progress
towards our Experience of the Future continues. About a quarter of the UK's restaurants have been converted and plans
are in place to do more throughout 2016. These restaurants offer modern in-store service platforms such as self-order
kiosks, digital merchandising and customized order pickup place. We recently tested table service and, based on
customers' favorable reaction, we plan to roll it out across nearly all converted restaurants in 2016.
Australia also delivered a strong quarter of comparable sales despite lapping its best quarter in 2014. The market-wide
deployment of Experience of the Future is driving incremental visits. Customers are enjoying conveniences such as
self-order kiosks and table service and taking advantage of the opportunity to customize their entrées to satisfy
individual tastes.
Australia continues to fuel future growth by capitalizing on wins in other markets. Most recently, it's taken a chapter
out of the U.S. playbook, testing All Day Breakfast in 300 restaurants, it plans to go national later this quarter.
Australia's ability to quickly scale this successful initiative from the U.S. highlights one of the many ways our new
segment operating structure is creating a more nimble McDonald's.
In Canada, balanced growth across all dayparts drove another quarter of strong comparable sales. Engaging marketing
campaign, including Monopoly, festive food events, and a successful free coffee promotion resonated strongly with
customers.
At the same time, the market continues to make progress towards its version of Experience of the Future. More than
175 restaurants have been converted with a significant number of additional conversions planned in 2016.
In Germany and France, fourth quarter comparable sales were relatively flat. Germany's successful Monopoly
promotion featuring premium products along with a focus on add-on items helped drive average check in a highly
competitive environment.
Value remains a critical priority in Germany. In the coming weeks, we'll launch an integrated value strategy across our
menu to strengthen our appeal to value-conscious consumers.
In France, the macro environment remains challenging. The informally eating-out market recorded its fifth consecutive
year of decline. On top of the lagging economy and dampened consumer purchasing power, the November terrorist
attack negatively impacted the entire eating-out industry. We have seen this in Paris and in other cities throughout
Europe.

Despite these headwinds, our brand remains strong in France. Successful Monopoly promotion along with the
introduction of new premium products are increasing average check. At the same time, we're giving customers more
options across lower tiers of our menu with new items added to our P'tit Plaisir line and the extension of McFIRST into
other proteins, including fish.
We are working to become even more accessible to customers as we continue to open new restaurants including five
new airport sites that were part of a deal we recently closed with Aéroports de Paris.
Turning to the High-Growth segment, fourth quarter comparable sales increased 3% and the comparable sales were up
1.8% for the year. China's fourth quarter comparable sales increased 4%. Successful execution of key initiatives around
value, convenience and breakfast are driving market share increases in a flat IEO environment.
Despite recent external challenges, we remain confident in the potential of this important market and in the strategies
we have in place to expand the brand even further. In fact, we plan to open more than 250 restaurants in China in 2016;
the highest of any of our markets.
In Russia, strong comparable sales in the fourth quarter reflected ongoing recovery of brand trust. However, results
may be volatile moving forward given continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and decreased consumer purchasing
power.
One additional market I'd like to highlight is Japan, where comparable sales increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter.
Results were partly driven by comparisons to last year's supplier issue. Even so, this marks Japan's best quarterly
performance in nearly four years. The team is diligently executing its revitalization plan as they work to strengthen the
brand's appeal to customers.
Our consolidated performance reflects the meaningful progress we've made to return critical markets to sustainable
revenue and income growth. Although some of our larger markets face challenging headwinds as we enter 2016, we
expect continued positive top line momentum across all segments.
We're focused on what we can control and committed to elevating every aspect of the customer experience. This is
about running great restaurants and our entire system is rallying around this essential imperative every day.
The steps we've taken have driven notable improvements in many larger markets but there's more work to be done.
2016 will be about continuing to execute our turnaround plans. We'll concentrate on fortifying the fundamentals of our
business as we deliver what people want and expect from McDonald's today while establishing the foundation for
future growth.
Thanks, everyone, and now I'll turn it over to Kevin.
Kevin M. Ozan
Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. As Steve mentioned, the strategic actions we took in 2015 were critical to restoring
momentum in our business in charting our path forward. Fourth quarter played a key role in both areas.
Today, I'd like to discuss the drivers of our fourth quarter results, review our outlook for 2016 and provide an update on
progress we've made on financial decisions announced in November. Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results.
As Steve indicated, we delivered solid comparable sales and operating income growth for the quarter. The increase in
fourth quarter operating income reflects the benefit of positive comparable sales across all segments, a testament to the
early impact of our turnaround efforts.
Fourth quarter results also reflected various current and prior year items outside of our normal operations. Relative to
the prior year, these items included comparison against results, which were negatively impacted by the China supplier
issue and an increase in our tax reserves. In the current year, these items included a gain of $135 million from the sale
of a U.S. restaurant property, and asset impairment charges of about $70 million in conjunction with our global

refranchising efforts. Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, fourth quarter earnings per share
would have increased $0.13 or 10% in constant currencies.
Top line performance continues to have the biggest impact on our margins, and it's one of the best indicators of the
strength of our underlying business. With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of
operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 9% increase in constant
currencies for the quarter. The franchised margin percent increased 50 basis points to 82%, driven primarily by the
solid comparable sales in the U.S. and International Lead Market.
Global company operated margin dollars increased 8% in constant currencies to $612 million for the quarter, while the
company-operated margin percent increased 80 basis points to 15.2%. Comparison against challenging prior year
results in the high growth and foundational segments accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the
quarter. Partly offsetting these margin gains were higher incremental labor costs in the U.S., reflecting the ongoing
impact from our decision earlier in the year to increase crew wages and benefits. These costs, along with minimum
wage increases mandated by several states during the year, negatively impacted fourth quarter U.S. margins by about
350 basis points, consistent with our expectations.
Solid comparable sales growth and favorable commodity costs helped minimize the impact of this labor pressure. For
the quarter, U.S. commodity cost decreased about 1%, primarily due to lower beef costs. Looking ahead, U.S.
company-operated margins for the first half of 2016 will continue to be impacted by labor pressures of a similar
magnitude in both first and second quarters.
To offset some of this inflationary pressure, our U.S. fourth quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2%, placing our
full year pricing below food-away-from-home inflation of around 2.5%. 2016 food-away-from-home inflation is
projected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%.
Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were up about 1% in the quarter. While price increases vary by
market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1% to 3%. Looking ahead to full year 2016, commodity
costs for the International Lead segment are expected to be relatively flat, while U.S. commodities are expected to
decline 1% to 2%.
G&A for the fourth quarter totaled $675 million, up 7% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based
compensation versus the prior year. Excluding incentive-based compensation, G&A for the quarter decreased as
expected. For the full year 2016, G&A is expected to decrease about 1% to 2% in constant currencies. We expect G&A
increases in the second and third quarters due to our worldwide convention in April and the summer Olympics in
August.
Foreign currencies negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by $0.11 and the full year by $0.50. At current exchange
rates, there would be less pressure in 2016 with an expected negative impact on first quarter of $0.04 to $0.06 and full
year of $0.18 to $0.20. As always, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move
throughout the year.
Now I'd like to provide an update on the progress we made in 2015 on our financial decisions announced in November
around G&A, refranchising and our capital structure. Starting with our G&A spend. In November, we disclosed our net
annual G&A savings target of $500 million from our G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. This target
excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. We expect to realize $150 million on savings by the end of 2016 with
about half of these savings already achieved in 2015. We anticipate completing the vast majority of the remaining $350
million in savings by the end of 2017.
Developing our ownership strategy is also a fundamental component of our turnaround efforts and the catalyst for our
decision to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018. While our refranchising target implies
approximately 1,000 restaurants per year, we expect variability around this average within a given year as we work to
balance the necessary time needed to select the best franchisees with our desire to execute our refranchising plans in an
expedient manner.

During 2015, we refranchised about 470 restaurants, and we're currently making progress toward completing the sale of
two international markets to developmental licensees, that will include the refranchising of over 400 restaurants. As
part of our valuation of ownership strategies around the world, we have been reviewing our ownership levels in all
markets.
In conjunction with this effort, we're exploring the sale of a portion of our ownership in McDonald's Japan if we
identify a strategic investor who could help advance Japan's turnaround efforts and unlock our growth potential with a
view of enhancing value for all stakeholders. We're in the early stages of the process and taking a thoughtful approach.
We have an experienced and talented management team and a strong group of franchisees, all of whom are committed
to enhancing our brand and supporting our turnaround in Japan with the Japanese consumer in mind.
Right now, we're focused on exploring the viability of finding the appropriate strategic investor. We are confident that
whatever may transpire with our ownership, McDonald's Corporation and McDonald's Japan will continue to have a
franchisor, franchisee relationship intended to promote McDonald's brand and business in Japan. We remain confident
in the McDonald's Japan business for the long-term and their commitment to revitalizing the brand in Japan. In
connection with executing against our refranchising and G&A targets, during 2016, we may incur incremental strategic
charges associated with asset dispositions and restructuring.
In November, we also committed to optimizing our capital structure. One month later, we added $6 billion of debt to
our balance sheet with an average tenor of over 15 years and an average coupon of 3.8%. We will likely have further
debt additions during 2016, as we expect to return a total of about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period
ending 2016. For the two years ended 2015, we returned $15.8 billion to shareholders, leaving about $14 billion in
combined dividends and share repurchases to be completed in 2016. Collectively, our refranchising efforts, G&A
management and capital structure optimization will contribute to our goal of enhancing long-term financial value for
our system and our shareholders.
In addition to moving forward on these financial decisions, we're maintaining a balanced and measured approach of
investing in our business to drive future growth. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion,
split fairly evenly between opening about 1,000 new restaurants and reinvesting in existing restaurants. The majority of
our new store capital is earmarked for the International Lead and High-Growth Markets, while roughly half of our
reinvestment capital will be devoted to U.S. restaurants.
As we begin the New Year, we're encouraged by our recent results. However, our financial performance in the coming
year is not likely to be linear. As we move through 2016, we expect some variability in our quarterly results due to
uneven prior year comparisons and some headwinds that exist, including macroeconomic issues in some of our
High-Growth Markets and challenging guest counts in the U.S., Germany and France. Generating sustained positive
guest traffic in these markets and around the world remains a top priority for 2016. We also anticipate limited pricing
power in several of our markets, as a relatively benign commodity outlook and low inflation could impact our ability to
increase menu board prices.
In closing, we begin 2016 in a stronger position, positive top and bottom line momentum across all segments and
greater alignment with franchisees around our near-term path forward. We're committed to executing our turnaround
plan, which starts with the diligent execution of operating great restaurants on a daily basis. At the same time, we
remain confident in our ability to execute against our financial decisions and evolve to a leaner, more heavily
franchised business that generates long-term value for our shareholders.
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.

<Q - Andrew Charles>: Great. Thanks. Mike, or if you're on the line with Steve as well, can you talk about the
decision to run the January and February value platform at $2 as it seem most quick-service sandwich operators are
running promos in the $4 to $6 range prior to the introduction, as well as the margin profile of what McPick 2 looks
like as well.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, there's no Mike here at the moment. So it's Steve here. So I'll try and answer
this one for you, Andrew. Yeah, so we launched on the fourth of January. We know that around 25% of our customers
are value conscious, and that value – a number of price points, but certainly at the entry level. And we like the construct
of McPick 2. It's very early days. There's not a great deal of trading information that we can particularly share right
now, but we know that the choice and the flexibility that we offer with two items at that compelling price point is
attractive.
As you say, others have chosen a different price point to go in and bundle more items into it. We think that choosing
two out of the four items we have on that menu gives that right balance between – it's simple. It's easy for the customer.
It gives them the choice and the flexibility. And through the course of a handful of weeks, we'll certainly read the
consumer response to it. We'll analyze the business results for it, and continue to work on developing the right value
platform for us on an ongoing basis.
The lead item on it is the Double Cheeseburger. That's sold well, but also the Mozzarella Sticks are going down really,
really well and it's a great add-on item. So it's an incremental profit driver, if you like, both within the McPick 2 but
also it's an add-on item on its own.
<A - Chris Stent>: The next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Thank you very much. As you think about the outperformance that you saw against the
industry in the fourth quarter of almost 300 basis points, do you see this trend as a pop in the fourth quarter, maybe
driven by the euphoria of All Day Breakfast and maybe expect it to settle in at a more moderate performance trend, or
do you see this as something in collaboration with all your initiatives as something that's somewhat sustainable against
your peers?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Well, certainly the idea of outperforming is something we want to maintain. We ended
the quarter with good momentum in our business. Clearly, that was accelerated through the fourth quarter. And as
we've said, All Day Breakfast was a primary driver of that but not the sole driver.
So, it exceeded our launch expectations. The period of time for which it exceeded our launch expectations was also a
little longer than we had projected, but we do expect it to settle down. And that's why we're working on a number of
other initiatives in the business to follow that up.
So, this is not a – we don't want this to be a single initiative turnaround plan. So the continued investment in food
quality, the development of this value platform, and as we continue to reinvest in the fabric of our restaurants, we're
confident the in-store experience will continue to improve.
The operational improvements we're seeing through the drive-thru around order accuracy in particular, we see is paying
dividends. Early days after launching a number of initiatives around people, we're beginning to see our staff turnover
decrease quite notably as well, which we believe helps us deliver a better days experience.
So, there's a number of dimensions to it. All Day Breakfast is understandably a more of a headline grabber. It will settle
down a little from its launch phase, but we believe that building these other platforms of growth on top of that will keep
us competitive in a marketplace and taking share.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Karen F. Short>: Hi. Just following on that question. I was just curious in terms of the layers of momentum, you
didn't – you haven't really given an update on the app. And then, I'm also wondering if you could give a little update on
the U.S. I guess, Experience of the Future, I think you were at 130 units in November. Thanks.

<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, hi, Karen. So on the app, it's still early days for us, but I mean for us, what we
can offer in the future is exciting. What we're actually delivering now is really just the start.
So, we only really launched the app here in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter last year, but within three months
we've had over seven million downloads, which I think just starts to signal the magnitude that we can build to as we
develop offers and functionality way beyond the basic.
At the moment, it's largely offer-based, and we're seeing those downloads being activated by customers and redeeming
the offers in the restaurants. So, we believe it's driving behavior. We hope to follow consumers' behavior easy because
we can read the kind of the data from it. But certainly, as we build the capability of the app, we think it's going to get
increasingly compelling and be a growth engine.
I would say that for the first time here at McDonald's, we have built in a trading increase, an incremental sales
expectation based on our digital platform. It's a little modest in 2016, but we see it actually contributing to the business
growth and being a platform that's going to deliver for many years to come as we can kind of understand our consumer
behavior and be more rewarding to them.
With regards to the second piece, the Experience of the Future, we have around five markets up and running, as you
say, with about 130 restaurants. We're certainly looking to expand not necessarily those markets but into new markets
at a larger scale. And the U.S. will again pick some lead regions, and this is where the regional strength of the U.S.
really comes to the fore.
We've got 23 regions here in the U.S. We'll be picking two or three of those to really look to accelerate their version
here in the U.S. of the Experience of the Future through 2016 and into 2017, but they'll be adopting a slightly different
approach in those three regions so we can actually learn in the market here what truly resonates with customers, what
the business results are and the future potential.
And also given our new structure now, we're learning so rapidly from the way that the Australians have built their
business, Canada building theirs, the UK, France in particular, theirs, that we are rich in insight which is helping each
other make smarter decisions and shorten the time line. So, we'll certainly share more, but at the moment the majority
of our growth that we're building into the U.S. performance through 2016 is through continuing to deliver against the
basics of our turnaround plan.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good morning. My question is on the U.S. comps momentum you saw in the fourth
quarter, which was very impressive. I was wondering, Steve, if you could help to sort of dissect what some of the
drivers were. In particular, if you could help to quantify what you think the lift from All Day Breakfast might have
been during the quarter and also the weather impact. That's question number one.
And then as a follow-up, perhaps if you could talk about some of the structural improvements you're seeing with the
drive-through simplification, if you're starting to see some progress on speed of service there. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, thanks, David. We don't really give specifics on the respective drivers, but the
piece that I want to make sure we don't lose is that we were building the momentum heading into the quarter and
heading into the launch of All Day Breakfast. And I won't necessarily do a full laundry list of the work the team had
done, but certainly around the fundamentals of delivering a better high-quality food experience day-in, day-out.
And you've heard me talk about the devil's in the detail always around toasting of the buns and searing of the beef. And
when you ally that with investing in the types of quality investments that customers care about, such as whether it was
the antibiotics move we made in the poultry supply chain or the announcement that we are on our journey of going to
cage-free eggs. That just creates a buzz. And when customers know that you care about the same things that they care
about, then they just respond with their business.
All Day Breakfast was clearly the primary driver of the quarter. We knew it would be. We focused the restaurants both
operationally, marketing and merchandising on that. As I say, through the launch phase, yeah, it helped contribute

materially to the quarter. Absolutely, no doubt. We hit peaks. We exceeded the sales contribution that we had
projected. And as I say, it lasted longer through the quarter than a typical launch period does. But inevitably, it'll settle
down as we introduce other initiatives in the restaurants through 2016.
The weather was noticeable but not material. But I just thought it was appropriate and transparent to reference it,
because it did give us a positive contribution, not just in the U.S. but in many of our major markets around the world.
That did provide a helpful tailwind that I thought would be fair to recognize and just acknowledge.
In terms of the drive-through in particular, certainly the streamlined menu boards have made life easier for our
customers and made life easier for our managers and crew in the restaurants. So, that experience has simplified and
helped speed things up.
Alongside, the greatest barrier to the overall service experience in the drive-through we have identified is order
accuracy. So the teams – the operational teams have been working really hard on initiative that – again, I won't get into
detail. We call it Ask, Ask, Tell. It's just the way that we – the ordering experience for the customer, where we can just
confirm twice over that we captured the order right and that we're presenting exactly the right order to the customers
before they drive off. And we're finding that has noticeably improved order accuracy, which in turn improves speed
and clearly customer satisfaction.
So, we've got plenty more to do. We will be working through and continue to challenge the menu and if there's further
simplification areas there. But simplification goes way beyond that. There's things through packaging, through
merchandising, through marketing where we can help the restaurant teams by taking work load off of them, taking
focus on the fundamentals of what they want, which is serving customers.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks. In the last turnaround, the one in early-2000s, clearly there's a focus or a refocus on
service execution. You were just touching on some of that. So if you have numbers on customer satisfaction today or in
future quarters, I think that'll be really helpful for people to get their head around the sustainability of the turn that may
be starting with All Day Breakfast trial and bringing back those lapsed users.
On the premium platform innovation front, do you feel like you're using this window perhaps being created by All Day
Breakfast to give yourself a taste of testing that is greater in such that you're building that pipeline for 2017 and
beyond? And if so, how is that looking and what's giving you confidence there? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, hi, David. So in terms of customer satisfaction, obviously we got a number of
different ways that we can monitor customer satisfaction, and we have one or two different systems around the world.
There's not a consistent measure as we speak. But we've moved and transitioned to a new customer satisfaction
measure here, which we call the DVOICE [McDVOICE], which is actually we're gathering multiple number of
customer feedbacks compared to where we were previously.
So, I'm going to explain that very well. We're gathering a lot more consumer feedback than we ever have done is a
better way of saying it. Certainly, we're seeing overall satisfaction improving both in drive-through and in-store. And
we're certainly seeing order accuracy in the drive-through. We're around – the actual satisfaction on speed is improving.
Our speed times haven't improved as much as satisfaction has done, so we want to work operationally to physically
speed up the service experience, but at the same time customers are reporting a greater satisfaction with the speed,
which is very encouraging. So, it means the overall experience is working for them.
In terms of on the premium side, yeah, absolutely. As you gather momentum and you start to get these growth drivers
that you can layer upon each other, it means that you can raise your head and look a little further out in the way that
you plan and develop the business. So on the premium side – and by the way, each market doesn't have to work in
isolation. So we have a number of initiatives around the world, whether it's Create Your Taste in Australia, a new
premium range of Signature burgers in the UK, a similar version of that within France, for example. And we have these
sophisticated, well-executed roll-outs across those markets, all of which is helping to inform us of where we head with
Experience of the Future.

What we do know is customization is important. We don't know quite how much customization customers truly wish.
They like a little bit of flexibility, but they don't want you to overcomplicate it. So we're working on that, for example.
We're working on the manner in which customers can order those premium burgers, away from the traditional just
through the drive-through or at the front counter, and that's where self-order kiosks and potentially even table service
comes into play. But again, we're getting a really good read on progress in some of our other mature and lead markets,
and that's certainly helping shape and inform the thinking here in the U.S.
So, more to come. Are we using the time to work on developing that platform? Absolutely, yes, we are.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Greg Badishkanian at Citibank.
<Q - Gregory Robert Badishkanian>: Great. Thanks. Just trying to understand where you're getting your new
customers from, which is lifting same-store sales. You had two big introductions, the 2 for $2, the All Day Breakfast.
And do you think you're gaining – are you gaining those from burger operators, overall QSR, the broader restaurant
category? And just define each one so – I think you might be getting different customers for each of those two
programs.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, hi, Greg. I think we've been pretty clear that as we go through the revitalize
stage of this turnaround, the market share that we're looking to recover and grow is in our more immediate competitive
groups, so the kind of QSR segment. Then, as we strengthen and ultimately want to get back the leadership position
that we aspire to, I think that growth will come from broader IEO.
So at the moment, the initial momentum we've seen typically around the world is coming from QSR. Some of that
recovering share we've lost as well. So, that's certainly heartening for us. I would say, potentially, one slight difference
from that is around All Day Breakfast, which where we're capturing customers with really what is a different occasion
now. And that is new to us at McDonald's. I think the customers, where the incremental business and the incremental
visits we're getting are probably from the broader IEO segment. But typically, our focus on this initial stage of the
turnaround is around winning near-in market share and recovering what we've lost and getting into a period of
outperformance.
<A - Chris Stent>: The next question's from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John Glass>: Thanks very much. Just two related, somewhat related – maybe actually unrelated. But one is on
the pricing. You talked about being cautious on pricing overall. However in the U.S., I think you said the
food-away-from-home inflation was going run some 2-plus percent. So, are you saying that you feel good about pricing
in the U.S. given that inflationary level? And it's maybe elsewhere, maybe talk about how you think about U.S. pricing
specifically?
And then just to clarify the SG&A, if you take it down 1% to 2% from 2015 levels it's not going match the $150
million, your savings. It's more like $50 million. Is that because you're not including the Operator Conference and the
Olympics in that calculation? That's sort of a one-off or not factored into $500 million? Or how do we think about that?
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Thanks, John. Let me start with the pricing, because we think about pricing relatively similarly
around the world, and that is we look at a whole bunch of factors to influence our pricing. That includes food inflation,
GDP growth, our internal cost inflation, et cetera, similar to how the U.S. would do it.
So for 2015, we said that the U.S. increased their prices a little over 2% compared to food-away-from-home inflation of
around 2.5% and that for 2016 food-away-from-home inflation is expected to be 2.5% to 3.5%. So, we would continue
to think about pricing in a similar way as we've been and keep an eye on that food-away-from-home inflation, as well
as food-at-home inflation just to make sure that we're not getting out of whack with that.
Related to the G&A, the way we look at it is we saved, I'd say, a little more than half of that $150 million in 2015,
which means that we go into 2016 with our base or run rate of those savings built in. We'll look at 2016 similarly. So,
while we may not get all of those actual savings realized in 2016, we'll have it out of our base by the end of 2016 so
that as we go into 2017, we're going in with a base that's $150 million less than where we started the $2.6 billion. And

that's a net number, so that includes the Olympics convention, all the additional costs in there also.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan, Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Nicole M. Miller Regan>: Thanks. Good morning. Going back to mobile, you said 7 million downloads, I
believe. Is that since you launched? And how many have redeemed offers? And what can you tell us about the profile?
And then just a final thought on mobile, I believe if I understood correctly, you earlier said, it's modestly in the
guidance, and what is giving you that conviction to make that comment? Is this a new customer? Is it a loyal customer
that's spending more? Just what are they doing? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Can you repeat that second part of the question, Nicole? Sorry, about something in the
balance?
<A - Chris Stent>: Why convictions were including...
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Okay, okay. Someone's explained it here, right, so two parts to that question. So there
are a number of metrics that we will follow through and we follow closely on a weekly basis, daily and weekly basis on
the app. One is clearly the downloads. Then you want the registration numbers, and then you want to see the activity.
So we have 7 million downloads, which gives people access to things like restaurant locator, nutritional information
and the rest. As they start to share their information and get confident with us, clearly, then they will start to register
and we can then communicate. If they notify us of their local restaurant or their preferred restaurant, then we can start
to localize the offers to them, and then we start to see the behavior.
We're seeing higher registration rates than industry norm from those downloads, and we're also then tracking
effectively frequency of usage. And we're trying to encourage that with things like loyalty play, such as buy any five
McCafes of any size and you get one free. So it's a fairly basic loyalty play just to get people familiar with using it and
actively using it and keeping it on their phones basically.
The reason we have built a sales build into 2016 is because we have seen the incremental business, we've seen the
incremental average check of redemptions. So, when people redeem an offer, we're actually seeing higher average
check than we had expected to see. So we can see there's an incremental business driver. Plus we've got other initiatives
that will both scale the number of customers and usage but also enhance the overall experience as well, which will
encourage people to return to the app more often, and clearly hopefully, return to McDonald's more often.
So we have it really – we have it week by week and month by month as a build. And we'll be able to clearly update
ourselves on whether we're hitting those projections. But it's a – it will be a helpful contributor to sales in 2016 and will
help guide us around the world beyond that to actually derive that return on the investment we're making in this digital
strategy as a whole.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question's from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Joseph Terrence Buckley>: Thank you. If I could ask two related questions on plans. First, with respect to the
U.S. turnaround and the sustainability of the U.S. turnaround, can you talk about some of the pipeline of ideas? You've
mentioned platforms a couple of times, if you could be a little bit more specific about how you're thinking about
product news and innovation to sustain the U.S. comp. And then a little bit longer-term, you've referenced in the past
that you would be sharing a longer-term strategy at the Worldwide Owner/Operator Conference in April and probably
sharing that with the Street sometime thereafter. I guess I was curious if that was still the game plan and if you can put
any outline or any meat around what we might hear.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Okay, Joe, so confidence as we build through 2016 in the U.S., I mean, clearly, we're
planning for growth, and we have a very robust plan that the team has built. So that gives us confidence. We will
continue to work the breakfast platform and beverage platform hard. [ph] Anyways, it's an (49:49) important daypart
for us. And then the All Day Breakfast is a further growth opportunity, which we're going to continue to work hard
through 2016.

Getting the value platform right will be important to us. That's why we're taking a very serious look at it and learning
from it before we then go into a national and permanent launch phase. But we feel good about where we're at the
moment.
You can expect to see us also focus more on our core menu. We're very proud of the menu. And we believe there is –
these are iconic and real popular assets that we believe that we could – we can probably do a better job with it. We can
bring to life, and we'll continue to invest in the ingredients and the food quality and create some fun around that. You
can expect to see that.
To create fun around the brand, you will also expect us to return to one or two of the promotional mechanics we have.
We got opportunities throughout the year to just bring in some variety and some fun around promotional activity,
shorter-term promotional activity, just to help provide that balance across the menu. So I think – and then with a digital
platform layering on top of that, we believe we're building a platform that will continue to grow through 2016 but will
also take us into 2017 and beyond.
As we develop and better articulate here in the U.S. our Experience of the Future, that is something we know the
system's excited about. We know it's creating a lot of energy and momentum elsewhere around the world and getting
that right and the business model right and actually getting the right elements of that for the customer here in the U.S. is
going to be important us to. And we're excited about what we're going to learn in 2016 because we believe that's going
to contribute to 2017 and beyond.
In terms of the long-term strategy, I guess what we would want to see is we've had two quarters of growth in this
turnaround. So we would certainly be looking to see another quarter or two before we ourselves start to move from the
turnaround plan into a longer-term growth plan. What I can tell you is that we have a small and senior team looking at
developing what that growth plan looks like, the elements of it, the brand positioning of it and the vision behind it. But
it's a small team that's working discretely on it. Because at the moment, the entire organization globally is focused on
the turnaround. So whether it's later in the second quarter or sometime into the third quarter, I would say by around the
middle of the year when we get confident that it's the right time to transition from turnaround into growth, we will
share that internally, and soon after, externally.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question's from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Karen Holthouse>: Hi, thank you for taking the question. Looking at the remodel CapEx going into U.S. stores,
can you give us a sense of where the majority of those dollars are going? Is it more going to sort of cleaning up
longer-tailed stores that maybe haven't been reinvested in recently or more specific initiatives around kiosks or digital
menu boards or something like that?
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah, Karen. For 2016, we said that about half of the reinvestment around the world will be
reinvested in the U.S. That consists of several buckets if you will. It's probably 400 reimages to 500 reimages in 2016,
about 90 rebuilds where we kind of tear down the restaurant and put up a new one. It also would include capacity
enhancements, things like putting in side-by-side drive-throughs, as well as our normal maintenance CapEx. It also
would include digital menu boards in substantially all the restaurants in the U.S. So it consists of several of those
components that would kind of comprise the total reinvestment in the U.S.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeff D. Farmer>: Great. Thank you. As the U.S. same-store sales recovery continues to build momentum, how
should we be thinking about the pace of a potential restaurant level margin recovery? Just a little color on that. You
guys have obviously given us some color on not only cost of goods sold for 2016, some of the incremental labor
pressure that you introduced midway through last year, but is there anything preventing you from returning to the high
teens U.S. restaurant level margins over the next couple of years? Again, big caveat, I understand, but assuming you
guys can continue to deliver some top line momentum, can we see these high teens restaurant level margins again in the
U.S.?

<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah, thanks, Jeff. As you know and we talk about pretty often, margins for us are a top line
game. I mentioned that we'll have some pressure first quarter and second quarter in 2016 as we kind of round out the
additional labor costs that we have from the decision we made to increase wages for our restaurant crew. But with
benign commodity costs, relatively reasonable inflation, and hopefully, some pricing capability, it'll come down to
what kind of comps we're able to achieve to determine whether we can grow margins. I think what fourth quarter
should have shown everyone is, even with those labor pressures, when we have good comps, again, depending on
where commodities are, we're able to offset a lot of those pressures. So it really does come down to continuing to grow
comps.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.
<Q - Jeff Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Actually, just a follow-on on that question. I'm just wondering
how you actually think about the interplay of commodity and labor costs, especially as you look at the offerings going
forward? Right now, obviously, it's commodity down, labor up. But I'm just wondering, is pricing easier this way? Or
would you prefer it if it was the reverse?
I think you mentioned, from a food standpoint, right, that food-away-from-home is still 2.5% to 3.5%, and you're going
to be less than that. But food-at-home seems like it's well below that entirely. So I'm just wondering how you think
about those two buckets being that they're similar in size, and the concern you might have on even pricing at that 2%
plus level? Thanks.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah, it's a good point in that I don't want to oversimplify how we look at pricing. We have to
look at, to your point, beyond just food-away-from-home as one piece of information. Food-at-home, exactly as you
mentioned, is clearly below food-away-from-home right now.
And so we look at food inflation in total because we need to make sure that kind of home is the competitor and people
could be leaving us, if you will, to eat more at home. But we have to look at all costs, food and labor to determine
pricing. And it also comes into play of what our competitors are doing, the demographics of where we are. So there's a
lot of things that go into determining pricing. I don't know if I'd pick one or another as far as whether I'd rather have
labor or food be high cost, if you will.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Just one point I would add to that, Jeff, as well is whilst we will clearly build an
assumption into our plans, because that's how we set our plans, we don't make a single pricing decision just once a
year. We make decisions across the year. So we can always gauge the consumer, consumer confidence, where our costs
are going and where the competitive environment is and do our best clearly to make the right decisions. So it's – we
have multiple opportunities across the year to reassess and make sure that we're certainly seizing the opportunity, but
without taking it too far.
<A - Chris Stent>: We have time for one more question. It'll be from Jason West at Credit Suisse.
<Q - Jason West>: Yeah, thanks, guys. Just on the market share number, can you give the two components of that, the
McDonald's number and the equivalent calculation, and then the industry number that you saw to get to the 2.9%. And
then, Steve, just big picture on that sort of same-store sales trajectory, we've been dealing with challenging markets
around the world, it feels like for several years now. And you guys are starting to see momentum despite that, but it
feels like the volatility and the challenges only seem to get worse each year. So how does that affect you guys going
forward? Do you think we're still kind of in the environment we've been in or have things externally maybe gotten a bit
worse? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Okay. In terms of the market share data then, we would take across the, pretty much
the 14-week period that our growth would be at 5.7%, and the QSR sandwich segment ex-McDonald's would be 2.8%,
giving us the differential of 2.9%. So overall growth in the market, we were outperforming that clearly.
In terms of around the world, yeah, I mean, we want to be careful that we don't sound too anxious and create a concern
around headwinds and what-have-you because so much of our ability to grow is in our own hands. And we are really
focusing on what we can control. And we have noticed and we have a history of being successful in many, many

countries around the world through strong economic times as well as challenging economic times as long as we do the
right thing by the customer.
So, overall, we are confident heading into this year. We've been through the plans in detail of our largest nine or 10
markets and are confident they will deliver the growth to a level that we are satisfied and we're challenging ourselves
hard on it. I also want to be pragmatic. In France at the moment, for example, it's tough. IEO has decreased for five
years in a row. So, if you're going to grow the business, you really have to take a significant amount of share in a
declining market for that to translate into top line growth. And to do that, you don't want to throw yourself out of your
longer-term strategy and the brand building they've done. So I think there are some realities that's right for us just to be
a little cautious about, but if I take a look at the collective across the U.S., across the Lead Markets and the
High-Growth Markets, we are building plans and certainly on a consolidated basis with an expectation of growing.
So – but as you all know from the markets even at the start of this year, volatility just creates a scrappier environment
and a little bit of nervousness whether it's across investor community and sometimes in certain markets across
customers. So we need to be mindful and sensitive to that. China's a good example where that kind of volatility in the
marketplace just create a little bit of anxiety. But that's why we want to reinforce our confidence in that market in
growing our core business as well as incremental units and new store growth. So we're mindful, we stay close, but we
remain quietly confident.

Thanks, Chris. And again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. 2015 was a year of change. We're running
McDonald's differently and building on our unique advantages as we strive to become a modern and progressive burger
company. Our fourth quarter results reflect the meaningful progress we've made. And whilst there's more work to be
done, we're on the right path. We're focused on our customers and delivering what matters most to them, hot, fresh
food, fast, friendly service in a contemporary environment, all of the value of McDonald's. I am confident in our ability
to sustain our positive momentum as we continue to execute our turnaround plans into 2016, and I'm excited about our
longer-term opportunities to strengthen our business and reassert McDonald's as the global leader we know we are.
Thanks, and, everyone, have a great day.
