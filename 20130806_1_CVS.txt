Nancy R. Christal
Thank you, [ph] Frank. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here with our President and CEO,
Larry Merlo who will provide an update on the business. After Larry, our Executive Vice President and CFO, Dave
Denton will revile financial results and guidance. Jon Roberts President of PBM and Mark Cosby, President of our
retail business is also with us today and will participate in the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. During the
Q&A please limit yourself to no more than two questions so we can provide more callers with a chance to ask their
questions.
Just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information you will hear today,
as well as key facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. I encourage you to take a look at
that.

Additionally we plan to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q by the close of business today and it will be available
through our website at that time.
During this call, we will use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance,
namely free cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations you can find the definitions of
these non-GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the investor relations portion
of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the
call for one year.
I have one key date to announce this morning. Please note that we will host our Analyst Day on the morning of
Wednesday, December 18th in New York City. At that time, we will provide 2014 guidance, as well as a
comprehensive update on our growth strategy. In addition to Larry and Dave, you will have the opportunity to hear
from additional members of our senior management team. We plan to send invitations with more specific details via
email by next week, but please save the date. Again, that's Wednesday, December 18th. If you don't receive an
invitation and would like to attend, please contact me at your earliest convenience.
Now before we continue, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor Statement. During this presentation we
will make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for
forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend
that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the risk factors section of our
most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and in our upcoming quarterly report on form 10-Q and now I will turn
this over to Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
Thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.
Let me begin by saying we are very pleased with our strong operating results enterprise-wide in the second quarter.
Operating profit increased 15% overall, with the PBM growing about 32% and the retail business growing nearly 9%.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter came in at $0.97, that's at the high end of our
guidance. And we also generated a substantial amount of free cash, totaling $1.7 billion for the first half of 2013 and
we remain committed to our disciplined approach to capital allocation, continuing to focus on returning significant
value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.
Now, considering our strong operating results to date, and all other factors affecting our outlook for the remainder of
the year, we are narrowing our earnings guidance for 2013 to a range of $3.90, to $3.96. And that's from our previous
range of $3.89 to $4.00. And while Dave will provide more details around the drivers of our revised guidance during
his financial review, I do want to mention that a key driver of lowering the high end of our guidance range is a higher
than forecast weighted average share count.
Now, as we announced last week, we have reached an agreement in principle with the SEC to resolve its investigation
of various company matters that occurred back in 2009. During the second quarter, we engaged in extensive settlement
negotiations with the SEC, and as a result, we suspended our share repurchase activity until we had reached the
agreement in principle. Now that it has been reached, we plan to resume our repurchasing efforts this quarter and we
still expect to complete the $4 billion in share repurchases that we had planned for this year.
So if you do the math, with our share repurchases now back half weighted, as opposed to occurring ratably throughout
the year as we had originally anticipated, this timing shift is estimated to dampen the accretive impact of the share
repurchase program for the year by as much as $0.04. Now despite this timing shift in share repurchases, our updated
guidance for 2013 equates to excellent adjusted EPS year-over-year growth in the range of 13.5% to 15.25%. So we are
still anticipating a very successful 2013.

Now, let me provide a brief business update and I will start with the 2014 PBM selling season. Our model continues to
resonate well in the marketplace, and we are very pleased with our results to date. Our gross wins for 2014 are $4.4
billion to date, while net new business stands at $1.7 billion and that's despite lower RFP activity this season. We have
been successful across all segments, and this net new business excludes any impact on our Med D PDP business, which
I will come back to in a minute.
There are still some modest opportunities remaining for 2014. Most of those are on the employer side and work is
already underway for the 2015 selling season. As for renewals, we've completed almost 50% and have a retention rate
of 97%. So overall, again, we are very pleased with our selling season to date and confident that we continue to be well
positioned in the marketplace with our unique products and services.
So I thought I would just spend a minute touching on what clients have been focused on this selling season and one
area of both employer and health plan client concern is managing their specialty spend across the pharmacy and
medical benefits. As a result, we are seeing interest across our entire suite of specialty capabilities, including utilization
management programs, specialty guideline management, formulary strategies, as well as our site of care and medical
claims editing products. And we believe our differentiated approach to specialty is driving lower overall costs, while
improving health and providing value for both payers and patients.
Our specialty revenues grew 19% year-over-year in the second quarter and that was driven by drug price inflation,
utilization, new product launches and new PBM clients. And our continued focus on managing specialty costs for
clients will help us continue to drive our share of specialty going forward.
Now, in addition to managing specialty costs, our clients are also focused on the changes resulting from the Affordable
Care Act and we continue to believe that Medicaid expansion and individual small group coverage in the public
exchanges will be a long-term secular growth trend, resulting in a significant amount of new coverage for people who
had previously been uninsured. Now details around the exchanges including plan participants, plan designs and rates,
they continue to emerge, and we believe we are very well positioned given our retail footprint, along with our existing
relationships with health plans and managed Medicaid plans.
We have had a lot of dialogue with health plans about collaborating with us on innovative programs that support their
overall exchange strategy, and these discussions often encompass how they can partner with us across our retail touch
points while tapping into our direct-to-consumer marketing expertise to attract and retain members.
We also discuss how MinuteClinics can support care management and wellness programs for the newly insured and
how a plan can maximize the benefits from all of the unique clinical and member engagement programs that we can
offer through our CVS pharmacy network, and we believe all of the activity around the exchanges will serve as a
catalyst for broader collaboration opportunities with our health plans.
I do want to touch briefly on the PBM streamlining initiative, which as you are aware, launched in late 2010 and is near
completion. We are on track to achieve the expected annual savings run rate of $225 million to $275 million in 2014.
As for the consolidation of adjudication platforms, we have now completed 11 waves of migration and we continue to
leverage our resource and technology investments to refine our processes and improve efficiencies resulting in moving
more clients and limiting potential disruption in each of those successive waves. 85% of our business is scheduled to be
on the destination platform by year end. So overall, the streamlining initiative has been very successful.
So let me turn to our Medicare Part D business and just as a quick review, we currently serve 6.8 million members in
our Medicare Part D business and we do that through the health plans we serve, as well as our individual SilverScript
PDP, including EGWPs. Our individual PDP currently serves approximately 4.3 million of our 6.8 million members.
Now, last week we received the preliminary benchmarks results from CMS for 2014 and we are pleased with the
outcome. SilverScript was below the benchmark or within the de minimis range in 31 of the 34 regions. We missed the
benchmark only in one small region in which we qualified today, where we have about 2,000 lives that will be subject
to reassignment to another plan. So aside from any normal attrition, these benchmark results should enable us to retain
the vast majority of the auto assigns we currently serve.

Let me update you on where we stand with respect to the sanction imposed by CMS earlier this year. As you know, the
sanction prevents us from marketing our SilverScript PDP or enrolling new members and as we've said, our goal has
been to complete our remediation efforts so that the sanction would be lifted before the annual enrollment for the 2014
plan year. Now given some additional complexity that we uncovered while working to resolve the issue, along with our
strong commitment to ensure that we are ready to operate at best in class levels we have revised our plan and expanded
the timeline for remediation. Based on our latest estimate, we now expect our remediation efforts will be completed
sometime near the end of the year.
Now, once our remediation has been completed, CMS will conduct its review to determine whether the issues have
been fixed, are not likely to recur, and when the sanction will be removed.
So what does all of that mean? Well, given the current timeline, we do not expect that we will be able to participate in
the 2014 annual enrollment period when it begins in October. In addition, until the sanction is lifted, we do not expect
to receive new auto-assigns from CMS for 2014 in the regions where we qualify. The sanction primarily affects our
individual SilverScript PDP, which as I mentioned, has about 3.4 million lives. It does not affect the Medicare Part D
business through the health plans we serve, and as a reminder, our EGWPs are also not affected by the sanction since
we continue to operate under a limited waiver from CMS that allows to us enroll newly eligible retirees into our
existing plans.
So let me put some parameters around the situation. First of all, assuming the sanction is not lifted prior to the end of
the year, here are a few factors that we can roughly estimate at this point. First, based on the preliminary results of our
bid, we do expect to be able to retain the vast majority of our current 2.5 million low-income subsidy enrollees. Second,
based on the historic competitiveness of our products, we do expect to retain the majority of our 900,000
non-low-income subsidy chooser lives and these enrollees have previously chosen SilverScript as their PDP.
Third, and consistent with a typical Medicare Part D plan, there will be some normal attrition of our enrollees due to
death, relocation, other normal member eligibility factors, and we estimate this attrition will continue at the rate of
roughly 25,000 lives per month. And in January, rates of attrition are generally a bit higher, after they have gone
through their typical decision processes during the annual enrollment period.
So to put some preliminary numbers around this, again using historical attrition rates, we estimate our PDP lives could
decrease by about 350,000 lives, leaving us with approximately 3.1 million lives in our individual SilverScript PDP by
the end of January 2014. So clearly the sanction limits our ability to expand our Med-D lives for 2014 and we will
continue to work diligently to have the sanction lifted as soon as possible in order to be able to enroll new members and
participate in the individual age-in process next year in the regions where we have qualified.
Now, obviously, we take this issue very seriously. We have devoted additional resources to fully meet the needs of this
important customer base. And while this does present a challenge for 2014 in our Medicare Part D business, it's
important to note that we still see significant opportunity to grow our Med-D business over the long term and the
remediation steps that we are taking will allow us to do just that.
Now, moving on to the retail business, we had another very solid quarter. Total same store sales increased 0.4%.
Revenue growth was muted by the impact from new generics, which had a 670 basis point negative impact on
pharmacy comps in the quarter. Pharmacy same store sales increased 0.8%, with pharmacy same store scripts
increasing 1.8%, when counting 90-day scripts as one and increasing 5% when counting 90-day supplies as three
scripts. And we have seen a greater than historical rate of conversion to 90-day from 30-day scripts, which is driven by
the strong growth in our Maintenance Choice programs.
Our retention of the scripts gained during the impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts continues to exceed our
expectations and as you know our goal is to retain at least 60% of the scripts gained during the impasse and given our
outperformance to date, we remain very confident that we will continue to retain at least 60% of the scripts in 2013.
As for the front store business, comps decreased 0.4%. That was impacted largely by the shift in the Easter holiday
from April of 2012 to March of 2013, which had a negative impact to front store comps of about 65 basis points.
During the quarter, pharmacy traffic was up, while front store traffic was down. At the same time, average front store

tickets continued to increase.
I think it's important to note that despite the slight decrease in front store comps, our front store margins expanded
nicely in the quarter and we continue to focus on driving more profitable sales through the targeted promotions we
offer to ExtraCare card holders and we are focused on increased personalization to accomplish this. And to gain a
bigger share of wallet, we have identified customer specific opportunities for increasing frequency of both the shop and
the basket size. And to drive this conversion, we continue to dramatically expand our personalized offers that are
delivered at the point of sale. In the second quarter alone, we issued more than 3 billion such offers and we've also
significantly expanded our personalized offers that we deliver via email.
So ExtraCare provides extraordinary precision due to the scale of customer engagement, along with the 15 years of data
that has provided us unique insights into consumer behavior trends, and we continue to use these valuable insights from
our ExtraCare program to drive the evolution of how we tailor our stores to better meet local needs.
Our latest data shows that we continue to gain market share. Our front store market share growth in the second quarter
versus a year ago was 71 basis points and 8 basis points, and that's when compared to drug and multi-outlet competitors
respectively.
As for new stores, we opened 47 new or relocated stores. We closed one during the quarter, resulting in 22 net new
stores in the second quarter, and this puts us on pace to achieve our 2% to 3% square footage growth target for the year.
Let me turn briefly to MinuteClinic, which once again recorded exceptional revenue growth with sales up 32% versus
the same quarter last year. We opened 35 net new clinics in the quarter, ending Q2 with 684 clinics in 25 states and the
District of Columbia. Our expansion plans call for the opening of 150 clinics this year, and to end 2013 with just under
800 clinics with around 30% of our expansion this year in new markets.
Our longer term goal is to create a national primary care platform to provide integrated high-quality care that is
convenient, accessible and affordable. And new services will continue to be developed to address the shortage of
primary care physicians and to support patients impacted by the epidemic of chronic disease. And our positioning
further supports the primary care medical home model along with connectivity through electronic health records to
numerous health system alliances.
So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.
David M. Denton
Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Today I will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results
and then I will provide guidance for the third quarter and update our full year 2013 outlook. First, I would like to
highlight how we have been enhancing shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation programs.
During the second quarter we paid approximately $276 million in dividends bringing our year-to-date payout to $553
million. Given our continued strong earnings outlook this year, we remain on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio
of 25% by the end of this year. And as a reminder, that is two years ahead of the schedule that we laid out back in 2010.
Additionally, we repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares for approximately $355 million in the quarter, at an
average price of $55.39 per share.
And as Larry indicated, we ended the quarter with more shares outstanding than we had planned because of our
decision to suspend share repurchases until we were more fully certain of the outcome of our negotiations with the
SEC. And despite our slower pace in the second quarter, we still expect to complete $4 billion of share repurchases in
2013, consistent with our original plan. And note that the guidance we are providing today assumes the $4 billion of
share repurchases can be completed this year.
So between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned more than $1.3 billion to our shareholders through just
the first half of this year, and we continue to expect to return approximately $5 billion for the full year. We have
generated approximately $1.7 billion of free cash for the first two quarters of 2013, and improving our cash generation

capabilities by enhancing our working capital management remains an area of focus for us, and we have made excellent
progress over the past several years in reducing our cash cycle.
As I pointed out on our last call, we have taken nearly two weeks out of our cash cycle over the course of the last ten
quarters. Inventory has seen the greatest amount of improvement, but all areas have benefited from our focus on
extracting value from our balance sheet and we remain committed to further improvements as we look further into the
future.
As previously highlighted on our last earnings call, we noted that we may have some timing issues with respect to CMS
payables and receivables that may affect our free cash flow delivery for the year, given the issues we experienced
following our Med-D plan consolidation. While we are maintaining our guidance for free cash flow of between $4.8
billion and $5.1 billion this year, we are still working to offset this headwind to our free cash flow targets and will
continue to update you on our progress as we go forward.
Turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $0.97 per share, at
the high end of our guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.91 per share, and as we have said, weighted average share
count was higher than planned, but the impact of that in the second quarter was negated by a slightly more favorable
tax rate and good expense management within the corporate segment.
Now, let me quickly walk you through our results. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased
1.7%, or approximately $534 million to $31.2 billion. This is near the top of our guidance range. Solid increases in
revenues in both the PBM and retail segments were offset only slightly by an increase in inter-segment activity, which
was primarily driven by the increase in adoption of our Maintenance Choice program.
Within the segments, PBM net revenues increased 2%, or approximately $377 million to $18.8 billion. This growth
was approximately 55 basis points above the high end of our guidance. The outperformance was driven by higher than
anticipated claims volume, primarily from Maintenance Choice and Medicare Part D utilization. Claims growth
year-over-year was driven by new client wins and increased membership within our existing book of business.
Specialty pharmacy was also a key driver. This was largely offset by the significant impact from new generics. The
PBM's generic dispensing rate increased nearly 275 basis points versus the same quarter of last year to 81%. Note that
the year-over-year increase is down sequentially from last year's quarter's year-over-year increase by about 125 basis
points and this is a trend that should continue throughout the year, given fewer generic conversions are expected for the
remainder of this year versus last year.
Now, revenues in the retail business increased 1.9% in the quarter or approximately $294 million to $16.1 billion. New
generic introductions also negatively impacted retail sales with our retail GDR increasing approximately 280 basis
points versus the second quarter of 2012 to 82%. Now, offsetting that phenomenon was the growth of our Maintenance
Choice program, which contributed to sales performance coming in near the higher end of expectations.
Turning to gross margin, we reported 18.7% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of approximately
95 basis points compared to Q2 of 2012. Within the PBM segment, gross margin increased by approximately 90 basis
points versus the same quarter of LY to 5.1%, while gross profit dollars increased approximately 24% year-over-year.
The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by increasing in GDR, higher volumes from new clients and new
members and better acquisition costs and rebate economics. These positive margin drivers were partially offset by price
compression and remediation in operating costs in our Medicare Part D business. Gross margin of the retail segment
was 31%, also up about 90 basis points over LY.
As with the PBM, this improvement was driven primarily by the increase in GDR and also by improvement in front
store margins. Additionally, gross profit dollars increased 4.8% year-over-year within the retail segment. Expense
leverage was also impacted by the growth in GDR, while the deleveraging was optically negative, the growth of
expense dollars was within normal parameters.
Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 20 basis points from Q2 of 2012 to 12.4%, while total
SG&A dollars grew by just 3.4%. The PBM segment's SG&A's rate was essentially flat to LY at 1.5%. The benefits
from the PBM's more efficient cost structure versus the same quarter last year was basically offset by the deleveraging

effect of an improved GDR and costs related to remediation efforts within Medicare Part D.
In the retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales increased approximately 25 basis points to 21.1%. As expected this
too is mainly due to the deleveraging effect of the growth in generics. Overall, SG&A expenses grew by 3.2%.
Within the corporate segment, expenses were virtually flat year-over-year at $176 million.
Now adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately 75 basis points to 6.3%.
Operating margin of the PBM improved by approximately 80 basis points to 3.6%, while operating margin at retail
improved about 60 basis points to 9.9%.
For the quarter, we are comfortably within the high end of our guidance for operating profit growth in both retail and
the PBM segment. Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 8.6%, while PBM operating profit was once again
solid, growing at 32%.
Now going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense for the quarter declined
approximately $5 million from last year to $127 million. And the debt refinancing we did in the fourth quarter last year
was the primary driver of the decrease. Additionally, our effective tax rate was 39.1%, which was slightly better than
expected, and as we discussed, our weighted average share count was higher than anticipated, about 1.24 billion shares
for the quarter.
Now, let me update you on our guidance. I'm going to focus on the highlights here but you can find additional details of
our guidance within the slide presentation we posted on our website earlier this morning. As previously stated, we
narrowed our EPS range for the full year of 2013 to reflect our strong operating results and to incorporate our current
plan for the timing of share repurchases. We are taking down the top end of the PBM operating profit growth –
forecasted growth to reflect some incremental remediation costs related to our Medicare Part D sanction. However,
these costs are expected to more than offset by an increase in our retail operating profit growth forecast. All of which is
reflected in our revised guidance.
All things considered, we have raised the low end of guidance by $0.01 and lowered the high end by $0.04. We
currently expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in 2013 in the range of $3.90 to $3.96 per share, reflecting
excellent year-over-year growth of 13.5%, to 15.25%, after removing the impact related to the early extinguishment of
debt in 2012.
GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.71 per share.
We have narrowed our top line outlook and now expect consolidated net revenue growth of 2% to 3%. This guidance
reflects the solid performance across the enterprise year-to-date, driven by better volumes, as well as inflation. We have
raised the PBM segment's revenue guidance to 2% to 3% growth, while narrowing retail's expected revenue growth to
2.25% to 3.25%. We expect total comp store – same store sales of 1% to 2%. We are maintaining our prior guidance
for script comps of 1.5% to 2.5%.
Now, we are also introducing a new guidance metric, adjusted script comps, adjusting 90-day fills for the 30-day
equivalent. Given the high rate of conversions from 30-day fills to 90-day fills we believe this is a better indication of
pharmacy performance. And we expect adjusted script comps to be in the range of 4% to 5%. As I said, guidance for
operating profit growth in our retail segment has been raised while we have brought down the high end of the range for
the PBM segment. We now expect retail operating profit to increase 9% to 10% year-over-year, and PBM operating
profit to increase 11% to 13%.
We now expect net interest expense of between $500 million and $510 million, a slight increase over our prior
guidance. We are increasing our weighted average share count forecast to 1.23 billion shares, up from 1.22 billion. And
as I said previously, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion. In the
third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1 to $1.03 per share, reflecting growth of
17% to 21% versus the same period of LY.
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.97 in the third quarter.
Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 4% to 5.5%, versus the third quarter of last year. The revenue

increase will be driven by solid volume growth while we expect a sharp decline from the dampening effect from new
generic introductions. We expect same store sales of 3% to 4.25%, script comps are expected to be – to increase in the
range of 1.25% to 2.25%, while adjusted script comps are forecasted to be 3.75% to 4.75%. Within the PBM we expect
revenue growth of between 4.5% and 5.5%, driven by volume growth and inflation and also benefiting from the decline
from the effect of new generics.
Operating profit in the retail segment is expected to grow 7.5% to 9% in the third quarter, while operating profit in the
PBM segment is expected to grow 19% to 23%. So, again, we expect another very solid quarter.
And before I turn it back over to Larry, I want to touch on the quarterly flow of profits in the back half of 2013 and
particularly within the PBM. If you take the full year and third quarter guidance that I just laid out, and plug that into
your models, you might note that our implied Q4 operating profit growth in the PBM is anemic, and here are a few
points you should keep in mind that should help you better understand why Q4 is somewhat atypical this year.
First, we have consistently stated that the positive impact of new generics in 2013 would be front half loaded, given the
timing of break open generics in 2012 and the resulting wrap effect into the first half of 2013. We will be lapping the
impact of a substantial amount of break open generics so the comparison year-over-years are tough.
Second, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in 2013 is turning out to be different than 2012 due to a number of
factors. These include the impact of the sanction, changes in earned rebates in the mix of the business across our
Choice versus basic products. And as a result of these factors, we are seeing a shift of profitability this year from Q4,
which has historically been our most profitable Med-D quarter, into Q3. While the year and even the back half of this
year remains very profitable, the comparison year-over-year in the third and fourth quarters are not expected to be
typical. I hope this helps to put in context the flow if profits in both Q3, as well as Q4.
In summary, the second quarter was a very strong quarter and we continue to expect strong earnings growth for the
year. I want to assure that you we remain committed to utilizing our substantial cash generation capabilities to deliver
shareholder value and with that, I will turn it back over to Larry.
Larry J. Merlo
Okay, thanks, Dave, again, again, we are very pleased with our strong operating performance this quarter, along with
our strong outlook for the 2013 year and despite the near term challenges in our Med-D operations we do remain
excited about the long-term opportunity for growth in the Medicare business.
With that, let's open it up for your questions.

[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please
proceed.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So, Larry, two things I wanted to touch on. The first is the whole personalization effort.
You know, where do you guys stand with that, you know, in terms of being fully functional? And then what are you
seeing with regard to redemption of your offers and vendor support for that program? And then finally, do you think
that has a greater impact – will have a greater impact on top line or gross margin?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, John, let me take – let me take the second half of your question, and then I will ask Mark
to come back to your – you know to your first points.
And, you know, John, I think consistent as we have, you know, talked many times, you know, and as I mentioned in
my prepared remarks, you know, we have continued to use ExtraCare to create value for customers and, you know, to

gain a bigger share of wallet and, you know, we are always experimenting and working to find that appropriate balance
in terms of, you know, driving profitable sales, okay, and, you know, so there is a sales margin equation there and, you
know, we continue to finesse our strategy with the goal of, you know, we are not going to chase empty sales out in the
marketplace.
You know, I will say in response to your second question that, you know, I think that, you know, the way we use
ExtraCare benefits, you know, margin as much as sales, because, you know, you are not – you are not going to target
the cherry pickers, okay, in terms of your ExtraCare offerings and I think that, you know, over time, the supplier
community has grown to, you know, appreciate the value that ExtraCare brings them in terms of their ability to, you
know, target specific customers, you know, based on whatever the product is and whoever they define, you know, as
the user for that product.
So, you know, they find ExtraCare as a very – a very effective tool versus some of the other tools that are available in
the marketplace, like, you know, the free standing, you know, coupon inserts. And, you know, as a result, I think that,
you know, we have been able to demonstrate to them a higher return on their investment, you know, as a result of
higher redemption rates. So, you know, I will let Mark talk a little bit about where we are at with personalization and
some things we have coming online later on this year.
<A - Mark S. Cosby>: Thanks, Larry. One of our founding truths, really, within the retail world is personalization.
Most of our initiates are geared around bringing that to life. The foundation of that is ExtraCare, as Larry talked about
earlier. We do have the biggest program by a long shot, but issuing cards really is the easiest part. The tough part is real
behavior change and that's where the 15 years of history that we have in place has really helped us with improving the
productivity of the program over time. We know what works and we know what doesn't work and that helps us
improve the sales and profits over time.
I think the other thing you will note, we do track our ExtraCare program religiously, versus our competition, and all of
our customer satisfaction scores from a loyalty perspective are higher. With that said, we are not resting on our laurels.
Earlier this year, we did roll out a pharmacy and health rewards program, 3 million folks now enrolled in the program.
It's very distinct from what you will find out in the open market. It's an opt-in program where we can motivate our
highest value customers. It's individual based versus household based. So it's powerful for encouraging adherence and
retention and all of our customers can participate in the program, regardless of the payment structure.
I think the biggest thing that we did earlier this year around personalization is a program we called conversion. It's
customer-specific offers with two big goals in mind. They are what we call conversion offers, which encourage
customers to shop broadly across the store, so if they shop in a couple of the categories, we try to work them across the
entire store and then we have what is called share of wallet offers where we encourage our customers to spend more on
the categories that they are already shopping in. And every customer receives both of these types of offers. This
program is new this year and has been very successful for us.
Also, doing a lot to try to improve how we deliver the offers, our email program is up 2x from where it was at this point
last year. We also rolled out earlier this year, a big program against our ExtraCare center which is what our bloggers
call our magic coupon machine. We have a lot of programs in place that have led to a 40% improvement in the usage of
that program, and it is one of our biggest conversion drivers because the coupons come out in advance of the
transaction, not after the transaction, leading to a 15 times increase in redemption versus a standard coupon.
And then later this year, probably the biggest thing we have coming out is what we are calling our personalized
circular, which will take our traditional mass circular approach and do a circular for each individual customer and we
will deliver that mechanism both online and via mobile applications. So tremendous amount happening in the
personalization front. It is one of our foundation principles, and we will continue to take it to the next level.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And John, just in terms of your other question around, you know, what are we seeing around
redemption? We are seeing redemption on a per customer basis up year-over-year.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan, please proceed.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.
I just had some questions around the selling season. Larry, or if Jon is there, can you just talk about your expectations
for 2014, your ability to sell Maintenance Choice, 1.0, 2.0? And I think, Larry, you talked about specialty specifically
in the quarter. Can you talk about where you are on penetration for specialty and where you see the opportunity as we
move into 2014?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, so, Lisa, as we look at the selling season, and if you disaggregate the overall
healthcare spend that the payer sees, so they disaggregate inpatient spending, outpatient spending, pharmacy spending,
pharmacy is now one of the largest categories of cost and is a high priority for payers. When you look at pharmacy,
specialty is an increasing focus and is now one of the top priorities that – and we're seeing trends of around 20% and in
some cases higher. So our capabilities in specialty are resonating extremely well with both our existing clients as well
as prospective clients and have led to some of our success this selling season. So we have capabilities to manage the
specialty spend not only in the pharmacy benefit but also in the medical benefit and as you are aware about half of the
specialty spend is covered in the pharmacy benefit and the other half is covered in the medical benefit.
And our new integrated specialty model also has appeal, similar to Maintenance Choice and will be rolled out across all
of our CVS stores beginning early next year. So you combine these capabilities with all of our integrated capabilities,
such as Maintenance Choice, pharmacy and MinuteClinic, payers are seeing the value of our integrated model.
Specifically with Maintenance Choice, we are at about 16.5 million members. We introduced Maintenance Choice 2.0
this year. We see a runway to grow that to 30 million members. So, you know, we are very excited about that. When
we look at our penetration in specialty, when you look at our employer book of business, we have most of their
specialty spend. We are looking to expand our reach into the medical side that today we see as mostly unmanaged.
When you look at our health plan space, you know, they have multiple providers and we think with our capabilities we
can get them to reduce the number of providers they have and grow our share. So, you know, we are very excited about
both of those products and all of our capabilities are – you know, have had a lot to do with our success in the selling
season and also the retention of our existing clients.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: So, Jon when we think about the 2014 selling season in specialty are you doing things around the
formulary? I know you have been successful on the formulary side for just regular chemical compounds, but what are
you seeing on the specialty side? Are you starting to see where you can have multiple manufacturers competing against
each other for a class, and therefore that's something that you can bring to the table? I mean, clearly, you know, prices
keep going up on specialty, but what are some of the things that you have won business on that you are a little bit
differentiated in the marketplace? It sounds like one of the things is being able to pick up the prescription at a CVS
store, but what are some of the other things?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Lisa, I think as it relates to formulary and specialty, we have begun that process. You
look at a category like growth hormone, you know, we have brought a formulary process that exists in the traditional,
you know, spend to, you know to specialty in that regard, and I think, you know, the opportunities there will continue
to grow over time, as – you know, as more products enter, you know, the marketplace that, you know, that do not have
clinical differentiation.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, and --
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Can that drive your profit? Is that a profit driver over the next couple of years. Clearly it's a savings
driver for your customer, but is it also a profit driver for CVS?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: I think, as you know, Lisa, you know the client gets a disproportionate share of those rebates
and, you know, but – while that's the case and it's definitely a cost saving for the client, there is, you know, enhanced
profitability for the business as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to delve into the free cash flow if I
could for a little bit. We are kind of behind this year, Dave, and I was wondering if maybe you could walk me first to
how we get to about $5 billion, maybe there's some timing issues there.
The second question is with the CMS issues and other things, it sounds like maybe we won't get there and I guess my
question around that, is that just a timing issue? Will that money show up eventually or is that more of a permanent
factor?
And then the third thing on cash flow is CMS and the way things are going with that and kind of hurting cash flow a
little bit, does that have impacts as we look into 2014?
<A - David M. Denton>: Okay. Scott, it's Dave. Thanks. Great questions. Just a couple of things. First and foremost as
you look kind of year-over-year, through the first half of this year, compared to last year, if you recall, last year the
timing of payments from CMS happened kind of on the – right on the quarter end, kind of in advance of the next
quarter. So there was -- last year, for the first half, free cash flow was somewhat inflated compared to a normal trend.
So you have kind of tough comparisons from that standpoint. So that's just, you know, a flip between first half and
second half. So that's no big deal, if you will.
Keep in mind from, you know, as we think about free cash flow yield for this year, we are not changing our guidance of
$4.8 billion to $5.1 billion and there's kind of two items that are kind of in play here. The first is from a CMS payment
cycle, is a bit longer for closed plans, and upon the first of this year, we consolidated our plans at the beginning of this
year and the result of that is one of our plans -- one of our historical plans is considered closed. So this is just simply a
timing issue as we think about that receivable probably flowing not into 2013 but probably into the first half of 2014.
The second item is – is due to our, you know, service challenges in the first of the year, where we wanted to ensure that
all members had adequate access to pharmacy despite, you know, some of the systems issues that we were
experiencing. So to ensure that that access happened, with all of our members, some additional utilization took place
which was putting pressure on our cash flow delivery.
Having said all of that, most of that is a timing issue and we are working hard to make sure that we get to within our
guidance range this year. So I hope that puts it in context, Scott.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Yeah, I mean it sounds like it doesn't have much impact, I mean, timing issues aside, 2014 is
really not impacted by these same issues.
<A - David M. Denton>: That is correct. That is correct, Scott.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. So that's perfect. Great. I really appreciate the clarity there. And then the second
question I had was for Mark and it seems like we have lots of flow into – or traffic that's going these pharmacies, likely
to pick up again next year with how you guys are positioned with the Affordable Care Act. So I guess what I'm looking
for, you know, I think if I was going to say that the front end was a little weaker than we anticipated, how do you
harness all of that traffic into maybe above not – you know, profits are good, but, you know, getting those people to
utilize the front end and maybe drive incremental profit as we look to 2014 and then I will yield. Thank you.
<A - Mark S. Cosby>: Yeah, Scott. I mean, I think the answer around that is consistent with what you have heard us
talk about in the past. I mean, as we – you know, introduce new customers to CVS pharmacy, and if that point of
introduction comes from the pharmacy first, you know, we have a unique opportunity to introduce them to the other

products and services available across the entire store. So, you know, getting them enrolled in ExtraCare, okay, a prime
example of that and I think that, you know, that kind of becomes the pathway to, you know, engaging those customers
in a differentiated way that allows us to harness some front store impact.

Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q>: Hi, good morning. Thanks and this is [ph] Zach (50:27) for Ricky, and thanks for the color. I wanted to ask
another follow-up question on the front store. The negative foot traffic in the quarter, I was just curious, is this a trend
that you see continuing and was this in line with your expectations given that you were expecting the trade for some
bigger basket size and also if you could color that around your market share on the front store for the quarter?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, [ph] Zach, in terms of customer traffic, it was pretty much in line with what we expected
recognizing that there was a calendar shift with Easter that negatively, you know, impacted traffic and I think as both
Mark and myself had mentioned earlier, you know, we are certainly mindful of, you know, how we manage that
balance between you know, driving traffic and, you know, managing, you know, promotional spend with both sales and
margin in mind. And, you know, we look to bring a, I'll say a surgeon's knife, so to speak in finding that right balance.
So, you know, we continue to see a very cautious consumer out there, you know, and we don't see that changing
throughout the balance of this year.
<Q>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And on a completely separate topic, there have been some rumors throughout the
quarter of you guys being tied up and being interested in a European partner without, I guess, addressing those specific
rumors. Can you just refresh us, you know, after having expanded a little bit in Brazil what your thoughts are on global
and particularly in the European market?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, [ph] Zach, we're don't – as you know, we have a policy of not commenting on, you
know, rumors out in the marketplace, but, you know, as we have discussed in the past, around our international
strategy, you know, it was not a question of, you know, if. It was more of a question of when and where. As you know,
earlier this year, we acquired the Onofre retail pharmacy chain in Brazil. And we are six months into that and we are
very pleased with how that's going in terms of the learnings that we are getting and the opportunities that we see to, you
know, bring synergies with our US operations and, you know, we're opening some stores this year. We will accelerate
our openings next year, and, you know, we're – you know, so far so good, and, you know, we will use those learnings
to further our agenda, you know, internationally where it makes economic sense and again, as we have talked in the
past, we will approach that with financial discipline.

Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Yeah, hi, good morning. Nice quarter.
So Larry, could I just – I want to just clarify what you said about the Med-D business and the impact for next year. It
seems like the math should be about 350,000 lives year-over-year that you would be down on. Is that correct, I guess,
first? I want to make sure that is right. Then, as we think about the impact, should we be thinking about average
revenue probably just under $1,000 per member per year and maybe a mid-single digit type unit margin on that
business?

<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Ed, I will take first part and probably the second part and maybe Dave will jump in here
as well. But, you know, your – your takeaway in terms of the, you know, the lives impact was right in terms of we're
expecting a year-over-year compression in the range of 350,000 lives for the reasons that, you know, we had
mentioned. And, you know, we do not disclose the revenue or the profit per life in the Med-D for competitive reasons,
but, you know, I would also, again, back to the earlier comments that, you know, the 350,000, you know, life
adjustment represents about 10% of our overall individual SilverScript PDP lives and right around 5% of our total
Med-D lives.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay.
<A - David M. Denton>: This is Dave. I just want to clarify just one point. What you said is that as you roll forward
from where we are today to, I will say January of 2014, that's our estimate of 350,000 lives coming out at that point in
time.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Right. Okay, perfect.
And Larry, just sort of a follow-up on, you know, the idea of generic procurement and the opportunities available
through things like partnerships. Could you just give us an update on, you know, how you are thinking about, you
know, the opportunity out there for, you know, CVS in this area? Obviously, you know, one of your competitors sees a
lot of opportunity and, you know, I would be interested in getting your updated thoughts on this area and the potential
for you to generate savings at some point going forward, if it's there.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Ed, I mean, I think as everyone is aware, we have renewed our wholesaler agreements
with Cardinal and McKesson a few months ago, and, you know, we were very pleased with the results of that and we
believe that the relationship that we have with both of those wholesalers – first of all, they both do a great job and we
believe that that makes the most sense for us from both an economic as well as an efficient distribution network.
Now, you know, we are certainly constantly evaluating opportunities out in the marketplace. If we thought that there
were, you know, further opportunities for us to, you know, enhance our efficiency from both a cost, as well as a
distribution network, you know, point of view, we certainly wouldn't hesitate to, you know, pursue those opportunities.
And, you know, so I think that's something that, you know, we are watching closely, and, you know, we will continue
to evaluate.

Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone from Macquarie, please proceed.
<Q - Dane Leone>: Thank you for taking the questions.
So maybe to ask the topical question of Medicare PDP a different way, I appreciate that over the past year or two, you
focused your strategy over to overall EBITDA growth versus EBITDA per script growth and with the PDP headwind
going into 2014, and thinking about the optionality you have with the balance sheet, could you just update your strategy
of what you see in the areas of organic versus inorganic EBITDA growth, as consolidation rolls through the entire
industry, but, you know, in the context of the plan and obviously a disappointment with CMS? Thank you.
<A - David M. Denton>: Well, I guess – this is Dave. First and foremost, let me just point out that, you know, from
using our capital structure, we have been very disciplined in the program that we have in place to kind of drive value
for our shareholders. First, kind of in three areas, one increasing our dividend, but probably more importantly in this
aspect, investing back in our business that we see good line of sight from a return on investment perspective and we

will use our balance sheet to do that.
Furthermore, our cash flow yield and generation is pretty substantial so we will continue to use that to drive share
repurchase program that will continue to work to enhance shareholder value. So we – if you keep in mind, you know,
we said very clearly that our adjusted debt to EBITDA was 2.7 times. We are a little better than that at this time so it
gives us some flexibility as we think about using our balance sheet to drive value for our shareholders and we will
continue to do that, both, as you just heard, through this year but certainly into next year as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard, Cleveland Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning. Curious on the PBM growth outlook as you think about and even frame where
you think we are in terms of generic benefits to profitability in the PBM relative to share penetration of 90-day and the
efforts that you are making with the formulary, I'm curious how you mix that all together and think about the growth
curve of PBM profits over the next 12, 24, 36 months.

general, as we have talked about, there are a few things that are driving kind of growth in our business over time, you
know. Clearly our ability to garner lives and share in the PBM space has been pretty important to us and we, you know,
as you keep – as you have even seen this year, you know, very successful selling season. As we continue to get more
lives into the PBM is pretty important to us.
The question then is, you know, how do we make sure that those lives, you know, we increase our share of dispensing
across both of our channels of distribution, both within the PBM but also on the retail segment. And I think clearly
generics, while the – over time we are in the peak of the generic introductions as we look forward, there's still plenty of
run room for new generic introductions over the next 3 to 5 years, despite it being a somewhat slower pace than what it
has been over the last year and a half or so. So, you know, all of those components that we have put in place are things
that we look to drive value for our clients and for our members, but also drive profits for ourselves.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, and, Eric, it's Larry. Just on the generic piece that Dave mentioned, you know, keep in
mind that we've got, you know, 15 – on average over the next three years, $15 billion worth of branded product coming
off patent, and then just one additional point. You mentioned the formulary, and while that's gotten a lot of discussion
and attention over the last couple of years, you know, what we refer to as our template formulary, you know, it has
today about a 50% penetration with clients. So, we continue to see opportunity for further adoption, especially as
clients will be looking for additional ways to reduce costs. And then, we talked about specialty earlier as a key growth
driver as well.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great. And then if I could circle back on the front end growth, which was a little slower. Just
wondering if you could characterize why that business was slower. I appreciate the focus on profitability, but if you
would frame what was different in terms of the growth rate in the front end being a little bit slower.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Eric, I don't know that there's anything new from what we have talked about in the past. I
think that, you know, we are continuing to see, you know, a cautious consumer. I think as you look across some of the
external data available in the second quarter, you know, whether it's IMS or some of the other data, it did show some
consumer spending slowdown in the quarter. You know, so, you know, I think, you know, it has to do as much about
that as anything else.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: That's helpful, thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Eric.

Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom from Raymond James. Please proceed.
<Q - John W. Ransom>: Hi. I just wanted to get into the weeds a little bit with specialty. A couple of questions. One
is, are you distributing more and more of your specialty drugs out of your retail locations or is it still primarily a mail
order business? Do you see advantages to doing it more retail?
And then secondly, I'm curious about oncology, because it's direct to physicians drug and it flows on the medical
benefit. I just wondered if there's any emerging strategies that might tame that beast just given all the drugs in the
pipeline?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, hi, John this is Jon. Specialty primarily is distributed by our specialty pharmacies
via mail order. There is some specialty revenue that flows through retail. I talked earlier about our integrated specialty
strategy, which is really providing access for members across all 7,400 CVS retail locations, but leveraging our clinical,
our billing and our fulfillment capabilities on the back end.
So we'll be rolling that model out next year and in a pilot that we have done, what we have seen is that about half the
patients like to have their specialty script mailed to their home and about half the patients like to pick up their specialty
script at their local CVS pharmacy. So we believe we are going to be able to grow specialty fulfillment at retail but we
are not going to have to actually house the inventory in the retail stores because we are going to be leveraging our back
end and then we are also going to leverage our billing and our clinical capabilities.
As far as oncology, you are right. That's a buy and bill that is done by the oncologists in their office. I would say that,
you know, it's not well managed today and the incentives are aligned for physicians to actually utilize the higher cost
oncology medications. So there are solutions that are in the marketplace that we have and others have where we look to
realign the incentives for physicians and incentivize them to utilize the most cost effective combination of oncology
drugs that that patient needs. So that – I'm not sure in the near future you will see a movement away from that buy and
bill model but I do think there's an opportunity to more effectively manage it.
<Q - John W. Ransom>: I guess my other question. Are you seeing – I mean, I guess potentially by 2015 or 2016, we
could be back into a pretty high top line drug trend. Are clients focused on this? And practically speaking, I mean, how
much can you really help them take, say, a 9% drug trend and turn it into a 7% drug trend or something. What do you
see, as specialty comes to be the lion's share of the growth in spend?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, John, so when you think of the drug trend you think of, there's inflation, there's
utilization and then there is mix changes because of new drug introductions. So we are actually seeing trends today
around 20%. So it clearly is becoming a very, very high priority for our clients. So – and we're going to – we have
solutions that can help them manage it. It's utilization solutions, it's formulary solutions, it's consolidating where they
purchase their specialty products through our channels that provides them better economics.
So we believe there are a lot of solutions that take a higher level of sophistication than what we see in the commercial
space, but we have made significant investments and we believe we have best in class capabilities to enable our clients
to more effectively manage this spend. So we're very bullish in this space, and believe that not only will it continue to
grow, but that our tools will distinguish us in the marketplace and allow us to grow disproportionately.
<Q - John W. Ransom>: Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, John.

<Q - Frank G. Morgan>: Good morning. Dave, you mentioned the tail-off in the operating profits in the PBM
segment in the fourth quarter, that was a good explanation there. But I'm curious, I think you also mentioned there
would be a ramp up in the operating profits on the retail that would offset that. Could you talk just conceptually about
what you expect to see specifically on the retail side in the fourth quarter? Thanks.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, good question. I think as we continue to work from a retail perspective, we continue
to, you know, see very solid volume growth, both -- particularly within the pharmacy segment, as you think about
where we started this year, and our expectation for script retention within the pharmacy business, that continues to hold
steady, and we continue to drive performance there.
Also, from a front store perspective, we have been very diligent on managing, I will say, volume and margin. So as we
pointed out during the call, our front store margin continues to progress nicely. We continue to, I will say, balance, if
you will, the top line front store growth outlook with our expectations for margins. So we continue to be, you know,
more efficient across our – across most of our outlets around the country.
I would say that one thing that is important to think about our business, and we've talked about this in the past is, you
know, we can continue to progress from a financial perspective, very nicely with a fairly modest, I will say, 1% comp
growth in the front of our business. You know, that consistency is probably more important than driving, you know,
out-of-market growth, if you will. I hope that helps, Frank.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Just a clarification. Does the $1.7 billion in new PBM business, does that include any
adjustment for the Medicare losses that you mentioned?
An then just secondarily, maybe Jon, can you speak anecdotally to what you found here, what incremental work do you
need to do for that CMS sanction to be lifted? I wonder why this might not have been identified at your first pass at
this.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Bob, it's Larry. In terms of the – you know, the business that – you know, that we called
out on both a gross and net basis, that does not include the Medicare Part D business. Okay?
And, you know, in terms of, you know, the second question, you know, as we went and conducted our own audit, okay,
of the success of, you know, the remediation efforts, you know, we did uncover, you know, some additional elements
that need to be completed, that, you know, ensure that, you know, we have our systems and processes working at best
in class levels. And, you know, that's what we need to continue and to finish up on the remediation. So, you know, it's
that straightforward.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay. We'll take two more questions, please.

Our next question comes from the line of David Magee from SunTrust. Please proceed.
<Q - David Glenn Magee>: Yeah, hi, good morning. Just two questions. The first has to do with what you are seeing
with the cautious consumer that you referenced earlier. Are you seeing that situation getting any better at all as the year
progresses and are you seeing differences with regard to geography or demographics in that regard?

And then my second question has to do with the generic benefit being more muted in the second half of this year. At
what point next year do you expect that to swing positive again in terms of comparisons? Thank you.
<A - David M. Denton>: Well, why don't I start with the generics a little bit. You know, as we said, really what is
happening here as you look back in really last year, in the back half of last year, those break open generics accelerated.
So you saw that comp itself into the first half of this year. So now we are facing pretty tough comparisons in the back
half.
I think as we think about, you know, moving forward, there's still plenty of opportunities for break open generics over
the next several years, the timing of which, quite frankly is probably a little too early to give you a sense of specifically
how 2014 will shape up from that perspective, kind of year-over-year, but rest assured, you know, if you look ahead for
the next two to five years, generic introductions are still pretty robust, despite the fact that we are in a peak at this point
in time.
From a consumer perspective, maybe I will ask Mark to comment on that a bit.
<A - Mark S. Cosby>: Yeah, so we are seeing some divergence of results based on where our stores are, and most
notable, between lower income, higher income areas, that's where we see the most difference. And it's most noticeable
in those areas between – mostly on the front versus the pharmacy which tends to be more flat. So we are doing some
things in those lower income areas to try to help the value perception and we will begin rolling those out in the second
half of this year.
<Q - David Glenn Magee>: Okay. Great thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay. Last question.
Operator
Our last question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I guess I have two questions. First is you talked about
losing the 350,000 lives. The remediation costs seem like they were, you know, noticeable so far this year. Do you
expect that cost to continue at the same level or to be higher in the second half? And would there be – are there likely to
be any costs next year as well?
<A - David M. Denton>: Meredith, this is Dave. We clearly haven't broken out those costs specifically. You know, I
would just say that all of those costs are baked into our outlook for 2013 and I think we are pretty confident that we
have kind of our hands around the cost spend for that.
And I guess as we cycle into 2014, you know, it's probably just a little too early at this point in time to give you some
clarity around that specifically at this point. But clearly, you know, as we said, our expectations have – is to have the
remediation effort complete, if you will, kind of near the end of the year. So that would say that most of those costs
would not continue.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. And then I have a question about reimbursements for generics. I was recently talking to
Walgreens and I know that they have chosen to sign slightly different contracts with payers in order to spread out the
benefits from generics. And so instead of being very, very high in the front and then dropping very sharply at some
point, they were kind of spreading it out. I think you guys have always said that the best profit comes when you have
three suppliers. But have you looked at all about smoothing out the benefit from generics in terms of gross margin?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Meredith, it's Larry. I mean, we have – I think there's been a lot of dialogue around the
use of, I will call it market basket or capped generic effective rates over the last 12, 18 months. From a CVS pharmacy
perspective, we started using those a few years back, and from our perspective, not much has changed and, you know, I
think that, you know, we continue to, you know, think about the cadence of generic reimbursement, very consistent
with how we talked about it in the past, and how you mentioned it, and I think it's important to note that despite the

dialogue around these things, you know, this does create more predictability from a forecasting and a budgeting point
of view. It does not alleviate the fact that there continues to be ongoing reimbursement pressures across the business.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Right. I guess I'm still not quite – did you say that you haven't made any changes at all, you
are still – still sort of have this pattern of dropping at a certain point?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Meredith, I'm saying that what's being talked about in the marketplace, we started doing
several years ago.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Oh, I see, I am sorry.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: So from our perspective, we haven't seen a change.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Got it. Okay. And then my final question I think is for, Jon. There was a question before about
managing the oncology spend and doctors' buy and bill. You had a program that you were working on that had to do
with getting doctors to follow certain pathways and generally keeping their reimbursement the same but encouraging
them to use the lowest cost oncology treatment. I was wondering – you didn't mention it today and I'm wondering if
that test is still there and whether you feel like you are getting traction with physicians, without getting a big push back
from them in terms of that program.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, Meredith so we still have that program. You know, it's out in the marketplace. I
would say that the payers are probably a little more reluctant to take on oncologies and they are focused on other areas
that are less sensitive. But we still believe that the oncology space needs a solution, and we think the solution and the
approach that we are taking is – is the most prudent approach and delivers savings without creating patient and
physician disruption. So we are still committed to – we are still committed to that program.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: And when you say the payers are attacking other things, are you talking about mostly the
pharmacy benefit? Or are they also looking at other areas funded under the medical benefit?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, they are looking at both. So...
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Both.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: So, formulary and utilization programs across both pharmacy and medical benefits and
they are coming to us and asking us to take our capabilities that we have demonstrated on the pharmacy side of the
specialty spend and extend that into the medical spend. So, again, it's, you know, it's a capability that we have that we
think not only makes sure that the right drug gets utilized, but that the billing is appropriate, medical claims systems
don't have good editing capabilities in them. So we provide that editing capability to make sure that the appropriate
charges are – are paid. So a lot of interest in this space. Again, half the spend is on the medical side and you are seeing
specialty grow faster than any other part of the pharmacy business.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate the help.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay. Thanks, Meredith.
Larry J. Merlo
