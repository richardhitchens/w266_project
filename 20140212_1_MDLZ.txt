Thanks, Dexter. As you know, 2013 was our first full year as a global snacking company. Frankly we're very
disappointed that our performance was below what we and our shareholders originally expected, but it turned out to be
quite a challenging year as we faced slower category growth and volatility in some of our key markets. In the context of
this macroeconomic environment, we delivered solid results.
For the full year, revenue increased 3.9%, in line with the overall growth of our categories. Our revenue was high
quality, driven by strong volume mix. In fact, our volume mix was the best in our industry. Our share performance was
also strong, with about 70% of our revenues gaining or holding share. In emerging markets, we grew 9% despite the
fact that they were disproportionately affected by the category slowdown.
As we enter 2014, four of our five regions have strong underlying momentum, with Asia Pacific being the lone outlier.
As you know, we're already taken a number of steps to regain momentum in Asia, including strengthening our
management teams at the regional level and in China, India, and Australia. We've also improved our monitoring
systems of leading indicators like trade stocks and shored up our analytical capabilities. These changes will help us
detect potential issues much earlier and make us a stronger operating company.
Turning to profitability, we delivered adjusted OI margin of 12%, in line with our guidance. Our margin improved
sequentially each quarter last year, exiting with Q4 margins at nearly 14%. Finally, our adjusted EPS was $1.51. That's
up 13.5% on a constant-currency basis, consistent with the double-digit guidance we gave throughout the year. A
favorable tax rate allowed us to accelerate our growth investments in emerging markets while still delivering strong
double-digit growth on the bottom line.
Before I turn the call over to Dave, let me give a few more details on our revenue and share performance. Vol/mix was
the primary driver of our growth, with all of our regions posting gains. Overall, vol/mix contributed 3.4 percentage
points to our top line. Pricing was only a modest contributor, mainly due to the impact from coffee, as we passed
through lower green costs to our customers. In the final analysis, coffee tempered organic revenue growth by 80 basis
points for the year and 70 basis points in the quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, our emerging markets performed well, up nearly 9%. Our BRIC markets grew about 10%.
Brazil, Russia, and India each posted double-digit growth, while China was up low single digits, reflecting the
significant slowdown in their biscuit category. Our developed markets increased 0.8%, with North America and Europe
both posting solid growth. Our Power Brands, which represent about 60% of our total revenue, grew 6.5%. They
continue to fuel both our growth and our margins as we distort our spending to these brands. Cadbury Dairy Milk,
Lacta, Oreo, belVita, Tuc, Club Social, and Barni all posted double-digit gains.
From a category perspective, in aggregate we grew in line with our categories. We used our strong share performance
to offset volatility in markets such as China, Egypt, and Southeast Asia. The rollout of proven innovation platforms into
new markets continues to be a key driver of our category growth. Biscuits and chocolate had a terrific year, and despite
continuing challenges in gum, our snacks revenue was up nearly 5%.
Let's take a closer look at each category. Biscuits continued to perform well. Revenue was up 7%, clearly outpacing
category growth of 5.5%, and we grew or held share in 70% of our revenue. Oreo led the way, up double digits, with
annual revenue now approaching $2.5 billion. belVita, which anchors our sustaining energy platform, continued to
grow rapidly, up 25%. belVita now generates revenue of over $0.5 billion, more than doubling in size since 2010.
Chocolate revenue growth was also strong, up nearly 6%. And share performance was outstanding, with 80% of
revenues gaining or holding share. Cadbury Dairy Milk had a stellar year, growing low double digits overall, including
more than 20% in India. Milka was up nearly 10%, driven by strong growth in emerging markets.
Gum remains the only soft spot in our snacks portfolio. Gum and candy revenue declined 1.5% as the mid-single digit
decrease in gum more than offset the low single digit increase in candy. Despite continuing weakness, we're seeing
improvement in gum as we implement a number of initiatives to rejuvenate the category. Over half of our revenues
gained or held share last year, and in the fourth quarter, although gum revenue in developed markets was down
mid-single digits, that's encouraging progress from the mid-teens decline we saw earlier in the year.

Outside of snacks, beverages revenue increased about 1%. Coffee decreased low single digits. That was in line with the
category and a clear reflection of the pricing environment driven by lower green costs. The pass-through was especially
pronounced in roast and ground coffee, which makes up roughly 40% of our business.
From a share standpoint, two-thirds of our revenue gained or held share, led by on-demand and soluble coffee. Tassimo
in particular continued to show strong growth, with revenue increasing 30% to over $450 million. That's on top of a
gain of more than 20% in 2012. Powdered beverages, primarily our billion-dollar Tang brand, had another robust year,
with high single digit growth and strong market shares.
Finally, the remainder of our portfolio, cheese and grocery, grew 1.3%.
So for the full year, we delivered high-quality revenue growth in line with recent category trends, strong share
performance, and sequentially improving margins, consistent with our guidance. Looking ahead, we're committed to
improving results in 2014 and beyond. We remain focused on increasing efficiency and aggressively reducing costs,
both in our supply chain and in overheads. Although near-term economic conditions will remain challenging, the plans
we're executing give us great confidence in our potential to significantly expand margins and deliver strong top-line
growth.
With that, let me now hand it over to Dave.
David A. Brearton
Thanks, Irene. 2013 was indeed a challenging year, and no more so than our Asia Pacific region. Organic revenue was
up only slightly for the year, 0.6%. Emerging markets were up mid-single digits, offsetting a mid-single digit decline in
developed markets. Revenues were notably weak in the second half of the year, including a 6% decrease in the fourth
quarter. This was primarily due to the issues in China biscuits that we discussed in our third quarter earnings call. As
expected, despite strong growth in gum, China was down double digits in Q4, as our distributors reduced excess
biscuits inventory. While the impact of destocking is now behind us, we expect biscuits growth in China will continue
to be soft for the first half of the year, consistent with recent category trends and as we lap a strong year-ago revenue
comparison.
In the fourth quarter, Asia Pacific's revenue growth was also tempered by aggressive promotional spending in our
developed markets, especially in Australia and New Zealand. This was a key factor, driving our pricing down 4.4
percentage points in the quarter. On the positive side, India continued to perform well, up low teens for the year, driven
by strong chocolate growth. Our share performance across the region was also strong, with over 60% of our revenues
either gaining or holding share. And Power Brands significantly outperformed the rest of the portfolio, up 6.5%.
Now let's turn to the other regions. As Irene mentioned earlier, all of our four other regions exited the year with good
underlying momentum and solid results. In EMEA, organic revenue grew 9.2%, driven by double-digit gains in
vol/mix. Pricing was a bit lower, down 1.8 percentage points. This mostly reflects lower prices in coffee, particularly in
Eastern Europe, as well as chocolate in Russia. Importantly, we delivered growth across the region and in almost all our
categories, even with the pricing pressures in coffee and chocolate.
Russia was up double digits, led by strong vol/mix across much of its portfolio. These gains were due in part to the
incremental A&C and route-to-market investments that we made earlier in the year. Other standout performers included
the Gulf states, West Africa, and Egypt. Market share across the region was very strong, with over three-quarters of
revenue gaining or holding share. And Power Brands were up 14%, as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Barni, Jacobs and
Tang all posted strong double-digit gains.
Turning to Latin America, organic revenue grew 12.3% for the year, almost entirely due to pricing in the
hyperinflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Each of these businesses has revenues of about $800 million.
After our $2 billion Brazilian business, this makes them our second- and third-largest markets in Latin America. Our
teams in Venezuela and Argentina have done a good job responding to the challenging economic conditions all year.
However, given each market's volatility, we continue to have a cautious outlook.

In Brazil, despite softening category trends as the year progressed, revenue was up double digits, with balanced
contributions from both vol/mix and pricing. Biscuits, chocolate, and candy each grew double digits, while growth in
powdered beverages was up high single digits. Like Russia, the incremental investments we made in A&C and
route-to-market expansion began to pay off, especially in the fast-growing north/northeast region of the country.
Market share performance in Latin America was mixed, with a little less than half of our revenue gaining or holding
share. Overall, shares of our Power Brands fared well, especially in Brazil. However, in markets like Argentina and
Venezuela, the effects of high inflation have led some consumers to trade down to cheaper brands. Finally, Power
Brands were up 13%, with Lacta, Oreo, Club Social, Halls and belVita all delivering double-digit growth.
In Europe, organic revenue was up 0.8%. Vol/mix contributed over 3 points of growth on the year, while pricing
declined nearly 2.5 points, mostly due to coffee. For the full year, as well as in Q4, lower coffee revenue tempered the
region's growth by about 2 percentage points.
Looking at performance by category, chocolate revenue was up mid-single digits, driven almost entirely by vol/mix.
Growth across the region was broad based, with double-digit growth in Central Europe. Milka and Cadbury Dairy Milk
each delivered strong growth, while innovation platforms such as Marvellous Creations and Bubbly made strong
contribution. Biscuits were also up mid-single digits, with most of the gains coming from vol/mix. Oreo, belVita and
our chocobakery platform drove much of the growth. Coffee declined mid-single digits due to lower pricing, more than
offsetting solid vol/mix. Our convenience coffee platforms, notably Tassimo and Millicano, continued to perform
strongly. Gum and candy revenues were down mid-single digits, entirely due to gum. However, gum revenue in the
fourth quarter was only down mid-single digits, a significant improvement from earlier in the year. Candy was up
modestly, driven by strength in Cadbury eclairs and Milka toffees.
Europe's market share performance remained strong, as about two-thirds of revenue gained or held share. And our
Power Brands grew 4%, with double-digit gains in Oreo, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Tassimo, and chocobakery.
Finally, in North America, organic revenue increased 2.9%. Biscuits delivered another outstanding year. Revenue was
up more than 5%, largely through vol/mix. Both Oreo and Chips Ahoy! grew double digits, driven by strong flavor and
packaging innovations, highly successful marketing campaigns, and increased in-store displays. belVita also had an
excellent year, nearly doubling revenues and crossing the $100 million threshold. Candy had a strong year behind
double-digit gains of Sour Patch Kids and Swedish Fish while Halls grew mid-single digits. In gum, revenue declined
in line with the category, down mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. That's an improvement from the first nine
months of the year, as we began to benefit from the impact of the shelf reset. Overall, market share performance was
outstanding, with over 85% of the region's revenue gaining or holding share.
Turning to profits. Adjusted gross margin was essentially flat for the year, but this masked the significant improvement
in our cost structure. Supported by the supply chain initiatives we described last September, we generated gross
productivity of well over 4% and record net productivity of 2.5%. These savings, however, were offset by commodity
inflation, especially in emerging markets such as India and Brazil. As local currencies weakened, the cost of purchasing
raw materials traded in dollars, euros, or sterling spiked. And while we usually have good commodity coverage, it's
significantly more difficult to cover these forex impacts, so it hit our cost of goods quickly. Of course, we fully expect
to offset commodity inflation over time, including the impact of currency, but we are unable to price quickly enough to
protect gross margins in the back half of the year. Once recent price increases are fully implemented, the benefits from
net productivity will flow through to improved gross margins.
Adjusted OI margin was 12% on the year and 13.9% in the quarter, consistent with our guidance. The full-year result
was essential flat compared to the prior year, including a 10 basis point impact from the devaluation of the bolívar and
a 30 basis point impact related to our decision to accelerate some investments in emerging markets. We offset much of
these impacts through overhead leverage in developed markets. In Europe, margins rose 60 basis points to 13.6%, and
in North America, margins increased 110 basis points to 14.9%. Clearly we're already making progress towards our
long-term margin goals for these regions.

Moving on to earnings per share. Adjusted EPS for the year was $1.51. Currency was a negative $0.09 headwind,
including $0.03 from the write-down of the net monetary assets related to the devaluation of the bolívar. On a
constant-currency basis, adjusted EPS grew 13.5%. Operations were a favorable $0.04 on the year despite the
investments we made in emerging markets. Much of the remaining increase in adjusted EPS was due to tax favorability
related to discrete items. However, as we progress through the year-end closing process, we determined that some of
these items should have been recorded in prior years.
As we described in our earnings release, we've increased our 2013 taxes to reflect this revision, resulting in a $0.02
reduction in adjusted EPS. We've also made corresponding reductions to taxes for the years 2009 to 2012 and adjusted
retained earnings for any items prior to 2009. All of these items are noncash. Even with this revision, as well as an
unusually high tax rate in Q4 due to a recent change in French law, our 2013 adjusted effective tax rate of around 15%
was low due to many of the discrete items we discussed during the year. In 2014 we continue to expect our tax rate to
be about 20%, in line with our midterm guidance.
Turning to cash, free cash flow was $2.3 billion after excluding the impact of the Starbucks arbitration. This is well
above the midpoint of our previous guidance of $3 billion for 2013 and 2014 combined. Improvement in working
capital was a key driver of the favorability. We cut our cash conversion cycle by 14 days or nearly 50% to finish 2013
at 15 days. Cash flow was also aided by delays in capital and restructuring projects, which we expect to catch up in
2014. As a result we're updating our expectations for the combined total free cash flow for 2013 and 2014 to at least
$3.7 billion. This increase from the original target reflects the phasing of CapEx spending and stronger working capital
performance.
Turning to our 2014 outlook. Our goal is to grow our top line at or above the growth of our categories. In 2014, we
anticipate organic net revenue growth will be approximately 4%. We expect adjusted OI to grow low double digits on a
constant-currency basis. The combination of top and bottom line growth will adjust in adjusted OI margin in the high
12% range. In terms of pacing, we expect year-over-year margin improvement each quarter. We continue to evaluate
opportunities in both overheads and supply chain to accelerate margin expansion, and we'll update you as those
opportunities firm up. Finally, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.73 to $1.78. As we did last year, we're
providing this guidance on a constant-currency basis. Based on spot rates as of January 31, currency would be a $0.07
headwind to our current range. You can see the details of the spot rates used in the appendix of this presentation. We
will continue to give updates on currencies each quarter based on the latest spot rates.
Let's take a closer look at our organic revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. Moving forward, we will frame our organic
growth opportunity in relation to overall category performance. As we outlined in the third quarter and again today, our
categories have slowed across the board. In 2013, our categories grew in aggregate about 3.8%, with fourth quarter
growth at about 3.2%. And while that fourth quarter deceleration is not indicative of our 2014 expectations, it does
show continuing volatility in the marketplace. Based on current trends, we expect the category growth rate to be about
4% in 2014. We'll use market share gains to offset potential volatility and provide upside.
Before we move on to the EPS, I'd like to highlight a couple of pacing considerations on our revenue growth this year.
We expect the first quarter to grow between 2% and 3% due to a number of factors. Easter is coming three weeks later
in 2014. As a result, some holiday-related shipments will shift from the first quarter last year to the second quarter this
year. We expect coffee prices will be a headwind in Q1, and likely for the first half, as we compare the 2013 periods
when prices were still coming down. Obviously the recent spike in coffee prices, if sustained, could change our
full-year outlook, but it won't affect Q1. In China, we expect the biscuits category will reflect the same weakness it did
in 2013. While the impact of the destock is behind us, in the near term, China biscuits will not be a significant source of
growth. Lastly, we're increasing prices across most geographies this quarter, in line with our strategy to fully cover
commodity and forex impacts. In the near term, we may face temporary disruptions with customers and consumers as
the market adapts to the new prices. We expect this impact will be most pronounced in Q1.
Turning to EPS, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.73 to $1.78, up double digits on a constant-currency basis.
Consistent with our expectation of double-digit operating income growth, the majority of EPS growth will be delivered
by operations. Taxes will be a significant headwind this year but will be more than offset by lower interest expense and

shares outstanding. The figures on this chart are directional, reflecting what we know today, but to provide a frame of
reference for you to understand the expected EPS drivers.
So, to wrap up, 2013 was a challenging year, but we delivered solid results. More importantly, our emerging market
investments and our early progress on cost reductions in both overheads and productivity set the stage for a strong
2014, especially as it relates to margin improvement. Of course 2014 will have some of the same category challenges
we faced last year. But we expect the top line to grow in line with our categories as we use share gains to offset market
volatility. Furthermore, strong growth in our operating income and margin will deliver double-digit EPS growth, which
should put us at the top of our peer group.
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good afternoon, everybody.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Andrew.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: I just have – two quick things from me. I guess first, of the 300 basis points in margin that
you're targeting through 2017, I think about 250 basis points was highlighted initially as coming from the gross margin
side. I guess you're now talking again more aggressively about potential overhead opportunity. I think you even
brought somebody on board fairly recently to help look into this a bit more deeply. I guess what would you peg the
overhead portion of margin through 2017 now, if that's changed? And does this increase the overall margin target
and/or maybe just accelerate it? Or just shift the composition of how you get there?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think the way to think about overheads, Andrew, is it has been the single biggest
driver of our margin increase over the last few years. It was again the biggest driver of the margin increase in North
America and Europe last year. And we still believe we have some road ahead of us on that. You're correct; we brought
James Kehoe back in at the end of last year as our cost management person, and a key part of his role is in fact
overhead management. And he's in the process now of working with us to implement a zero-based budgeting approach
going forward. So I would say, yes, overheads will be an opportunity in 2014 and beyond. I think it's too early for us to
quantify that. But we'll probably give you some more insight into how we're thinking about overheads at CAGNY.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great. And then, Irene, as you've spoken about, I think, in your prepared remarks and even last
quarter, your category growth rates have slowed since the time of the split. And that's certainly had the largest impact
on your recent top-line trends. I guess do you think it makes sense to move more towards sort of a long-term top-line
target that is more market growth based? So, in other words, market growth plus some factor for share gains? Proctor
for example. Proctor does the -
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely, Andrew. I think we're taking the first step in that direction
with the guidance that we've given you for 2014. But without a doubt, as we monitor these markets and we see how our
categories are evolving, it will be our intent to grow, as we've said, at or above those category growth rates. And I think
that's the right way to think about it.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. And just as part of that, I mean, in 2014 obviously you'll grow in line with the market
because you've got share gains offset by some volatility. I guess over time, I would think you would expect to grow
ultimately at market growth rates plus some factor. So i.e. faster than your category growth rates over time. Is that the
right way to look it, and it's just now the market volatility that's bringing it back down to in line with category growth?

<A - David A. Brearton>: I think it's a question of just how we frame up the expectations. We've given guidance to be
at or above category growth rates, and I think that's the approximately 4%. Last year, we actually grew share in most of
our markets. And as you saw, we were slightly above category growth rates. And I think we strongly believe that the
brands we've got are capable of growing faster than the category. I think as we think about it, we'd rather keep that
share upside for either covering any emerging market volatility, like things in Ukraine or Venezuela, or ideally to
deliver upside to the guidance we're giving. And so that's how we're thinking about it. But clearly, internally, we're
driving for share growth.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks very much. And see you all next week.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Good evening. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: Yes.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yes.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yes.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you. I wanted to ask, as you look at your growth profile for 2014 and the
4% revenue growth, you had a pretty sluggish environment in the developed markets. Some of that's coffee, I realize.
I'm just trying to get a sense of emerging market versus developed market growth in 2014, if you can give any more
color on that.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah. I think we're – we haven't given specific guidance for 2014 by segment. But I think
it's fair to say that the categories last year in emerging markets grew in the sort of 8% to 9% range. And our revenue
growth in emerging markets last year was about 9%. So to the extent that we're saying we don't see the category
trajectories changing a lot, those are probably reasonable guidelines for next year. We still think emerging markets over
time will return to double-digit growth. But that's probably not in the next 12 months. Developed markets growth – as
you say, I mean, the category has slowed along with emerging markets. But a big driver of that, particularly in Europe,
was in the coffee business. Again, we're not counting on a big recovery in that in the short term. But in North America,
the growth rates tend to be in the 2% to 3% range. In Europe, it's a bit lower because of coffee.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And just – I had a quick follow-up, if I could, on your pricing versus cost
inflation. If you gave it, I didn't hear. But is there any range – I know you don't talk in specifics – but about the
percentage increase in cost inflation or how much pricing you should expect across the year as a contributor to revenue
growth?
<A - David A. Brearton>: We haven't given a specific number here. But I think it's actually not so much commodities.
It's more currency.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Which, frankly, makes it a little harder to pin down, because it's more volatile and we have
less coverage on it. But it's going to be a fairly significant driver of the revenue growth in the first half of the year in
particular. And it'll be more skewed to emerging markets. There is some significant pricing in Europe, but it's going to
be more skewed to emerging markets.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thanks for the time.

Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q>: Hi. Good afternoon. This is actually [ph] Chris Carril (31:18) in for Dave. Just a quick question, just a follow-up
on coffee – you mentioned it's still a headwind in the first half. But could you provide any visibility on whether it'll be a
drag in the second half? Or your view on the second half?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah. I think the reason we said it's a headwind in the first quarter specifically is last year
at this time, coffee prices were still coming down. It was about $1.45 last year at this time, and the pricing in the
marketplace today is more in the $1.10 to $1.20 range, because that's where green coffee had been for most of the last
six months. If you ask me about the back half of the year, then I'd have to start projecting what green coffee costs are
going to do. And, as you might have noticed, coffee costs spiked up about two weeks ago. They're up about $1.40
today. If it stays there, we would obviously adjust our prices upwards to reflect that, because coffee is a pass-through
category. That's not built into our guidance, but I think it's way too early to say whether that's going to stick or not.
Regardless, it wouldn't affect quarter one, and quarter one will play out more or less based on where the pricing in the
marketplace is today against that kind of $1.45 base last year.
<Q>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Bryan.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just a question on, I guess, marketing investment in emerging markets. I think you had
previously talked a bit about a $100 million incremental investment in 2013 and then, I think, an extra $100 million in
2014. So I guess, first, can you just – are those still good numbers for us to be working with? And then, second, kind of
given the change in the environment, is there anything different you're doing with those dollars versus your original
plan? So, I guess, does the environment sort of change your perspective on marketing investments in emerging
markets?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Okay. I'll answer the first part and let Irene answer the second. I mean, in terms of the
numbers, we had a plan to increase emerging market investments over time. This year, we made a decision to
accelerate about $100 million of that investment from 2014 into 2013, and that has played through, and that's part of
our results this year. So we did make that step up. We're not holding back on that, but we'll sustain that kind of
spending as we go into next year. So we're not going to have another step change, but we'll kind of sustain that level of
spending as we get into next year. But in terms of how we think about the investments, I'll let Irene address that.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah. I guess we continue to see the opportunity to make foundational investments that we
think can get a good return – investments in route-to-market, investments in sales capabilities, for example – so that
we're well positioned as these markets recover. And we certainly did see a good return on our investments in markets
like Russia and India and Brazil last year. So we will continue to look at those investments. We're going to pull back a
little bit on some of the A&C investments, as we see the categories continue to grow at the rates that are out there
today, because we are just not finding that we're able to change the trajectory much with those investments. So that's
how we're thinking about it, but we'll obviously continue to monitor the markets and make the adjustments accordingly.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Good evening.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Couple of questions, first on – well, I guess you call it marketing, admin, and research.
So it looks like you've been running, in that line, roughly $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion a quarter. Is that like a decent run
rate? Because the comparison, for whatever reason, I'm not sure what hurt you or what was so costly a year ago, like so
much margin expansion came from that line, your gross margins were actually down in the quarter. So I'm just trying to
get a sense as to what is the right level there? And if you could also kind of say what advertising and promotion were
up or where it was for the year and the quarter, that would be helpful.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Sure. I mean, that line is called selling, general, and administrative expenses includes all of
what we call our advertising and consumer promotions. It includes all of our overheads outside the manufacturing area.
It also includes other income expense, which has some of the sort of one-off items that would come from asset sales
and stuff. So it is a broad bucket. I think the reduction year over year is partially forex, frankly. But also partially
overheads are down, and particularly down in North America and in Europe, where we've had pretty good programs all
through the year, and we've been building savings as we went through the year. Quarter four a year ago was also
relatively high, particularly in North America, because that was the first quarter after the spin. And that's really when
the dis-synergies hit, sort of with a full whack, in the fourth quarter last year. So that's kind of what's in that bucket and
what's driving the reduction.
In terms of the A&C spending, we said that we spent just over 9% in 2012. We finished last year about the same,
actually. We invested more in emerging markets, but we had some good productivity programs in the developed
markets that allowed us to get some efficiencies out of that. So, again, the same kind of range.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And what are your plans for 2014 on that number?
<A - David A. Brearton>: We haven't given guidance [indiscernible] (37:01) but I wouldn't expect any material
changes up or down.
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: We'll talk probably a little bit more at CAGNY about that, too.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then in terms of your – I guess just so I understand it more clearly, your reported
revenue, like, right now you've got up organic I guess a 2% to 3%, but you ended the fourth quarter on like a negative
2.5% on currency. But you're saying that you're implementing pricing, so you're hopeful that the pricing offsets the
currency on the top line. So, in dollar terms, you hope for the year to still – or for your organic to basically equal your
reported?
<A - David A. Brearton>: When we talk about pricing to cover commodities and currency, we're talking about
transaction, so the impact of currency on the cost of importing materials into a specific country. We don't try to price to
recover the translation impact of currencies. So that's part of when we talk about – we gave guidance on a
constant-currency basis. The approximately 4% is on a constant-currency basis. If currencies stay where they are today,
it would come off a bit because of that. As we said, EPS impact of the spot today is about $0.07. So you would expect
that to come down a bit on a reported basis. But I'd expect those currencies to move around a bit as we go through the
year.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then I guess last question to Irene. Europe, you've talked about some margin
improvement out of that market. It sounds like in some places, France in particular, is very important to you. But in
France has in some ways become more challenging in terms of their regulatory government approach to business. So
some of the improvement that you were hoping for in that region, is that still feasible? Or is that kind of maybe being
pushed out until the environment becomes a little more friendly for you to do so?

<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No. France has always been a challenging environment in which to do business. And we
adjust our timing typically accordingly as a result of that. But I'm very pleased with the performance of our European
team this past year in that they improved their margins about 60 bips. And it was primarily driven by lower SG&A
across the board. So the challenges in any individual country doesn't affect our overall confidence and the ability to
continue to drive margins in that region.

Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll from Citi Research.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Yeah. Can you hear me?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yes, we can.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Super. First one, just a little one, and then a bigger-picture question. Can you quantify the
Easter effect in 1Q? Is that worth about a point?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah. I'd rather not quantify it, because truthfully I think last time we had an Easter shift it
shifted literally the entire Easter shipment. This year, it's three weeks, so it'll only be partial. So I think it's going to
depend, frankly, as we negotiate with each customer. So we've given you an aggregate of 2% to 3% and a number of
factors below that. But I'd rather not get into specifics on Easter.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Okay. On gross margins, is it fair to say that the gross profit margin was strong or stronger in
North America and Europe and hit pretty hard in the emerging market regions? Would that explain the weak fourth
quarter gross margin?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yes. Directionally, that would be right. The biggest hits we got on the gross margin line
were from currency, which as I said we don't have coverage on currency in a lot of the emerging markets, whereas we
can cover that pretty easily for Europe or North America. And so that hit us pretty quickly. We're putting the pricing in
place across the globe today, but in the back half of the year, there was a lag as we got the hit from the currency and we
didn't get pricing through until Q1. So, yes, the gross margin was more in emerging markets, less in the developed
markets.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Any way to quantify that number?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I think if you look at some of the OI bridges, you can see by region where the margin
declines where. But gross margin was a decent component of that.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: All right. Related to this, then, so you're taking pricing in these emerging markets that it's
kind of FX-based pricing, not really the underlying commodities. How is it being received; what's the volume
sensitivity here? And, frankly, is this kind of the key risk to Qs 1 and 2 in 2014?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah. I think that's correct. It is resolving the underlying cost trends. The issue on the
currency is not the translation – which I would agree would be more unique to U.S. companies – is that if India buys
cocoa, they're buying it in British pounds. And so as the Indian rupee devalues, they've got to pay more rupee to get the
cocoa. So it is a local cost increase; all competitors face the same thing. So we're not going to be out of step with the
industry.
The reaction we talked about and the sensitivity in emerging markets is likely to be more from consumers. And it just
takes a while to get the price-pack architecture right to make sure that in every channel there's the right pack and the
right size and the right price point for every consumer and get that all the way through the system. And it just takes
consumers a little bit to get used to that, and typically it's a quarter in emerging markets. So that's really what we talked

about in the first quarter as being one of the headwinds. But I would say I would consider that normal when you take
these kind of price increases.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: If I could sneak one final question in, Irene, just can you comment on the coffee operations?
Frankly, I've always thought that this was a scale provider in Europe and perhaps even in Russia. Would you agree with
that? And is there any desire or sensitivity on your part that this would be an operation that you would consider selling?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, I'm not going to comment on any hypothetical stuff, David. I think the reality is that it
does provide an important role, scale role, as you say in Europe and Eastern Europe. And it has been historically a
strong contributor to our profitability and our cash flow. This past year has been quite an anomaly given the
tremendous volatility that we've seen in pricing. And, as we've mentioned, it's been a disproportionate – has had a
disproportionate impact on the top line. We've been able to protect margin. So net-net, it is a volatile category. It has
performed reasonably well, and well in line with our portfolio over the last couple of years, but 2013 was a rather
unique year.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey. Good afternoon, folks.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Jason.
<Q - Jason M. English>: So, first, real quick housekeeping question. And I apologize if maybe I missed this already.
The SG&A drop in the quarter was much bigger than we expected. Can you help us decompose how much of that was
advertisement related versus real sort of overhead efficiency?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I don't want to get into breaking that out every time. But I would say, in the quarter, the
biggest contributor to the margin gains we saw in North America and Europe were overhead. And I think a lot of the
other stuff that's in that line – there's other income expense, which had some asset sales. Last year, we had some as
well, but they were in a different quarter. This year, it happened in the fourth quarter. So there's a lot of numbers in
there. I think the takeaway you should have is, we're continuing to sort of support our business on the A&C side. And
the real underlying OI margin growth in North America and Europe is driven by good overhead cost management,
particularly as we went through the back half of the year.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Okay. But don't necessarily take this 23% of sales to the bank on your go-forward?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I don't think we've -
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: We're not [indiscernible] (45:09)
<A - David A. Brearton>: [indiscernible] (45:09) want to give guidance at that level of detail. But it's – I think, again,
there's a lot of things in that line. So I wouldn't get carried away on trying to quantify a number there.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Okay. And I want to come back real quick to one of the categories you highlighted as weak
but a little bit less weak, that being gum. Hershey's had this ongoing campaign to try to crowd out the – or shrink the
gum sets at retailers – get more candy, get more breath-fresheners. It seems like that push is about to accelerate on the
back of this new product technology they're bringing to mints. I think it's this Ice Breaker Chews product. What are you
expecting – or I should say, where do we stand right now in terms of shelf resets? And what are you expecting to
happen to the market? And, most importantly, what are you sort of assuming in your underlying outlook here for gum
in North America?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, as we've said, we're not expecting any dramatic recovery in the category anytime
soon. Obviously, our emerging markets business continues to grow nicely. It's been the developed markets that have

been a challenge, and within that the U.S. We have made great progress from a share standpoint, and it's being driven
by the steps that we took to address that. Our shelf resets are focused on some of the core benefits like freshness and
oral care. It's been execution at point of buying, as well as the product assortment on shelf. So we're going to continue
to use that playbook. We've got a nice pipeline of innovation coming behind some of the focus on freshness, for
example. And we've got a number of tests in place to address the long-term growth of the category that we're hoping
will start to bear some fruit. So we remain quite committed to the gum category. We do see our competitors taking a
number of actions. And we actually think that will be good for the category over time.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Good evening, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, good evening.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. I wanted to follow up on the candy business specifically. And maybe this is just a
rounding issue, but my recollection was that the business through the nine months was growing closer to mid-single
digits. And today you cited more of a low-single digit figure for your own sales despite the category being up 4.5%.
Can you talk about any specific challenges you're facing in that business and initiatives you might be investing behind
next year to address them?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah. We continue to see that as a nice growth engine for us. There have been some puts
and takes on that business. For example, our Halls U.S. business has been a little weaker year over year because of the
flu season, up until the end of last year was not quite as robust as it had been a year ago. We've seen some challenges in
China on our chocolate eclairs business. But net-net, candy continues to be quite an attractive category. And we do
expect that that will play an important role in our growth algorithm going forward.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Would you expect to be able to grow in line with the category next year? Or is there a
period of reinvesting?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: There's nothing. We've got a nice pipeline of innovation, and we would expect to grow in
line with the category in 2014.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks. And then just one additional question on Europe. It seems like you have
good momentum behind the Tassimo business. You've also been launching the compatibles and other things. Given the
expectation for some pretty substantial margin expansion next year and the need to be very focused in where you're
investing, is that a business where you'd expect to continue increasing support next year?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah. Well, within our European portfolio, the on-demand and convenient coffee, as
reflected in Millicano, have been the key drivers not only of our revenue growth, but also of our margin improvement.
So those are critical enablers in our European and our Eastern European business, and so we will continue to invest
behind them.

<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. Two questions. One is, in fourth quarter, I thought I saw in the notes that
there was a $0.03 gain on sale this quarter from asset sales in India, UK, Italy. Just very quickly, is that last year? Or is
that this year?
<A - David A. Brearton>: That's this year. Last year, we had a very similar number, but it was in prior quarters, and it
was in Russia and Turkey last year. I think the simple way to think about it is when we bought Cadbury and LU, we got
a lot more facilities than we needed, and we're just cleaning that up, because it reduces our cost of maintaining these
over time.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Well, how much operating income did that contribute in fourth quarter?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I mean, every penny for us is about $25 million of OI, so -
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay, so put a regular tax rate on it. So will that set up a tough comparison for next year,
because you're leaving it in your adjusted base here for operating income gains, isn't it?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, it's in the adjusted base of it, but we're still doing clean-up. I mean, I'm not going to
make it a guidance number that I'll give every quarter, but I don't view it as a material headwind for us, no.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay. And then the final question is, of that $0.15 to $0.20, how much would you
characterize as really good visibility? Like, we know how much overhead we're cutting, we know that our marketing
dollars are going to – it sounds like the code here is that marketing dollars are going to be maybe flat, maybe even
down, in 2014.
<A - David A. Brearton>: I think as you look at the $0.15 to $0.20, it's going to be a combination of a few things.
Number one, we're growing revenue at around 4%, so that's a good start. We are fully pricing commodities and forex,
and so while that's not necessarily a margin increment, it gives us the opportunity to take more of that net productivity
to the bottom line. So we would expect gross margins to improve. And we've got good momentum on the overhead
programs that we started during the year this year. And we expect to see that continue into next year, and that's going to
be a big driver. So the drivers of the $0.15 to $0.20 in operating gains or the double-digit OI growth that we've talked
about are, in our view, pretty much within our control, and that's why we're fairly confident of them.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Oh, so I completely understand, the 4% organic sales growth includes pricing to cover
transactional currency. Is that right, or it does not?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yes, it does. So – and I think this past year all our revenue growth came from – pretty much
all of it – came from volume/mix. I think it'll be more balanced in 2014 because we're putting in pretty material price in
emerging markets and in the chocolate and dairy categories to recover product commodity and forex.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: But if the only purpose of that pricing is to offset the higher cost, isn't that, as you say,
neutral to operating income growth?
<A - David A. Brearton>: It would be neutral to operating income growth, other than it makes sure that our gross
margin is protected so the net productivity can drop – significantly more than net productivity can drop through. So it's
more a question of yes, there'll be some portion that is volume/mix, and that will drop through to OI, but probably more
important than that, it gives us more of the net productivity dropping through than the gross margin benefit.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay. Thank you, David.

<A - David A. Brearton>: Evening.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Can I ask, first of all, about China? We're a quarter on now. Are you done with the trade
inventory rationalization? Do you have any better visibility into when that business might start to stabilize?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah. I think the simple answer is yes, we're done with the inventory destocking. That all
came out – the end of that came out in the fourth quarter. And as we look at the start to the year, we would say the
business is on a pretty stable footing already. So we're feeling good about the business already. What we warned about
was more about how the comparisons look versus prior year. Last year, we had a very strong growth rate in the first
half, so the comps will look more difficult in the first half. And obviously we didn't have a terrific back half, so the
comps are going to look much easier in the back half. But in absolute dollar shipments and tons going out the door, I
think we're already at a pretty good run rate month over month.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Great. Thank you. And then coming back to free cash flow guidance, it looks as though – I
think you were talking about $1.4 billion, at least in 2014 when you did the math on the numbers that you shared
earlier. Why the slowdown? Is it just that you're taking off the improvement in the cash conversion cycle this year and
saying the underlying number is about that level?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Actually, I mean, the cash provided by operating activities, which is a combination of our
earnings and the cash conversion cycle, essentially, is the same. And we've said $4.1 billion plus because hopefully we
would be better than that. But we said that's – we're not taking our foot off the gas on the cash conversion cycle. The
reason it slows down at the bottom is because the CapEx – we've started spending about 4% of CapEx. We said we
were probably going to spend around 5% for the next two, three, four years. And in 2013 we're kind of halfway
between. We got up to 4.5%. We'll probably spend 5% of CapEx in 2014. So that's the biggest reason you see the
slowdown.
The other piece is restructuring spending, which basically is more skewed to 2014, less skewed to 2013. So there's a bit
of phasing there. But in aggregate, across the two years, we're actually spending a little bit less CapEx, and we're
spending the same amount of restructuring. So that's more of a phasing thing.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner from Wells Fargo.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Yeah. Irene or Dave, as you look at the landscape in China, we've seen some recent
news in terms of Hershey doing a deal, WhiteWave and Danone being involved with JVs. Is there anything in the
country, either with the change in leadership or otherwise, that maybe you think the environment for opportunity
strategically is changing, or that you can have some opportunities as well to kind of build more distribution in that
market going forward?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: We do see a great opportunity there, John, and we're continuing to invest as, we've talked
about. And we've got over a $1 billion business there to date. We just launched gum about a year ago. It's a sizeable,
$100 million business for us. And over time you will see us continue to invest in the country. So obviously, the
mechanism by which we choose to invest may vary from category to category and from company to company. But it is
a big growth opportunity for us, and as we see the biscuit category recover, we're quite confident that China will
continue to be a growth engine for us.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Great. Thanks, Irene.

<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good evening. Are you concerned that the inflation that some Latin American countries are
experienced, that that might ultimately crimp consumers' willingness to spend on the products that you sell and
therefore limits your pricing power in those countries?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think that's basically an Argentina/Venezuela thing. And I think, truthfully, even
last year, as I talked about earlier, the growth in those two countries that we got was basically through pricing and far
less through vol/mix. So, yes, consumers are trading down to lower-priced brands, and they are having to monitor their
cash carefully. So Argentina and Venezuela have been and continue to be difficult markets. I think it's truthfully not a
lot different today than it was a year or two ago on Venezuela. Argentina may have gotten a little bit worse. But we're
pretty experienced with dealing with those markets.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: So really no concern that your pricing power might diminish eventually?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I think it's not as much about consumers. I think consumers and most companies are pretty
used to how to do business in these countries. There may be regulatory issues. Last year, Argentina put in price controls
for a while, and that hurt us a bit. But then they loosened that up afterwards. Those are the kinds of things that tend to
cause a little more short-term issue, but it tends to be temporary. It's just the way those countries operate.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. And then just a housekeeping question. Can you share with us what you expect for interest
expense and shares outstanding for fiscal 2014?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I'm not going to give you a shares outstanding, although you can probably calculate
it. We did a $2.7 billion buyback last year, and we've said we would spend between $1 billion and $2 billion this year. I
think on interest expense, we've said that between interest and shares, we'd had an $0.11 to $0.13 benefit. The benefit is
roughly half and half between interest and shares. So interest will be lower, mostly because we did a little less debt and
we did the debt tenders and refinancing last year, which took down the cost of our long-term debt. So that'll come
down. I think on slide 17 of the presentation -
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Yeah.
<A - David A. Brearton>: I went through earlier identifies that.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. Thank you.
