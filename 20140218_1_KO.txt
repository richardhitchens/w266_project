Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. I want start off today by recognizing that many of you are attending
the CAGNY conference this week. Given the timing of our earnings call and the fact that I will also be presenting at
CAGNY this coming Friday, we will keep our prepared remarks a little bit shorter to ensure that we have adequate time
for your questions and that we can get you back into the conference.
With 2013 behind us, I am now looking forward to joining forces with our global system associates as we work to
restore momentum to our business in 2014. 2013 was clearly marked by ongoing persistent macroeconomic challenges
and our business was not immune to these pressures. Nevertheless, we delivered sound financial results and we grew
global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages for a 26th consecutive quarter. Our worldwide volume
grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year.
We delivered full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth of 6% after excluding the impact of
structural changes off of a comparable currency neutral ex-structural revenue growth of 3% for the full year. And we
delivered full year comparable currency neutral EPS growth of 8%, in line with our long-term growth targets. This
performance underscores our ability to generate sound financial results even in a challenging environment.
Our sparkling brands grew 1% in the full year, cycling 3% with brand Coca-Cola adding nearly 100 million unit cases.
In fact, all of our $1 billion sparkling brands, except for Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Light, grew in 2013 contributing more
than 140 million incremental cases in the full year. As of the end of 2013, we've gained core sparkling value share for
17 consecutive quarters. For the full year, our portfolio of still beverage brands contributed over 300 million
incremental cases or 5% growth while cycling 10% growth in the prior year. Importantly, we gained volume share and
value share for the year. Our tea volume grew 11% for the full year with solid performance across our entire tea
portfolio.
Juice and juice drinks grew 5% for the full year with strong performance by Minute Maid, Simply, Del Valle, Minute
Maid Pulpy, Rani and Innocent. We're proud of our robust portfolio of leading juice and juice drink brands. Sports
drinks grew 2% for the full year with Powerade continuing its solid and consistent growth performance. Packaged
water grew 5% for the full year as we focused on growing our premium water brands and on expanding our plant bottle
and Eco-Flex packaging.
While 2013 was an unusual and challenging year, it has certainly not deterred us from our commitment to our 2020
vision. Many economies around the world remained volatile in 2013. Developed markets are slowly starting to recover
from this turbulent time and consumer expenditures remain moderated. And emerging markets faced substantial
challenges as they dealt with fluctuating currencies and other structural issues. However, we remain optimistic and
excited about the future of our business and brands in emerging markets. After all, per capita consumption for our
brands remains relatively low in most emerging countries. That said, these emerging market conditions simply
reinforce our commitment to remain focused on our long-term strategies and to keep investing through these tough
times to ensure that we continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
In Europe, we saw a 1% volume decline for the year. However, we gained sparkling and still value share, and we were
pleased by improving volume performance in certain key markets. A better second half of the year helped our
Northwest Europe and Nordics business unit close 2013 with 1% volume growth while Germany continued to
outperform, delivering 6% volume growth for the quarter and 2% growth for the year.

Our successful Share a Coke campaign last summer contributed to full year trademark Coca-Cola volume growth of
1% in Northwest Europe and Nordics and 5% in Germany. We also launched Share a Coke in our Iberia business unit
in the fourth quarter of the past year and, as in other markets, the campaign has generated tremendous excitement,
contributing to strong double-digit immediate consumption growth and to trademark Coca-Cola growth of 2% in the
quarter.
Moving now to Eurasia and Africa, full-year volume grew 7%, cycling 10% in the prior year. And we grew volume and
value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages for the full year. All our business units delivered solid full-year
volume growth including double-digit volume growth in our Middle East and North Africa business unit. In Russia,
strong Olympic and Christmas campaigns activated across the country fueled double-digit growth in trademark
Coca-Cola for the full year and enabled us to gain core sparkling volume share while maintaining value share.
Fittingly, leading up to this Olympic year, our business achieved an all-time high market share for nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink beverages. We recently completed a successful Olympic Torch Relay, bringing the torch to thousands of
Russian towns and cities, and I was pleased to have an opportunity to host our customers and our bottling partners in
Sochi last week where I saw our best ever activation of an Olympic asset. Our local team and bottler are doing an
excellent job in Sochi.
Our Pacific Group grew 3% in the full year, cycling 7% in the prior year. We were pleased to see improving trends
across key markets including India, China and Japan as the year progressed. For the full year, our volume in Japan
grew 1% with Sprite, Minute Maid and Ayataka each growing by double-digits. China contributed 3% volume growth
for the full year, cycling 4% in 2012, and grew 5% in the fourth quarter.
We delivered balanced growth across sparkling and still beverages thanks to strong campaigns and a renewed focus on
execution. We're engaging teens and driving category excitement in China through campaigns like our Mini Me
Coca-Cola campaign, which contributed to double-digit immediate consumption growth in the fourth quarter, and our
popular Share a Coke campaign last summer.
And India cycled 16% full-year growth with a 4% volume increase in 2013, closing out the year with our 30th
consecutive quarter of volume growth. It is remarkable to think of the business that we have built in India over the last
two decades. In 2013 our system generated nearly $1.8 billion in revenue and we have four of the top five core
sparkling brands, the number one juice drink brand, a commanding nonalcoholic ready-to-drink share and so much
untapped opportunity still ahead.
Turning now to Latin America, we grew 1% for the full year, cycling 5% in the prior year. Argentina, Mexico and
Brazil all come to mind as we consider what worked for us and what was challenging in 2013 in Latin America. We
were pleased with our performance in Argentina where despite challenging economic conditions, our brands performed
well, resulting in 7% volume growth for the full-year. Sparkling was an important volume driver in Argentina with
Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta each growing mid to high single-digits.
Coca-Cola Life met our expectations and is playing a meaningful role as it is not just delivering incremental volume
but also enhancing the positive feelings that consumers have for Coca-Cola. We're excited about the potential of
Coca-Cola Life as it has shown great promise in bringing people back into the category. It's another example of how we
are working to be part of the solution to the obesity issue giving consumers a blend of sugar and natural zero-calorie
sweeteners.
Returning to our business in Argentina our still brands grew double-digits with strong performance in packaged water
with the launch of the Bonaqua Eco-Flex bottle as well as solid growth in juice and juice drinks and sports drinks.
In Mexico volume growth was even for the year with still beverage volume growth offset by sparkling. Despite a solid
start to 2013, we had a challenging second half of the year mostly due to severe weather. We continue to see
opportunity in Mexico where our strong brands, world-class execution and an improving economy bode well for the
future.

Our bottling partners have adjusted their pricing as a result of the newly implemented tax and we are closely
monitoring any further adjustments as needed. While we expect the change to adversely impact our volume in Mexico
in the short-term, it is too early to tell what the exact impact will be at this time.
I will wrap up my commentary on Latin America with an update on our business in Brazil where consumers have been
impacted by a slowing economy, rising prices and reduced disposable income. Full-year volume was down 2% due to a
disappointing 6% drop in the fourth quarter. Our local team, working closely with our bottling partners, have now
launched an upgraded affordability strategy enhancing our occasion brand price pack and channel architecture. We are
optimistic that this strategy together with our World Cup program will enable us to return to growth in Brazil in 2014.
Turning now to North America, we remain steadfast in our commitment to building long-term value in our flagship
market and a commitment that calls for building strong brands, creating customer value and enhancing our system
capability. Sandy Douglas is leading our North America business where we will again benefit from his strong customer
and strategic brand expertise. Adding Paul Mulligan and Irial Finan's disciplined focus on execution at the point-of-sale
will enable us to refine these strategies and to enhance their impact.
The combined experience and expertise of this leadership team and a joint accountability for driving value will ensure
that we are laser-focused on continued improvement of our overall performance in this important market. We will
therefore continue to assess and to evaluate the operating results in North America as an integrated business.
In October of 2010, we established a four to five-year timeframe to commence the refranchising of our bottling
operations in North America. 2014 is the fourth year, and as the North America operating model evolves, it will not
only streamline our focus, but it will also expedite refranchising to independent bottling partners. To date we've closed
on the first transaction of our twenty-first century beverage partnership model at the end of 2013, and we are very
encouraged with the seamless transition of the territory.
Looking ahead, we are well-aligned on the transition with the other four bottlers that we announced back in 2013. We
expect to reach agreements with those partners shortly, and for those transactions to begin closing later in the year that
we are in. We will also imminently announce new bottling partnerships whose ownership reflects the diversity of the
consumers and customers we proudly serve in North America. We expect North America to deliver consistent volume
revenue and transaction growth, with the balanced volume and price mix that you would expect from an industry
leader. We also firmly believe that the business will deliver consistent profitable growth over the long term. 2013 was a
challenging year in North America, and I'm not satisfied with our overall performance. Nevertheless, we gained volume
and value share while generating positive price mix of 1% across our portfolio, and positive price mix of 2% for our
sparkling brands. However, our volume was even versus prior year, and operating income fell short of our targets.
Sparkling beverage volume fell 2% largely due to softer Diet Coke volume. We have implemented a multifaceted
approach to address category headwinds and the various misperceptions that fuel them. This effort is targeting both
obesity and ingredient concerns and includes aggressive sweetener innovation, transparent consumer communications,
continued packaging evolution and new partnerships with credible third parties around the world, who will use
meaningful facts to defend and protect the sparkling category.
While we work to nurture our sparkling business back to growth, our still beverage business continues to perform well.
Still beverages grew 5% for the full-year as our diverse portfolio of still beverage brands continues to outperform the
competition. Thanks to continuous innovation and to growing brands like Powerade, Simply, Gold Peak and
smartwater, the fourth quarter marked the 15th consecutive quarter in which our still beverage portfolio gained or
maintained volume and value share in North America.
As we approach the midpoint of our 2020 vision, we remain fully committed to taking the necessary bold actions to
realize our vision. One such action is our recently announced global partnership with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.
This partnership is a real game-changing innovation in the nonalcoholic beverage category. Consumers are demanding
more beverage variety, functionality and convenience. And we believe Green Mountain is the perfect strategic partner
to collaborate with and to capitalize on the many transformative opportunities we see available in the marketplace.

Importantly for The Coca-Cola Company, with this exciting partnership, we're leveraging new technology to create a
transformative platform for consumers to enjoy our great brands through new consumption occasions and new
channels. By combining Coca-Cola's brand leadership and global footprint with Green Mountain's cutting-edge
technology and innovation capabilities, together we will capitalize on the many exciting opportunities in the
single-serve pod-based segment of the cold beverage industry as well as explore other future opportunities to
collaborate on the entire Keurig platform.
As evidenced by this recent announcement, our management team is constantly identifying and constantly evaluating
creative ways to formulate and fuel the power of partnerships that keep us at the forefront of consumer trends, driving
the dynamic global beverage industry. We are fortunate to participate in a global and resilient industry fueled by robust
long-term demographic trends. We are part of a great business system and unparalleled in its reach and its commitment
to invest, and we are the stewards of some of the world's most loved brands. But there's no doubt that the lingering
effects of the global recession in 2009 have created a challenging environment over the last few years.
In addition, obesity and ingredient concerns have raised some questions about growth in developed markets.
Throughout this time period, our company has consistently delivered on our profit objectives, and we will not allow
ourselves to become distracted or to make decisions focused on short-term gains. Instead we have thoroughly evaluated
what we need to do to accelerate sustainable growth, and we are acting with urgency and decisiveness. Historically we
know that when we invest in our brands, commit to near flawless execution and control what we know we can control,
we can accelerate our growth. With this in mind, we aligned on five strategic priorities to restore our momentum and to
keep us on the path to achieve our 2020 vision. These priorities focus on the growth drivers for our system, sparkling
beverages, still beverages and global system execution and on securing and strengthening the financial and human
capital necessary to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
Our five strategic system priorities to restore momentum are firstly, accelerate Sparkling growth led by Coca-Cola;
secondly, strategically expanding our profitable still portfolio; third, increasing media investments by maximizing
productivity; fourth, winning at the point-of-sale by unlocking the power of our system; and five, investing in our next
generation of leaders.
Let me just spend a few minutes providing some detail on each of these system priorities. First, we will accelerate
sparkling growth led by Coca-Cola. There is quite simply no other brand in the world like Coca-Cola, the world's most
universal beverage brand. We're fortunate to be its stewards. And indeed, in many markets around the world brand
Coca-Cola remains magical, but we need to work even harder to enhance the romance of the brand in every market
around the world.
Our global marketing community is laser focused on doing their best work while reallocating resources to the most
impactful campaigns and mediums. A good example of this great work is Share a Coke, which I have referenced
several times in my remarks earlier. Since the initial launch of Share a Coke in Australia back in 2011, we've now
executed the campaign in 21 other markets. This is much more than a marketing campaign. In fact, it's a system-wide,
collaborative effort to engage consumers in a meaningful and very authentic Coca-Cola way. Markets that have
launched Share a Coke have experienced increased household penetration, higher immediate consumption volume and
improved brand love scores as a direct result of this campaign. This is the kind of marketing that we love to invest in,
and we look forward to again sharing a Coke with millions of consumers around the world this year.
At the same time, we're working hard to empower our consumers. And we're making progress against our four
commitments to further contribute to healthier, happier and more active communities. To that end, we placed a special
emphasis on innovation efforts to enhance low or no calorie versions of our brands, as well as on supporting active,
healthy living programs all around the world.
Our second priority is to strategically expand our profitable still portfolio. We're the world's largest still beverage
company with $11 billion still brands and many more in the pipeline. We have shown in juices that when we approach
an objective and a goal systematically, aligning with our partners, planning from end to end, we win and we win big.
Today, The Coca-Cola Company is also the world's largest juice and juice drinks company, almost twice the size of our
closest competitor. We are the stewards of $4 billion juice and juice drink brands, and we are working diligently to

raise that number. We're bringing the same disciplined thinking to other categories, partnering across our systems and
across our supply chain to establish a scalable formula for value creation in new categories. This effort involves
re-examining every stage of a beverage's lifecycle and developing category specific plans that balance organic growth,
innovation and acquisitions.
Our third system priority is to increase media investments by maximizing productivity. We're in a business where great
marketing works, so we have committed to increasing our media spending behind our brands by up to $1 billion by
2016. We will fund this increased investment through a combination of supply chain optimization, systems
standardization, diligent resource and cost allocation, as well as improved utilization of our global marketing network.
This incremental productivity goal will further enable us to drive long-term profitable growth and momentum towards
realizing our 2020 vision. Gary will share further details about this new opportunity in a few moments.
Our fourth priority is to win at the point-of-sale by unlocking the power of our global system. Working together with
our bottling partners, we are continuously building capabilities and leveraging best practices to improve our execution.
In the last four years alone, our system has invested over $50 billion to enhance our competitive position in markets all
around the world. As you know, execution in the global marketplace is about doing many common things uncommonly
well and doing them in an aligned way across our great system. It is about presenting our brands in the right package, in
the right outlet, in the right channel, at the right price, cold, available and within an arm's reach of our consumers. This
is why we're calling 2014 the year of execution at the point-of-sale beginning with brand Coca-Cola.
Our final but perhaps more important priority is to continue to invest in our pipeline of leaders. There's nothing more
critical to our business than our people and we have to continue to hire the best, retain the best, train the best and
mentor the best. Our company and leadership must inspire our people to live our values of focusing on the market,
working smart, acting like owners and being passionate ambassadors for our company and for our brands.
As we look forward to 2014 and beyond, we remain very confident in our ability to drive our volume growth trajectory
back in line with our long-term growth model. The overall beverage industry remains healthy, generating both volume
and value growth. Our diverse portfolio of 17 billion-dollar brands combined with our unparalleled scale provides us
with many opportunities to accelerate market share gains. We have identified opportunities to significantly enhance our
productivity initiatives and we have made important commitments to increase our brand investments.
Consequently, we are no less enthusiastic about the future ahead of us and the beverage industry than when we
embarked on our 2020 vision back four years ago.
With that, let me turn the call over to Gary.
Gary P. Fayard
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar shared earlier, 2013 presented numerous challenges to our
industry and to our business and, as a result, our full-year volume growth was below our expectations. However, before
we put 2013 behind us, I wanted to reflect on a few items that I shared with you all at CAGNY last February.
Specifically, I talked about our unwavering focus on long-term value creation for our shareowners and apart from
competing in a great industry, there were three specific points I emphasized. First, we are focused on delivering value
creating volume growth and despite volume growth being below our expectations in 2013, we delivered full-year
operating income and EPS growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Secondly, our goal is to take volume share
and value share and although we fell short on volume, we again gained global value share in nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink beverages in 2013.
Lastly, I emphasized the critical role that the evolution of our franchise system plays in creating sustainable long-term
growth. Our company and our system made solid progress on this front throughout 2013. We sold 51% of our
Philippines bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA. Our four bottling partners in the Greater Tokyo area merged to
form Coca-Cola East Japan. Our seven bottling partners in Spain and Portugal merged and the integration of that model
is underway. We merged our company-owned bottling operations in Brazil with an independent local bottler to form

the second largest bottler in Brazil. And we also continued to advance the system of the future work in North America.
Having said that, let's quickly review a few key drivers of our financial performance this year. Unit case sales and
concentrate sales were in line on a consolidated basis in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our comparable
currency-neutral operating income was up 6% in the quarter and for the full year after excluding the impact of
structural items. Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share grew 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year, and
we generated $10.5 billion in cash from operations, which was down 1% primarily due to the impact of foreign
currency exchange rates, an increase in tax payments and the impact of the deconsolidation of bottling operations in the
Philippines and Brazil.
Now let me take a moment to update everyone on our productivity initiatives before I move to our outlook for 2014.
First, let me start by saying we've made significant progress on our previously announced productivity and
reinvestment programs. In fact, I am pleased to report that by the end of 2013, we have substantially accomplished the
objectives of the program and captured the savings associated with those objectives.
Secondly, as Muhtar mentioned earlier, we're expanding our previously announced productivity and reinvestment
program to drive an incremental $1 billion in productivity by 2016 that will be redirected primarily into increased
media investments. Our incremental productivity goal consists of two relatively equal components. First, expanded
savings through global supply chain optimization, data and information technology system standardization, and
resource and cost reallocation, which will be reinvested in global brand-building initiatives with an emphasis on
increased media spending. And also we'll be increasing the effectiveness of our marketing investments by transforming
our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer-facing marketing investments to
accelerate growth.
As we look ahead to 2014, let me take a minute to update you on a few outlook items as you model our business. After
considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of prior-year rates, we currently expect a currency
headwind at the operating income of approximately 10 points in the first quarter of 2014 and 7 points for the full year.
In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro and the yen, almost totally covered on sterling and also have
near-term coverage in place across several other major currencies. We anticipate that operating leverage on a
currency-neutral basis will be flat to slightly positive. We expect net interest income will contribute roughly equivalent
of $0.01 per share to our full-year 2014 earnings per share and will be evenly distributed throughout the year. We
expect the tax rate for 2014 to hold steady at approximately 23%.
With respect to structural items, we'll still be cycling the impact of some bottling divestitures during the first six
months of 2014. And even though these structural items will not have a significant impact on earnings per share, they
will result in a 1 point headwind in both net revenue and operating income for the full year. To be clear, our 2014
outlook for the impact of structural items does not include the potential impact of refranchising bottling assets in North
America related to our system of the future work. We will continue to provide updates as we move forward throughout
the year.
As for cash, as I've shared with you over the years, we utilize a very disciplined and consistent framework. First, we
reinvest in the business, which includes making the necessary investments to strengthen our brands to accelerate
growth. It also includes capital investments, which we expect to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year.
Second, we reward shareowners by paying a healthy dividend. We've increased our dividend every year for more than a
half-century, and we will recommend another increase in the dividend this year at our board meeting this week.
Next we evaluate opportunities to grow through acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures. We view these as
enablers to help accelerate growth when appropriate and where there is a need within our existing portfolio. And
finally, we've put what's left over into share repurchase. In 2014 we expect share repurchases to be in the range of $2.5
billion to $3 billion.
Although our 2014 outlook for net share repurchase is below 2013, I would remind everyone that our 2013 buybacks
represented a 15% increase from the prior-year and was partially funded by cash inflows related to bottling divestitures.
Also given the forecasted exchange headwinds in 2014, we believe this is the right approach and we will obviously

continue to update you as we move forward throughout the year.
In terms of quarterly saving, our first quarter in 2014 will have one less selling day and our fourth quarter will have one
additional selling day. In addition, we expect the impact of the Easter holiday to fully benefit the second quarter of
2014 and we'll be cycling the reversal of certain expenses related to long-term compensation in the first and second
quarters of 2014.
In closing, we continue to be focused on doing the right things for the health of our business and to ensure we can
deliver sustainable long-term growth to create value for our shareowners. I believe our company and our system are
well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities within our great industry. I look forward to seeing many of you at
CAGNY later this week and at CAGE in March.
Operator, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Good morning.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Can you guys just talk about sort of the outlook geography-by-geography? And then
maybe how the pace of growth is going to differ between volume and pricing given some of the big currency moves
and also obviously the tax in Mexico? And then I have a follow-up if I could.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Sure, Bill. Good morning. This is Muhtar. Let me just first just take a step back and just
say that in a way, we've had a speed bump. We know it would've come on our road to 2020. We dealt with
commodities in 2011 and 2012. Volatility in weather has become a norm. Uncertain economies, internal also execution
issues caused us to underperform versus our expectations in 2013. I'll start by saying that.
We have looked at everything. We've looked at our people, priorities, marketing spending and innovation. And we have
refreshed our plans with a simple but scaled up set of priorities on marketing our brands, system execution by our
franchisees and bottling partners and company-owned bottlers and on innovation of all kinds, business models like the
one the we recently announced with Green Mountain, brands, equipment, packaging, the lot.
Our long-term outlook is our performance algorithm which we have and will deliver going forward. And 2014 will be a
year of steady improvement as we get back up to speed. But make no mistake, our leadership team is confident,
accountable, our system will market well, we will sell well and we are going to achieve our 2020 vision.
Now let me just take you through a quick tour of the world and I'll ask Ahmet also to comment. Starting with Asia, I
think China is going to sustain its growth. India, in terms of its macroeconomic outlook and I think we will continue to
benefit from that. In India, I think there's elections coming up and usually when there are elections there's a little bit of
easing of fiscal discipline. I think that will play into a little bit of added disposable incomes.
In Southeast Asia certainly we've seen quite a lot of political turmoil especially in Thailand. I think that will, as we go
into 2014 my expectation is that, that will ease a little bit. Indonesia also there's an election coming up, but I think
Indonesia is certainly having some macroeconomic issues that will probably continue into 2014. And then Philippines,
I think we'll see a slightly improved outlook in the Philippines versus 2013.
In Japan, I think obviously everyone is looking very closely at the new policies of Prime Minister Abe's government.
There's a new tax coming up, we'll see how that impacts. But certainly, we all feel that our operating in Japan, feel that
there is some hope for a little bit of more inflation in the economy that will benefit also businesses like ours, although
recently the last economic numbers from Japan were a little bit below expectations. Africa, the youngest continent,

we're very well-positioned, and we feel that we will continue to grow well in the years to come in the African continent
and benefit from the also improvements in governance across the whole continent.
And in Eurasia, there's elections coming up in Turkey. Lots of, again, political issues in the Middle East will continue.
And Russia, I think all Russians can be very proud of the Olympics that are taking place, and I think that we will, as we
move forward and I was there in Russia looking at some of the great activations that we've had in our business, and I
think Russia, our business will continue to grow in Russia with all the investments that we're making with our bottling
partners.
Europe is a continued tale of two cities. If you take the Southern zone, I think the high unemployment and low growth
is going to continue, but it's not going to get worse. As far as Northern Europe, Britain is certainly ahead of all the other
economies in terms of the growth outlook, and I think Germany also is in that area. We will continue to benefit from
the robustness of policies in those two economies. And the rest of the continent is somewhat behind Germany and
England.
And in Latin America, again, 2014 is going to be a year leading into an election in 2015. We'll have also the benefit of
the World Cup and our biggest ever activation globally in the World Cup. And Southern Cone, Argentina, Chile, we
should continue to see the benefit of all the programs we have in place and also continued inflationary environment in
those two areas. And Mexico, I think, President Peña Nieto's programs are taking effect, all the reforms. Well, long
term, I think that is a benefit to our business, to the economy, to the people of Mexico, and again as I said in my
commentary, it's too early to say about the impact of the price increase we've had there.
So I hope that gives you a good tour of the world, and then finally in terms of our flagship market in the United States,
clearly the best right now, as far as we can see, the best western developed economy in the world. We think we will see
slightly improved mobility in the United States in 2014 versus 2013, and we hope that, that will also mean a little bit of
increased spending for consumer products as we go into 2014. And again, we will benefit from all the robustness in our
marketing programs and our increased expenditure and quality of marketing as we move into 2014 for our flagship
market.
Ahmet, do you want to add some commentary?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Yeah, I'll add a few things, I guess, to really compare some of these issues that have existed
even last year, how they're different now. So, for example emerging market currencies, when the first news on
discontinuation of tapering came out last year around May or June, there was a bit of a shock in emerging markets. We
see that over the last seven or eight months these emerging markets are sort of finding ways to deal with it. By no
means it's certain, by no means it's perfect, but it certainly feels a little bit more under control compared to when it first
came up. And the interest rate and things like that have been baked into those expectations. So I guess the message
there is countries and our business were finding ways to deal with that new reality of less liquidity coming out of the
United States.
I would just add, Muhtar, to your comment on Europe North-South divide, that is very much true, but we're sort of
beginning to see sort of different shades of gray in the South as well. There are some encouraging signs in Spain, sort
of less so in Italy at this point in time although there's a new prime minister there and we're hopeful with the new
programs to be announced if they are. And Eastern Europe, it continues to struggle in terms of consumer confidence
and economic. So, North continues to do well and South is even showing different performance now. The other point
that Muhtar mentioned is political uncertainty. It's another common thing to many of our emerging markets. They
eventually could impact the economic realities but, again, so far in countries like Turkey and Thailand it's been fine.
And let me, just in the interest of giving time to other questions, let me just stop it here.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Sandy. Do you want to add any commentary to North America? I think it's important to
say in North America that we believe in the North American market, we believe in the demographics, we believe this is
a growth market. We have grown in all but two quarters of the last 15 quarters in the United States. We believe we can
do better and we're intent and resolutely focused on achieving that. Sandy?

<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas>: Thanks, Muhtar. We have a great business in North America and our focus in
accelerating the business is on our brands, on our customers and on our capability. And I'm really happy to be working
with Irial and Paul and all of our U.S. bottlers. I think Irial and Paul bring a tremendous amount of selling and
executional energy that will help us build on our momentum. On my end, over the last six to seven weeks, Paul and I
have met with our major customers, we've met with our bottlers and we've gone through the brand plans in detail
looking at opportunities to focus and strengthen them and to move resources to emphasize advertising and brand
building on our largest brands.
And I think with the plan in place, our focus as a system, Irial, Paul, and I and our bottlers is to improve all aspects of
our execution whether it's marketing or sales or in the marketplace and we believe as a result of that that we will
improve steadily over time and we share the confidence that Muhtar expressed in the long-term health of North
America. It's a great market, it will grow and I think we can be confident about our long-term future there.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Thanks. All right, next?
Operator
And our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Hey, Bryan. Good morning.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just a follow up to Bill's question. I guess if we think about 2014 there's a lot of moving
parts with exchange rates and some of the volatility in emerging markets. Maybe, Gary, could you talk a little bit about
how we should think about currency neutral and also maybe sort of neutral of the effects of structural change? Are you
still looking at currency a neutral on algorithm year in operating profits? And also just some of the other major drivers
behind volume that might influence that? Cost of goods sold inflation, price mix, country mix, that sort of thing. I think
that would be helpful.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah, Bryan. Thanks. And let me see if I can go through all of those. So let me start at the top.
When you're the industry leader, you have to believe in rational pricing. And we believe we should get pricing for our
brands because our brands are worth it and we would expect to have positive price mix this year to go with the volume
that we'll have this year. When you look at commodities, they're fairly benign from what we're seeing for 2014 so not a
big deal. But, now let's take currency, among the worst we've seen in years and there's not a whole lot you can do about
it when all the emerging market currencies kind of melt down as they did earlier at the end of December, early January.
But with that said, let me be very clear. Ours is a growth business, is a business model that is built on growth and we
know that we cannot save our way to prosperity. We will have productivity but that productivity will be reinvested for
growth and while we are reinvesting for growth in our marketing, we will – we have – our goals are also in addition,
while we're increasing the marketing, we will also have a goal and is the goal for this year of hitting our long-term
growth models this year. So, we're going to significantly increase our marketing but at the same time the goal is we will
hit long-term growth model this year.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Thanks for that clarity, Gary, and look forward to seeing you guys Friday.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks. Just one quick follow-up to Gary's question and then a question for Muhtar – or
Gary's answer rather. Gary, does that include a Mexico impact in hitting your long-term algorithm in 2014? And then,

Muhtar, responding to Gary's question about ramping up the marketing, I guess, how do we view – there's a sense out
there in the market that given the headwinds for the category, that adding more marketing could be sort of pushing on a
string, so to speak. So what is it that you're seeing that says these headwinds that you're facing can be offset with higher
marketing? Thanks.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah, John, it's Gary. Thanks for the question. Well first, as Muhtar said in the prepared
remarks, it's too early to tell what's going to happen in Mexico. We have planned around Mexico of what we believe is
the most likely case. But we have a portfolio of brands that are marketed and sold across 200 countries and our job is to
manage that portfolio. So unless something unforeseen should happen, I think the answer has to be yes. It includes what
can happen in Mexico. If that changes we'll update you, obviously, but what will kind of – we're going on what we
believe would happened today.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: And I'll just add to Gary's answer and to the second part of your question, John. I'll just
tell you very simply that the Coca-Cola way is to grow our way to success. And we invest for growth together with our
bottling partners and we have the greatest system in the world and we have a tremendous amount of experience to say
that good marketing, good selling works for our business and it will work for our business. We have numerous cases to
prove that and we're going to continue to build on our marketing in both quantity and quality. This is a global increase
in marketing and in every country that we operate in, large or small, we know it works. And when we invest in
marketing, our global partners invest in feet on the street, in more coolers, in more trucks, in more lines and that's what
we see happening and that's what we will see, we believe, happening to our business as we restore steady momentum in
through 2014 and beyond.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning. Just a few questions, first, just on North America, Gary, the
profitability decline in the fourth quarter was pretty surprising. So maybe you could give us a little bit of color in terms
of the components of the profit decline in North America? And just broadly in North America from a profitability
perspective, the business hasn't really grown since the acquisition of the bottlers. So as you think about the next couple
of years thinking about the refranchising opportunities and all the productivity savings, are we at a point where we can
actually see growth in this business from a profitability perspective in 2014? Or is this more of a transition year still
with the investment that's going on?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Judy, it's Gary. Let me take the first part of that question on the fourth quarter profit. Operating
profit decline, it was down 12%, I think, in the fourth quarter. And by the way, I know the answer to this one
specifically because I asked the same question sometime back and got into the minute detail on it. And 100% of that
change is because of – it's all in OpEx or primarily all in OpEx and it's what we're cycling from 2012. There were some
incentive compensation, accrual reversals in the fourth quarter of 2012 that did not happen in 2013 and that cycling
caused a significant change in OpEx swing year-on-year in the fourth quarter only. And it's what's swung North
America to that 12% operating income loss.
So I think it's much more reasonable to actually look at North America, look at it for the full year and you'll get a better
picture of actual performance versus the fourth quarter. When you look at the full year, then you will see that is where
we've got some challenges, as Muhtar said, around volume and particularly in sparkling around diets and lights. But
that's what we're specifically on.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Just let me add to in terms of outlook, and that is that, as I said, we are confident about
and excited about first our performance algorithm worldwide, but also in terms of steady improvement as we get back
up to speed in the United States. And I think that that will, when we start restoring the momentum in the United States,
which we believe is going to happen, that will also bring the results and the financial results that we will be happier

with as we move into 2014 and beyond. It's going to take a while. This is not an immediate fix, but we know that it's
going to be a steady improvement.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: And just in terms of the media investments, is there any color you can give us in terms of the
breakdown by regions, by categories? Is North America likely to get a disproportionate amount in terms of the media
spending increase in 2014?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I can't give you the specifics on the geographic mix, Judy. But as we announced, it's
about $1 billion by 2016, and it is a global number. And again, there will be a good distribution, and we will be again
also looking and tracking through franchise leadership, resulting also system increase and investments in all the key
markets.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi. I also wanted to touch on profit in North America. It sounds like in 2013 you viewed
the profit challenges as more driven from a volume perspective. But given the diet soft drink where you seemed to be
more secular around longer-term health concerns, I'm just wondering if going forward you may manage more for
profitability and lean more on pricing than driving volume growth? Is there any change as you look at the algorithm
between pricing and volume and which metric you'll focus on going forward?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Thanks. Sandy, do you want to take the [inaudible] (56:22), and then Irial, if you want to
comment?
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas>: Yeah, I think the key to the North America growth algorithm is investing in our
brands and our feet on the street, and a key element to that is getting our pricing, so that we can have the revenue to be
able to reinvest in sustainable growth. Where we've had issues over the years in my experience in North America is
when we did not get the price we needed when our marketing execution was not what it needed to be, and therefore the
feet on the street started to get reduced and ultimately it hurt sustainable growth. Our plan going forward, and it's going
to take some time, and we're focused on improving it is to make sure that we get the price and that we execute the
marketing well and feed the feet on the street which creates the virtuous cycle in the United States just like it does
around the world. I mean, Irial you want to add to that?
<A - Irial Finan>: I guess the only comment I'd say, Muhtar already mentioned that we are an industry leader and
industry leaders have to set the tone in terms of price and in terms of how to market their brands in any given market.
And actually in less than 50 days into my new involvement in North America, I'm really excited about the future. I'm
excited about the enthusiasm and the passion of our people. Our job; mine, Paul's, Sandy's is really is to make sure that
excitement translates into performance and to results. And as Sandy said, it's not going to happen overnight, but I feel
we've already started on the journey. And over the next quarters and next couple of years, you will see very positive
momentum in our market in North America.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And then, Muhtar, post the investment in Green Mountain, I was just hoping to get
an update on how important overall acquisitions might play in meeting your 2020 vision goals? You mentioned the
focus on partnerships earlier in the call. I was hoping you could elaborate there, and if acquisitions are a greater priority
here, given some of the difficult macro conditions in a somewhat favorable environment with your healthy balance
sheet and still low rates here?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, look, nothing different than before, so no change. I think we're obviously very
excited with our new opportunities for consumption as will be brought to us by the partnership with Green Mountain
over time. I think the key is to fuel the power of partnerships. The Coca-Cola Company and system is an incredible

integration of power of partnerships in every respect, and therefore, this is yet another one. And so think about, if you
look at household consumption in particularly the Western markets, there's a tremendous opportunity to gain
incremental consumption occasions for our brands through these kinds of partnerships, and this is what the Green
Mountain partnership is all about.
When you look at how beverages are consumed at home, and when you look at trends in the next 10 years, people are
going to spend more time at home. They're going to work more from home. Home is going to be an even more
important place for people, for consumers, and I think we need to be present there with different technologies, different
packaging, different ways to serve our brand. And that's why this is important, and partnerships like these are going to
be important for us over time going forward. And so our thinking has not really evolved or changed in terms of bolt-on
acquisitions. If we see opportunities, we'll get them like Innocent, like Aujan and so forth. And we will continue to seek
new power of partnerships, to leverage new power of partnerships also going into the remaining part of our 2020 vision
for the next six years.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So I guess the frustration I'm hearing from many investors and a lot of questions on this call is it that
there's a feeling that the company isn't doing enough to change itself despite that the world around it has clearly
changed and many, like us, believe secularly. So there's continued emphasis on the Coca-Cola Way in history which is
respectable and volumes, market share, spending even more in marketing, blaming some short-term externalities, but
it's been a little while now that we've seen tough volumes, North America profit pool continues to shrink. There's only
$1 billion cost savings when some of your competitors are doing more at least on a pro-rata basis. There's limited
movement on re-franchising and health innovations so far.
So I guess might the company ever believe that it needs to focus on new levers of shareholder value creation, like
pricing up even more, lower promotion, massive cost-cutting, big portfolio or innovation change and indeed returning
more cash to shareholders? And I know there's lots there but should investors expect bigger, bolder change at KO to
meet this truly different world? And if so, what specifically should we look forward to? Just kind of share your
confidence about the story? Or should we just expect kind of the same status quo going forward?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: First, Ali, I disagree with you. I think we have a great portfolio of brands. We have a
great system, the best consumer products system in the world, and I believe that our programs will work and have
worked. We've significantly outperformed and grown since 2010. And, yes, we've had a speed bump, and certainly that
makes us even more focused and more resolute to continue on our road to 2020. And I think that we have, I will share
at CAGNY on Friday, the real reasons why we believe in our future, and so that's all I would say.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: But I don't disagree with you about the strength of the brands at all actually, Muhtar, and I don't
disagree with you about the strength of the system. I'm just looking at the results and I'm trying to figure out whether
enough is changing, enough is different, and whether you guys do actually view the world as different enough and so
you're taking action around it. I actually don't disagree with you [inaudible] (62:56).
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I understand, and I understand it's easy for people to have very short memories. But we
have the experience, and we know what we are doing. And we will continue to do what we believe. And we are
focused, and we will execute the best and we will achieve our 2020 vision. That's what this is all about. So that's what I
would say, and we have talked about pricing. You've heard my colleagues also talk about pricing, and I think we don't
want to repeat ourselves.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Ahmet Muhtar Kent
So thank you, Gary, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Jackson. We've delivered sound full-year financial results. We're
implementing the strategic actions that will enable us to restore momentum in 2014, and we see many reasons to
believe that we can accelerate our growth over time, achieve our long-term growth model targets and realize our 2020
vision.
Our global beverage industry is healthy, the trends that have historically fueled it continue to be strong and our global
systems commitment and reach are unparalleled. This commitment has never wavered and the strategic decisions that
we have made over recent years have not only enabled us to deliver solid financial results, they've also advanced our
competitive position, enhanced our capabilities and strengthened our resolve as a global system to achieve our 2020
vision. That is our promise to our investors, to our customers, to our consumers and the daily objective of the more than
700,000 associates of the Coca-Cola system all around the world. As always, we thank you for your interest, your
investment in our company and for joining us this morning.
