Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Welcome to our discussion of results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We appreciate the interest
of the people on the call.
As our press release notes, we reaffirm our FY 2017 guidance $11.85 to $12.35 adjusted EPS, based on our expectation
of an excellent fourth quarter, and despite the 30% year-over-year fuel cost increase in the third quarter. Going forward,
we will experience less volatility in earnings when fuel prices change rapidly, due to our new weekly versus monthly
fuel charge adjustment system that was implemented last month. Alan will cover this in greater detail. I should note,
given the interest in the subject, FedEx Ground segment margin will be 15%-plus in the current quarter, and Alan will
also comment further on this.
FedEx delivered an outstanding peak season with our highest volumes ever, and record service levels. I thank our team
members around the world for doing this. We believe strongly that our strategic investments to expand our global scope
and our portfolio of services will significantly increase long-term profits. During the third quarter, for example, FedEx
was pleased to extend our 16-year express air transportation relationship with the U.S. Postal Service, and we added to
our range of customer solutions with FedEx Fulfillment to benefit small and medium-sized businesses, and we reached
agreement with Walgreens to broaden convenient access to FedEx Services. Raj will provide additional context on
these. The integration of TNT Express is proceeding smoothly, and we are targeting operating income improvement at
the FedEx Express group of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017. Alan and Dave Bronczek will
offer additional information on this.
We reiterate our continued commitment to grow corporate earnings, margins, cash flows, and returns over the long
term. Recently, Fortune magazine recognized FedEx as one of the Best Companies to Work For, and World's Most
Admired Companies, a reflection of the commitment by more than 400,000 team members to our Purple Promise,
which simply states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Raj.
Rajesh Subramaniam
Thank you, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook, then discuss our performance and business
conditions in each segment including revenue, volume, and yield and provide some commentary on broader industry
trends and enhancements to the FedEx portfolio.
We see moderate growth in the global economy. We expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.3% in CY 2017, driven by robust
consumer spending and stronger business investment. Industrial production growth should rebound to 1.5% this year.

GDP and industrial production are expected to grow by 2.5% and 2.4% respectively in CY 2018. For the global
economy, we forecast growth of 2.6% for CY 2017 and 2.8% for CY 2018.
Now I will review revenue, volume and yields trends by segment. The U.S. Domestic Express Package revenue grew
3% year-over-year in Q3. Yield per package increased 3% as a result of increased weight per package, the dim divisor
change, and improved rate and discount. Yield excluding fuel surcharge increased 2%. Fiscal year 2017 Q3 had one
operating day less than Q3 last year which lowered the revenue growth and year-over-year comparison. Domestic
Express Package volume increased by 1% year-over-year during the quarter.
FedEx International Export Package revenue increased 4% year-over-year in Q3. FedEx International Priority volume
increased 5% while International Economy volume grew 2%. International Export Package yield increased 1%.
Excluding fuel and exchange rate impact, yields increased 2% primarily driven by impact of product and destination
mix.
The Ground segment revenue increased 6% year-over-year, while average daily volume increased 2% year-over-year.
Ground yield per package increased 6%, benefiting from the annual rate increase and yield improvement in both
Ground and SmartPost and the Ground dim divisor change. As has been mentioned before, FY 2017 Q3 also had one
operating day less than Q3 of last year.
Fuel prices did not have a material impact on yield per package. FedEx Freight segment revenue increased 3%
year-over-year in Q3. Average daily shipments are flat year-over-year, and this is partially driven by our stronger
emphasis on pricing improvement. Revenue per LTL shipment increased 4%. Excluding the impact of fuel surcharge
revenue, the revenue per LTL shipment was up 2%.
The third quarter included most of the 2016 peak holiday season. This year's peak was a record breaking both in
volume but most importantly service. We are proud of more than 400,000 team members around the world who came
together to provide record service levels this past holiday. With volume that more than doubled our daily average on
multiple days, all of our year round preparation paid off and our networks performed as designed to meet the surge in
demand.
Once again, volume during this season was impacted by the continued growth of e-commerce. The retail and e-tail
industry and consumer shopping patterns continue to evolve. We had record volumes over the peak season, although
we had a few large customers who had volumes below their peak forecasts. We are already well into our planning for
peak 2017 to ensure we are ready to meet our customers' needs in a profitable manner. Retail industry is being
transformed by e-commerce and FedEx is at the forefront of innovating and implementing solutions up and down the
value chain that make e-commerce convenient and accessible to consumers around the world.
In this context, we made some significant enhancements to the FedEx portfolio during the quarter. Let me highlight a
couple of them. First, we recently announced a long-term alliance agreement with Walgreens for FedEx Onsite. FedEx
Onsite is a nationwide network of alternate delivery locations which is a direct response to our customers telling us
they want access to more choices for package delivery and drop-off. FedEx Onsite locations include some Albertsons
and Kroger grocery stores as well as select Office Depot, OfficeMax and FedEx authorized ship centers. Adding
Walgreens will dramatically increase the number of FedEx Onsite locations. Walgreens is an ideal partner. They're a
well respected brand with whom we've had a long relationship and are well known for their convenient locations. We
already started the rollout and expect nearly 8,000 Walgreens locations with FedEx Onsite in time for this year's peak
season.
Second, we also announced the launch of FedEx Fulfillment in February. This is an e-commerce logistics solution for
small and medium sized businesses. The strength of the FedEx portfolio allowed us to bring to market a fulfillment
solution with advanced warehouse management, the latest same day cut-off times, two day Ground shipping throughout
the United States, and a seamless return process. FedEx Fulfillment also improves our accuracy through top tier
warehouse management systems and experts in fulfillment. We have received strong customer interest over the first
few weeks since launch, especially with small and medium sized customers who are in need of a powerful and
attractive alternative to competitive e-tail logistics and fulfillment options.

I'll now turn the call over to Alan Graf.
Alan B. Graf Jr.
Thank you, Raj. Well done for your rookie performance. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope your NCAA brackets are
holding up better than mine and all your favorite college teams are winning.
Looking at FedEx Corporation third quarter results, the net impact of fuel, one fewer operating day at Express and
Ground, and Ground expansion costs weighed significantly on earnings. A bright spot was yield growth at all our
transportation segments, as we continue to improve our revenue quality and manage yields.
Three things you should know about fuel: first, yes, fuel prices increased 30% year-over-year for the quarter. Second,
year-over-year, we had a benefit from net fuel in Q3 last year, and a loss from net fuel this year. And, thirdly, last
month, as Fred mentioned, we began adjusting our fuel surcharge weekly instead of monthly for both Express and
Ground. This should better match volatility of our fuel expenses to our surcharge. With that change, fuel will not
impact our future results as much as it did in the past, though we will not fully lap those year-over-year impacts until
February of 2018.
Our effective tax rate of 37.5% for the quarter was 230 basis points higher than last year, and was also a drag. The
higher tax rate in FY 2017 are due to costs incurred in connection with the integration of TNT Express as well as local
country losses in some entities within TNT for which no tax benefit was recognized due to uncertainty for the
utilization of these losses. This impact has been partially offset by the continuing benefit to the tax rate from last year's
early adoption of the accounting standards update for share-based payments. During the next three years, however, the
benefits of the TNT Express integration, fleet modernization, yield management, e-commerce growth, and investments
in network capabilities and efficiency will drive significant earnings growth. For the full year, we are reaffirming our
guidance for adjusted earnings of $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share assuming moderate economic growth as Raj
discussed.
Earnings in Q4 will primarily be driven by growth in volume and yield at Express and Ground, as well as the inclusion
of TNT Express. As Fred mentioned, we expect Ground segment operating margin to be 15%-plus for the quarter. We
expect our effective tax rate to fall from Q3 to Q4, and our FY 2017 effective tax rate should be about 35% prior to
year-end mark to market accounting. Our capital spending forecast for FY 2017 is approximately $300 million lower at
$5.3 billion due to reduced spending forecast at FedEx Ground.
For the year, we have made contributions totaling $2 billion to our tax qualified U.S. domestic pension plans, which is
$1.5 billion more than what is required, partially funded by the $1.2 billion debt offering we issued in January. We do
not expect to make any further contributions to these pension plans during this fiscal year. We anticipate our U.S.
pension plans will make benefit payments aggregating in excess of $1 billion in the fourth quarter to former employees
who elected to receive their benefits early under a voluntary program. This payout will allow us to reduce future
liabilities and administrative costs associated with our U.S. pension plans. Our U.S. pension plans continue to have
ample funds to meet expected benefit payments.
At Ground, operating income declined 8% year-over-year because of higher rent, depreciation, and staffing as a result
of network expansion, unfavorable net fuel impact and one fewer operating day. Ground's FY 2017 CapEx forecast is
reduced from $2 billion to $1.7 billion, much of which is timing the projects that are already under way.
We continue our intense focus on balancing capacity and volume growth with yield management at Ground. These
actions affected our Q3 volume results and are also expected to mute Q4 volume growth. While network expansion
dampens Ground's near-term profitability, we believe these investments will enhance long-term earnings, margins and
cash flow.
At Freight, higher salaries, wages and information technology expenses reduced operating income. As with Ground, we
are working toward a better balance of volume, pricing, and capacity. Those efforts along with an expected
improvement in the U.S. industrial environment, should lead to better operating results at FedEx Freight in coming

quarters.
Express adjusted operating income was significantly impacted year-over-year by the unfavorable net impact of fuel and
one fewer operating day. On a GAAP basis, Express results included $31 million of TNT Express integration expenses
for the quarter. Express results benefited from higher yields and volumes, and we continue to manage network capacity
to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize our fleet, and increase productivity.
At TNT, revenues were approximately $1.8 billion, with an adjusted operating profit of $40 million. Adjusted operating
margin was 2.2%. Adjustments to operating income for Q3 included TNT Express integration and restructuring
expenses of $22 million, as well as intangible asset amortization of $16 million.
With respect to the TNT integration, and you will hear more on this shortly from Dave, we continue to have a great
degree of confidence in the TNT acquisition and the value to the enterprise. We have a very long history of success in
integrating businesses into FedEx, and TNT is no exception, as the integration is going extremely well.
In the nine months following close, we learned a great deal more about the TNT business. The business we acquired
was severely under-invested particularly in IT and in operations, which is driving additional investments.
Furthermore, prior to the acquisition, TNT announced a restructuring program with numerous initiatives to improve the
business. Over the fall, we executed a strategic assessment to optimize capital and expense across the base FedEx,
Express and TNT businesses, the TNT restructuring program, and the integration activities. The result is a more
streamlined set of projects and initiatives that deliver the greatest benefits.
We believe that the combination of the businesses is more than just an integration of the businesses, and we are
positioning ourselves to leverage combined businesses in a very powerful way. We see the combination of these two
businesses as transformative and expect significant synergies from the integration.
As the integration progresses, businesses are combined and countries are fully integrated, discrete financial information
about the legacy business will no longer exist on a comparable basis. So beginning in FY 2018, we intend to eliminate
the TNT segment, and to begin reporting FedEx Express group results in one segment, FedEx Express segment.
Given these plan changes, we will begin describing our target for the TNT integration benefits along with
improvements in the base business, in terms of the FedEx Express group operating income. We are targeting operating
income improvement at the FedEx Express group of between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion in FY 2020, versus our final
FY 2017 adjusted results, assuming moderate economic growth as well as current accounting and tax rules.
Based on this target and current tax rules, we expect to lower our pre-mark to market effective tax rate to around 33%
to 34%, with the completion of the integration. The pace of the integration activities in FY 2017 combined with
preparations for FY 2018 is dictating higher levels of dedicated integration personnel, training for our teams,
professional fees to support the integration as well as for investments in IT and operations.
As a result, we are increasing this year's forecast for integration and restructuring related spending by $50 million to
$300 million, an acceleration previously planned for later in the four-year integration plan. We expect the aggregate
integration expense over the four years to be approximately $800 million. The actual timing and amounts of these
integration-related estimates are subject to change, as we implement and adjust our plans.
The integration is complex, and the timing and pace of the integration is subject to change, based on numerous factors
and dependencies. However, how we ultimately get to our target will evolve as market conditions and other factors
change. We are highly confident in our target and our goals for the Express group.
And now Dave will give you an update on our progress with the TNT integration.

The TNT acquisition as I'm sure you know is the largest in FedEx's history, and we have discussed this with you
previously. This provides extensive benefits to FedEx including rapidly accelerating our European and global growth
around the world, substantially enhancing our global footprint and leveraging TNT's lower cost road networks in
Europe, Middle East and Asia, producing improved results for the entire corporation.
Our global integration teams are working to bring TNT and its 54,000 employees and their operations across 200
countries and more than 1 million shipments daily into the FedEx Express system. The integration of TNT and FedEx
is on track, with significant progress thus far in fiscal 2017. Our teams around the world are energized. They're focused
on delivering the opportunities and the benefits that's provided by this combination.
The integration plan that was developed prior to the close of the deal has been fully validated, and did not require
significant revision, which has given us tremendous momentum, as we moved into the execution phase. While we have
a multi-year integration ahead of us, my comments will give you some additional context on why we are so confident
in the value of this deal, and the status of our progress to date, which has gone extremely well.
On the people side, our leadership team is now all in place. We continue to benefit from the expertise of TNT's
personnel. More than 35% of our integration international officer positions are now held by former TNT executives.
We have an outstanding leadership team in place, to drive our integration. And as Alan and Fred have already talked
about, the integration is a key driver to FedEx Express' FY 2020 operating income improvement target of between $1.2
billion and $1.5 billion.
The benefits of the integration will be driven by four key areas; the first being, optimizing pickup and delivery
operations. We are implementing new technology and optimizing the location of all of our facilities and all of our
stations to deliver unmatched service. We will benefit from efficiencies, improved stop density and the economies of
scale that come along with the integration of pickup and delivery operations.
Next, we will operate one integrated global express network, capitalizing on technology and solutions to most
efficiently route parcels and freight through our integrated hub, linehaul, and of course our intercontinental air network,
to deliver the absolute best service for our combined customers, while at the same time significantly dropping our costs.
Third, we will improve the efficiency of staff functions with improved IT solutions, streamlining support functions, and
realizing significant sourcing savings globally. And last but certainly not least, we will grow revenue by offering a
best-in-class portfolio of services through a single sales team, a single online customer-facing tool, and through revenue
management activities focused on improving market share, yield, and, of course, profitability.
As you all know, these are network businesses and require the combination of our pickup and delivery operations at a
local level, our air and ground networks, and our extensive operational sales and back-office IT systems. Given all the
factors, we continue to expect the full integration to take four years to complete from the date of the acquisition, which
was last May.
Now, on the integration of the two businesses, we generally have concluded at a country level there's different
integration models. And we have identified the planning process. Those integration models are what we call
direct-serve to direct-serve. It's FedEx to TNT. Or a global service partner at FedEx to a global service partner at TNT
or to one or the other. Using these models, however, to date, we have successfully integrated 33 countries around the
world already. Beyond these 33 countries, other country integrations are underway, including three that we launched
during this third quarter: Spain, Japan, United Arab Emirates. Our integration in the United States and Canada which
started in the first quarter of FY 2017 will in fact be complete by May 31.
In total, we have approximately 50 countries in process or completed to this point. In addition to representing different
integration models, the countries completed to-date are well established markets, with high-value opportunities, and
from them we're learning very valuable lessons. While the integration activities are most visible at the country level,
the integration is supported by several key back-office initiatives, mainly by our IT functions around the world. One of
these and a foundational element is the success of the integration of our two companies, and the ability for us to handle
TNT packages inside FedEx, and FedEx packages inside TNT. This cross-scan technology we are deploying will
significantly benefit our customers, and, of course, all of our employees. This first phase of technology was launched

February 27.
Now, as we look to the fourth quarter, in April, we will begin a phase conversion of the intercontinental flights
currently operated by ASL Belgium to FedEx Express operations. The first phase will convert the TNT transatlantic
flight and over time, the wide-body operations between Asia and Europe. These changes bring benefits to
approximately 100,000 existing TNT customers for shipping to the United States and to Canada, with improved transit
times and a broader service coverage.
And beyond the air network changes, country-level integration preparation and executions are in full swing. As we are
preparing for our FY 2018 launch of integrated activities, we're adding 25 more countries. So as you can tell, we have a
complex and multi-year integration ahead of us, but we are off to a very strong, fast, productive, and extremely
important for us team collaboration going forward.
So with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Mickey for opening up for Q&A.
Mickey Foster
Okay, we're going to take two questions first from questions that were submitted before, and then we'll take two live
questions. Fred?
Q&A
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: All right, Mickey, let's start off with a question about capital. A, will CapEx as a
percentage of sales come down by the end of this decade or will it remain elevated beyond 2020? Any specifics would
be appreciated. That's from Amit Mehrotra, Deutsche Bank.
And, B, what will be your biggest requirements for capital over the next five years? As a percentage of revenue, do you
expect your capital budgets to be less, the same, or more than will be this year? Matthew Troy, Wells Fargo. Alan will
take this.
<A - Alan B. Graf Jr.>: The biggest requirement for capital over the next five years will remain re-fleeting at Express.
We have a current pace that we have right now, and you can see in our stat book how that pace continues. So I think
over time, we will start to see post-FY 2018 CapEx as a percentage of revenue will begin to decline. TNT's not nearly
as capital intensive as Express is, although we are investing a lot in the integration, as you saw in my opening remarks.
We've accelerated a lot of these costs into 2017 and we'll bring some of 2019 into 2018 because we're being so
successful as Dave so eloquently described. There are a couple wildcards in what I'm saying here. One is if we can
somehow get approval for 33-foot twins, those have a ridiculously fast payback and we will begin to re-fleet our
linehaul Ground operations as rapidly as we can. Those are not in my projections. And then secondarily, if there is a
expensing of capital as part of the tax code, we're likely to accelerate our capital spending as well, because we get
significantly improved returns on essentially the interest-free loan from the government by being able to expense at day
one.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. The next question from the Internet is, how do you drive better forecasting
from customers? Can you incentivize them to provide a more accurate forecast, or penalize them for overpromising
deliveries? Helane Becker of Cowen. Raj?
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: Yes, as I mentioned before, planning is well underway for the peak 2017 to ensure we
provide outstanding service for our customers and we continue to work with our customers year round to prepare for
peak. Now it's important to remember that it's a relatively small number of customers that drive the bulk of surge in
demand at peak, and we work closely with each of them to ensure the highest possible level of accuracy on their
forecast. But do keep in mind that forecasting e-commerce volumes at peak is an inexact science at best. With all that
being said, we're looking at several pricing options to ensure that we get a reasonable return on investments that we are
making.

<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay, now we'll take some live questions.
Operator
Thank you. FedEx would like to invite you questions via email. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first
question from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on the earlier
CapEx question, but sort of honing in on Ground specifically. So it seems fair to say that with elevated spending at
Ground over the last few years, along with the pretty meaningful ramp in CapEx that UPS recently announced, that
volume growth has become more expensive. So really, my question is, are the investments that you're currently making
to improve efficiencies and margins solving today's problems? And then if we look out another three to five years,
assume customer demand will continue to evolve, could you find yourself in a similar situation whereby you need to
continue to invest to solve tomorrow's issues? So really has e-commerce led to a structural increase in the capital
intensity of the Ground business, in your view? Thanks.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Allison, this is Henry Maier. Well, first of all, I think we get an awful lot of flexibility out of
these highly automated projects that we've deployed the last couple years. In fact, today we operate roughly 100 fully
automated facilities, that includes hubs, that includes automated satellites. And we have a lot of incremental capacity
built into those buildings just by virtue of the fact that the technology not only allows us to operate those buildings
more per day. We get better productivity out of them. They require about a 30% less head count to operate, and the
automation of the operation allows us to flex that capacity across the network depending upon where the volume shows
up. So we've invested in capacity today through our CapEx spend that's going to allow us the ability to flex up and
down based on volume for some time. In terms of just network planning in general, we have a five-year plan. It's a
rolling five-year plan. We adjust the number of projects up or down based on trends we see in the business. I would say
that other than the items that Alan mentioned, probably the biggest thing out of our control right now with respect to
our CapEx spend is the timing of the projects. We had three major hubs this year delayed due to weather. We had a
land acquisition that was delayed because we discovered some historic artifacts on it. So through the due diligence
process, we're going to have to comply with the state laws with regard to finding those kind of things. So I think we're
in good shape today and in the future. I don't feel like we're in the catch-up mode we've been in the last couple years,
and I'm going to throw this back to Alan. He wants to make a comment here at the end too.
<A - Alan B. Graf Jr.>: Allison, a couple more points. Vast majority of the volume that we carry at FedEx
Corporation is business to business. And while e-commerce is the fastest growing piece, it's the smallest piece. And
secondarily, as we've discussed many times and we can discuss ad infinitum, we can't afford the same capital intensity
for peak e-commerce volume which is why we have been backing away from some customers and raising our prices
significantly so that balancing act will continue for us going forward.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Good afternoon, guys. I wanted to follow up on Ground a little bit and sort of the CapEx
relative to capacity utilization. So we're trimming $300 million off of this year. I think Alan it sounded like that was a
bit of a pull-forward. Are we lowering the Ground spend going forward? Want to get a sense of maybe how your
trajectory might look beyond fiscal 2017 and then just thinking about sort of the fiscal fourth quarter outlook, your
ability to sort of fill up that underutilized capacity that you invested in earlier this year, how that's kind of ramping up
through the fourth quarter. Thank you.
<A - Alan B. Graf Jr.>: Well, I think you can expect that our CapEx spend will decline over time. The size of the
projects that we're bringing on I think well position us for the future. In terms of capacity, we generally buy – we
acquire land for what we believe is the end state for the facility, but we don't build to a future need, which gives us the

ability to expand those facilities over time as business conditions warrant. A great example of that is next year, we have
one new hub coming online, which is in Houston, and we have two hub expansion projects, which are at existing hubs,
one being in Champaign, Illinois, and the other in northern Kentucky. So we don't really – I don't want to give you the
perception here that we have unused capacity. We really don't. Once we get the facility in place, we just engineer the
ability to expand it over some number of years as it reaches full phase in its life.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay, now we'll do two questions here, Fred.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay, there are a couple of additional ones on Ground. I think I'm going to segue
right into that, since they follow on what Henry's been talking about, and then there's one on Freight. This is a question
about what percentage of SmartPost volumes can be redirected into Ground by end of 2018. Any targets you can share
in terms of potential margin impact this could have would be appreciated. Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank.
And then a related question from David Ross of Stifel is, are you having any problems getting contractors? Henry.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Okay, on the first question I think we got to keep in mind here that the mission is improving
delivery density and revenue per stop. And we're getting some software delivered in this summer. We call it Terminator
internally. It's part of a delivery optimization project that allows us to virtually divert packages in the network from
SmartPost to Ground that have the same address on the same day. But you got to keep in mind here that there's also an
opportunity with adjacent deliveries and the ability to build density through the expansion of our retail Onsite network
which is the Walgreens deal that we did a couple months ago that Raj referred to. So there's a number of moving parts
here that get us to where we believe we need to be. We do have an internal number, but we've decided that we're going
to keep it internal for this time.
In terms of Ground businesses and the trouble in finding contractors, you might be surprised to know that the actual
number of businesses under contract has declined over time. And that's been the result of two things, one, the size of
these businesses is getting larger. And, two, our transition to a single, independent service provider contract
nationwide. Currently, we contract with roughly 6,000 small businesses that collectively employ over 60,000
employees. And we have seen no indication that these businesses are having any trouble attracting drivers either on the
linehaul side or on the pickup and delivery side, and we just came through a record peak season, and they performed
admirably in terms of being able to get the necessary resources to handle the volume.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So we have a question or two on Freight. You mentioned on the last call the
investments being made at FedEx Freight. Is that why the margin has compressed a bit? Can you talk about the
investments being made and how they should set FedEx apart from the competition? That's from David Ross of Stifel.
And what investment is the firm, meaning Freight, making in natural gas tractors? And do you think over the next few
years that these alternative sources will reduce fuel expenses at FedEx Freight? That's from Keith Schoonmaker of
Morningstar. Mike Ducker?
<A - Michael L. Ducker>: Okay, thank you, David. Yes, somewhat, that is partial reason for the margin compression.
There are a number of different areas we're investing in, number one safety systems. 80% of our fleet today has the
most recent safety features available on the fleet. We will be 100% complete by the end of 2018. We're investing in
customer automation systems, line haul optimization systems, and replacing some legacy systems, as well as new
dimensioning technology. All of those investments are really aimed at our goal of double-digit margin, and improving
the customer experience. So hope that answers your question.
Secondly, Keith, we have the signature facility in Oklahoma City, with 100 CNG trucks operating today. We opened
that facility in October. So, it's somewhat dependent on the difference in CNG pricing and diesel pricing, so it's really
too early to tell the long-term impacts of that. But we're monitoring that closely, and looking at investing in these newer
kinds of technology, and really the whole corporation, or FedEx Freight Corporation, is embracing the new
technologies available to us.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Let me make an editorial comment based on what Mike said about our reaching 80%
of our FedEx Freight having these new modern technologies in the tractors. Similarly, Ground has been providing

incentives, and soon all of our independent service providers will be required to have these same types of technologies,
and quite frankly, the Department of Transportation and the Congress should mandate these technologies.
It is simply unacceptable to have vehicles on the road that don't have these modern technologies, that can prevent so
many accidents that take place historically because of the inability to stop in time, or to change lanes precipitously, and
so forth. So every truckload carrier in the United States, every LTL carrier, Ground parcel, it should all be mandated,
and we're trying as hard as we can to push this technology into every vehicle we have, as fast as we possibly can do it.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay, let's take a couple of live questions.
Operator
Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah, good afternoon. I wanted to – appreciate the new information and the update on
TNT. There's a lot of good information to work with. And it's great to hear about the strong progress there. I was
wondering if you could help us understand maybe the new framework of the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion versus the prior
framework of $750 million. How much of an increase is there versus the prior $750 million? Obviously it's a different
categorization. It sounds like it's an expansion on the $750 million that you think there's more there at TNT stand-alone,
but I don't know if you could parse that out on a comparable basis and give us a sense of that. Thank you.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Okay. Thank you. This is Dave Bronczek. Then I'll turn it over to David Cunningham. Let
me start off by saying what Alan said earlier. We decided and it's in the best interest of our company to just look at it
holistically starting June 1, so we're not going to break out TNT and FedEx Express into the future. And the
combination of TNT and FedEx Express, the synergies of it all are what we've actually presented to you now.
So looking at our business and our business model and our strategic outlook combined with TNT and what we see and
what we've seen before, and putting it all together, these are the numbers that we've now come up with. And so because
of all the hard work and because of all the teams that have been working on this for almost a year now, we're confident
to give you these new numbers. So David?
<A - David L. Cunningham, Jr.>: Just a couple of quick questions and thanks. We've got a lot of moving parts in this
equation. You've got two base businesses, you've got integration. You've got fleet changes. And so what we tried to do
is give you the ability and us the ability to measure our progress in very clear terms between now and then. So that's
what this target is, and that it incorporates the synergies that we identified earlier.
<A - Alan B. Graf Jr.>: Tom, it's Alan. It's also everything else we're doing in Express. So there are unbelievable
things going on at Domestic Express, things that have nothing to do with TNT in terms of productivity. We continue to
deploy automation and IT solutions everywhere that are increasing our cost performance, and so I can't see the $750
million anymore, is really the issue. And I might have been able to see it a little bit longer, but we've done such a good
job with speeding up the integration that became very clear so rather than wait till June, we just thought we'd deliver
this news now so you'll know what to expect.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Hey, good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. Alan or Fred, I guess as I
look at the outlook here, if margins are improving at Ground from where we are today and you get the Express
improvement as you've laid out and we appreciate that guidance as well, sounds like you're going to have more free
cash flow, although I'm not sure that we heard a commitment that CapEx will stay flat from here. But I'm thinking more
strategically at the board level, Fred, is there any impetus or change in strategy that says we need to start compensating
people on the long-term plans not just on EPS growth but also look at free cash conversion or return on invested

capital?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: It's funny you should ask that. I just requested several months ago another look at
whether we should put an ROIC component into our LTI, which Judy Edge, who heads up our corporate HR and
strategic finance headed up by Bob Henning just did a Cracker Jack report, and we will show this to our board of
directors either at the next meeting or the June meeting. I can't remember which. But bottom line is, our current
correlation between EPS and shareholder return is so close, it's approaching 95%. And the dangers of perverse
incentives of putting things like that on automatic pilot are so great that we don't think that it makes sense.
Now, having said that, for those of you who have been here or listened to what we've said over the last year and a half,
let me say it again. I don't think that FedEx Corporation CapEx in absolute dollars is going to vary too much for the
foreseeable future. We want to put these new modern airplanes in. We see an opportunity to continue to grow our
Ground business, the Freight 2020 initiative that Mike said.
But with the numbers that we gave you today, it just reinforces what we've been saying that margins, cash flows and
returns are going to increase over the next several years. So there should be an increase in free cash flow unless we do
some other corporate development activity, or as Alan mentioned to you, there's expensing in the new tax bill, or we
got 33-foot trailers, which is a huge improvement in national productivity and safety, as we've been arguing over and
over again. That might change it a little bit, but I don't think you're going to see the CapEx materially change in the
next few years. It's just too lucrative to us, and our position does nothing but strengthen competitively by continuing to
do this. But we will be throwing off more free cash flow in the years to come as a result of these projections, or
outlooks that Alan gave to you, particularly based on these TNT synergies.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you delve in a little bit to B2C versus B2B growth in
Ground in the quarter just to give us a feel of how each of those performed versus past peak, and then a little
commentary on what you would think for Ground volume going forward? Thanks very much.
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: Let me kick it off and then I'll turn it over to Henry. This is Raj. We do not break out
our commercial and residential volume growth numbers. Although what I can tell you is that we did see higher growth
rates in our residential delivery volume driven by e-commerce.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, I would say without breaking out our Ground and sorry, commercial and residential
volumes, our commercial volume has been very strong and have been for the last three quarters or so. I think – I'm
pretty bullish on where we are from here, but you need to understand that we're going to continue to balance yield and
volume going forward as Alan and others have said here. And other than that, I think you can continue to see us make
good progress in this area.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay, I think we'll do a couple more questions, Fred.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. On the United States Postal Service, what would be the implications for
FedEx and the industry if the USPS reform actually passes into law? As written, it seems to broadly support the USPS
financially, which could lead to greater competition, but also higher capacity for SmartPost and other products. That's
from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan.
And what are the implications for the extended FedEx and USPS day-sort contract with Express, also from Brian.
So let me break this into two parts. First, let me ask Christine Richards to comment on the legislation that's being
considered by the Congress, and then I'll get her to revert it back to me, and either Dave Bronczek or I or one of us will
comment about the other two aspects of this question.

<A - Christine P. Richards>: Hello. The implications of this legislation passing would be positive, and we strongly
support the Postal Reform bill that passed out of the House oversight committee last week. As you may know, the
unique pre-funding requirements imposed on the Postal Service with respect to the costs of their retiree health requires
them to pre-fund those obligations, and they have failed to make the payments for several years now. It's time for
legislation to address this situation, and provide stability to one of our largest customers, and also a very important
vendor for us.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So let me just talk about in the broadest terms here, obviously our daytime system is
a great asset of FedEx. It's terrific for the Postal Service. It provides a wonderful service for their Priority Mail. It
allows us to transport on the same airplane our 2Day Express and our IE traffic to and from international points as
required. So I think you will continue to see us put a lot of emphasis in these areas. In the case of SmartPost overall, I
think it's important that people that follow this industry to again recognize that there is no entity that has the delivery
density of the United States Postal Service. Henry knows these numbers better than I, but it's something like 155
million deliveries they make every day. I think it's 120 million residential, and 30 – what is it? 125 million out of the
155 million are residential deliveries. They have mostly these small vehicles delivering mail, which pays for these
routes.
The Postal Service's overall revenues are three-quarters mail, one-quarter package, and the packages commingled with
the mail has proven to be a very great thing for the e-commerce industry and for the Postal Service.
The real question is, what happens over time as mail is diverted to digital transmission, as opposed to physical delivery,
which lowers the revenue per stop, and what implications that has on the package business? There's this constant
refrain about the Postal Service as, "a competitor", as in this question. The biggest part of the Postal Service's package
delivery business is Parcel Select. That's where you have upstream providers pick up, transport, and insert into the
Postal Service packages for last-mile delivery by the Postal Service. That's our SmartPost. FedEx Ground every day, or
every operating day, injects into approximately 22,000 Postal DDUs, as they call them, direct delivery units for
last-mile delivery. It's a wonderful agreement.
We do all the upstream, these enormous hubs and operate these twin trailers which again would be much better if they
were 33 versus 28. And our SmartPost, UPS's version of this, UPS's SurePost and Amazon's direct injection into the
Postal Service is the vast majority of the Postal Service's Parcel Select business.
The next biggest cohort is postal pickup, transport, and delivery of Priority Mail, most of which is transported by air by
FedEx Express. Then there's some other segments there, First-Class Mail – Package or whatever it is, that's sub 1
pound. It's like the samplers you get and this, that and the other. That's the postal package business. There are some
other ones but there's this constant refrain of, well, the Postal Service is a competitor.
The Postal Service is our good partner in most cases. There's some overlap there, but if you don't define the market
clearly, you don't understand what these logistic systems are, and what they are not. And that's what's led to a lot of this
mythology out there that people that only see the delivery end of it, and not everything that's upstream.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay, we'll take some more live questions.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good afternoon. So I just want to confirm on your 4Q targets, you reiterated
your full-year target, if I look at that, it's [ph] 379 to 429 (58:50) to make your range. You noted a 15% Ground margin.
Can you put some other parameters on there? It seemed like Ground volume slowed down to just over 2%. Can you
talk about – are you still pushing away volumes there? Can you talk about your kind of outlook and what's in that
fourth quarter number? Thanks.

<A - Alan B. Graf Jr.>: Well, I probably shouldn't have given you the dang bonus about Ground's fourth quarter
margins. So, that'll be the last time I do that. I think the point was is that we didn't have the financial quarter in Q3 that
we had expected, but we had a lot of reasons why that won't repeat.
Notably, some of our largest customers at Ground did not hit their forecast, yet we provided capacity for that that went
unused. We had one less operating day. I don't know what you have in your model for that. Fuel, as I described, was a
big change that will probably reverse itself in Q4. And then the tax rate. So it's more steady as she goes, and if I were
you guys I'd forget Q3. Look at everything else we said.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: But more importantly what you need to do is look at what Alan told you last June.
What was the range you gave last June, Alan?
<A - Alan B. Graf Jr.>: It was the same range except it was 10% lower on the bottom.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, that says everything you need to know.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for the time. So just a quick question here, kind of referencing
back to UPS's Analyst Day and their decision to initiate Saturday Ground operations in the U.S. this year on a rolling
basis. What sort of impact do you think that could have on your own Ground business? And would there be any need to
make some changes to your own operating days during the week in response? Thank you.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Well, Jack, thanks for the question. You should know that we have been operating on
Saturdays at FedEx Ground for going on 17 or 18 years now, and operating six days a week is absolutely nothing new
to us. In fact, every year at peak, at least for the past 10 years or so, we've operated six days a week, sometimes seven,
every day from Cyber Monday through Christmas Eve. And our highly automated facilities give us the capability to do
this.
Now given the growth of e-commerce, we thought some time ago that if retail customers could ship six days a week in
December, they might like to do that 12 months out of the year. So couple of years ago, we actually put together a
concept where we began offering six-day delivery in select markets. Now, in addition to the obvious customer benefits
to this you should know that there are some pretty significant operational benefits to operating six days a week
year-round as well.
What we've learned from all of this and what we continue to learn through these pilots is in order to get the full benefit
of a six-day operation, e-commerce companies must fulfill and release volume over the weekend in time for sortation
and delivery on a Monday.
If they are able to do that, then you can hit a home run, because you significantly advance volume in the network that
would have been due for Tuesday. As customers adjust their operations to fulfill and ship on weekends, and do it year
round, I can assure you we are ready to take their business.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Fred?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Yeah. Okay, we have another question off the Internet. This is about Amazon.
Amazon's interest in delivery has evolved rapidly from, this is a quote, not from me, from cute photo ops of drones to
now registering as an ocean and air forwarder, to most recently announcing plans for a $1.5 billion air hub not far from
your largest competitors.
As Amazon's posturing has become more aggressive and larger in scale, have your thoughts changed on their potential
impact on the industry and how you interact with them as a customer/competitor? Matthew Troy, Wells Fargo. Raj?

<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: Thank you, Matthew. Let me just say that Amazon is a long-standing customer of ours
and while Amazon does deliver a portion of their packages, they still rely heavily on USPS, UPS and FedEx for
delivery. And it's definitely worth mentioning that no single customer represents more than 3% of our total revenue,
and Amazon is far from being our largest customer.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: I think there's one more point to make here, and that was Alan's comment a few
minutes ago: The vast majority of FedEx business is business to business. 85%-plus of our business has nothing to do
with e-commerce. So Amazon's a wonderful company and they certainly have revolutionized the e-commerce world,
and we're not sure what Amazon's going to do one way or another.
But the FedEx system that consists of thousands of facilities and the ability to pick up, transport, and deliver in one to
two business days between any two addresses in the United States has been decades in the making. And we think that
we have a not great risk of being disrupted, to use the term. And we obviously, as Raj and Dave Bronczek and others,
are putting a lot of effort into making sure that there is no opportunity for somebody to disrupt us on a substantial scale.
So I think, again, people focus on the e-commerce, because everybody looks at this from their mobile phone forward
where the real story is everything behind the mobile phone, and that's what FedEx has in enormous quantities,
airplanes, trucks, facilities, team members. So hopefully that answers your question.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay, now we'll take live questions.
Operator
Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks, afternoon. So, Alan, just wanted to ask you, just going back to the full-year
guidance, so you're keeping the range. Does that suggest that you think the midpoint is possible? Or would you – you
think we should be better off at the lower end of the range? And then just separately, do you have a thought on Ground
margins for next year? Do you think we'll see year-over-year margin improvement at Ground in fiscal 2018?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: I'm sorry, we didn't understand that question. Come on, goodness gracious, we've
answered this question about as clearly as we can. We're not going to give you any more specificity on the range. If
we'd wanted to do that, we would have been specific in the target. And I think we've answered the question on Ground.
We're very confident in Ground's earnings here. Alan?
<A - Alan B. Graf Jr.>: I don't know where to begin. The range is the range because we have a lot of moving parts
and this is a big, complicated company. And what we do is very hard to do, I might add, and I'm so proud of our team
that does this every day, that kind of goes back to the question that Fred just answered before. It is very hard to do. It's
very capital-intensive. There are so many things that go on around the world. I quit giving quarterly ranges, because I
could never hit them. So I think we'll just let it stand for where we are, and we'll talk about Ground's margins in FY
2018 in June.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: And Scott, let me give you one example here of just what we're talking about. I
happened to be in New York last Monday giving a talk for Fortune magazine. A snowstorm hit, which I unfortunately
was out in. I don't know what that snowstorm cost FedEx with the size and scope of our operations, but it certainly cost
us a significant amount of money at Ground, Freight, and Express. So whatever it is, that's why we have a range,
because stuff happens. Now, if volumes are a bit stronger than we think in the fourth quarter, it won't make any
difference. We'll be at the top end if the range. If volumes aren't quite as strong, then that snowstorm may push us
within the range some other place. So it's very difficult for us to be any more specific, and I think, as I mentioned a
moment ago, for a company of this size, $60 billion, for the CFO a year ago June to tell you that we were going to have
a range, and we now reconfirmed 10 months later, even I'm in awe of that. I think it's just remarkable with our financial
planning folks and the great systems that Alan and Bob Henning and the operating companies to put it together, I mean,
this is really something to watch, that we're able to tell you, with the degree of specificity that we do tell you.

And we'll take our next question from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: Yeah, thanks for fitting me in here. So I know the Fulfillment business is pretty new here, but
I was hoping you could just take a step back, maybe give us the pitch that you use when you go in and try to convince a
customer to use your Fulfillment Service over something like Amazon's. And early on, what do you think is resonating
there?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, this is Henry Maier. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: It's Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Okay, how are you doing?
<Q - Bascome Majors>: All right.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Let me give you a couple updates here. First of all, the company that was formerly known as
GENCO was rebranded to FedEx Supply Chain in the quarter. And we launched FedEx Fulfillment which I think you
need to look at as an all in one logistics solution for e-commerce companies, but primarily targeted at small and
medium sized e-commerce companies, some of which are startups. Let me just put a little bit of color around this. You
really need to have somewhere between 50 and 2,000 shipments a day to fit into this.
And the reason why that range is necessary is because in order for this to work, you've got to have the ability to keep
your inventory in at least one, but potentially two, of these warehouses that are run by FedEx Supply Chain. The reason
why that's important is, is that we've cited those fulfillment centers in such a way as we can reach 94% of the
population out of two of them, in two days or less.
And I'll let you – I mean, it should be obvious to you why that's a big deal. The pitch is simply this, FedEx Fulfillment's
a one-stop shop for warehousing, fulfillment, order management, inventory and transportation management, and
reverse logistics, which allows these small to medium sized customers to really focus on their business, which is selling
things online. It is not a marketplace.
However, since these folks may be selling on their own market, on their own website, it gives them the ability for them
to have visibility to their inventory as they could potentially sell across some of the 90 or so marketplaces that exist out
there. It's highly customizable in the sense that you can – we will actually ship your product in your own branded
carton, which is really important, because there are now companies that don't allow to fulfill through certain fulfillment
operations if it's going to show up in that company's branded box.
They also do gift wrapping as part of this, so something that's really important for some of these smaller facilities. It's
also integrated with FedEx CrossBorder, which gives them the ability to sell internationally, which is a big deal for
these small customers. Because generally the first thing they find out is, is once they get online and get their product on
one of these marketplaces, orders come in from parts of the world they didn't expect. I will tell you that we're really
grateful for the customer interest we've had in this to-date because it's far surpassed any of our expectations. Hope that
answers your question.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Again, let me stress what Henry just said here to make sure the point is there, this
lets the merchant sell on any marketplace. So, if they want to sell on Amazon, that's great. If they want to sell on
Walmart, who's very aggressive trying to attract marketplace customers, if they want to sell on eBay, if they want to
sell on Alibaba, JD.com, as Henry said, there are 90 of these marketplaces. Now, obviously Amazon in this country is
the biggest, so that is the advantage that they get all of the centralized support that Henry gave to you, but they can sell
in any or all of the channels that they find most useful for their product and merchandise.

And we'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Dave, a question for
you on the integration plan with the TNT Liège hub. Are you guys planning to keep that as part of the network? And as
you guys work to integrate that, can you talk a little bit about how your international capacity, your sort of transatlantic,
transpacific capacity is going to be growing over the next couple years?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks for the question. Yes, Liège, Belgium. I was just there two months ago with my
colleague Rob Carter. And I have to tell you, they've done a great job there. We're putting in new technology into the
automation, into the hub there. We're starting – you probably saw the press release already come out, we have a 777
that starts in April that comes out of Liège, comes to Memphis, goes to Seattle, goes to Asia. It's going to be fantastic.
In every way, we actually improve our service and our cutoffs and deliveries. So the answer to your question
specifically is, yes. I'm proud of the management team in Liège. They've done a great job at transitioning from an old
facility to a new one. It's critical to our success there. It goes alongside of our Cologne hub and our CDG hub. So we'll
operate all three hubs there. It's very effective for us to have all three hub operations in Europe.

And we'll take our next question from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Amit Mehrotra>: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. The question is, on the operating income target at
Express, just wondering if you can provide any cadence of that improvement over the next three years and some color
on what, if any, revenue synergies are included in that number. It just seems like there's an enormous opportunity to
increase penetration with the European multinational corporations, given the enhanced presence in Europe. So if you
could just talk about that or talk to that and what's assumed related to that in the new Express profit plan. Thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, we agree. There's a lot of opportunity and we're not going to give you the
cadence of it at this point in time, because that would be in tantamount to giving you our forecast, which Alan does in
June. David Bronczek?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yes, let me add to what Fred said. I can tell you that you're right, and I said it in my
comments. The sales organization in Europe is highly motivated. They're extremely excited to be part of the FedEx
global sales organization, and the marketing team. So I think that you're going to see us become a little bit more
aggressive, as I mentioned before, in filling up our 777s coming out of Liège and the operations in Europe. I think
there's going to be more synergies between the volumes, between TNT of the past and FedEx in Europe, including
helping our yields, including helping our profitability, but also fundamentally growing our volume and growing our
revenue. No question about it.

And that concludes our questions and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers
