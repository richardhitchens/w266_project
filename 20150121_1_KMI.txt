MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the
presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded.
If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. You may begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Sharon, and welcome to the investor call.
As usual we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. I'll make some introductory remarks. Steve Kean, our Chief Operating Officer, will talk more about operations
and our backlog. Kim Dang, our CFO, will review the numbers for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. And Dax
Sanders, our Vice President of Corporate Development, will talk about an acquisition that we just announced this
afternoon.
And let me just start by summarizing very briefly that acquisition. We think it's a very exciting and strategic acquisition
that we announced by separate release this afternoon. We're acquiring Hiland Partners, which is a large, privately
owned midstream company with crude transportation and gathering assets and gas gathering and processing assets,
primarily in the tier one sweet spot acreage of the Bakken formation. It's overwhelmingly fee based and it gives us the
platform for further growth in the Bakken where we currently have no asset. We think we can do in the Bakken the

kind of expansion that we did on our Kinder Morgan crude and condensate system down here in the Eagle Ford which
has grown from less than 50,000 barrels a day throughput to having virtually all of its 300,000 barrel per day capacity
contracted for in future deliveries.
So think of what we're doing as building a spider web that we intend to expand over the coming months and years. The
consideration for the purchase is $3 billion, including approximately $1 billion of assumed debt. We have a bridge loan
commitment to finance the remainder, and longer term we will finance that remainder with equity and debt to maintain
our appropriate level of debt to EBITDA ratio previously communicated to both the rating agencies and to our equity
investors. The transaction will be modestly accretive to DCF per share in 2015 and 2016 with the accretion ramping up
thereafter. And it's supported by long-term contracts with the system's largest shippers. That's an overview and Dax
will give you more details in just a few minutes.
Now let me get back to 2014 and the outlook for 2015. As you know we closed the merger of all the Kinder Morgan
entities into KMI during the fourth quarter, and so that made for somewhat of a noisy quarter, post-closing. But bottom
line, our DCF per share for the quarter was $0.60 and we've declared a dividend of $0.45. That leaves excess coverage
for the quarter of $320 million.
Looking at the $0.45 dividend, that's a 10% increase to the fourth quarter of 2013. It means that we will have
distributed dividends for the full year 2014 of $1.74 per share versus $1.60 in 2013 and $1.72 in our plan. Now we
were negatively impacted, to a certain extent, in the quarter by lower commodity prices, primarily in our CO2 segment.
But we were still able to produce strong results and in my judgment that shows that our toll-road-like assets performed
well even when prices for underlying commodities are extremely volatile.
Now looking to the future, we said when we announced the merger of all the Kinder Morgan entities back in August of
2014 that we expected to be able to declare a dividend of $2 for calendar year 2015, to grow that dividend at a
compound annual rate of 10% out through 2020 and to have more than $2 billion of excess coverage over that period
from 2015 through 2020. We're still comfortable with the first two projections and we're still comfortable that we will
have substantial excess coverage but I have to admit it's hard to ascertain exactly what that amount will be given the
recent volatility in commodity prices.
But as an example in an effort to be as transparent as possible, let's just take a look at 2015. When we released the
outlook in December of 2014 for the year 2015, we based it on $70 oil and $3.80 gas. That's what we assumed when
we did our budget back in the fall of 2014 and represented the forward curves at that time.
We projected $2 declared dividend for 2015, that's up 15% from $1.74 in 2014, and we said we would have "over $500
million" of coverage. As we refined our budget, the actual coverage number in our budget is much greater. It's $654
million to be precise, at those prices that I just mentioned. Now in this world of lower commodity prices we've looked
closely at the impact on our excess cash and found it to be about $10 million per $1 change in crude price, and that's
about $7 million in our CO2 segment that you heard us mention time and time again, pretty consistent from year to year
and about $3 million throughout all of our other business segments in the company.
In addition, we think we have sensitivity of about $3 million for each $0.10 change in natural gas prices. Now like
everyone, we're unable to predict exactly where the prices will be for 2015 but you can make your own estimate and
see that almost under any circumstances we have substantial excess coverage and I think relatively little sensitivity
compared to a company that will produce about $8 billion in earnings before DD&A.
Now in an effort to be even more transparent and without predicting prices at all, let me just take you through an
example. Let's say you want to take our outlook and say, I believe we're going to have an average of $50 WTI crude
price this year and an average $3.20 on Henry Hub natural gas price. What would that do to this $654 million of excess
coverage on top of the $2 dividend? You'd start with the crude and you'd say, crude is going down by $20 per barrel.
Our sensitivity is $10 million per $1. Therefore that's a $200 million degradation.
On the natural gas side, if we went from $3.80 to $3.20 that's a $0.60 degradation which would be six times $3 million
or $18 million. That gets you to a total of $218 million. You take that off the $654 million and you got $436 million of
excess coverage still there over and above paying a $2 dividend.

Now let me be real clear. There's obviously a myriad of factors beyond price that influence the accomplishment of any
annual plan. But I would emphasize that the commodity sensitivities that I just outlined do not, do not include the
positive impact of cost reductions in our CO2 EOR operations which we're working on and believe will happen and
would certainly happen back in 2008 and 2009 – the last time we had a dramatic change in crude oil prices to the
negative. So hopefully that gives you some guidance. And rather than us trying to redo numbers, you can do your own
figuring of the outlook we gave you back in December. But the bottom line message from me would be that we still
have excess coverage. And you can roll that forward to other years and talk about exactly where the excess coverage is
and it gets even more difficult, obviously, the further out you go because who knows where the prices will be then. But
I think the main thing is this kind of toll road structure that we have allows us to survive and prosper very nicely even
in a low commodity price environment.
Now when I'm finished, Steve is going to detail our current backlog of projects which remain very strong. And this
backlog is to me a clear indicator of future growth in cash flow at KMI.
Now let me close my part of the presentation by addressing succession planning at Kinder Morgan. I've said publicly
for some time that our Kinder Morgan succession plan called for Steve Kean to succeed me as CEO with me continuing
as Executive Chairman. We now expect that change will take effect on June 1, 2015. Let me make a few points for you.
First of all, I can assure you this is not going to change in any way the way the company is being run. Secondly, my
name is on the door and I don't plan to go anywhere. The office of the Chair will still consist of Steve, Kim, and
myself. And post June 1st, I'll still be involved in all major decisions including acquisitions and expansion projects.
I want to also assure you I have never sold a share of my KMI stock and I don't intend to do so in the future. So to kind
of sum that area up, as we say in Texas, I plan to die with my boots on. But more importantly Steve, Kim, and the rest
of the management team, are doing a really outstanding job now and I can assure you they'll continue to do so in the
future and that this company will continue to grow and meet its commitments to its shareholders, its customers, and its
employees.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
All right. Thanks, Rich.
And briefly I want say I'm honored to have the opportunity particularly coming from Rich who is one of the best and
most accomplished CEOs in America, who by the way still has his boots on. I'm also ready and committed and
determined to do my part here. So I'm excited by the opportunity but there's no reason for any of you to be. As Rich
said, you can count on his active involvement and you can count on Kim and me, the leadership team here and our
11,000 co-workers to run this great network of assets safely, profitably and reliably every day and to continue to grow
the company. So this will be the most seamless transition in the history of corporate America.
So now let's do the quarter, backlog first and then a segment update. On the backlog, since our investor conference in
January of 2014, we've grown our backlog by nearly $2.8 billion. Our current backlog stands at $17.6 billion, which is
down slightly from the last quarter. Over the quarter, we added $1.24 billion of projects while we put into service $730
million worth of projects for a net addition of about $500 million. But the impact of lower commodity prices led us to
re-examine our CO2 investments, and we removed from the backlog a little under $800 million for the quarter and the
majority of that came out of the backlog for the CO2 segment.
The additions to the backlog were in our pipelines and terminals businesses. The largest being the addition of the
Palmetto refined products pipeline serving the Southeast U.S. That project includes the pipeline. It also includes an
upstream expansion of the Plantation pipeline system and associated terminal investments in a total to our share
assuming others opt in for their shares would be about $800 million. Now the additions to the terminals and pipelines
backlog underscore the continued strong demand for our midstream energy infrastructure.

Now a brief segment review and I'm going to focus on the performance on a full year basis compared to 2013. In gas,
earnings before DD&A were up $352 million or 9% year-over-year to $4.069 billion. The gas segment benefited from a
full year of the assets that we acquired from Copano including some growth in those assets as well as strong
performance from our Tennessee and El Paso systems.
We continue to see strong demand for long-term firm natural gas transportation capacity. So even in this fourth quarter
that we just went through we added another 242 million cubic feet a day of long-term transportation commitments with
an average term of 12.8 years. So if you look at the total going back to December of 2013, since that time, over that 13
months, we've added 6.7 Bcf of new and pending commitments with an average term length of 17 years. That's about
18% of the capacity of the underlying pipeline system those commitments are associated with. We expect the demand
to continue as I think we're still at the beginning of what will ultimately be needed, both for power generation and
industrial and petchem load.
We're also seeing improvements in storage opportunities I think first in the current market but also in terms of the
long-term commitments. We got a firm long-term commitment of 3 Bcf of storage on our Texas Intrastate system by an
LNG customer during the quarter. And I think all of this, on the transport and storage side, points to continued
optimism about the overall value of our gas network.
CO2 segment earnings before DD&A were up $26 million or 2%, but looking at the fourth quarter on a year-over-year
basis, the segment was down 6%. So clearly, we faced deteriorating commodity prices in the fourth quarter but
operationally we saw record years at SACROC which was up 8% year-over-year and was averaging 35,500 barrels a
day in the fourth quarter and record CO2 volumes and NGL production.
Yates was down slightly 2% year-over-year. And although Katz and Goldsmith are up on a full year basis, both
continue to perform below plan. But in total, oil production is up due to the outperformance at SACROC which is our
biggest field.
As I said, we've reduced our backlog in the segment. While we continue to have many good investment opportunities
here, we'll lay some of those out at the conference, we've delayed plans on various new developments, including the St.
Johns field and associated pipeline infrastructure with that development.
Turning to products. Segment earnings before DD&A on a full year basis were up $76 million or 10%, with strong
year-over-year growth on KMCC and SFPP more than offsetting a decline in our transmix business. Some key
operational developments in this segment are improved, refined products volumes and a ramp-up in crude and
condensate volume on KMCC. All refined product volumes, gasoline, diesel and jet, were up in 2014 versus 2013,
including Plantation gasoline volumes were up 4.4% for the full year, versus 1.5 without Plantation and 1.1 for the EIA.
Much of the full year difference is due to Plantation therefore, but in the fourth quarter we saw gasoline volumes on
SFPP, our West Coast system, up 4.4% year-over-year in what we believe is a sign of economic improvement in the
markets we serve and also in part perhaps the beginning of a demand response to lower prices.
From a project standpoint and products, we are experiencing a further delay in our Houston Channel splitter project on
the KMCC system. We now expect March of 2015 in service. On the other hand, our various build-outs of the KMCC
system are going very well with several of them coming in ahead of schedule and/or under budget, and I already
mentioned Palmetto which had a successful open season in the fourth quarter and was added to the backlog.
In Terminals, segment earnings before DD&A for the year were up $181 million or 23%. The growth was split roughly
two-thirds/one-third in favor of organic growth versus growth from acquisitions. We continued to see strong
performance in our Gulf Coast Liquids business and benefited from the expansions coming online in Edmonton and the
Houston Ship Channel, primarily.
During the quarter, we brought on line phase two of Edmonton, two crude by rail facilities and our liquids terminal
expansion for Methanex at Geismar, Louisiana. In this segment, we continue to see strong demand for liquid storage
and handling, again, particularly in Edmonton and Houston. And nearly all of our $2.1 billion backlog in this segment
consists of expansions of our liquids facilities and again on the Gulf Coast and in Alberta.

On Canada, segment earnings here were down $17 million year-over-year. That was really a result of FX; otherwise the
segment had a good year. But the main story continues to be our progress on the $5.4 billion expansion of Trans
Mountain. That expansion's under long-term contracts, as you'll remember, they've been approved by the NEB. We
filed our Facilities Application December of 2013, and we're working through that process under a schedule that calls
for a decision in January of 2016, and we expect an in-service date late in the third quarter of 2018.
We continue to make good progress in our consultation processes. We also recently completed some important, though
controversial, testing at Burnaby Mountain in Greater Vancouver and that will enable us to minimize impacts on local
residents for the last few kilometers of our build.
So that's it for the segment update in the projects. And with that, turn it over to Kim.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay.
So turning to the attached page numbers to the press release, the first page is our GAAP income statement. As Rich
said, it was a bit of a noisy quarter given the closing of the transaction about two-thirds of the way through the quarter,
and we've got a number of certain items that are littered through the GAAP income statement.
So I'm going to turn to the second page which is where we have these items delineated so that you can see them
individually and also is our calculation of distributable cash flow for KMI. Now this is a new format for KMI.
Previously at KMI, we used the financial metric cash available for dividend. We've now converted KMI to the DCF
formula we previously used for KMP and EPB, which is net income plus DD&A including our share of joint venture
DD&A plus book taxes minus cash taxes minus sustaining CapEx, including our share of JV sustaining CapEx, plus or
minus some other small adjustments. This formula will work for all the periods presented, even those prior to the
consolidation transaction, because KMI consolidates KMP and EPB, so net income at KMI includes 100% of the
earnings for all three companies.
For periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, we subtract from our DCF formula the declared distributions we made
to KMP and EPB public unitholders, resulting in a number for DCF that is equal to what we previously reported as
KMI's cash available to pay dividends. For the fourth quarter, there will not be distributions made to KMP and EPB
unitholders because the transaction closed before the fourth quarter record day. So there will be no MLP distributions
to subtract. However, the KMI shares that we issued in November will receive the full KMI fourth quarter dividend. So
in our average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter, we show the newly issued shares as outstanding for the entire
fourth quarter.
So with that explanation of the overall format and the new format, let me take you through a couple of numbers. This is
the format that we expect to continue to use going forward.
So DCF before certain items in the fourth quarter was $1.278 billion. That's up $796 million. You can see that the
2.133 billion shares outstanding again include the newly issued shares for the entire fourth quarter to get us to $0.60 of
DCF per share available versus the $0.45 dividend. For the full year, we're at $2.618 billion of DCF, up $905 million.
Again, the weighted average shares here, 1.3 billion shares, include a full fourth quarter of the newly issued shares to
get us to $2 in distributable cash flow before certain items versus the $1.74.
I'm going to go through a couple of the numbers, Steve has taken you through a lot of the detail, but the segment
produced earnings before DD&A of $1.972 billion in the quarter. That's up $98 million or 5%, with the big contributors
to that being gas up $51 million, or 5%, and terminals up $56 million, or 25%. For the full year, segment earnings
before DD&A up $613 million, or 9%, with the biggest contributors being Natural Gas Pipelines up $352 million or
9%; Terminals up $181 million or 23%; and Products Pipelines up $76 million.
Now versus our budget for the full year, Natural Gas Pipelines came in above their budget. They're about 2% above
their budget primarily because of incremental transport revenues on TGP and EPNG. CO2 came in about 6% or $90

million below its budget, primarily due to lower oil prices and a higher Mid Cush spread, and also some higher
expenses at our Goldsmith Field. Products came in about $68 million below its budget, primarily because of lower
volumes on KMCC, a lot of which we will receive revenue in later years, make up revenue, and the delay in the splitter.
And then terminals came in about $10 million above its budget as a result of the APT acquisition. Without the APT
acquisition, terminals would have been below its budget because of some lower coal volumes, expansion delays and
negative impact of FX.
The certain items in the quarter, totaled $98 million loss, the more significant ones were the $235 million impairment
on our Katz field, all due to the lower price curves that we have to use in that test. And then we also had a benefit that
offset that, a non-recurring tax benefit, of about a little over $100 million. So that's it for the DCF page for KMI for the
quarter.
Looking at KMI's balance sheet and comparing that, the December 2014 balance sheet to the December 2013 balance
sheet, you can see the impact of the transaction, primarily in four or five different lines in deferred charges, in deferred
income tax. So what's happening there is KMI was previously in a deferred tax liability position because of the step-up
on the transaction and the tax basis that we're getting in the assets. We actually now have a deferred tax asset and so
you see a big swing between deferred income taxes and the assets deferred charges.
You also see a big increase in other shareholder's equity and a reduction in noncontrolling interest as the public unit
holders at EPB and KMP went away, and we issued new KMI shares. The other large change is that which I'm going to
reconcile for you in just a minute. We ended the quarter with $40.6 billion of debt which is about 5.5 times debt to
EBITDA, relatively consistent with where we expected to end. Our debt is up $5.1 billion for the quarter. And so let me
take you though the larger changes contributing to that.
The consolidation transaction was a cash outflow of about $4.06 billion, $3.9 billion for the cash portion of the deal
plus associated fees; expansion CapEx, acquisitions, and contributions to equity investments were about $1.1 billion in
the quarter; and then we made a CPC settlement payment of about $319 million for a cash outflow of $5.5 billion. We
raised equity prior to the close of the transaction at EPB through its ATM of $126 million and then we have about $250
million cash inflow from other items or working capital source which is primarily the coverage that we generated in the
quarter and that gets you to the $5.1 billion.
So with that, we'll turn it to Dax.
Dax A. Sanders
Thanks, Kim.
Just to reiterate what Rich said, this is an acquisition that we are very excited about. It will give us a premier asset in a
premier basin. At this point, we have a significant presence in every major producing region in North America except
the Bakken. With this acquisition, we will now have a major position in the Bakken and a long-term partnership with
some of most prolific producers in the Bakken, including Continental Resources.
To give you a bit of detail on the transaction, it is, again, approximately $3 billion in total enterprise value. Very
slightly accretive out of the gate, but based on our assumption, this should be $0.06 to $0.07 accretive a couple of years
out. Looking through the lens of 2015 expected EBITDA, approximately 86% of the margin is fee based, with the
remaining 14% subject to commodity exposure, primarily through POP processing arrangements in the gas processing
and gathering segment.
There are essentially three main businesses to Hiland. The first is oil gathering which consists of four facilities,
represents approximately 59% of the EBITDA, and is almost exclusively fee based with really no direct commodity
exposure. Hiland serves most of the major producers in the Bakken and has over 1.8 million acres dedicated, with a
large piece of that centered in what many consider to be the tier one portion of the Bakken as Rich mentioned.

Second is oil transportation which is essentially the Double H pipeline. Double H represents approximately 27% of
2015 EBITDA and is 100% fee based. Double H is a 485 mile pipe extending from the Dore Terminal in McKenzie
County, North Dakota, along the North Dakota/Montana boarder down to Guernsey, Wyoming where it ties in to Pony
Express. It includes 500,000 barrels of storage and two truck stations. It's in the process of being commissioned right
now with the initial capacity being approximately 84,000 barrels a day but increasing to approximately 108,000 barrels
a day at the beginning of next year.
Price is underpinned by firm commitments for approximately 60,000 barrels a day with an open season in process right
now for additional barrels, again, currently in process. As of Monday, Double H had nominations for approximately
80,000 barrels for February which is its first full month in operation.
The third business is gas gathering and processing which consists of five different facilities and represents
approximately 14% of the EBITDA. It's almost exclusively non-fee based or commodity exposed to the POPs that I
mentioned earlier.
Again, the largely fee-based nature of these assets limits our direct commodity exposure – exposure to commodity
prices. However, it's certainly not a loss on us if there is indirect commodity exposure and that the economics of these
assets are in part dependent upon whether the oil behind them continues to be produced. We believe that the risk of the
oil being produced is largely mitigated by the quality of the acreage that is dedicated to Hiland and will be driving the
economics of the oil gathering.
As we mentioned in the release, the acreage driving our economics is largely located in McKenzie, Mountrail, and
Williams counties and represents some of the best drilling economics in the Bakken and in North America.
Consequently we believe that this acreage is economic to producers even in the current commodity environment. Some
Bakken producers including some of our customers have publicly revised their guidance for drilling and CapEx in
recent weeks to account for the current commodity environment and we have taken that into account in our analysis.
Further, while nobody can really contemplate what will result from a substantial decline in commodity prices from
here, the relative attractiveness in the acreage should position us well versus other acreage competing for a finite
number of rigs in such an environment. Again, to summarize we believe this is a highly strategic acquisition of some
premiere assets that largely put our toll road concept and are located in area where we have no presence. We will be
inheriting a very talented group of employees that have built a great company and we look forward to doing great
things with this franchise.

<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Thank you. Just a couple of quick questions here. I was wondering if we can talk a little
bit more about today's acquisitions. You've had a lot of pundits out there talking about the Bakken, with production
being flat at best, possibly declines and so forth. I was wondering if the opportunity over the next couple of years, as
you see accretion pick up, is that a function of moving some of the trucking volumes on to the pipeline system? Is that
kind of how we expect to see the opportunity on a go forward basis given the bleak environment that we have out there
for the Bakken?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, again, let me start with this, and I'm not sure if we posted this on the website, but if
not, we should have. If you look at acreage around the country and what the breakeven price is based on WTI prices,
this area of the Bakken is right at the top of the list. It's one of the two top producing basins in terms of breakeven
prices. So we don't think that it is nearly as bleak as other parts of production are, if you want to use that word.
Secondly, obviously, a big part of the upside is the ramp-up in this Double H pipeline. We're starting out in the 80,000
barrel per day range, ramping up to by the beginning of next year, 108,000 barrels. And again, we believe that the
combination and, as you may know, there's a joint tariff arrangement between Double H pipeline and the Pony Express
line that gets you all the way to Cushing. And then of course there are several avenues now to get from Cushing on
down to the Gulf Coast. And we believe by putting all that together, we provide by far the most economic way of
getting barrels out of this very sweet spot in the Bakken. So we think HH is a real winner, both near term and long
term. So that's part of it.
The other thing is that we have looked at the EURs on these wells. We've looked very carefully at the drilling plan of
our largest customer and we've adjusted for exactly what they plan to do, what we believe they plan to do, with the rig
counts that have already been announced. So we think we've been pretty conservative in the way we have assessed this
and believe that it's an incredible asset for us.
Now let me say that beyond that, I think we have the opportunity, as I said in my opening remarks, to do here kind of
what we did in the Eagle Ford on KMCC. And that is to build out this system to make it bigger, to do some
acquisitions, to do some extensions. And the fact that we have about 1.8 million acres dedicated to us, I think will show
very well in the long term.
And look, you have to look at this in the long term, not in the flavor of exactly what's happening today. So we think,
long winded way of saying, we think we've been very conservative in looking at the front end of this transaction and
still think it has enormous long-term growth potential.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. And just to follow up on that. In terms of permanent financing plans, any sense on
an equity-to-debt ratio that you're thinking about?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah, we've been very clear since the time we announced the merger last August, after
meeting with the rating agencies, that we would stay in that band of 5.5 to 5.0 debt to EBITDA and certainly driving
that down toward the lower end of the range as we move on out toward 2020. We've been very consistent on that and
we've said that the Holy Grail for us is maintaining our investment grade rating.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. And one final question. You had mentioned in the prepared remarks that you had
taken out a little under $800 million from your backlog out of the CO2 business due to lower commodity prices. I was
wondering if you can sort of share the commodity price that you would assume to take that out. Was it $70? Was it
$50? Just trying to understand the sensitivity to see if that's possibly going to change on a go forward basis given where
crude prices are today.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I don't have a specific price for you but what we did, and in a lot of cases what we're
doing is delaying our expectation of making these investments. And in some cases that was delaying it outside of the
five-year window that we typically use for defining the backlog. We're going to give you, at the conference next week,
some more specific return numbers to go with various development activities that we have going on.
But I think the way to kind of slice it is, it is very economic for us to do CO2 development and pipeline work where
we're expanding kind of off of our existing footprint. So like Southwest Colorado, with Cow Canyon and the Cortez

Pipeline, particularly, the north part of that, expanding that to make that available. And it's certainly very economic for
us to be doing infill drilling in SACROC and additional HDHs at Yates. And so the kinds of things that are building off
of and utilizing our existing infrastructure are very economic. And if you have a price recovery that's back in the $70,
$75 range, I think you'd see some of those projects that we pushed out or pushed off, coming back on.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. Thank you very much guys.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: One other clarification. The $800 million, that was predominantly CO2 but there were a few
other cats and dogs in there as well. But it was predominantly CO2.

Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Go ahead. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Darren. Good afternoon.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Hey, Rich. Good afternoon. And Rich and Steve, congratulations to both of you on your
respective announcements. Rich, just a quick question, and I realize you're going to get into a lot more detail on this
next week but I'm just curious with the current forward commodity curve, have you seen a big shift away from more
producer push to more demand pull or consumer pull type projects, and specifically with regard to export opportunities
around Galena Park, the Ship Channel. I know we've talked about ultra-low sulfur diesel exports and obviously that big
tank expansion that you had discussed that was underwritten by a new shipper. But I'm also thinking about more of an
emphasis on Pasadena in addition to Galena Park, a further BOSTCO build out, more ability to get more product on the
water quicker?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I'll turn that over to John Schlosser who runs our terminals group.
<A - John W. Schlosser>: Yeah. We're looking at 35 million barrels right now. We have six different projects we're
working on that will bring it up to 41 million barrels. We are going from 8 docks to 11 docks. So we feel we have the
premier footprint in North America for clean products and we see more projects and more growth opportunities in that
area as we go forward here.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: In terms of aggregate CapEx, and maybe it's too early to do this, but can you put a rough
cost number on that, and is it fair to assume unlevered cash-on-cash returns maybe in the low to mid-teen range?
<A - John W. Schlosser>: Yes. We're managing actively right now a little under $2 billion worth of projects on the
Houston Ship Channel between BOSTCO, Pasadena and Galena Park and some of our other expansions. And the
returns are all in the low to mid-teens.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. And then last question for me maybe...
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: [indiscernible] (38:28) we subscribe over term contracts from our customers. So it's not like
we're building tankage on spec here.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Sure. And then Rich, last question for me maybe. As you're looking at the existing
opportunity set, obviously with the challenges across natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil prices, in terms of
cash-on-cash returns are the best bang for your buck with regard to allocating capital, is this the biggest area of
opportunity for you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, I think we've got opportunities across the board. I think I said last August when we
announced this that what we would have is a much lower cost of capital under the new arrangement or a lower hurdle
rate, if you will, which again on an after-tax basis is about 3.5%. And not that we're going to do 4% projects but it gives
us a lot more leeway to make accretive acquisitions and we're certainly going to use that currency to make good
acquisitions.

And I think that if there's a silver lining in these clouds of low commodity prices it's going to be the ability to make
some extremely good acquisitions over the next six to 12 months. Now we're not the only player here that's going to be
looking at the same thing. There are other well-capitalized midstream companies but I think you're going to see
consolidation opportunities. And everything I said last August I think is even more true today than it was then given the
decline in prices.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Thanks, Rich.

Our next question comes from Brad Olsen of TPH. Go ahead. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Brad. How are you this afternoon?
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Hey. Good afternoon, Rich. How are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: My first question is really just a follow-up on some of these others on the Hiland acquisition.
You guys mentioned that there would be some incremental CapEx and I'm just trying to understand where that CapEx
is going to go. Is there additional construction left on the Double H pipeline, or is that further building out the crude
gathering or the G&P asset footprint?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I'll ask Dax to answer that question.
<A - Dax A. Sanders>: Yeah, Brad, we think that we'll be able to invest roughly $850 million from, call it, 2015
through 2018. There is on an aggregate of oil well connects some gas well connects, some remaining CapEx on the
Double H. The Double H has roughly $30 million left to spend and a little bit more than that to spend to get it up to
roughly – get it to 108,000 barrels.
Now what that doesn't contemplate at all is a substantial expansion of the Double H which is something that we will
certainly be putting time and thought and opportunity into. That gets us up to the 108,000 barrels a day.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Got it. And so safe to say that the vast majority of the remaining $800 million is gathering and
processing and crude gathering?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think that's right.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Okay. Got it. And when you think about the competitive environment in the Bakken, some other
midstream operators have made asset acquisitions up there over the last few years. And when you think about what
percentage of the market is spoken for under long-term midstream agreements and what might still be up for grabs, do
you see an opportunity to attract incremental customers?
<A - Dax A. Sanders>: Yeah, I guess what I would say is – as we mentioned in the release we've got good long
existing relationships with a lot of different customers including some very prolific producers up there but we don't
have them all. We haven't necessarily – we happen to have really good acreage dedications with the ones we do have
which makes us feel really good about this business but there are some that Hiland doesn't have a historical relationship
with that we do have a relationship with. And we will absolutely be spending a lot of time to try to solidify those
relationships with the Hiland assets.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Got it. I guess shifting gears a bit to the natural gas pipeline side of things. Looks like you guys
are still pushing forward on the Northeast Direct project and I was – there have been some press releases out about
some of the work you're doing around multiple different rights of way. How is that process going I guess from a
simplistic view which is really the only view that I do, the simplistic view is going to New York state, moving along a
right of way that's similar to constitution which has become a kind of regulatory quagmire, what seems to be a really

encouraging project with a lot of customers who seem excited about it, that right of way issue sticks out as something
that could delay timing or cause problems. Is that point of view accurate or fair?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I don't really think it is. And let me tell you why. We have adjusted this right of way so that
today the huge percentage of the right of way is along utility easements. Now there's certainly people who are going to
say, not in my backyard, but that's why we have FERC as enabling agency. And we will have, in fact, we're going to
have – I've forgotten how many open houses here in the next few weeks, actually, this winter, in all these communities
talking about it. But in the end, we will have a route and we would expect the FERC to approve that route because it is
reasonable.
And look, you have to look at the underlying economic need here. If there's one area of the United States that needs
additional national gas, it is New England. And the area of New England with this ending at Dracut is exactly the
location where you'd need to be in order to serve that market which initially will be LDCs, and you can see how we've
announced the LDCs in the past who've signed up. We now have reduced almost all of those to [ph] PAs (44:40). And
longer term, of course, beyond the LDCs, in the end, the power generation market in New England has to have more
capacity on pipelines. It just can't work any other way. And we plan to be there to catch that ball when it comes off the
backboard. So I think we can do this.
We are proceeding very in close consultation with everybody up there including our customers and including
government officials. And I'm astounded sometimes. Frankly, this goes beyond this project, I'm astounded that even as
recently as a couple years ago, people, I believe the general public, rightfully believe that natural gas is the savior. It
emits half as much emissions as other power generation alternatives, for example, and it's the lowest-emitting fossil
fuel. This is the bridge fuel for the future even if you believe we'll eventually move more to renewables. And now
we've got a coterie of people around the country seem to be attacking every expansion of every pipeline. And I still
believe in the common sense of the American people and the regulators, and I think in the end projects that are really
needed, like this, will get approved and will get built.
Now let me emphasize that there's not one damn cent of that northeast direct project, either the supply portion or the
market portion, that is in the backlog that Steve took you through. So this is a project that we're working on. And if it
gets built it will be additive to everything we've projected for you thus far.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: That's great color, Rich. I appreciate all the color, everyone. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Carl Kirst of BMO Capital. Go ahead, sir, your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Carl, how you doing?
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Good afternoon. Good, good, thank you, and certainly congratulations to both of you. Just maybe
if I could stick with NED for a second because I'm just curious now from the other aspect, from the commercial aspect,
is there any better sense of how the market is shaking out from the demand pull aspect, i.e. what perhaps Maine might
do to kind of push you over the finish line or anybody else for that matter?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I'll let Tom Martin, who runs our natural gas pipelines, to answer that.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Thanks, Rich. As Rich said, we've gotten most of our LDC part of this project sewn up, so
it is really going to the state of Maine and ultimately the power customers that will be the next phase. And we think,
over the next quarter, maybe two at the most, we will have a very clear picture on getting those commitments in place,
we believe, to move forward with this project but a lot of work to be done between now and then. Certainly need to
work with the state and local officials as well as the commercial aspects of these transactions. But as Rich said, all the
people that need this commodity have been very positive towards this project and we are very optimistic that we'll get
this done.

<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Understood. So it sounds like the spring is still at least a potentially still a realistic scenario as far
as knowing how the chips are going to fall.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Spring into mid-year, yeah.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay. If I could ask a question on the CO2 business, only because, Rich, I think you mentioned
that the current budget for instance does not include any of the potential benefits of cost reductions. I'm just curious in
the experience of 2008 and 2009, if there's any sense of magnitude of what that was back then as far as possible offset
we may be looking at this year.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah, Jesse?
<A - Jesse Arenivas>: Yeah, thanks. I think our target is going to be 15% of our total operating budget. Keep in mind
about 40% of that is tied to natural gas prices or correlated to natural gas price, which is power. So we're shooting for
an overall 15% reduction in cost, roughly $30 million of the non-committed dollars. In regards to 2008, 2009, we were
able to achieve a little higher percentage of that but what we've learned through that period as we tied a lot of our
drilling and well work programs and contracts to crude price, so when we lowered the budget to $70 there's already a
wedge out of that. So in aggregate, it's probably going to be closer to 20% consistent with what we've got in 2008,
2009.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And obviously, Carl, he's talking just about the O&M, the operating budget. There will also
be savings on the capital side, but as far as impact on 2015, reducing the O&M cost, we believe 15% is a good solid
number. And they've already achieved about a third of that with contracts they've already renegotiated just since the
first of the year. So I think we will have that. And again, there'll be a lot of moving parts, obviously, in this kind of
environment but we don't have that anyplace in our numbers yet.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Understood. And then, lastly if I could, this is just sort of I guess a micro question but to the
extent that we saw the excess coverage again keeping the $70 oil plan moving up from $500 million to $650 million,
$654 million, was that basically just a nuance to the bonus depreciation at yearend, or was there something more going
on there?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Kim?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure. That was just, Carl, when we went out with our budgets where all the pieces were
all the pieces weren't in place yet, and so we went with a over $500 million. It was over $600 million at the time but
one of the moving pieces was that we were finalizing some of the tax purchase price allocation. And so that's why we
went out with an estimate as opposed to a precise number.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Understood. Appreciate the clarification. Thanks, guys.

maybe was behind schedule the last couple of quarters? And can you comment on appetite for EOR growth CapEx
initiatives in the current environment with things like ROZ or the Yates NGL flood?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. And Craig, we're going to go in a lot more detail next week at the Analyst
Conference. In fact, I think Jesse's got a slide that's going to show you basically what returns are at various WTI prices
broken out by SACROC, Yates, Katz, ROZ, so on. But I think the huge story – the success story here is the SACROC,
and you're going to see next week that once again that if you've attended our conferences every year people ask, well,
when does SACROC start this inevitable decline?
And I remember at one time it was going to be 2008, 2009, then it was 2014, 2017, 2018. We continue to move that out
because frankly it is just a fantastic field. And we're now doing a lot of infill drilling that is very economic. It's more
economic than putting on new patterns by a fair margin. And again, Steve gave you the average for the year and for the
fourth quarter. We're starting this year. We're right at 37,000 barrels a day at SACROC. And our budget that we set for
this year is about 33,000 barrels a day. That will have moving parts elsewhere in CO2 but thus far we're off to a very
good start and it's largely due to SACROC.
So we see that, certainly the ROZ I think is at the upper end of the curve in terms of a clearing price versus something
like infill drilling at SACROC and we'll just have to see how that comes out. But certainly the money we're spending
now on our test patterns there is economic given the costs we've already put in it. It's very economic on a going forward
basis. And then we'll just reassess after that on where the prices are.
Steve or Jesse anything else on that? They're nodding their heads. So I guess they're agreeing, so.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. And just one more question. It would be great on an ongoing basis quarterly if maybe we
could kind of track the growth CapEx inventory or portfolio relative to what was originally envisioned when you issued
your original guidance through 2020. I realize there's some moving parts, including commodity prices, but where do we
stand right now in terms of maybe needing just a couple billion dollars more at the same commodity prices you
originally assumed to fulfill that long-term growth guidance?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Go ahead, Steve.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I was just going to say I think that we can give you some more insight into that but it's very
hard to define what in what some people have called our shadow backlog is going to fall into the backlog. But we
believe we're going to get a substantial piece of additional CapEx beyond what we're showing you in the backlog. And
our performance over the year and from quarter to quarter is generally demonstrating that to you.
The other thing that's hard to incorporate in there is acquisitions like the one we're talking about today. We expect we're
going to see those as well. So those are shots that are just a little bit harder to call, but you're making a good point.
Certainly with some additional capital deployment in our existing businesses, we can claw back some of the damage
done in our CO2 business from lower commodity prices. So we can help get back some of what would have otherwise
been a deterioration from the transaction that we were talking about back in August.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Sure. I guess that was my point of just making up the free cash flow that was originally guided
and maybe getting to the point, eventually, of being able to increase that 10% CAGR on the dividend.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, yeah, we would certainly – that's our intent too. And again, as you can see, we've got
a lot of positive cash flow even with lower commodity prices. It's just harder to judge on a going-forward basis. But the
reason I took you through 2015 is that's something that I can get my pea-sized brain around, so you can see that in a
year like 2015 – and I'm not saying that that's the same every year – but you can kind of see where you are and the
impact of commodity pricing on the bottom line in terms of distributable cash flow and excess coverage.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. Thank you very much. I look forward to next week.

<Q - John D. Edwards>: Well, congrats to Steve as well. But I'm just curious on the Hiland deal if you can give us an
idea of the economics behind the acreage that's dedicated; in other words, maybe kind of what the breakeven costs are
for that acreage?

know whether we posted any slides on the website yet. I think we're going to, and one that we used with the board

you look at one source I think, and this is publicly available, is a presentation that Continental Resources, who is a
pretty well respected producer up there, put on their website, based on a presentation a couple weeks ago. And they
show a graph that shows effectively a PV10 at a WTI price of effectively $40, and assuming a modest amount of cost
cuts in this kind of environment. So that's one piece of data out there that you see. And again, that's in terms of the WTI
price.
We've got another I guess piece of information from a bank that shows effectively tier one Bakken being – if you look
across different acreages across the United States – being really second only to the Eagle Ford tier one in having sort of
again kind of a PV10 or a 10% IRR breakeven with a WTI price in the range of, call it, $35 to $45. And again that
assumes some cost cuts that are probably appropriate for this environment.
But those are the types of numbers that we think about. Again, I think what you've heard all these producers say, a lot
of these guys have said publicly is they're reducing rig counts but they are high-grading their portfolios and
substantially increasing the EUR targets in the wells that they're drilling and they're really focusing in on the higher
grade acreage and focusing rigs on that acreage. And that's really kind of what we take into account in our analysis.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: All right. That's really helpful. In terms of those ranges, is there some percentage – I think
you said it was 1.8 million acres dedicated – is there some percentage that say the economics are more at the fringe?
Say it's not economic below $60 or $70 or what – I assume it's some kind of a curve in terms of how this shakes out.
<A - Dax A. Sanders>: Yeah. I would just say that the majority of that acreage is stuff that we believe is concentrated
in what we've defined as that sweet spot which is again the sort of McKenzie, Mountrail, and Williams Counties. So we
think that really is kind of what's driving things.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And just again some touchstones for you, John, and again a lot of different people have a
lot of different opinions. But the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources put out a report on January 8 that
ranked the counties in North Dakota by breakeven oil price. And the rankings, the three counties that we're primarily –
where the heart of what we have is in is McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail, and those were three of the top five
counties in North Dakota according to the Department of Mineral Resources. And McKenzie has the most rigs,
Williams has the second rigs – number of rigs, and Mountrail has the third largest number of rigs.
So I think certainly when you have that much acreage, 1.8 million acres, some acreage is going to be better than others,
and they're not going to drill up everything. But certainly we think and believe that we are right in the tier one sweet
spot of the Bakken. Otherwise, we wouldn't have done the deal.

And the other thing is we've got long-term contracts on this. So again, whatever happens in that acreage we feel we're
going to be able to benefit from it and benefit our customers for years to come.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. That's really helpful. And then you indicate it's a 10 times multiple by 2018. About
what's the multiples for like 2015, 2016, 2017 if you can give that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think the only guidance we have there is that it is modestly accretive in 2015. And then we
build to that 10 times by 2018.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. All right.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: It's accretive every year from the get go. So I think that's the important thing.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. That's really helpful. That's all I had. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies. Go ahead. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon, Chris.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Hey, Rich. How are you? Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up
on a couple of things. To follow up on things that may or may not be in the guidance. I know Carl followed up on some
of the cost reductions that might be possible at the CO2 business.
I was curious, you had mentioned in the fourth quarter the currency impact in Canada. Just wondering if that was sort
of part of the later quarter scrub on what you're offering for 2015? I'm sure you're going to go into more detail next
week but was just curious about the widening Canadian dollar impact.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure. And we can go into this more next week. But what we have in the budget is 0.92
times for the exchange rate.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay. And is there any sort of broad sensitivity, Kim, that you've offered on that?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We'll have that for you next week.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay, perfect. And then, Kim, you were kind enough last quarter call to offer detail
on the hedge positions and I think you had commented that you might add in the yearend or beginning in the year look
to add additional hedge positions. Just curious if you did that and if so if we can get an update on where things stand?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We continue to have hedges. We have an ongoing hedge program. Right now we've got
about 80% of 2015 hedged at about an $80 price, 50% of 2016 at a $79 price, 32% of 2017 at a $79 price and 20% of
2018 at an $81 price.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Great, okay. And I guess final question maybe for Steve or for Rich. In terms of the
CO2 business, I know there was the comment earlier about the CapEx that came out of the five-year plan. I'm just
wondering how we should think about the potential impact on volumes. Rich you had talked about the SACROC slide
and the slide that you guys have about eventually when does that asset start declining, if and when.
Just wondering how we think about, in context of some of the CapEx coming out over the next five years what perhaps
we ought to be doing from a model perspective and thinking about the base level of decline on the asset.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, on SACROC, and again this is early, but we're kind of seeing the best of both worlds
here. We're actually seeing the ability to increase production with less CapEx-intensive programs. And so that's a bit of
a change from where we even were, I'd say, six months ago, Jesse. And so there's been some improvement there. We

just keep figuring out better and better ways to get at the oil there.
When it comes to the other fields, I think it's less about looking at it field by field than it is more about the type of
development. So where we have existing infrastructure in the fields, so we've got gathering lines, we've got injection
lines, we've got tanks, those sorts of things. The infill part of our program is going to be economic and what moves to
the margins is a new build-out or new development, new pattern in the same development. That gets a little closer to
the edge. And then a brand-new kind of greenfield development is probably outside the edge. And that's a real
summary way to think about it. And again, we can give more specific with some specific development plans that we
have when we get to the conference next week but did that cover it, Jesse?
<A - Jesse Arenivas>: Yeah, I think maybe to look at it, it's the backlog. I think the question is heavily weighted
towards CO2 development, not the EOR business. So I think the push out of the $800 million or so is more focused on
our new CO2 source development and not the existing EOR project. I think that's the way to look at it.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay. Thanks a lot for your time again. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from Adam Steinberg of Waveny Capital Management. Go ahead. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon, Adam.
<Q - Adam Steinberg>: Hi. Thank you. Hi, how are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Adam Steinberg>: Good. I'll echo the comments that others have made on the call about extending our
congratulations to you guys. But it seems like the market is not really rewarding some of these accomplishments that
you guys have achieved. And Rich, I saw your comments in the release today but I was wondering, maybe you can go
further than just saying you won't sell and would the company consider buying back some of the stock and/or the
warrants?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Would the company consider buying back some of my stock?
<Q - Adam Steinberg>: No, some of the stock in the open market.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Oh, that's not in our present plans. Again, what we have said is that we're going to
concentrate on this tremendous dividend growth story that we've got and be very careful about maintaining our
investment-grade rating by paying close attention to it and keeping that debt to EBITDA in the range that we've talked
about for the last six months.
<Q - Adam Steinberg>: Great. And then just one follow-up, maybe. You talked about – you reiterated your dividend
guidance in the future. Is today's acquisition add to that, or is it sort of the core business a little weaker and that makes
up for it?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, I think this is additive. What we're doing today with the accretion and the out years is
additive to what we had before. I think you have to look at it on separate tracks. In other words what we've got here is a
tremendous set of assets that admittedly are somewhat, I think, in a pretty minor way compared to if you were a pure
E&P company but impacted by the lower commodity price.
We've never denied that. We've given you guidance on that. And any acquisitions that we do or any new expansion
projects we have in the backlog, we don't have now will, do you want to say offset that or will add to it? So I think we
certainly won't do any acquisitions or expansion projects unless they're accretive to the cash flow.
<Q - Adam Steinberg>: Got it. Thanks.

Richard D. Kinder
Great. Well, thank you very much, everybody. I know it's been a pretty long conference call. We're very excited both
with the results for 2014, the outlook for 2015 and with our newest acquisition. Thank you and have a good evening.
