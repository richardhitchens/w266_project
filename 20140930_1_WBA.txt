Gregory D. Wasson
Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today I'll begin with a review of
the highlights of the quarter and the fiscal year. Next I'll provide an update on our progress towards the launch of
Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. And finally, I'll look ahead to fiscal 2015. And then I'll turn the call over to Tim
McLevish for a more detailed financial review.
In the quarter, we continued to see improvements in our top-line with growth in our Daily Living business and
prescription volume that resulted in our largest quarterly and fiscal year sales increases in three years. In addition, we
continued to see margin improvement across the front end of our business. As we move into fiscal 2015, we are very
focused on our performance. We've put into place a strong blended management team for the future Walgreen Boots
Alliance organization, which is bringing greater focus and clarity to the critical work at hand.
For the quarter, net sales were $19.1 billion, up 6.2% from $17.9 billion in the fourth quarter last year. GAAP operating
income for the quarter was $969 million, down 5.8% from $1 billion last year. Adjusted operating income for the
quarter was $1.14 billion, up 3.5% from $1.1 billion in fourth quarter 2013. The GAAP loss per share in the fourth
quarter equaled $0.25 compared to earnings per share of $0.69 last year.
Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.74, up 1.4% from $0.73 in the same quarter last year. This
quarter's GAAP results were negatively impacted by an $866 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, non-cash loss related
to the amendment and exercise during the quarter of the company's Alliance Boots call option.
Now, turning to our fiscal year performance, sales were $76.4 billion compared to $72.2 billion last year, up 5.8%.
GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 6.4% from $3.9 billion in fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating income for the
year was $4.9 billion compared to $4.7 billion in 2013, up 4.6%. Our full year GAAP earnings per diluted share were
$2, down 21.9% from $2.56 last year, and on an adjusted basis, earnings per diluted share were $3.28, up 5.1%
compared to $3.12 last year.
We closed fiscal 2014 entering the next important phase in our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots, amending and
exercising the option to complete the second step. Through the transaction, the new Walgreens Boots Alliance will
have unmatched global reach, strength and leadership and a broad mix of retail health, wellbeing and beauty business
and an international pharmacy wholesale network, all dedicated to ensuring people across the world lead healthier and
happier lives.
This fiscal year, we also completed the transition of our drug distribution to AmerisourceBergen. Their company now
supplies virtually all of our brand and generic medications. The strategic relationship together with Alliance Boots is
establishing the leading global pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution network.
Importantly, we achieved $491 million in synergies through our WBAD joint venture. Our retail pharmacy market
share grew 30 basis points to 19% in fiscal 2014, and we filled a record 856 million prescriptions. In our Daily Living
business, it was a big year for beauty. We launched Boots No7 product in our Phoenix and New York markets in our
flagship locations to very positive customer reaction and improved performance. And finally, we increased our
dividend for the 39th consecutive year.
Turning to trends in gross profit dollars and SG&A dollars. In the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, our gross profit
dollars increased 2.6%, or $136 million from year ago. SG&A dollars increased 4.8%, or $207 million compared to the
same time last year. Adjusted gross profit dollars increased 2.6% or $133 million compared to the same quarter last
year. Gross profit dollars grew primarily as a result of the improvement in script comps and front-end comp sales.
Gross profit dollar growth also benefited from brand to generic conversions year-over-year, but were negatively
impacted by lower third-party reimbursement and generic drug price inflation.
Our adjusted SG&A dollars increased 2.1% or $86 million compared to the same quarter last year. These results reflect
the impact of savings from enterprise optimization, our efforts underway to improve efficiency across our organization.

Looking ahead, we'll continue our strong focus on cost reduction, driving to achieve our $1 billion target over three
years, which we announced in August. We've put headquarters and non-labor spending reductions into immediate
effect and are continuing to work toward greater efficiencies in our processes through Walgreens Lean Six Sigma.
Now turning to our key performance drivers. In pharmacy, health and wellness, our script comp was up 3.9% in the
quarter. We filled 211 million prescriptions in the quarter, up 4.2% from the same period last year. To drive that
performance, we continued our focus on winning with high-value seniors through preferred relationships with
Medicare Part D plans. Since 2013, our prescription share with Med Part D seniors has grown more than twice as fast
as our overall retail prescription's share. On average, Med D seniors filled three times as many prescriptions as our
non-Med D customers.
We also are capturing share in the fast-growing specialty market by improving and integrating care for patients with
complex chronic disease states across our enterprise. By the end of the fiscal year, we now have access to more than
100 limited distribution drugs by manufacturers, reflecting their growing desire to work with our unique specialty
network of health system pharmacies, complex therapy pharmacies, infusion pharmacies and our specialty at retail
offering.
In the fourth quarter, we continued to face headwinds to our pharmacy margin from ongoing pressure from
reimbursement and generic drug inflation. To address the pressure on our pharmacy margin, we are focused on our
contracting strategy to evolve our payer contracts to the realities of an inflationary versus deflationary market. We're
also aggressively working to reduce total pharmacy costs by increasing efficiencies and providing high-quality and
cost-effective pharmacy services.
Finally, Tim will discuss in greater detail the factors affecting generic inflation. We believe through our WBAD joint
venture, we are well positioned to leverage our unique global retail wholesale relationships to create a long-term
competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Turning to our front-end comp sales, which increased 1.3% in the fourth quarter, average basket size grew 3.5% while
traffic was down 2.2% as we cycled a more aggressive promotional environment from a year ago. Key categories, such
as cough, cold, and allergies drove comp sales, and as I mentioned earlier, our front-end margin continued to improve
in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year with solid performance in health and beauty.
At the end of August we had 82 million active Balance Rewards members, giving us valuable insights that allow us to
target our promotional investments even more efficiently. We're also offering storewide events designed to further
build loyalty. In the quarter, we converted or opened 88 Well Experience format stores, giving us a total of 750 with
plans for an additional 1,000 in the coming year.
These formats offer more integrated health and wellness products and solutions, provide a private consultation room to
receive health services and speak to your trusted pharmacist, and offer personal care and everyday items our customers
value. We're integrating these new store designs with digital and mobile technology to offer our customers ultimate
convenience.
And finally, with our newest flagship store in the Wrigley Building here in Chicago, we now have 14 flagships in nine
major markets. These flagships, along with our Well Experience stores, bring a real vibrancy to our markets and build
awareness of our brand.
Our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots contributed $0.06 of adjusted EPS accretion in the fourth quarter.
Combined synergies reached $124 million in the quarter and $491 million for the fiscal year. For fiscal 2015, we're
introducing a full-year combined synergy target of approximately $650 million. In addition, we're making good
progress on the integration of our two companies. We recently held our first meeting in Bern, Switzerland with the
future Walgreens Boots Alliance leadership team to ensure we're on track to close in the first quarter of calendar 2015.
The meeting was extremely productive as we prepare to launch our new company and hit the ground running on day
one.

As you know, we also filed our preliminary proxy on September 16 and are now working toward obtaining all
regulatory approvals and the vote of our shareholders.
Finally, let me be clear. While the work underway to integrate our two organizations is an important strategic priority,
the overwhelming majority of our team remain focused on serving our customers, improving our top line, expanding
margins, and bringing our costs down.
Now, looking ahead to 2015. We're well positioned to capitalize on industry tailwinds, an aging population, growth in
chronic conditions, consumerization of health care, increased new generics and growing demand for a personalized
experience. With our suite of health care services and team of professionals in our communities, with our approach to
omni-channel access and the strength of our loyalty program, and most important, the potential of a strategic
partnership with Alliance Boots, we are positioned well to serve the needs of a changing customer and industry.
We expect to continue to drive sales and margin growth in the front-end, offering ultimate convenience, the best in
customer loyalty and extraordinary customer care with a focus on integrating health, beauty, and convenience. We also
expect to continue to increase pharmacy volume and share with high-value customers through growth in Med D,
enterprise specialty and immunizations.
Building on our efforts to optimize our enterprise and control SG&A, our three-year cost reduction plan is already
underway, looking at savings at the corporate, field and store levels. We expect to begin to realize incremental benefits
in fiscal 2015, and we will expand on these efforts, leveraging the expertise of both Walgreens and Alliance Boots
moving forward.
We are realistic about the headwinds we face for the year: a cautious consumer, ongoing reimbursement pressure,
generic drug inflation and significant step downs for Med D reimbursement rates. The market reality certainly creates a
challenge for us in fiscal 2015, but one that we understand, accept and are driven to meet.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tim.
Timothy R. McLevish
Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. I will begin with the details
regarding our fourth quarter performance, then provide a few thoughts on capital structure, expectations for fiscal year
2015, and finish with some comments on our long-term goals.
As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter, we reported a GAAP loss of $0.25 per share, but this doesn't tell the whole story.
The GAAP loss of $0.25 per share walks to an adjusted earnings of positive $0.74 per share for the quarter and is
illustrated by this chart. The GAAP number is first adjusted by $0.90 to reverse the accounting treatment of the call
option to purchase the remaining 55% ownership interest in Alliance Boots.
Let me elaborate on this. GAAP accounting require that upon amendment and exercise of the call option, the company
needed to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option and record a gain or
loss to recognize the difference. Applying this standard, we determined that the fair value of the amended option, once
exercised, was estimated to be zero. This valuation is as a financial instrument without regard to its strategic value.
This reduction in value was primarily due to the shorter duration of the amended option and the appreciation since the
original valuation in the price of Walgreen's stock. The resultant effect required us to record a non-cash loss on the
exercise of the call of $866 million with no immediate tax benefit.
I will also point out that for GAAP EPS purposes and due to the loss, any outstanding stock options would be
anti-dilutive and they are not included in the share count. As a result, 956 million basic shares were used in the
calculation for GAAP EPS. But since the adjusted EPS is positive, the effect of the diluted shares has been reflected.
The remaining adjustments should be more familiar to you. A LIFO provision of a negative $0.01 per share,
acquisition-related items were $0.11 per share consisting of $0.06 of acquisition related amortization, $0.01 of

acquisition-related costs, and $0.04 from Alliance Boots related tax. And finally, the special items had a net negative
impact of $0.01 per share. This was comprised of a negative $0.10 impact of the warrants issued by
AmerisourceBergen to Walgreen's and Alliance Boots. Alliance Boots impact was recorded on a three-month lag basis.
Also, a gain on the sale of a business of $0.01 was partially offset by the positive $0.10 impact of store closures and
other asset optimization costs.
Turning now to comparable-store script numbers, on a one-year and two-year stack basis, in the quarter, comp scripts
increased 3.9% on top of 7.1% in the prior-year. The two-year stack, therefore, on script comps has improved
dramatically at or over 11% for both of the last two quarters. This performance reflects growth of our underlying
business, the ongoing progress in winning new Medicare Part D customers, an increase of 90-day at retail scripts and
the return of Express Scripts patients. According to IMS, we grew scripts 60 basis points faster than the retail industry
in the quarter.
Likewise, we look at front-end comparable-store sales trends on both a one-year and two-year stack basis. In the
quarter, we reported a 1.3% front-end comp with the individual components of this being basket size, which increased
by 3.5% and traffic, which decreased by 2.2%. You can see that comps have been positive for the last six quarters and
the two-year stack comp trends have improved about 400 basis points since the second quarter of 2013.
Now on to margin. Adjusted gross margin was 27.9% in the current quarter compared to 28.9% last year, a 100 basis
point decline. Margins were solid on the front-end, but were weak in the pharmacy. Front-end margin benefited from
our purchasing synergies and our strategy of winning in the most important categories, particularly in health and
wellness and beauty, which is also driving market share growth.
The primary drivers for the pharmacy margin decrease were increased third-party reimbursement pressure partly due to
contract step downs, increased Medicare Part D business mix, including our strategy to continue driving 90-day
prescriptions at retail, pronounced generic drug inflation on a subset of generic drugs, and the mix of specialty drugs.
Partially offsetting these pharmacy margin decreases were the positive effect of the increased rate of introductions of
new generics this quarter versus the year-ago quarter and purchasing synergies in the pharmacy. As we look into the
future, for the next quarter, we expect the negative factors impacting pharmacy margin to outweigh the expected
benefit from new generic introductions and front-end margin improvement.
Let me say a few additional words about generic drug inflation. The dynamics under which generic drug manufacturers
can avail themselves of pricing actions has not changed. They were able to raise prices when demand outpaces supply.
These drug supplies can be impacted by a number of mechanisms including regulatory actions by the FDA resulting in
the shutdowns of both API and finished dosage form manufacturing plants, generic drug manufacturer consolidation
and portfolio harmonization, API manufacturer consolidation, and FDA backlog on approvals as well as a shrinking
pipeline of first-to-market generic blockbuster launches.
Our current environment is experiencing all of these mechanisms and as a result, the average inflation in our basket of
generic drugs is mid single-digit, as measured on a comparable drug price basis. This change is caused by very large
price increases in a small percent of molecules. Because these supply constraints and other factors are continuing, we
expect the generic drug inflation will be with us for a while.
In the meantime, we're working diligently to minimize the impact of this inflation by tracking the movement of AWP
and working with market participants to help them understand the importance of appropriate AWP adjustments to
represent changes in actual drug costs, evolving our payer contracts to reflect the realities of an inflationary versus a
deflationary market, and working through our joint venture to secure better costs by leveraging our unique global retail
and wholesale value proposition to create a long-term competitive advantage in the marketplace. Jeff Berkowitz is here
with us today and available to answer any further questions about this subject.
As you know, the mix of generic and specialty drugs can have a significant impact on gross profit margins, so we also
focus on gross profit dollar growth in our business. This next chart illustrates our one year and two year stack gross
profit dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last 16 quarters. The primary difference between GAAP and
adjusted gross profit is LIFO provision. So let's review the one year and two year stack trends on an adjusted basis.

Adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased 2.6% compared to a strong 4.3% growth in the year-ago period. This
growth was positively impacted by the comparable-store script and sales trends in both the pharmacy and front-end
respectively. It was negatively impacted by the same factors that impacted pharmacy margin that I described earlier.
Despite this impact, two-year stack in adjusted gross profit dollar growth trended up for the fiscal year.
This chart illustrates our one year and two year stack SG&A dollar change trends on a GAAP basis for the last 16
quarters. Let me walk you through the adjustments to SG&A. For the quarter, GAAP SG&A dollar change was 4.8%.
Our adjustments included 3.2% for store closures and other optimization costs, 20 basis points for acquisition related
costs and, as shown, our adjustment also included 20 basis points for a decrease in amortization costs, 30 basis points
for distributor transition costs, and 20 basis points for other small items in the quarter. The walk yields an adjusted
SG&A dollar change of 2.1% for the quarter.
Two year stack adjusted SG&A dollar trends increased versus a year ago by 310 basis points with a two year stack of
3.6% change, up from 50 basis points last year. The two year stack from a year ago included the period when we were
out of the Express Scripts network in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. In general, two-year stack SG&A dollar
change has trended down over the last 16 quarters. Our operating model required widening the gap between gross profit
dollar growth and the SG&A dollar change.
Now, I would like to provide a little bit more detail on a few components of the income statement. This quarter
included a LIFO benefit of $18 million versus a benefit of $8 million a year ago. Net interest expense for the quarter
was $43 million versus $55 million last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 231.9% versus 35.4%
last year. The loss on the Alliance Boots call option was non-deductible for tax purposes resulting in this dramatic
increase in the effective tax rate. This loss, however, is available to be carried forward and offset against future capital
gains through fiscal 2020. But under GAAP rules, we're not able to reflect the benefit until we have identified specific
gains against which we can offset the loss.
Average diluted shares outstanding were 968 million versus 957 million last year. The change is primarily due to
options exercised and the impact of higher stock price in the money options.
And now a few words on our AB partnership. Combined net synergies for the quarter totaled $124 million and for the
fiscal year, $491 million. Adjusted EPS accretion totaled $0.06 for the quarter and $0.43 for the fiscal year. For the first
quarter of 2015, we expect accretion from Alliance Boots to total $0.10 to $0.11 versus $0.14 in the quarter and in the
first quarter of 2014. Note that last year's accretion received a $0.07 tax benefit from the U.K. tax law change and this
year a $0.02 benefit from AB's acquisition of its partners' interest in the joint venture. For fiscal 2015, we expect the
combined synergies to be approximately $650 million. We're very pleased with both the progress and the benefits we're
receiving from this partnership.
Now, a couple of words on working capital. Accounts receivable increased 22.3%. Let me explain the increase in
accounts receivable. It's primarily due to higher vendor funding receivables to the joint venture and
AmerisourceBergen for rebates. This increase was partially offset by better third-party receivables. LIFO inventories
decreased 11.3% and accounts payables decreased 6.9%, both in conjunction with the terms of our new agreement with
AmerisourceBergen as the remaining generic pharmacy distribution transitioned to them. Under the terms of the
agreement, we expect both the inventories – we expected both the inventories and accounts payable to decline.
Overall, net working capital increased by 2.7% versus a year ago, an opportunity as we increase our focus on cash flow.
Speaking of which, let's look at how we did. For the year, we generated approximately $3.9 billion in cash from
operations versus $4.3 billion in the year-ago period. Free cash flow in the fiscal year was $2.8 billion versus $3.1
billion in the prior-year. The lower cash flows in the year were primarily due to changes in working capital I just
mentioned.
Our capital allocation policy is structured to ensure a balanced and disciplined approach to capital and includes
investing across core businesses at suitable returns to drive organic growth, pursuing strategic opportunities including
M&A that meet our return requirements and drive long-term growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial
flexibility with a commitment to solid investment grade credit ratings and returning cash to shareholders by committing

to a 30% to 35% dividend payout target over the long-term, and finally, returning cash to shareholders in the form of
share repurchases.
As you know, we're currently executing against our $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Many investors have
recently asked us about the potential for incremental share buybacks beyond that $3 billion. As you know, the level of
share repurchases are a function of many considerations, including the impact on the cost of debt, leverage ratios, credit
ratings, the relative return on the investment, and alternative uses of free cash. We will continue to discuss our capital
allocation policies with our board and will make any future changes when appropriate to maximize shareholder value.
Now, let me comment about fiscal year 2015. While we have set a new goal for fiscal 2016, the trajectory to get there is
not linear. The tailwinds we expect through fiscal 2016 will be largely offset in the short-term. Of note are
reimbursement rate pressure including specifically lower Medicare Part D reimbursements coming in January of 2015
and the continued impact of generic drug inflation. Also affecting the EPS growth rate in 2015 is the timing of the close
of Step 2 with Alliance Boots.
Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 29% and 30%. Our share count at fiscal 2015 year-end is expected to be
approximately 1.1 billion shares. The average shares outstanding for the year will be subject to the timing of the close
and the pace of our share repurchase. We will continue to focus on utilizing available cash to offset dilution, that is the
impact of dilution due to option exercised and the dilutive impact of in-the-money unexercised options.
In fiscal 2014, CapEx was $1.1 billion. This is below our original plan of $1.4 billion as we slowed some investing in
Well Experience stores until we further optimize the investment and rollout plan. In fiscal 2015, we now plan to
convert or open an additional 1,000 stores to the Well Experience format. The step up in expected CapEx to $1.7
billion reflects this new expansion plan.
We'd also like to provide some further clarification on interest expense for 2015. Due to market sensitivity around our
financing plans, we cannot provide any specific estimates at this time. We'll be in a better position to provide this on
our next earnings call. But to give you some perspective, I would offer the following. We have an obligation to deliver
$3.1 billion in sterling at close. That equates to approximately $5 billion at today's exchange rates. We're factoring that
obviously into our financing plans.
We also intend to refinance substantially all of Alliance Boots' debt at closing to optimize our capital structure and take
advantage of lower rates afforded by our combined credit profile. You can look to AB's last reported gross debt balance
for a reference point, but please understand that does not reflect the debt issued and assumed with the recent acquisition
of FASA.
Finally, you can assume our current reported interest expense is a reasonable run rate for 2015 for legacy Walgreen's
interest expense. In order to accomplish our Step 2 objectives, we'd look to secure the necessary capital in advance of
our expected closing, which we're targeting for the first quarter of calendar 2015. In our first quarter of fiscal 2015, we
expect our interest expense to be comparable to the fourth quarter at $43 million, the tax rate to be approximately 30%,
and the average share count to be about 957 million shares.
Before closing, I want to take the opportunity to make sure that everyone understands the major elements in the
reconciliation of the original fiscal year 2016 adjusted EBIT goal that the company first presented in the summer of
2012 to the new adjusted EPS goal announced this past August.
This slide identifies the relative sizes of the four major elements involved in the walk from the old goal to the new goal.
Namely, Walgreens front-end, Alliance Boots, Walgreens pharmacy, and finally, the Walgreens incremental cost
savings. Even though we're not quantifying the size of each element in this reconciliation, we wanted to give you a
sense of the relative magnitude as well as some of the individual factors for each element contributing to the shortfall.
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg for a few final remarks.

Thanks, Tim. Let me close by saying that overall the quarter met our expectations and closed out a challenging,
important and historic year for Walgreens. We recognize we have more do as fiscal 2015 is another milestone year for
our company. We have two very important opportunities ahead of us. The first, drive performance and execution for
Walgreen Co., and the second, establish Walgreens Boots Alliance as the first global pharmacy led health and well
being company.
A few weeks into fiscal 2015 I am confident in the combined leadership team we've put in place. We're already
working well together to develop and implement plans to improve performance across the business. We have the
discipline and focus we need to deliver the performance you expect. Finally, as we close the book on fiscal 2014, I
want to thank our customers, the Walgreens and Alliance Boots teams, and our shareholders for their commitment to
our company and confidence in our future. We are equally committed to meeting your expectations as we bring two
great companies together to create something even greater for all of us.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Rick.
Rick J. Hans
Thank you, Greg, and Tim. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please
limit yourself to one question. Amanda?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Great. Thanks for the questions and all the detail this morning. Obviously, the big focus in the
industry has been around pharmacy reimbursement. We heard one of your competitors a few weeks ago talk about
increased pressure that they're now anticipating given some of the contract negotiations that they're in the midst of, and
I know you guys called out Part D rates and ongoing general reimbursement pressure this morning, but I was hoping
you guys could just delve into it a little bit deeper and maybe give us some order of magnitude of how you're thinking
about the reimbursement rates as we get into the fiscal 2015? Maybe just even on a historical perspective, how are you
anticipating this reimbursement pressure relative to what we've seen in previous years.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, Bob. Thanks. And I'll let Jeff weigh in here a little bit as well. I think as we laid them
out quite well, frankly. I think commercial reimbursement pressure, ongoing reimbursement pressure will be on the
order of magnitude of what we've seen going forward. Part D, our one-year contracts, as you know certainly this past
year, that market became much more competitive with the preferred plans and other providers wanting to get in to those
plans primarily because of the share gains we were realizing. With 2016, we don't expect to see that significant of a
step down. We think there will continue to be pressure as plans are looking to control costs. And then certainly with
generic inflation being a big driver of those contracts versus the deflation that we've seen over the past, we're going to
have to really understand and understand where generic inflation is going. Jeff, I'll let you weigh in a little bit.
<A - Jeffrey Berkowitz>: I think, Greg, just on that point, as the generic inflation dynamic has unfolded over the
course of the past 12 months, we have been developing contracting strategies to adjust it more proactively. We started
to incorporate protections into our agreements that adjusted the inflation dynamic that we're seeing. And we've actually
successfully incorporated some protective language in one of our first major renewals moving forward. I think with that
as a baseline we are beginning to construct evolved pay arrangements and the generic inflation impact really impacts a
variety of stakeholders, not just retail pharmacies. So as our reimbursement agreements continue to cycle through, our
own stakeholders are going to have to continue to adjust to their potential new reality of fewer new generics being
launched and inflation on a small subset of mature generics which may mean that payers will come to expect lesser
discounts from pharmacies and clients of payers may get less discount guaranteed as contracts come around for renewal

and we continue to see inflation.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Jeff, I think that makes sense. Just one follow-up on that issue, it sounds like you guys have
made some progress, but do you think that ultimately this issue around dealing with inflation is something you guys can
actually mitigate through better contracting, or do you think you need to see legislative action take place in order for
this not to be kind of a structural issue for the industry going forward?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I would – Bob, I'll lead off and then let Jeff get to specifics. I think it'd probably end up
being both. I think, certainly we do think that it's going to persist based on our intelligence and all the industry
intelligence that we're seeing out there. It's hard to predict. I think Jeff and his team have really ramped up their
predictive modeling so we can understand what may happen going forward. But I think that we may indeed see the
benchmark – the tables begin to reflect what's really going on with cost inflation, we'd begin to see some of that as we
speak, and then a lot of the different things that Jeff and team were doing with regarding putting inflation protection in
the contracts and so forth, I think we'll begin to be able to get after it.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: All right. Great. Thanks for the questions.

Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Yes. Hi. Good morning. A question on cash flow. So it came down in fiscal 2014, even as you
trimmed your CapEx budget. I guess, as we look ahead with the step up in CapEx and more of the Well Experience
stores, can you give us a sense for how free cash flow of the organization may trend? And the other pieces being just a
little further understanding of where working capital goes and also the relationship with AmerisourceBergen? Thanks.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yes, I'll take that one, Mark. And obviously, we'll have some step up in earnings, so
there will be a positive component of that. I think the majority, if not all of the step up in inventories and – the step up
in accounts payable and receivables resulting from our arrangements, will have already been reflected in 2014, so we
shouldn't see an increase there. I think we need to continue to work at our working capital, so I would expect to be
pushing that down rather than up. And obviously, we've identified that there will be a step up in CapEx for the year.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Just as a follow up then knitting that all together, Tim, are we expecting an increase in free
cash flow, and just any sense for magnitude? Thanks.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yes. I mean, I'd say probably not materially different from what we saw in this year. I
think that's clearly a focus area as we go forward to improve our cash flows, but immediately I don't anticipate that it's
going to be a material change for 2015.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Mark.

Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yes. Good morning, and thank you for the color that you've provided on the call. Just taking
a little bit further, when we think about the headwinds that you expect in fiscal year 2015 and then the cost-cutting
initiative that you're launching or you that launched to offset, can you just help us understand the magnitude, the dollar
magnitude of the headwinds? And we're not looking for line item by line item, but you gave us a number through the
end of fiscal year 2016 for both, if you can just clarify what percent of that is going to materialize over the next 12

months, would be very helpful.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Well, Ricky, maybe I'll start and let Tim weigh in. I think we did say, without giving the
actual numbers, that certainly we wouldn't expect to see a linear progression from what you saw in 2014 through 2016.
I think that's the main thing. I think we do see significant headwinds yet in 2015, and as we said, we think that a lot of
tailwinds that we see will be outweighed by those headwinds with generic inflation persisting and so forth. With that
said, we do feel that we're taking concrete actions now that are giving us confidence that you certainly can hit and
exceed the 2016 goals. But I guess without breaking it down bit by bit, certainly it will not be a linear progression from
2014 to 2016. Tim, any color?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yes, I agree with that. I mean we talked a lot, at risk of repeating what you just said and
what we've said in the script, but that we will experience these short-term headwinds before that will take a big chunk
of the tailwinds that we have coming that will drive us to 2016. In the meantime, and you know we're undertaking
cost-cutting program, we're well into that. How much of it actually will materialize in this year, particularly as we see
the headwinds, we're stepping up the pace on that. So we'll work at accelerating that to the degree we possibly can.
We've already undertaken some hiring freezes and some other actions to reduce the costs for the year.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: So when we think about these cost cuts, and it sounds like hiring freeze is probably going to
cap growth of SG&A rather than take out SG&A, but I mean you talked a little bit about cost cuts coming from kind of
like corporate level expenses. Have you been able to identify some significant cost savings opportunities at the store
level as well? And again, should we think about it more as kind of like a 2016 opportunity?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, Ricky, maybe I'll start with the fact that with Tim coming on as CFO and certainly
the Walgreens Boots Alliance Finance Director, Tim is going to be quarterbacking cost across the group as well as
making sure that we have the targets that we expect and think we need to get. Alex Gourlay, certainly, with taking on
the U.S. business as President-elect will own and be accountable for the WAG business with Mark Wagner who is
coming out of the stores and one of our strong leaders as far as executing will be leading that for Alex. I'll let Alex kind
of give a little color on where he has identified the sources for phase one and then the second and third phases as how
he's kind of looking at. Alex?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi, Ricky. Yes, I think that we see some opportunity in the near-term to really stop spending, as
you said, money which is not really having an impact positively on customers, so the first phase will all be about
protecting the customer end and working back the way. We're pretty confident that we see opportunities we can get into
2015, but we have more work to do to first of all ensure we can and then confirm we can. But we feel pretty good about
that. Then going forward, as you said, the majority of the structural change will happen towards 2016 as we think about
how do we actually set the business up for the future.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Ricky.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Meredith Adler with Eric Percher. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric R. Percher>: Thank you. It's Eric Percher and Meredith Adler from Barclays. A question for Tim and
perhaps Jeff, when you entered the relationship with AmerisourceBergen, you believed generic pricing was inflationary
in trajectory and now you see inflation and it sounds like it's here to stay, Does ABC have a, or Amerisource have a
role to play in offsetting the negative inflationary impact, or does that responsibility really lie with WBAD? And how
has WBAD's game plan changed? You talked about the changes at Walgreens relative to contracting, how have you
changed your manufacturing strategy for an inflationary environment?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes. Jeff.

<A - Jeffrey Berkowitz>: Yes, Meredith. I guess I'll take the second one first, because we've actually got quite a few
things that we've been doing in the short term and that we can do in the longer-term. I think, we continue to believe that
coming together of Walgreens and Alliance Boots as well as the strategic alliance with ABC is providing a long-term
sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace, as Greg had mentioned. Even right now, despite this inflation on
a very small subset of molecules, I think we have to keep in mind that the vast majority of molecules continue to
experience deflation versus the small amount of hyperinflation on a very small amount of molecules.
Just right now WBAD has been able to rollout out a new and enhanced price protection policy with generic
manufacturers that provides actually lengthier protection to Walgreens in an inflationary environment providing more
flexibility for us to develop alternatives and also more time to allow associated dynamics to catch up. I think this
dynamic over the past 12 months has also forced us to tighten the systems and processes and communication between
the teams, so we've enhanced our analytics that now allow us to much more proactively forecast where we may see
inflation which is allowing us to take much more initiative and be preemptive rather than reactive in the face of that
inflation.
In terms of ABC, certainly when you think about the Walgreens Boots Alliance Development organization, WAG, AB,
and ABC, we've really brought together four of the best-in-class generic procurement teams across four companies with
an extremely large amount of volume, which is very important to the generic manufacturers, so the volume and the
relationships that we have with ABC has really helped us continue to manage the dynamic moving forward.
<Q - Eric R. Percher>: And when you see price point, you say price protection is now being built in, can you expand
on what that means and how that comes to play?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Well, I think maybe I'll – Eric, weigh over Jeff that we don't want to go into that too much.
Obviously, we want to make sure we maintain a competitive advantage, but I think what Jeff has done and the team
within WBAD have worked with the manufacturers to give us additional projection as we go forward, it gives us time
to react. But I think I'd like to withhold any more information than that.
<Q - Eric R. Percher>: That's fair. I guess the last question would be do you feel like most of that pressure that's not
structural or product mix is coming from a relatively limited number of manufacturers? And do you think the
movement toward sourcing efforts helped create that push for more inflation?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Well, again, I'll weigh in. I think it's a host of things that have driven that inflation.
Certainly, there's consolidation in the buying space with us and three or four other large buyers buying about 80% to
90% of the generics and at the same time, there's been some consolidation in the supplier. But with that said, I wouldn't
say that's all of it. There are a lot of other dynamics. I see Jeff wanting to weigh in here, that are really at the root cause.
Some of those will be more persistent than others. Jeff?
<A - Jeffrey Berkowitz>: Yes. And I would look at it as more molecule lead than vendor lead. I mean, we continue to
forge very deep relationships at the highest levels and on a global scale with the major generic manufacturers, but the
inflation that we're seeing is really not associated with any one particular vendor. It's really based on the molecule
opportunity where there's harmonization in the portfolio as our manufacturers have supply issues or are pulling out of
molecules where that price opportunity comes, somebody then takes an increase and the others feel some confidence to
follow sometimes later than others. So I'd look at it from a molecule perspective and a supply perspective versus a
vendor perspective where we've developed very deep relationships.
<Q - Eric R. Percher>: That's very helpful. We'll pass it on.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thank you.

<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Thanks, George.
<Q - George R. Hill>: And maybe I'll hop right into it, Jeff. Can you quantify for us, and I'm going to keep coming
back to slide 37 here in the – I'm sorry 33 in the presentation. Can you quantify how many of the payer contracts have
been addressed or how much of the dollar value of the payer contracts has been addressed with respect to generic drug
price inflation, the necessary reimbursement changes that need to be made? Part A, and then I guess part B to my
question would be between Jeff and Tim, if I look at that Walgreens pharmacy red box on slide 33, how much of that
should I think of as at risk or flexible with respect to the company's success in being able to renegotiate some of these
payer contracts?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I'll let Jeff weigh in on the first one and then Tim on as far as contracts.
<A - Jeffrey Berkowitz>: Yes, I'd say our contracts span different contracting strategies depending on who we're
working with, and we sign multiyear agreements that come up over time. As I said earlier, we've already started to
incorporate that protection into our agreements addressing the inflation dynamic and we've already have a proof point
in that we've successfully incorporated some protective language in one of our first major renewals since the dynamic
has taken place. So I think we'll continue to work very closely with our managed care customers over time to help them
understand the dynamic and also help them understand the downstream impact to their own customer and client base as
they need to work with them on the different financials that are taking place in the inflationary market.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: I'll respond to the second part of your question, George. I mean, I think you're referring
to the box called Walgreens pharmacy and identifies the major component piece as being Medicare Part D. I don't
anticipate there's going be material changes. I mean, we will continue to endeavor to mitigate any of these we possibly
can, but I think the Medicare Part D rates are going to continue to decline. I don't see a lot of hope out for that. We are
seeing some of the volume recovery from the Express Scripts a couple years ago, but that's pretty much on pace with
what we had anticipated when we put together this back in August.
The generic inflation, I mean we've talked a lot about that. You have as good a sense for that as we do based upon Jeff's
comments. And again, the commercial reimbursement rate, we continue to try to embed that in the contracts, but it's
unlikely that we're going to go back and get a step up for already inflation. What we would hope that we would
mitigate and minimize is any impact from future inflation.
So I think this is a pretty realistic depiction of what we should anticipate on a going-forward basis. It doesn't mean that
we're every day not out there trying to find ways to offset it through any of these mechanisms. And obviously, as we
talked about, driving cost improvements is another major area that we'll continue to work on.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. So it sounds like there's probably not a lot of upward relief, but maybe we can mitigate
the downward pressure. I guess then just a quick follow-up on that would be with respect to the synergy targets you
guys have highlighted that it's going to be, it's actually a pretty non-linear ramp as we think about 2012. You had a big
step up in 2013. 2014 was a big step up, 2015 is a little flatter. It looks like 2016 is a big step up. Can you provide any
of the color on any the moving pieces, I guess, aside from the close of the deal on what drives the synergy step up in
fiscal 2016? And I'll hop back in the queue with that.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes. So George, maybe I'll, yes, I think certainly I'll start with the fact that the good thing
is the first two years of the program we've exceeded those synergy targets. We still feel confident we'll exceed actually
the $1 billion in 2016. The leveling off, so to speak from what we've seen in 2015 or the slight or lesser increase was
planned. The first couple years, Jeff and team, and John Donovan did a great job getting at the synergies from generic
drug procurement that we talked about.
That was the, I don't want call that easy by any means. Jeff will throw something at me. But I think that's certainly
where we saw the earlier opportunities the first two years. The longer-term synergy opportunities, which are things like
owned brand expansion within the Walgreens front-of-store, front-of-store improvements across both Boots and
Walgreens, we knew were longer-term. We knew they would come in 2015, 2016. Alex has done a terrific job in
building confidence with pilots to help us understand how to grow out some of those opportunities and when they will

come.
So it was planned. We've realized earlier synergy opportunities. That's what we went after first and we feel confident
we'll get the longer-term synergies in 2016. Maybe I'll let Alex give you some proof points as to why we do feel
confident in that slope.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: If I can just, Greg, I'd just interject one thing.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: I mean because I've observed, we observe that there is a flattening going into 2015 of
that synergy level. We stand behind the ultimate objective. We think we're on track to get that. As Greg pointed out, we
did see a little flattening of the curve in 2015. The large piece of that is, and not to diminish all the good work that's
been done by Jeff and the WBAD team, but the first step was drugs and there's a defined specs. There's a defined
limited number of drugs and there's a defined number of manufacturers and suppliers of that. And so going at that, was
what we'll say, I'd say easy or the low-hanging fruit. Not easy but low-hanging fruit.
As we go into the next step, we're expanding the number of items. We're expanding the manufacturers. Now we don't
have defined specs as we get into front-of-store and as we get into goods not for resale, there's just more front-end work
before we're ready to approach the manufacturers. And then there will be in all likelihood some transitions from one
brand to another or from one manufacturer to another. It just takes more time before we can get it. So you'll see a little
bit of flattening still moving forward, but a little bit less more flattening in 2015. And then we'll realize the benefits of a
lot of that good work in 2016 and forward.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I think it's important enough topic I think, Alex, if you can weigh in with some proof
points to give us the confidence that would be helpful, probably.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yes, sure. I mean I think, as I said already, the front-end margin expansion has been driven by a
deliberate strategy, which is to really drive our health, beauty and wellness categories. We were confident because
we're starting see some winning share in the market. And secondly, by working with Alliance Boots team to really
build and drive our own brands, particularly again in health, beauty, and wellness. Both these we're feeling good about.
There's been solid progress made in the market in front of customers as you see by both the market share performance
and also by the margin expansion we've seen in Q3 and now in Q4.
So the signs are there and, as Greg said, we also have a number pilots running in partnership with the AB team, the
relationships there really strong. And when we come together in stage two, I'm really confident that Ken Murphy and
the team who will run new global brands will give us even more power through to the front-end. So as a floor in terms
of margin and is more for testing pilots to make sure that we can actually change consumer behavior, the point that Tim
made that the signs are good and the relationships are strong.

<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: No, they're not down. I mean, we aren't going to see the step up to the level that we've
identified in 2016 relative to 2014, but we aren't anticipating a decline.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: You're not expecting an EBIT decline or flat out in core Walgreen?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Correct.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. Great. And it seems like the synergies, we have $350 million there, we've got savings
here of $1 billion that the $425 million to $460 million, it seems like we're favoring the low end given the challenges in
the business, or am I misreading that?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: I really don't – I mean, we have a range. We still have lots of moving parts. Narrowing
that range is not something we're prepared to commit to at this point either on the downside nor the upside. I think it's a
reasonable range, I think that we've reflected kind of a low-end and a high-end likelihood, and I think at this point we
wouldn't want to make any further comments on it.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. And then, Greg, could you talk a little bit about the culture, a lot of changes at the
company, a lot of cost savings, we've heard some grumblings that people are a little bit nervous. Can you maybe
address the cultural issues?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes. Scott, I think any big merger combination of two iconic brands there's going to be
some degree of angst and that should be expected. I feel good about the culture and how it's coming together and that's
the reason I've actually put some comments in my script about the meeting we had a couple of weeks ago over in Bern
with the new WAG, Walgreen Boots Alliance leadership team coming together, and that was a very, very energizing
couple of days together in Bern.
And I think, Scott, what probably is driving that is, one, we have worked together for a good couple of years now. I
think there's been a lot of cross-pollination, so to speak, already happening. But I also think now that the board has
approved the option, we have certainty now that we are going to bring this together if indeed certainly our shareholders
approve the additional shares, and there is a time instead of years it's months. And I think that's always a good thing. So
I think it starts with Stefano and I. I couldn't ask for a better partner than Stefano. And then certainly the leadership
team coming together like they are, and we've seen over the last couple of weeks, I think is very, very encouraging.
Thanks, Scott.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Hey. Thanks very much. As I look at the tailwinds and headwinds, it seems that they're very
generic when you talk about aging population, et cetera. Greg, is there anything more specific that you think is going to
drive Walgreens next year? For example, are you seeing any changes in commercial narrow networks where you could
pickup an increase in market share? I mean I also noticed that you didn't talk about the Affordable Care Act at all as
being potential tailwind to the future, and I was just also curious as to what you saw in your fiscal 2014 for ACA?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes. Lisa, I think that one of the things that could become greater and greater tailwinds
and I think it's what Jeff was alluding to, our focus on building strategic relationships with more and more payers is
gaining momentum. For example, we're working extremely well with Express Scripts. And as you know, we launched
our Smart90 program with them a while back, we're working together on some unique things. I think other payers'
health systems, we're beginning to gain traction with some of the things we're doing with some of the large health
systems around the country.
As far as ACA, it's still early. I think we're probably seeing 20 bps to 30 bps in lift. So the nearest we can tell, as you
know, there's a lot of moving parts there, a lot of folks move from one plan to another plan, but as best we can see,
we're seeing probably early on about a 20 bps to 30 bps lift in script business. We think that will improve as we go
forward. But I think it'll really come down to what Jeff refers to as market access as we look at more and more access

with pharma or specific products such as specially limited distribution drugs and other things we're doing as well as the
right access with the payer markets in the U.S. I think, we'll begin to build those relationships.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Great. And then just secondly, Tim, we've read the Proxy Statement, you could back into a
number, and I think that you came back out with an 8-K saying that that number you could back into for 2015, really
was assuming that AB was part of the company for the full year. But if we were to back out AB for the half a year, is
that a good number for us to be thinking about for 2015? I know you're not giving specific guidance, but just referring
back to that Proxy Statement, is that something that you're comfortable with?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: We haven't given – you reference half year. We haven't said exactly when we anticipate
closing and there are some other moving parts with respect to the lag, et cetera. I mean, the analysis that Goldman did
was predicated upon our internal plan, so we stand behind those. But the percentage of the year and there's a whole
bunch of things as we consolidate and the results of that and the financing impact and all those sort of things, I don't
think you can simply extrapolate or interpolate from the numbers you've seen.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: So a simple half-year convention probably wouldn't be sufficiently robust analysis to
kind of capture it.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Lisa.
