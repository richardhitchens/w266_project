This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results
prepared in accordance with GAAP. We'll discuss organic sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions, and
divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A, operating profit, net income, and earnings
per share excluding the impact of certain items described in the press release. And a full reconciliation with the
corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted in the For Investors section of our website
at www.colgatepalmolive.com.
We're delighted with our second quarter results, which continue the broad momentum we saw in the first quarter. Our
simple financial strategy has again stood us in good stead. We increased our gross profit margin while at the same time
reducing our overhead expenses. This allowed us to increase our advertising to drive the top line and still increase
operating profit, both on a dollar basis and as a percent of sales. And of particular note was our 70 basis point increase
in advertising as a percentage of net sales versus the year-ago period, the largest increase in three years. Our advertising
ratio was up in every division and allowed us to support a very robust innovation program. As Ian mentioned in the
press release, our new product pipeline is full. So that should bode well for the remainder of the year, and you'll hear
about some exciting upcoming launches as I review the divisions.
In addition to a healthy P&L, our balance sheet is solid and our cash generation strong. As Ian remarked, our global
growth and efficiency program is proceeding smoothly as well as our ongoing funding the growth program, and both
these initiatives provide substantial savings opportunity so that we can continue to invest in the business.
So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. We're very pleased with our continued strong results in this
region. As referenced in the press release, we have good market share progress with increases across several categories.
Of particular note was our launch in May of Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield mouthwash. As we told you last
quarter, this has been introduced with a regimen concept and displayed with a companion toothpaste and toothbrush
under the same brand name. Across the country, we had record regimen displays in-store, and in June, just one month
after launch, we had over a 5 share for Total mouthwash with an overall mouthwash share of 8.4%.
As you would expect, we had a very robust integrated marketing support plan, which included television, sampling,
in-store activity, digital, and PR campaigns. In addition, we implemented a strong professional plan with both large
pumps and small patient samples in dentist's offices. Our field consultants communicated the product benefits such as
12-hour anti-bacterial protection even after eating and drinking, with clear impactful sales materials. Our share of
Colgate Total toothpaste also benefited from the strong display activity, increasing from 10.5% pre-launch to 11.5%
post-launch.
New product activities continue in this quarter. In the toothpaste category, we are launching Colgate MaxFresh Cool
Scrub and Colgate Sensitive SmartFoam with Whitening. Colgate MaxFresh Cool Scrub builds on the strong franchise
that the MaxFresh brand holds in the Fresh Breath segment. The freshening segment is large and appealing to young
consumers, particularly in the 18- to 24-year range. This new variant has micro-scrubbers for a freshness you can feel.
During brushing, vigorous silica particles provide a micro-scrubbing sensation as they gradually diminish. The pack
itself calls out the benefit with a tagline, "Destroys Bad Breath Bacteria from Teeth & Tongue."
Our new sensitivity toothpaste builds on the insight that consumers understand that formulas with foaming technology
have the capacity to get to tough-to-reach spaces while brushing to help provide sensitivity relief with the additional
benefits of whitening and fresh breath. Colgate Sensitive SmartFoam provides 30% more foam than our existing
sensitivity toothpaste, along with a maximum-strength anti-sensitivity ingredient. It's also formulated with
high-performance cleaning silica to remove surface stains and help keep teeth whiter. Additionally, this is an exciting
opportunity as both the premium-price sensitive and whitening segments are growing faster than the toothpaste
category overall.
In toothbrushes, we're very excited about the launch of Colgate SlimSoft. This product was first launched in Asia and
has garnered strong shares in several markets. In Hong Kong for instance, it has a 15.6% year-to-date share, and in
Thailand, almost 10%. The toothbrush has 17 times slimmer tipped bristles for a deep clean. The unique bristles
provide a six times deeper reach than end-rounded regular bristles. And the higher-density bristles provide a unique
feel, and the handle is flexible and ergonomic. As we told you in the press release, we recently achieved brand market

leadership in manual toothbrushes, and this should help extend that leadership going forward.
Turning then to Europe South Pacific, we are pleased with our results in this region given the very challenging
macroeconomic environment. As you well know, GDP growth rates are low to negative and unemployment is high,
particularly in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Greece. Consumer confidence is low and consumers are looking
for value. While category growth is slowing, our market shares across Europe are doing well, with increases in
toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, and fabric softener. Two of our acquired businesses, GABA and Sanex, are also
doing very well. Both now are fully integrated, and we continue to gain learnings and innovation ideas from these two
high-margin businesses.
In toothpaste, we increased market share year-to-date in our four biggest countries, France, Germany, Italy, and the
U.K. And pleasingly in the U.K., our share read for the last two periods was over 50% despite a highly competitive
market. In manual toothbrushes, we increased share in all but the U.K. where, although the share is modestly down on a
year-to-date basis, we reached a record share of 33.6% in the most recent period.
We will continue to offer our consumers innovative products at all price points. We have some exciting innovation
providing added value at higher price points. Under the Elmex brand, we are launching Colgate elmex Sensitive Gentle
Whitening toothpaste, which provides effective protection and gentle care for sensitivity sufferers with the additional
whitening benefit. And a new fabric conditioner, Soupline Perfect Glide should help can continue the good momentum
we have seen across the region in this business. To lessen the chore of ironing, Soupline Perfect Glide has a unique
formula with a polymer, which allows for easier ironing while delivering an explosion of fresh fragrance.
As I mentioned a moment ago, increasingly the consumer is also looking for value, to that end, we are now
re-launching our base Colgate toothpaste business across the region. The six variants, Colgate cavity protection,
Colgate Triple Action, Colgate anti-tartar, Colgate herbal original, white, and gums will all have new modernized
designs at affordable price points, an important initiative for a segment which still represents almost 30% of our
business. Similarly, in personal care, we are launching Palmolive essential body wash. This line will be smaller sizes at
a lower price, providing the value conscious consumer with the affordable luxury of appealing fragrances along with
the quality assurance of the Palmolive brand.
Latin America. Latin America continues to deliver solid results with another quarter of strong organic sales growth, and
as elsewhere, new product activity has been an important driver of our business, and this is across all price points. In
addition to the market share gains referenced in the press release, our market share has increased in underarm
protection and bar soaps. In Brazil, our toothpaste market share was up 80 basis points on a year-to-date basis to 71.7%,
the highest level in 15 years with the most recent read at 71.9%. Both higher-priced products, such as Colgate
Luminous White and value-priced products in the Sorriso, range have contributed to the share gain.
In Mexico, our share is still well over 80% at 81.5% on a year-to-date basis with the most recent read at 82%. And
we're now market leader in manual toothbrushes in every country across the region, including Mexico. Our share in
Mexico was up 220 basis points year-to-date to 44.2%. In Brazil, we achieved a record 31.7% on a year-to-date basis,
up 110 basis points. And we've achieved strong results, both in the premium segment in the modern trade as well as in
the indirect trade, where we have been driving distribution and visibility in a retail environment which still represents
50% of the market. In mouthwash, our market share across the region is up 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis, and
we're now less than 3 points from the market leader, whose share has steadily declined over the last four years. In
Mexico, we've reached a record 23.6%, up almost 2 full points on a year-to-date basis, with the most recent share at
24.7%. A new smaller 60 ml size has helped to drive per capita consumption and category penetration.
We're continuing with more new product activity in the third quarter. As you know across the region, Colgate
Luminous White toothpaste has met with great success. The whitening segment is the fastest growing, and Colgate
Luminous White is the number one whitening brand in Latin America. This month, we've launched Colgate Luminous
White Advanced in Mexico. This toothpaste was developed from the insight that many consumers believe only a
professional whitening treatment can provide visible results. It intensifies the whiteness of teeth three shades whiter
with a unique formula that contains the same ingredients that dentists use. At the same time, in Brazil, we are
re-launching Colgate Luminous White Enamel Shine with whitening accelerators in a gel formula that also delivers a

shinier smile.
In the mouthwash category, we're launching a new Colgate Plax 2-in-1 in Brazil. This product delivers clean and fresh
breath and actually shows you how it works. It contains a unique dual liquid formula that is activated by shaking and
mixing the two liquids. Its electrostatic action removes particles from your mouth, and its antibacterial action fights
bacteria that cause plaque and bad breath. So when you rinse out, you see the product work with what's in the sink.
In the personal care category, we're introducing Protex Men Power Shower gel and soap in September in Brazil. This
builds on the Protex Men's series launched last year, which is already the number one variant in the rapidly growing
men's body cleansing segment. Both bar soap and shower gel offer 10 times more protection against odor causing
bacteria than ordinary soaps, along with a high-impact fragrance especially developed for the male consumer.
Turning then to Greater Asia/Africa, excellent momentum continues in this region. A strong increase in gross margin
allowed us to increase advertising substantially behind new products, resulting in strong organic sales and market share
increases. As referenced in the press release, our toothpaste shares increased in many markets. In India, our market
share was up over 100 basis points to a record 54.2% on a year-to-date basis. We achieved gains both in the value and
premium segments of the market. In China, our market share increased 90 basis points to 34.4% on a year-to-date basis.
And in Russia, the launch of Colgate Optic White drove our share to 33.1% on a year-to-date basis, up 130 basis points,
with the latest reading at 33.5%. We continue to grow our market-leading manual toothbrush share in India, up almost
3 points to 41.3%, with our latest read at 41.5%. Recent programs focused on increasing our distribution in the rural
areas of this vast market have contributed to this success.
So, we'll continue to launch new products for the balance of the year to help us continue to deliver solid results. In the
toothpaste category, we will be launching Colgate 360° Enamel, an incremental line extension to our Colgate 360°
toothpaste range in China, which repairs and protects enamel through the reduction of erosion caused by bacteria. In the
manual toothbrush category, we will be launching Colgate 360° Interdental in select markets. This line extension
provides consumers with four times more deeper reach due to its Floss Tip bristles. And of course, as with other
Colgate 360° toothbrushes, it features a wrap-around tongue and cheek cleaner.
In mouthwash in Vietnam and China, we will be launching Plax Herbal Salt, which addresses local consumer desires
for this key flavor profile while also delivering long-lasting fresh breath and reduced bacteria accumulation in the
mouth. In both these markets, our mouthwash share is up strongly on a year-to-date basis, and this new product should
help continue the trend. In shower gels, we are very excited about the launch of Palmolive Gourmet Spa in Russia and
Turkey, where we saw increased market share on a year-to-date basis in both markets. This new range has tempting
aromas and wonderfully soft textures, encouraging the consumer to immerse herself in the ultimate indulging escape. It
comes in the following variants: Enticing Chocolate Veil enriched with dark chocolate and cocoa bean extract, Tender
French Vanilla with sweet vanilla extract, and Delicious Strawberry Smoothie infused with strawberry juice.
Lastly, Hill's. We are particularly encouraged with Hill's performance and the fact that we delivered volume growth one
quarter ahead of schedule behind three important initiatives. Our new product activity across our brands has been very
well received by the trade, the profession, and the consumer. Our first initiative, Ideal Balance, which started shipping
in May in the U.S., has done very well. The placement in the Naturals aisles is – in the pet superstores has been ahead
of plan and should be completed by the end of August. Year-over-year consumption is up at both PETCO and
PetSmart, and we've been working very closely with both retailers to drive results. We've had a full marketing
campaign including TV and digital media as well as a widespread consumer sampling program. In addition to the dry
and wet dog and cat food, we added canine and feline treats in June to complete the line. And we're continuing our
media investment in the third quarter, and we'll add more high-impact in-store displays in September.
The second initiative has been the re-launch of our Science Diet line. At the end of the quarter, we added three new cat
products and two new dog products, Adult Grain-Free Cat, Adult Indoor Long Coat Cat, Senior Indoor Age-Defying
Cat, Adult Grain-Free Dog, and Senior Small and Toy Breed Age-Defying Dog. We anticipate that these will be in a
full distribution by the end of August. In-store support has included nutrition consultants who explain the particular
benefit of each diet to the shopper.

Our third initiative is the launch of Prescription Diet Metabolic, both in the U.S. and overseas. This unique diet to help
achieve weight loss in dogs and cats is doing well globally, exceeding all targets and budgets. The repeat rates have
been excellent, and the launch is driving category growth in the U.S. and overseas. So, we'll continue to focus on these
very important new product initiatives in the third quarter, supported of course with the continuation of our
comprehensive integrated marketing campaigns.
So in summary, we are very pleased with the continued momentum in our business around the world. Our new product
pipeline is as full as it has ever been, and that should help continue to drive sales and market shares in both developed
and emerging markets. Our simple financial strategy and sharply focused initiatives are serving us well. In addition, our
global growth and efficiency program is on track to provide even greater opportunities for investments. Colgate people
around the world are working hard to deliver our results, and we look forward to sharing those results with you as we
go through the balance of the year. So that's all I had for prepared remarks, Sarah, if we can open up the line to
questions.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Joe B. Lachky>: Hi, thanks. Just first off on your guidance, the EPS outlook that you mentioned in the press
release, I just wanted to verify that was solely due to foreign exchange in Venezuela. And then secondarily, along the
guidance lines, I just wanted to verify your outlook on organic growth. You mentioned 6% to 7%, Europe 5.5%
year-to-date. I guess you got a little bit easier comps in the second half, but I wanted to hear your outlook on that. And
then also if you could talk about your 30 to 70 basis points of gross margin improvement that you're expecting.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks for the one question, Joe. So to come to the points on guidance, you are absolutely
correct. Indeed, we've already seen some notes where folks have picked that up. It is entirely due to Venezuela, which
is unchanged from what we told you earlier in the year, and the additional 1% reduction in the range is due to the
foreign exchange volatility and the strengthening of the dollar we saw in the last four to six weeks of the quarter, and is
predicated against the current spot rates.
The growth part of your question, I think, merits a little bit of – a little bit of perspective. As you might suppose, we are
pleased with the fact that as a company, we have this quarter between 53% and 54% of our worldwide sales in the
higher-growth emerging markets. But we also believe that the decisions we took some 30 years ago to focus on the
categories in which we do business continued to be a positive factor in the sense that we are marketing products that are
everyday use products for people brushing their teeth, cleaning their bodies, looking after their homes, and indeed,
caring for their pets. So, we think the category choice is durable.
Now when you look around the world, as we have said on many previous calls, we continue to see the U.S. categories
grow low single digits. We continue to see Europe grow extremely low single digits. Indeed, some of the categories are
flat and some are modestly negative, not new news, and something that we have been factoring into our planning for
some time. When you turn to the emerging markets, notwithstanding the macro news that we have been reading about,
our data so far shows that those categories continue to maintain high single digit growth rates, which is very pleasing.
And of course, we're focused very, very closely on seeing whether any of that macro commentary turns into category
pressure for our businesses.
But that being said, even with that, we are reaffirming our 6% to 7% organic growth rate for the year. As Bina said
earlier, our new product pipeline already executed in the market, and the ones that Bina mentioned for the balance of
the year, is extremely strong. Secondly, we are encouraged by our market share progress around the world, which
obviously gives you incremental growth beyond the category growth. And third, our Hill's business, which we had
expectation to turn positive in the second half of the year, has indeed done so with a faster start than we were expecting,
and we get that benefit for the balance of the year. And finally, as many of you have already noted, our comparisons in

the second half from an organic top line point of view are somewhat easier than they were in the first half of the year.
And then finally, on gross profit, let me take this opportunity to run through the second quarter gross profit to
roll-forward. So, if you start with 57.9%, which was the second quarter gross profit in the prior year, pricing gave us 40
basis points, funding the growth, following our usual pattern where second quarter funding the growth steps up from
the first, was 210 basis points, actually better than what we delivered in 2012. Material prices were a headwind of 180
basis points, and the combination of that and the pricing gives us the 70-basis point growth that we saw in the second
quarter. And, yes, we are very much staying with our gross profit guidance of 30 basis points to 70 basis points. And of
course, extremely pleased with the year-to-date progress at the higher-end of that range.
And there's one other thing I should add relative to the gross margin and also relative to the earnings guidance because
of the currency volatility, and that is, our plans for the balance of the year, of course, have us offsetting the transaction
impact of foreign exchange in order to continue that gross margin progress. That's the end of the answer.
Operator
And moving on, we'll take a question from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi, and good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey, it was a monster operating margin quarter in North America. So can you just
[indiscernible] (26:30) dig a little deeper into what drove that, and maybe sort of how sustainable that almost 30%
operating margin is, here in the home market?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, well, we were indeed very, very pleased with – I assume monster means good.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Yeah.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. We were very pleased with the progress in the U.S. Obviously it traces back, as you'd
already have seen, to the gross margin which expanded extremely helpfully. And as we said in the release, that gross
margin, obviously used to fund advertising investment, and indeed fund a little bit of stepped-up debt for promotional
activity, which most of you have seen as we came towards the end of the quarter, which comes nicely back to the top
line. And then, good control of non-variables in the geography. So certainly, our expectation in our U.S. business is to
sustain the growth in our gross margin. Whether it will be as strong as the first half of the year, which indeed was
extraordinarily strong, we will have to see. But our plans in a relatively benign commodity cost environment, with our
traditional strong funding the growth program, as we look forward, sees us with continued strong gross margin
progress.
Operator
And moving on, we'll hear from John Faucher of JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Yes, thank you very much.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Good morning, Ian. Obviously, you guys are holding in better than generally what we're
seeing coming out of consumers in Brazil, where it looks as though we're getting sort of a stagflation type of
environment there. So can you talk specifically about whether it's stuff you're doing? Is it categories, where we're
seeing your categories just more resilient relative to maybe what we're seeing on the food and beverage side? And can
you talk about sort of the ability, you talked about transactional pricing to cover transactional FX. Can you talk about
the ability to get further pricing through in that market? Thanks.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, John. The – well, I guess the headlines would be, and indeed, that was the point I was
trying to make in talking about the categories in response to the first question. We do think there is a difference
between an everyday health and wellness and, indeed in Brazil, pet nutrition business, to perhaps more discretionary
types of categories. As we even saw during the sub-prime, you will remember, we talked about it that people stayed
with behavior in Brazil, and we use Brazil as an example. And they did not trade down. They stayed if they were
buying one of our premium offerings, as indeed they are buying Optic White today. They stayed with those premium
offerings because they saw value in the benefit they were given, number one.
Number two, without being too self-effacing, we believe that the combination of the innovation and the marketing
programs that we have in the emerging geographies, Brazil being a very good example, outsizing, outpricing the way
we distribute, the visibility we focus on at retail when we distribute, the timing of our promotions, all things that sound
extremely fundamental and extremely basic, and they are. But we believe doing them well makes a difference in terms
of continuing to reach all of your consumers in the different areas of the country at the different price points that they
buy, and making sure you keep that consumer connected to you. And finally, indeed as we speak, in many markets, we
have and continue to move with pricing to the degree necessary to offset the transaction impact.
Operator
And up next, we'll take a question from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: Hi. I have some more questions about Latin America. I think you had said in the first
quarter that if you were to take Venezuela out, your Latin American operating margins were up. Is that true of the
second quarter as well? And then as a follow-up to your comments about Brazil, can you give us any sense of how
much your volume was up there alone, and how much pricing you're taking in Brazil? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Alice, in response to your comment, the answer to the first question is the same answer as it was
in the first quarter. So absolutely yes, and the answer to the second question is no.
Operator
And then our next question will come from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Ali?
Operator
Ali, your line is open. If you could check your mute function or pick up your handset?
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi, sorry, I'll pick up. Just wanted to ask a quick follow-up question and then get to the real question
on Hill's. You mentioned a little – a few questions ago that you're offsetting the transactional impact of currencies by
taking pricing. But if 4.5% to 5.5% all-in EPS growth is still double-digit constant currency EPS growth, it would seem
that the top line impact of currencies is less than the bottom line impact of currencies. So, I'd love some clarification on
kind of that answer you gave a little while ago. But the real question though for me is on Hill's, which, to your point,
has clearly started to grow the top line again. But margins were down a couple of hundred basis points for the first half
of the year, and of course that's some launch investments that's clearly higher ingredient cost as you're growing more
natural. But I just wanted to get a sense from you about what you think the run rate Hill's margins should be going
forward, and what's the kind of complement in top line growth you expect with that margin? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, Ali, you're – and we've, I think, at least around the edges, had this discussion before.
The impact on the top line of the foreign exchange is about 3%, 3.5%, and the impact on the bottom line is about 1
percentage point more than that, for reasons of geographic mix and dollar-denominated corporate overhead and factors
like that. So, there is a difference and that's the case there.

Hill's, again I repeat, we are extremely pleased. We think we have the right innovation to build the true naturals entry
that we have with Ideal Balance, to stabilize and rebuild our everyday wellness product in Science Diet, and to continue
to advance with clinically-proven therapeutic efficacy our prescription product, Prescription Diet. As we have said a
couple of times, but certainly in the first quarter, moving to Ideal Balance and relaunching the Science Diet product
was a choiceful investment in formulation to be successful and competitive and regrow the business, and that is job
number one. I think we have said that our expectation on the Hill's business is to bring that business back to mid-single
digits organic growth pace. And without getting into the specifics, you can rest assured that there is a very
well-thought-through plan embedded in our strategic planning to rebuild the Hill's gross margin over a period of time.

Our next question today comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thanks, good morning. Just on margins and more specifically -- Hi. On margins, and more
specifically, Latin America and Europe, you guys said funding-the-growth press release is benefiting both regions and
other reasons as well. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more in detail about how big that might have
been relative to other regions? Because I was kind of surprised that you didn't see more of a hit in LatAm given the FX,
and that European margins were up given the negative pricing. And then just following up on European pricing, given
your plans behind, like, base Colgate and smaller sizes of Palmolive Essentials, do you expect pricing to remain
negative in Europe in the back half of the year? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: The – no, our funding the growth has been effective in most geographies. Remember, the drag in
Latin America, as we said in the release, is really Venezuela. When you look at Europe, the benefit there is indeed
commodities and our funding-the-growth program. And I think we made the point in Europe, we also saw nice progress
on the overhead reduction plan that we have. So that would answer the question on Europe. What was the last?
<Q - Olivia Tong>: It was European pricing, what you're expecting to offer for the second half.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Europe is a very tough environment. And I think it would be fair to say that in that environment,
the expectation built into our plan continues to show modestly negative pricing in Europe. I would say that the
innovation spread that we have across all price points, which is to say our premium innovation and the value
innovations that Bina mentioned, is not in any way gross margin dilutive.

And moving on, we'll hear from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey Bill.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Just a follow-up on – hey, how are you? A question on Hill's. I mean I don't fully
understand why it improved at kind of a quarter ahead of expectations. Because I think you outlined a lot of the
initiatives which really didn't kick in until mid or even end of the quarter. So was it, category is rebounding? Or were
there other things that are really driving it? Thanks so much.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, Bill, it really is that obviously, given the time we have waited for this, we wanted to be
thoughtful about stating when we would see the turn. The preliminary plans we had showed activity leading to a result
in the third quarter. The fact of the matter is, working very closely with those two major retailers, PETCO and
PetSmart, the execution was accomplished slightly faster than planned and with good effect, as you see. And then as
Bina mentioned also, we have now followed that up with a lot of innovation to follow the base innovation towards the
end of the second quarter and into the third quarter to keep that momentum going, with continued support from those
retail partners. So it really is that simple. The execution was just accomplished a little bit quicker than we had originally

We'll hear next from Ian Gordon of S&P Capital IQ.
<Q - Ian J. Gordon>: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to understand the interplay between the volumes and the pricing
in North America a little better. I think it's first quarter and a year and a half with pricing down, but obviously the
volumes were great. So how much of this is consumers responding better to some of the increased promotional activity
versus, say, investments in trial building, that are bearing fruit versus mix or something else? And then, what is
electrostatic action in toothpastes? That sounds interesting.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay. Well, first of all, a great name, so I'll take a long time answering this question, Ian. The
answer in North America is exactly as you suppose, which is that it is trial building behind innovation that we have.
Remember, in the U.S., couponing is also included in pricing, and that is a very important vehicle in conjunction with
retailers to build trial. And I mentioned, given some of the marketplace activity we were facing, we indeed stepped up
our promotional activity selectively. And we like, as you say the balance we got for that price versus the growth. And
of course, we still saw a terrific expansion in gross margin.
And we've been saying for quite a long time on these calls that when you think about engaging the consumer,
particularly in the developed markets, you can have very strong brand-building programs that would be reflected in
price and run in retail environments. And whilst you've also seen our traditional advertising and promotion increase, it
is a great way, working with the retailers, to build trial for innovation, and you can expect to see that continue out in
time. And electrostatic action is good for you.

And our next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.
<Q - Caroline Shan Levy>: Good morning, everybody. Just wondering, if you continue to see such good top line
momentum, particularly in the volume mix, whether you would look to reinvest any profit upside in the fourth quarter
behind any big ideas that you're working on, or even in the third quarter?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, we – Caroline, we'll let you know in October and January. But clearly, I think the stance we
have taken, exactly as Bina said, is to try and execute our financial strategy to the benefit of the business, which is,
continue to see our gross margin expand, continue to manage our overheads very tightly, and of course, as the global
growth and efficiency program works its way forward, we will see increased benefit from that so that we can do
precisely that, which is to take up our advertising expenditure behind building brands and our overall commercial
expenditure behind the same objectives.

We'll move to a question from Michael Steib of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning again.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Can you give us the actual growth rates of some of the bigger emerging markets? China, India,
Brazil, and so forth?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: No, I wouldn't get into that level of detail. I will say, you could say for those markets that you just
raised, they were all double-digit organic growth rates.

Moving on, we'll hear from Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital.
<Q - Connie Maneaty>: Good morning. I have a question on Hill's. Could you comment on the early market share
read you have for the combination of Science Diet and Ideal Balance? And is Science Diet in particular gaining share?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: The Science Diet is basically flat on market share at this stage. Ideal Balance is building share.
The real important data, Connie, is going to be in the fourth quarter, when we start to get the trial and repeat for both of
those products, and that will shape our investment stance going forward. It really is a little bit early given the nature of
those businesses to see anything dramatic. So far the trends are good. Key for me is going to be trial and repeat, and we
won't have that until the fourth quarter.

And from Barclays, we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Lauren.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Hey, so two things because everyone's asking more than one question. First is just, I
thought you guys were relaunching Total in some countries in Latin America this quarter, just it wasn't mentioned, so I
just wanted to know if that happened, and impact it may or may not have had. And the second thing was just on pricing.
I know particularly in North America, you commented on your choice to increase promotional activity. But overall,
with your focus on pricing analytics, pricing had been a pretty big contributor to the top line last year. Europe, you've
done a really great job getting it to be a bit less negative, and then it kind of dipped down 3% again this quarter. So,
maybe tough to look at from such a big picture standpoint, not in each market, but from here, is pricing a bit less of a
benefit as, kind of, pricing analytics work you've done maxed out its potential in terms of incremental contribution to
top line? Or is this quarter a little bit more of a one-off?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I would say, first of all, let me answer the sort of factual easy question. Total relaunch, we have a
new Total variant called Total Gum Health, which is what is moving around the world, and the initial market response
has been pretty good, but that is still in the process of rolling out. And to be candid, we simply just didn't mention it,
not for any negative reason. It's still moving, I guess, is the point.
And no, absolutely not, from the pricing analysis point of view. We do think this quarter was a one-off, particularly in
the U.S., given the innovation flow that we had and the trial that we were seeking to build behind the mouthwash that
we really just launched slap-bang in the middle of the second quarter. We're using it very assiduously. We are
obviously using it to help us guide how we take the pricing in the emerging markets to offset the transaction impact on
cost. So no, it has neither less focus nor less utilization, and it will continue to guide our pricing actions for the balance
of this year, and of course into 2014 and beyond.
Operator
Our next question comes from Javier Escalante of Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Hi. Good morning, everyone. My question is also on pricing, but it has to do with Europe. It's
a little bit on – a follow-up on Lauren's, and it has to do with – pricing has been negative actually for a long time. And
if you can comment on, number one, whether it's a specific part of the portfolio, I suspect that it may be the household
product part of the portfolio. And if so, will you consider, after a couple of years of negative pricing, of making some
divestitures in that part of the portfolio? Thank you.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Javier, let me – first of all, let me answer the end of the question, which is divestitures. The
answer is no. We think that Europe, particularly now over the last several years, has been a very difficult environment
with the consumer, and indeed with customers who are looking for store traffic. So, in the end from a European point of
view, our planning assumes limited growth in that geography for the foreseeable future. And you may remember that
when we announced the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, and indeed with the plans that you have already seen
implemented, there is a very strong bias to getting our structural costs in the right shape in order to get what growth is
reasonably available in Europe and deliver a reasonable bottom line. So what you're going to see – you saw the gross
margin this quarter benefit, and the focus will be on equally reducing our overheads.
The other point to make in Europe, and again we have said this before, not just for us but for many, there is a bias to
activity at the retail level which gets captured in commercial spend, not in the traditional A&P. So you are seeing that
too. And we believe that at some stage Europe will come back, but as we have said many times, it is not in our
immediate planning horizon. So, we are focusing on growth that is reasonable, delivered by commercial spend in
totality, while building gross margin and lowering overhead, and that's going to continue to be our focus in Europe with
all of the categories that we compete in today.

[Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Thanks, and good morning, everybody.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: You see – Ian, you described the inputted cost environment as benign, and I guess that sort
of bears out in the continued expectation for 30 bps to 70 bps of gross margin expansion. I guess I'm just curious, given
the current level of oil, does that at some point flow through, maybe not this year but next year? And then maybe just
comment a bit on broader sort of input cost bucket puts and takes. And then if you could just remind what the oil
expectations were for the original budget in 2013, that would be helpful.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, to answer the second question first, and it hasn't changed, we had 110 in our original
budget, so not a factor this year. And given the performance of oil in the world, I think we should defer any discussion
about 2014 until we are a little bit closer. Yes, the cost environment is benign, as many have seen. I will make one
observation and that is, you will remember three years ago and before, it used to be the case that when foreign
exchange strengthened, commodities went the other way. We're not seeing that, and we haven't seen that for a couple of
years. So while benign, still elevated and no big correction down in a strengthening foreign exchange environment. So
again, we focus on all of the things, the pricing, the mix, the funding, the growth, and to the extent that global growth
and efficiency will benefit our gross margin to offset and continue to build that gross margin.

And with that, we have no further questions from our telephone audience.
