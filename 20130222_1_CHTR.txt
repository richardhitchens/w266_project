MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello, my name is Dawn, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to
Charter's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you.
I would now turn the call over to Robin Gutzler. You may begin your conference.
Robin Gutzler
Thank you, Dawn. Good morning everyone. And welcome to Charter's 2012 fourth quarter earnings call. This morning,
we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results.
Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K. We will not review those risk factors and other
cautionary statements on this call. However, we do encourage you to read them carefully.
Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's
current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional
forward-looking statements in the future.

During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this
morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures
with similar titles used by other companies.
In today's release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP, as well as pro forma results for 2011. The pro forma
results reflect the acquisition of certain cable systems in 2011, as if they had occurred on January 1, 2011, unless
otherwise noted. The year-over-year growth rates we will be referring to this morning are on a pro forma basis.
Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. The presentation that
accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under Financial Information. The press release
and trending schedules are also posted on our website under Investor & News Center.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thank you, Robin. Over the past year, we implemented a new strategy for Charter in terms of providing a superior
product, reorganizing the business and how we price and package our products. We have made significant progress. We
accelerated our underlying subscription revenue growth. We grew revenue over 4% in the fourth quarter of 2012, and
our growth rate was increasing during the quarter. We also added 20,000 residential customer relationships compared
to 5,000 in the prior year, our best fourth quarter performance in 10 years. And we gained nearly 110,000 residential
customer relationships over the past 12 months.
While our video subscription units declined in the quarter, we lost fewer units than we did a year ago, and the quality of
our video customer base and the video packages we're selling are significantly better. In fact, if you include limited
basic video customer losses – if you exclude video – limited video customer losses, our video losses were just 12,000
for all of 2012.
Our triple-play connect rate in the quarter was 36% of video connects, which is a significant improvement. And we've
seen selling in the past few weeks get as high as 50%, which is where we'd like to be consistently. Triple-play ARPU at
acquisition during Q4 was $120, despite our $90 promotional price, indicating a higher sell in rate of ancillary services.
And in just six months, 30% of our total customer base is now on our new pricing and packaging, which means these
customers are receiving a truly competitive product, are less likely to drive transactions, are less likely to churn and
were either migrated into full pricing or will be stepping up after the promotional period. Fundamentally, we're getting
a better return on our investment for newly acquired customers.
On the commercial side, we continue to drive revenue growth for the year by over 20%. Even with all of the operating
changes and investments, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 1.7% in the quarter. Our objective is to do much more over
time, now that we've completed our organizational changes.
On our last call, I outlined the many changes we're making in our business, but we're also making the appropriate
investments to take better care of our customers and our key strategic asset, our two-way plant. Not only will these
investments normalize over time, but they position us for faster residential top line growth, which we're starting to see.
In 2013, we'll focus on four key areas to further our objectives and deliver more for our customers.
First, we're going to continue to leverage our two-way interactive high-capacity plant, which is competitively superior
to the vast majority of our footprint. This includes maintaining superiority on our Internet speed and reliability, and
continued catch-up plant maintenance, so we can deliver a superior product that increases the inherent architectural
advantage of our two-way plant. This allows us to differentiate ourselves from satellite and telco and take share.
Another way to increase our competitive advantage is to go all-digital by the end of 2014. In essence, we've already
gone all-digital from a go-to-market perspective, as we stopped actively marketing analog service in the middle of last
year.

And we'll continue to go all-digital in a variety of ways, including continued analog channel reductions and
prioritization of specific regions for full digitalization now, where the benefits already outweigh the costs.
Through digitization, we unburden the plant for more HD and DOCSIS 3.0 channels and make ourselves even more
competitive with a superior high-capacity infrastructure. And we're going to do that predominately with fully
functioning set-top boxes rather than D2As in order to offer a better user interface, use our two-way advantage and
generate more revenue with a better ROI, particularly as we buy new boxes at lower costs.
A second key objective is to spend more time on our product and feature development. We're working on developing a
cloud-based user interface and search service that will move key product and service functionality out of the set-top
box and into the network.
The goal is to enable high-quality, low-cost, two-way set-top box purchases and extend the life of our set-top boxes
already deployed. We'll also put the building blocks in place to take more control of our customer interfaces across
varying devices and platforms. An early example of that will be streaming to smart devices and a companion remote
application and we've procured content rights to stream both inside and outside the home.
While we'll develop new products, interfaces and applications, the key thing to remember is that the largest value driver
at Charter is our operating strategy, execution on fundamentals and getting our video, Internet and phone products into
the roughly 7 million passings we have in front of us. And finally, we'll continue to capitalize on the $9.5 billion
commercial market within our footprint, a business that remains in its early stages and has a significant room for
additional growth.
Before I wrap up and turn the call over to Chris to give fourth quarter details, I'd like to mention the deal we recently
announced to acquire the former Bresnan properties from Cablevision. These markets are similar to Charter in terms of
demographic profile and competitive overlap. The operations have been structured the same as what we are implanting
today at Charter: pricing and packaging, product improvements, organizational design and network configuration, only
the Bresnan properties are two years ahead of Charter in terms of implementation.
The capital to position Bresnan has been spent over the past two years and is now declining. And the asset is growing at
a faster rate than almost any cable system in the United States. So, we're getting an asset that's accretive to free cash
flow and well-positioned to grow, all of which means that this acquisition is a good fit and we're looking forward to
incorporating the team and its operations into Charter.
After a year at Charter, we are where I expected us to be at this stage, offering a fully competitive product and service
suite, focusing on the fundamentals and taking care of our customers, all of which increasingly puts us in a position to
grow faster.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris Winfrey.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom. Before I get into the financial results, I'd like to mention a few reporting changes we've made. We
changed our homes passed and penetration disclosure to include commercial establishments in addition to residential,
to be more consistent with our peers. And we've made some changes to our expense reporting categories in order to
more closely mirror how we organize and manage the business and we hope you'll find those helpful. We've reflected
both of these changes in prior periods for ease of comparison.
And now turning to slide 5: looking at customer trends, we improved our video performance in the fourth quarter. We
lost 36,000 video customers down from 44,000 a year ago. Despite no longer actively selling analog, we saw a
year-on-year improvement in video customer trends, evidence that the new approach and improved product offering is
gaining traction.

As Tom mentioned, our full-year expanded basic customer trend significantly improved and we're continuing to make
progress on retooling many of our sales channels, now growing those in a substantially new form. We added 54,000
Internet customers during the quarter, inline with our strategy of taking a more bundled approach.
And recall that in the fourth quarter of 2011, we had a $20 standalone Internet offer in 2011 and a low price two-play
Internet and phone offer in the market, which drove Internet volume.
In the fourth quarter of 2012, we grew our phone customers by 34,000, better than last year, which had the low price
two-play offer, but phone still has room to grow.
Under the new offer strategy, customers are buying more of our product and that leads to a higher quality relationship.
You can see that higher quality in the product taken and the increased triple-play penetration. And, while we're
acquiring new customers at introductory rates, we're doing so without reducing our average revenue per customer,
which totaled just under $106 in Q4. And we already see benefits in non-pay and competitive churn.
Looking at slide 6: we grew revenue by 4.3%, which is both a sequential and a year-on-year improvement. Our video
revenue grew 2.8% over the prior year, the largest quarterly gain in more than four years, driven really by four factors:
the quality of our subscriber development increasing the expanded basic and digital; second, increased sale of advanced
services with a higher number of boxes, all of which has revenue attached; also promotional rate step-up discipline in
early 2012 price increases; and finally, a higher amount of bundled sell-in, which results in the allocation of more
revenue out-of-phone then in the past.
Internet revenues grew 9%, driven by the addition of nearly 300,000 Internet customers over the past year, and our
phone revenues declined 14% with the increase of phone customers more than offset by revenue allocation within the
bundle.
Not including advertising, commercial, and other revenue, our residential cable revenue rose 2.2% year-on-year that
compares to 1.1% in Q4 of last year; so very good early progress.
As we look to 2013; we'll continue to focus on adding new customers at introductory rates with lower upfront fees, but
recurring monthly rates should start to step up. We've also implemented a rate increase effective for the end of the first
quarter, which equates to about a 2.3% increase across our 5 million customer base.
Turning to commercial – to our commercial business; we again generated over 20% revenue growth. And excluding
video, our commercial revenues increased by 26%. In addition in the fourth quarter, our advertising sales rose 18.5%,
due to a strong political quarter, as we also increased sales from the automotive sector. Excluding the election year
impact, our advertising revenue would have risen by roughly 8% in the quarter and for the full year.
Moving to slide 7; our EBITDA was up 1.7% compared to 2011, which demonstrates solid performance given the
amount of change. We have realigned our organization and restructured field operations. We're migrating to more
in-house versus outsourced labor. We've revised our product and selling tactics and are redirecting various sales
channels. We've revamped our sales commission structure and we're improving the way we maintain our plant.
Total operating costs in the quarter increased 5.8% on prior year with the key cost drivers being programming and
maintenance. Programming costs rose $26 million or 5.5% year-over-year. We think we can keep that growth rate in
the mid-to-high single-digits on a per sub basis this year.
Maintenance expense increased $19 million in the quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, we've significantly stepped up
our preventive maintenance of the plant. And in doing so, we've identified specific regional areas which need
improvement and which have an outsized impact on Charter's service rate and the company as a whole.
We also added a fair amount of personnel in the quarter, including in-house service techs, quality control personnel and
direct sales reps. The operating strategies have also driven a significant further improvement in bad debt, which
declined to more than 20% on a year-on-year basis.

On slide 8; our CapEx increased $122 million in Q4 compared to the prior year, and $47 million of that increase was
related to higher CPE. Fourth quarter CPE spend totaled $162 million in the following categories: about half were
capitalized installed labor for new connects; one-fourth of that CPE spent for equipment for new customer acquisition
and upgrades; and the remainder for additional equipment in existing video customers' homes.
In addition to CPE, our upgrade and rebuild capital increased $35 million over the prior year, primarily due to plant
replacement in conjunction with the preventative maintenance, I noted earlier.
As we completed more frequent plant sweeps and increased preventative maintenance and find issues, we're incurring
one-time capital, which will bring down trouble calls and churn rates.
Similar to the maintenance expense in the P&L, which identifies that capital need, there's a clear ROI attached to the
spend which comes via improved operating metrics, customer satisfaction and lower churn.
We expect some of this spend to continue through 2013 as we finish up the remainder of these projects. And support
capital increased $13 million in the fourth quarter, driven by investment in vehicles in real estate, particularly as we
in-source more of our workforce.
Our fourth quarter commercial CapEx was up $13 million, and for the full year, increased $74 million to $269 million
to support growth in the commercial business. For 2013, we expect our capital investments excluding acquisitions to be
approximately $1.7 billion, meaning that at least as a percentage of revenue, 2012 should be the peak for Charter, with
the caveat being the timing how fast we migrate to all-digital and growth generally.
Turning to cash flow on slide 9; we generated free cash flow at $33 million, down from last year's fourth quarter due to
the higher capital investments, and from a balance sheet perspective over 80% of our debt matures beyond 2016. And
we ended the year with a weighted average interest cost of 6% with a run rate interest expense of approximately $780
million, our leverage was 4.8 times adjusted EBITDA and our leverage target remains 4 times to 4.5 times plus or
minus a half-turn either way to enable strategic activity. A good example of that strategic activity is the recently
announced Bresnan transaction, where we believe our leverage at closing should be about 5 times.
And finally on slide 10; we've updated our tax asset information. As of 12/31, we had an outsized tax basis totaling
$8.9 billion as well as NOLs of $7.7 billion. The key point about our tax assets is enhanced free cash flow conversion
through at least 2017 and continuing tax benefits through 2024.
Before we open it up to Q&A, I'd like to introduce our new VP of Investor Relations, Stefan Anninger, many of you
know him well. As we move to our headquarters to Connecticut, he joined us from Credit Suisse in January. Robin has
done a great job, not only in managing that transition, but representing Charter with this group of stakeholders, as many
of you know firsthand.
And with that, we'll open it up to Q&A. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Good morning, guys. Maybe some questions around margins. Obviously, programming cost
growth has been one of the focuses of the quarter and your 9.6% was solid. Can you give us an update on where you
think that's trending in 2013? And then the ability of the company to maintain the strong margins even with that cost
growth that you've been able to post this quarter? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, John. Clearly, programming is a driver of cost in the business. We do think that
our margins will improve as a result of our performance operationally by taking transactions out of the business. And
so, the second biggest cost driver in the cable business, I think, is unnecessary physical transactions. And the way,

we're going to reduce those is by improving the customer proposition, therefore, improving the customer life and
reducing the amount of service calls over the life of the subscriber. And that's how we take cost out of the business, and
that's how margins improve.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Do you expect similar type of programming cost growth, or should that accelerate? And I
guess, looking into 2013, is flat margins a good place or do you think you can see improvement year-over-year?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Chris, do you want to answer that?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. So look, we're not going to give margin guidance, but as I mentioned in the
prepared remarks, we do expect that for programming for 2013 that we should be in the mid-to-high single-digits on
programming cost on a per subscriber basis.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Wlodarczak (sic) [Jeff Wlodarczak] (19:04) with Pivotal Research.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Hey guys. It's Jeff Wlodarczak. I had a question about data additions. You talked about the
fact that you had very aggressive data in double-play promotions last year. What I wonder is, was there also a churn hit
as those folks that were paying the $19.99 price last year churned off this year as they were repriced materially higher?
And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Jeff, the way I would describe it is – I mean, there is a churn affect from those kinds of
offers, and we're essentially selling a different product today than we sold previously, and it's a richer product. And our
– and so, as we drive that into the market, we're being very disciplined about the kinds of customers that we're
connecting, so that the life of the subscriber and the value of the subscriber is increased. So, we're putting a much
different product in the hands of new customers.
And in the process of changing our operation and changing, essentially, every reporting relationship in the company,
we are gradually building back our sales capability at the same time. So, you have two things going on. You've got old
offers expiring and a different customer base essentially being transformed into a new customer base with a new
product set and an operational change simultaneously that has to realize the full benefit of its implementation, and that
has yet to occur.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Got it. And then if you could provide any additional color, it sounded like the first-quarter
trends sounded good, but any more color you can provide on how the first quarter's going? And then last year you
actually had positive sub growth there. Are you prepared to say that you could have positive sub growth in the first
quarter of this year as well? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I don't want to give any more guidance than we've already given, but we did say
that we were – that our triple-play sell-in continues to climb to 50%, and we've been seeing that kind of result as a
result of the organizational changes we've made. So, our organizational proficiency continues to improve.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.

response from your – any noteworthy response from your competitors?

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I haven't seen a significant change that I can articulate from any of our competitors. I
mean, our national competitors are satellite companies, I'm not sure are specifically focused on our activities. And I
haven't seen AT&T, which is our primary phone competitor, change its go-to-market strategy with regard to us either.
<Q - Brian Russo>: Okay. Thanks. As a quick follow-up, what kind of further innovation do you think would be most
impactful from a competitive standpoint for you guys to do?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I think our biggest opportunity is to just be a better cable operator. We have a
superior infrastructure, relatively speaking, to all of our competitors. And we need to use it effectively. And our biggest
effort is in putting our organization in shape, putting our plant in shape, so that we can actually take advantage of our
inherent strengths. And there's a lot of execution around that strategy, and we're continuing to improve in our operating
metrics every day. But that's where the biggest single opportunity is, in just operating our strategic advantage
effectively.
Beyond that, we've started to use cloud-based guides and cloud-based searches to take advantage of the change in the
world. The fact that people now have tablets and smartphones and the fact that those devices can interact with our cable
system in a way that makes the video experience much better than it could be otherwise. There's inherent disadvantages
to remote control devices on TVs for navigation purposes. And we've found a way to take navigation from the TV and
put it onto your smart device and, essentially, get a whole new experience without having to recapitalize our entire
set-top box universe. So, it's capitally efficient and it's consumer-friendly and we're develop – we're spending our
precious development dollars in that area specifically.
<Q - Brian Russo>: Perfect. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. Good morning. Tom, for the last, I guess, two quarters now you've been
putting in a lot of changes to how you sell – how the organization sells and positions the products. Would you say that
now, by end of Q4, you're sort of at where you want to be? And part of the reason I ask the question is, if you look at
your bundled penetration trends, they were a little surprising in that single-play went up, triple-play went up a little bit,
double-play went down. I didn't know if there was still some more, maybe, noise in the numbers and you hadn't kind of
hit your full stride until Q1. You did mention that your bundled penetration – your triple-play sell-in rates continue to
climb, so I wanted to ask if you could comment on sort of timing there?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah, I think that's – we have said that we continuing to improve into Q1, and Q3 and
Q4 were very significant in terms of the structural changes we've made to the company. We essentially changed every
reporting relationship and changed the way we sold and priced our products, changed every commission structure we
had and moved our headquarters. So, all of that was quite disruptive, and we've seen – but it's finished and all of our
people are in place and our management structures are in place and our organization now is performing better every
day than it did the prior day. And that means that we're getting a higher triple-play sell-in rate and we expect continued
success in improving our operations. But it's a big company and there are a lot of people involved. And it's a big job,
but it's getting better consistently.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: And, if I could just ask Chris, if you could – to follow-up on some of the – two numbers
you gave on your prepared remarks. Well, I guess one number, then one question on the quarter. So, you said 2.3%
benefit from a rate hike. Was that – are you speaking to the customer – revenue per customer number, the $105, you
did in 2012, is that the...
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: What I'm speaking to, yes, effectively. We're talking – that's the same relative metric,
the 2.3% increase on average across the 5 million customer base, including video and non-video subscribers.

<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Got it. And Chris, any comment on the sequential decline in expenses? I know
marketing was down a little bit; other costs were down. Just given how much you were doing to the sales force and
pushing your new product strategy, it was a little bit of a surprise on the expense front. Any comments there?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah, look, you typically see some seasonality. I think the biggest driver on the
expense side was, obviously programming on a year-over-year basis, but the other one was on the maintenance side.
So, I think you're picking up more on seasonality than anything else.

<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Just had a question for Mr. Rutledge, very kind of you to include slide 4, which shows

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yes.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: And I think a lot of investors are probably wondering sort of the timing to sort of see,
if there is a material inflection up on revenue, what a reasonable timing is. So, I just wanted to check some dates and
make sure I have this right. The investments when Bresnan was part of Cablevision, you began to make those
investments in the first quarter of 2011 and it looks like the inflection happened about a year later. And you joined
Charter, I think, in the first quarter of 2012 and maybe made the investments in the second quarter of 2012. Is that
reasonable? And so, we should sort of think of it, 2Q 2013 is maybe the point when it becomes obvious if there is an
inflection up on the top line? Is that reasonable?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, your timing is slightly off. I would say it was more Q3 that the changes were
implemented.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: [indiscernible] (27:48) implemented in Q2 in the Bresnan acquisition for Cablevision.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: 2Q of 2011 and 3Q of 2012 for Charter?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yes.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: So, other than that everything you said is correct.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: From a fact basis. We included that because we think that the Bresnan success is
indicative of what Charter can do.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Right.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: It's not a 1:1 correlation. Charter's a different circumstance, but it's much larger
obviously.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Right.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: And therefore, it has a bigger execution concern...
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Yes. Thanks. I mean, we've danced around this a little bit, but can you help us think about the
sales process and the gross ad momentum over the last, call it, six months? How do you see that sort of sales process?
At what point is it normalized and up to sort of full speed? And then, can you talk a little bit about the digital rollout as
well – or the all-digital rollout? Are there markets you expect to attack first there? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. So – no, I wouldn't say we're at full speed yet. Q3 and Q4 were transitional
quarters in terms of our capability of executing a strategy. We had to recreate our sales forces even where they are
physically, how our inbound sales work, how our direct sales work, and there were a lot of people moving around in
that process.
As a result of that, we had achievements and additional sell-in and higher sell-in. But we can do much better because at
the same time that we were making those achievements, we were creating our own noise as a result of all of the activity
and change that we created.
And as I said earlier in the call, our triple-play sell-in continues to improve, and I expect it to get better over time as
well in other areas.
The subscriber life indicators continue to improve, too, like churn continues to go down. So, we think that the effect of
our strategy is visible, but it hasn't been fully realized by any means. So, I have higher expectations than we've already
achieved there.
With regard to digitization, we're going all-digital so that we can take advantage of our two-way plant and create more
value for our customers. And as part of that, we're selling our way in. And in the middle of last year, in 2012, we quit
selling analog and so on the increment, we're only selling digital. And there are places where we've gotten fairly high
penetration already to the point where we're going to go ahead and turn off the analog signal and sell-in the rest of the
digital product in a very short timeframe.
And, we're going to start doing that in places where we have the highest penetration or where we think we'll get the
biggest uplift from a value proposition and where we can learn the logistical issues that we have to deal with as we go
all-digital faster throughout the country. So, that's our strategy. We're going to continue to sell our way in. And the
higher that sell-in is, the less disruptive the all-digitization process is. In places where we've already achieved that or
where we think that going all-digital faster will produce immediate results, we're going to do that. So, we'll be
opportunistic.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant [ISI Group Inc.]
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Hi. I have two questions. First, I have in our numbers an expectation that ARPU will accelerate in
the second half of the year, because you've started with your new promotion in the middle of last year. And as those
promotional prices come off, we should get a lift. That's part of the thinking there.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yes.

<Q - Vijay Jayant>: And, we've been hearing some of the other folks talking about how, when that happens, there's a
high risk of churn and people want their promotional pricing. Can you sort of talk about how constant you are that
you'll be able to get that ARPU lift at that point?
And the second question is on – your programming cost in 2013 look at least below where everybody else seems to be
talking about programming rates. And obviously, these things are lumpy. Can you sort of talk about what is the
longer-term programming rate increase per sub in your business model based on what you've seen in your contracts?
Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yes. Well, to your first question, yes, you're right. We started our promotional pricing in
July of 2012, and as a result of that, in July of 2013, those promotions will start to roll off and they roll off over a
multi-year period and there'll be a step-up in price.
We think that because of the way we've added value to the product that the churn will not be significant and that the net
economic effect of all that will be very positive. And so, that's based on our experience and it's based on our
understanding of what you need to do to create a valuable product, and what our competitors' products are and how we
relate to them. So, these are fully featured, really good video products with lots of HD and two-way interactivity and
lots of Video on Demand, the highest, fastest speed Internet service you can buy in almost any part of our footprint and
a fully provisioned voice product. And when you put it all together, it's sold at a price, even with the step-up, that's
lower than you can build with going to the end of the digital component pieces of other providers. And – so, we think
that the values there, that the product is superior, and that we'll be able to manage our customer relationships through
Q3 and Q4 and going forward.
With regard to programming expenses, if you look at Charter's programming expenses as a percentage of revenue
versus, say, Time Warner's and Comcast's and other companies, it's higher. And so, we actually think that there's some
compression in the differences in prices between the big MSOs and us, and that we can actually have a lower rate of
increase than other companies. But we're still already paying higher programming cost than other companies and that's
how – why we think we can get that compression to occur.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Thank you. So, looking forward, after all-digital rollout, do you have a marketing plan
that'll sort of be next? And anything you're going to do to sort of wrap that product around? You mentioned being able
to up-sell the customer and so forth and see a lot of concepts there. We've seen some of your larger peers be pretty
successful post digital rollout with some improved product packaging. Do you – can you give us some idea on some
plans there?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: In changing our product packaging?
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Well, once you have an all-digital product, do you have a plan to – for a branding strategy?
Any sort of other push to sell products to customers, once you've kind of gotten all-digital? Because digital is not
necessarily an end into itself, there's other ways to sell beyond that. Just to – is there a marketing plan there?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah, well, a good point. We – some people think we should change the Charter brand
and that we should add a tracker brand like XFINITY or Optimum, and we don't have anything to announce today on
that. We think that we can be successful with where we are today, and incrementally, we already are selling all-digital.
But the all-digital strategy is really designed to take advantage of our infrastructure. But in terms of our go-to-market
product strategy, we've already implemented an all-digital strategy.
In terms of additional marketing tactics, I think our biggest opportunity is to continue to develop our Internet portal,
sales portal and to take advantage of Internet marketing in ways that we haven't historically as a cable company, and

we've already begun to do some of that.
One of the issues with Charter is its dominance, or lack thereof, of any DMA. And it's interesting that the Internet now
allows us to sell in ways that we historically couldn't, and we don't necessarily need the same mass media tools as
we've historically used. So, we think there's some opportunity there.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Okay. And one just quick follow-up. On – with the Optimum West properties, where were
they as far as SMB penetration relative to the rest of your base?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Small business penetration?
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Yes.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I actually don't know off the top of my head.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Thank you. When you think – in 2012, you talked about success-based CapEx. Does that impact
your guidance for 2013 as well? If you add more video customers, is there a risk that goes higher? And then I guess,
second question is, post-Bresnan, can you just update us on how you're thinking about acquisitions and managing your
footprint versus capital returns and deleveraging? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So I'll take the capital question, Amy. The – you call that a risk that if were to grow
faster than what we have as a plan, I would call that an opportunity. I mean, we have growth expectations and we have
a CapEx estimate on that basis. If we're more successful, we'll spend more capital and I think all of us should be fairly
pleased with that.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: That's right. If we doubled our customers, it would definitely cost more.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yes. And none of us here would be apologizing for it. The second question is related
to the recent acquisition and how that impacts our thoughts on the return of capital, and I would say it's exactly inline
with everything that we've always said about our use of free cash flow strategy, which is that we have a target leverage
range. We think that's the optimal place to be in terms of 4 times to 4.5 times, and whether it's stock buybacks, which
we did in 2011, or whether it's investing significantly inside the business at a level that's not dissimilar from an
acquisition, which we did in 2012. And in 2013, now investing in the Optimum West transaction; those are what we
believe the highest ROI projects at the time that we could do to use our free cash flow and we'll continue to do so, and
we're comfortable up to 5 times. We're also comfortable as low as 3.5 times to enable some of those strategic
opportunities in the future.
So, I think we've been very, very consistent in terms of how we've articulated our target leverage and our use of capital
based on the opportunities that are in front of us. And I think we're all very comfortable where we are at from a
leverage standpoint today, and that the projects that we've done so far, including the buybacks, as well as the spend that
we had last year inside the business in 2012, have been highly accretive, and we have high hopes for the same with
Optimum West.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Great.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore Partners.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Hi. Thanks. I just have two questions. Tom, you mentioned the Bresnan here is the head of
Charter and CapEx is now declining. So, you seem to be, I guess, indicating in some way that Charter's CapEx will
decline, perhaps in 2015, as you finish the digital transition and some of the other initiatives. Just wanted to ask you, if
that's a reasonable interpretation of your comments?
And then also, I wanted to ask on the digital conversion, are you charging for each of the set-top boxes, digital boxes
that you require the customers to take on the additional outlets, as part of the conversion? And how are you executing
that conversion today? Are you requiring all new customers and upgrade customers to take a box for every TV? Or
you're just requiring at least one box per home? Just wanted to get a little more color on that, if you don't mind?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Okay. Well, with regard to capital in Bresnan, absent – or including what Chris just said
about success-based capital, the answer to your question is, all other things being equal, yes. It means that capital
intensity goes down in the business going forward. And there is a capital expenditure necessary to get the ship moving,
so to speak, and then there is success-based capital on the increment. But in general, I expect capital intensity to decline
over time.
With regard to set-top boxes, the answer is yes, we are charging for the additional outlets and we're charging for the
set-top boxes through the conversion, which is why you want to market your way in, as effectively as possible before
you start trying to do it en masse.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Is there a promotion where you get it kind of like Cablevision did where you get it for free for
a year and then you start paying? Or do people have to start paying from day one?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yes. There are various – depending on the scenario, there are promotions, necessary
sometimes to make it go as fast as you want it to go. And we'll manage those through time as we need to, but the plan is
to charge for the outlets.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Okay. Thanks very much.

And your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza with CRT Capital Group.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Thanks for taking the questions. I have two questions, if I may. First, on the video side, I
was happy to see the price increases and some discipline on the promotions. Could you discuss the competitive outlook
there, how aggressive are you seeing the satellite guys, in particular?
And then on the programming side, I'm pleased to hear that you expect the pricing pressure to moderate somewhat in
2013. My question is, is that due to the timing of contract renewals? Or are you seeing an opportunity, taking advantage
of an opportunity to push back a bit on some of the also ran channels when they ask for more money?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: So, we are disciplined in our pricing and video promotion products. And with regard to
programming, yeah, we push as hard as we can push. We think that we've done a reasonably good job in negotiating
contracts. Timing does matter, and different programmers have different levels of expectation and leverage. But
historically, Charter has paid a higher rate for its programming than I think it should, and we're trying to get that to be
more inline with other companies.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Thanks.
