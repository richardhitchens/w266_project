MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation fourth quarter 2011 earnings release conference call, hosted by
Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She's joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the
web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation , today's conference call is being recorded. Other
recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox. After presentation,
there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]
During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by
their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially
different than those expressed herein.
At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.
Ursula M. Burns
Good morning and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. We began 2011 with a clear articulation of
our priorities. You see them listed here. While the statements themselves seem relatively simple, the complexity was in
the implementation, especially during a year of unexpected external challenges. Here's a report card on how well we
did.
First, accelerating our services businesses. Growing it faster by diversifying our offerings and expanding globally.
More of our total revenue now comes from services than technology. In 2011, revenue from services grew 6%. This
reflects an impressive 8% growth in business process outsourcing, and 9% growth in document outsourcing.

Our IT outsourcing business declined 4% during the year, but we're encouraged by a recent uplift in ITO signings. In
total, our integrated sales activity resulted in a stronger pipeline, and a 14% increase in new business signings.
Second, maintaining our leadership in document technology. We not only continued to hold our number one equipment
revenue share position, but we always grew share in 2011. We did this by offering a more extensive and affordable
portfolio of color products, and by expanding our distribution to serve more small and mid-sized businesses around the
world.
Third, we're very good at managing our business, with a disciplined focus on operational excellence. This gives us the
financial flexibility to help offset pressures on the business. Whether it's economic uncertainty or necessary
investments that drive growth. Either way, our focus is on delivering strong bottom-line results.
And by executing well on the first three priorities, we delivered on the fourth, expanding earnings and returning cash to
shareholders. Full-year 2011 adjusted earnings per share grew 15%. We generated $2 billion in operating cash, and
bought back $700 million in Xerox shares during the year. That's a buyback of 88 million shares, or 71 million net of
the pension contribution, which is more than we initially expected.
So during a year where we faced our share of headwinds, I'm pleased with our progress, and confident in our position
to build more value for our business, for our clients, and for our shareholders in 2012.
I often say that some companies talk about transformation but we're actually doing it. You're seeing the results of the
company's strategic shift in our financial performance. But to understand how we're achieving these results, it's
important to understand the breadth of our business. The Xerox brand is now in places that may seem unexpected, but
the link between our well-regarded technology and our diverse services is one more common objective, which is
simplifying for clients the way that work gets done so that they can operate more efficiently and more effectively. And
as you would expect from Xerox, innovation remains core to what we do and how we strengthen our competitive
advantage.
Turn to Slide 4 for some examples of what I mean. Radical changes to managing information in healthcare are now
being more embraced by healthcare providers and payers. We continue to advance our offerings, and be recognized as a
valuable player in the industry through our cloud-based technology, our advanced security protocols, and deep
expertise in the complexities of building and managing digital health systems.
Two examples, two very good examples. One is our recent acquisition of the Breakaway Group, which provides
electronic medical record simulation technology on contract with the State of Iowa to run its health information
exchange. Xerox innovation is also changing the status quo in some of the more basic ways that we live. Like using
public transportation. Through large-scale contracts with Transit Authority, we're developing easy ways for commuters
to pay with smart phones and debit cards, doing away with the inefficient token and ticket systems.
And no matter where your work takes you, in the office, on the road, or at home, we help ensure that printing is
accessible and affordable. We do that through continuously extending and refreshing our product portfolio, especially
in color, and by broadening our managed print services. Our MPS offerings continue to win the praise of industry
analysts. More important, they win new business with clients like British Airways that recently tapped Xerox for a
five-year enterprise services contract.
In all three areas, we've developed repeatable, scalable and integrated solutions. This is our approach to real business,
improving our clients' productivity by simplifying the way that they serve their clients. Our results in the fourth quarter
reflect progress in these and other areas.
Please turn to Slide 5 for a review of the Q4 performance. In the fourth quarter we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.33;
that's up 14% from a year ago. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.26 a share. This includes $0.07 related to the
amortization of intangibles. Total fourth quarter revenue of $6 billion was flat. Revenue from our services business was
up 6%. However, revenue from our technology business was down 5%. While our technology business improved
throughout the year in the United States and in developing markets, we saw a drop-off during Q4 in technology sales
across Europe.

The strength of our services business model is particularly evident when we're faced with macro issues. Our services
provide cost efficient ways for our clients to run more productive enterprises. And our multiyear services contracts
benefits our business for the long term through a healthy base of recurring revenue. Signings for BPO, document
outsourcing and IT outsourcing, were up 15% in the fourth quarter. The increase in services signings continues to put
near-term pressure on margins as we make initial investments to implement new contracts.
As a result, operating margin of 10% was down 0.4 of a point. Gross margin was 32.2 points, in line with our range.
And we balanced our investments by continuing to improve SAG with selling, administrative, and general expenses
now at 19.3% of revenue. Q4 cash from operations was approximately $1.3 billion. And as I mentioned previously, we
delivered on our commitment to generate $2 billion in full-year operating cash. We're continuing to use available cash
for acquisitions and share repurchase.
In a moment, Luca will provide a more detailed – more detail on cash flow as well as review our balance sheet and
reporting segments; then we'll both take your questions.
First, let's take a little closer look at our top-line results on Slide 6.
Here you see what – that services now represents 48% of our total revenue, up from 45% a year ago, and continuing to
grow in proportion to our total revenue. It's an important metric that reflects investments in building our outsourcing
portfolio, and expanding our offerings globally. As I mentioned, total revenue of $6 billion was flat in the quarter.
Annuity revenue, which is 80% of the total, was flat or up 1% in constant currency. Equipment sales revenue was down
3%, or 2% in constant currency, largely due to the weakness in Europe. While operating in this challenging economic
environment, we've grown our global market share for equipment revenue, and installs of Xerox equipment grew 8% in
the fourth quarter, a good indication of future annuity.
During the year, we launched 27 products, with an emphasis on broadening our color portfolio for both production and
office markets, and we expanded our channels of distribution. As a result, our MIFs, that's machines in the field, for our
color devices grew 14% in 2011, an important contributor to our annuity stream.
Growth in services is also a big benefit to our annuity. We continue to focus on joint sales activities between Xerox and
ACS. In 2011, this resulted in more than 300 revenue synergy deals, delivering significant total contract value for the
company. These deals include a multi-year contract with a major consumer goods company to manage their IT systems,
an enterprise print services win with a large financial investment firm, and expanding our business with one of Latin
America's largest banks to now support their commercial foreign exchange operations.
To further accelerate our joint sales activities, we increasingly see the value of going to market as one Xerox,
demonstrating to our clients that our services-led, technology-driven strategy offers value to their business through the
strengths of our offerings, the power of our innovation, and the expertise of our people.
Therefore, we're retiring the ACS brand in many areas of our services business, and we'll lead with Xerox as the master
brand that now represents the world's largest enterprise for business process and document management. It's more than
a logo change. It reflects the progress that we've made in transforming the company, the meaningful growth in front of
us, and the value we're building for stakeholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Luca, and I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?
Luca Maestri
Thank you Ursula, and good morning, everyone. As Ursula just explained, revenue was flat in the quarter, both at
actual and constant currency. Services continued to show good growth, up 6%, and technology was down 5%, affected
by the weakness that we saw in Europe. Operating margin in Q4 was 10%, a sequential improvement from Q3, in line
with seasonality, but down 0.4% year over year.
Gross margin at 32.2% was lower year over year, due to the shift of business towards services, and the ramp of new
contracts. We expect this gross margin dynamic to continue in the near term, as services growth accelerates and new

contracts start up.
We partially offset the gross margin impact through disciplined expense management. Both R&D and SG&A ratios
continued to show significant improvement from restructuring and synergies. Within SG&A, bad debts increase year
over year by $12 million, as improvements in North America were more than offset by higher write-offs in Southern
Europe.
For the full year, operating margins grew by 30 basis points. We deployed several cost and expense reduction
initiatives to offset the disruption from the natural disaster in Japan during the first half, and ongoing currency
headwinds. Below the line, we had improved results from lower interest expense and higher equity income at Fuji
Xerox.
Also in the quarter, we made two one-off entries, which are worth mentioning. We realized a $66 million after-tax
pension curtailment gain that is associated with our decision in Q4 to fully freeze after December 2012 any further
service and benefit accruals in the Xerox defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. This impact was partially offset by
restructuring charge of $39 million after tax we took to improve the efficiency of our operations and help counter the
pressures in the macro environment.
As a result, adjusted EPS in Q4 was $0.33, and grew 14% year over year. The only adjustment to reported EPS was the
amortization of intangibles. It should be noted, this adjustment was higher than in previous quarters because in Q4 we
accelerated the amortization of the intangibles related to the ACS trade name, following our decision to discontinue the
use of the ACS brand going forward. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 15% and GAAP EPS more than doubled.
Let us now move to the services segment on Slide 8. The 6% revenue growth in services is a reflection of the breadth
and diversity of our portfolio. Within services, BPO growth accelerated, it was up 8%, and document outsourcing was
also up 8%. ITO revenue was down 6%. The 8% growth in BPO came from both commercial and government.
Commercial growth was driven by financial services, customer care, and recent acquisitions. Government revenue
growth came primarily from the ramping of the California Medicaid contract.
The 8% increase in document outsourcing reflects both the impact of strong new signings, and benefits from our
partner print services offerings, which began to be reported in document outsourcing this year, and are accelerating.
The competitiveness of our product portfolio, and our unique document management software and tools, continue to
clearly differentiate us in the marketplace.
ITO revenue was down 6% in Q4, driven by two main factors. Past contract losses, and lower product resale revenues.
On the positive side, during 2011, ITO signings were $3.4 billion, and up by more than 150% year-over-year. The
impact of a few contract losses will continue to have an effect on revenues through mid year, at which time the ramp in
new signings will deliver revenue growth. Total signings for the entire services business increased 15% year on year in
Q4, and the trailing 12-month signings calculation is now flat, even after including the California Medicaid new
business, and the Texas Medicaid renewal, both signed in 2010.
Our pipeline continues to be healthy, and is up 5%, including synergies. Segment margin of 10.3% was down 1.7 points
year over year, due to the contract startup costs and lower renewal rates, we just discussed. California Medicaid alone
impacted margins by over half a point.
We expect this margin pressure to remain in the near term, but to gradually improve as we move through 2012.
Let's now turn to the technology slide. Technology revenue was down 5%, or 4% at constant currency. The largest
factor in this decline was the slowdown in Europe, where equipment revenue was down 15%. It should also be noted
that, as planned, our technology results are impacted by the launch of our partner print services, which have been very
successful, and are reported in document outsourcing. In spite of the revenue decline, segment margin of 11.7% was
flat year over year, and at the highest level for the year, in line with seasonality. Overall, a good result, thanks to strong
control and expense control.
Looking out, further segments in detail. Entry install performance improved in the quarter, although revenue was
impacted by price and mix. We're building momentum in this segment with the recent launch of a new,

price-competitive platform, providing both mono and color capabilities. Entry represented about 21% of our technology
revenue. Mid range was the strongest performing area in Q4, and for the full year, thanks to our strong color portfolio.
This is the product segment that was also most impacted by the disaster in Japan. As we had expected, supply
availability has now returned to normal, and the backlog, while healthy, is not artificially high due to the product
constraints.
Mid range accounted for 57% of our technology revenue. High end results were mixed. We continued strong
performance in production color, driven by iGen4 and the 800,1000 Color Press. We're also improving our
performance in entry production color with the recent launch of our zero 770 system. High end represented 22% of our
technology revenue. Going into 2012, we're very confident in our technology offerings, given our market share gains
and recent improvements we have made to our industry-leading portfolio.
Moving on to our key metrics on Slide 10. Our most relevant operation metrics this quarter were quite positive. Total
services signing of $4.2 billion, were up 15% year over year, with over $1 billion of signings in each of the three lines
of business. For the year, we signed over $14 billion, flat year over year, even with the two large Medicaid deals in the
prior year compare. New business signings for the year were up 14%.
Looking at the document-related metrics. Please keep in mind that these include the technology segment plus document
outsourcing. Total color revenue was up 2%, both actual and constant currency. Digital machines in field continued to
grow. Was up 3% in total; 14% for color capable devices.
Lastly, digital pages were stable, and down 3%, with pages from color devices up 9%, both in Q4 and for the full year.
All color segments showed strong install growth, and total installs for the company were up 8% in the quarter. This did
not translate into equipment revenue growth, given price erosion and mix impacts, but this will feed annuity, over time.
Moving on to the cash flow slide. Cash from operations of almost $1.3 billion was in line with Q4 of 2010, for a full
year total of $2 billion. Earnings contributed $303 million, and consistent with normal seasonality, working capital
during the quarter was a source of $696 million. For the year, working capital was essentially flat.
Pension cash contributions in the quarter were $78 million, and $426 million for the year, which is about $200 million
higher than our 2010 funding. We expect a similar level of pension contributions in 2012, due to a very significant drop
in the discount rate, in spite of truly outstanding returns that we achieved in 2011 on our plan assets. CapEx of $134
million was in-line with the annual trend, and we had limited M&A activity during the quarter.
Let us turn to the next slide to quickly review the uses of our operating cash flow in 2011. So we generate $2 billion of
cash from operations. CapEx came in at, as anticipated, at $501 million full year, and the resulting free cash flow of
$1.5 billion was used as follows. We paid down over $600 million in debt, and we have now repaid the debt for the
ACS acquisition. We ended the year with $8.6 billion of debt, of which $6 billion can be associated with the financing
of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance debt is calculated assuming a 7 to 1 leverage of all finance assets of
$6.9 billion.
We also had $265 million in dividend payments, and our current yield sits at approximately 2%. Our focus was to
deploy our available cash primarily towards the share repurchase program. As mentioned earlier, we repurchased $700
million worth of shares, at an average price of $7.97. We also continued to invest in tuck-in acquisitions, spending
$212 million full year, primarily in services.
Let me now move to guidance for 2012. For revenue growth in 2012, we're guiding to 2% plus, at constant currency.
We expect services to grow mid-to-high single digits, with growth accelerating throughout the year. And technology to
be flat to modestly lower, given the macro environment and our strategy to lead with our managed print services
offerings. We expect GAAP, EPS in the range of $0.97 to $1.03. And adjusted EPS in the range of $1.12 to $1.18.
The change in guidance from May of last year is driven by a pension expense increase of well over $100 million,
because of the significant decline in discount rates, negative currency dynamics, and worsened economic outlook in
Europe.

Our earnings estimate will put us in a position to deliver strong cash flow, between $2 billion and $2.3 billion. This is
also lower than we were assuming back in May of 2011, due to three main factors. Revised earnings, as I just
explained, pension funding in line with 2011. This is $200 million higher than previously assumed, due to the
historically low discount rate. And restructuring payments of approximately $150 million, instead of an earlier
assumption of nominal payments. We took a $61 million restructuring charge in Q4, and anticipate taking a modest
amount of additional restructuring in 2012. This will allow us to improve our operating leverage, and offset some of the
cost pressure in the environment.
We expect operating cash flow to be negative in Q1, with higher pension contributions adding to the typical working
capital seasonality. On CapEx, we're planning for investments of $500 million, which will result in free cash flow of
between $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. In 2012, we expect to repurchase between $900 million and $1.1
billion worth of shares, skewed to the second half of the year, consistent with our cash generation seasonality.
We are announcing today that our board increased the share repurchase authorization by $500 million, so it now stand
at over $1.3 billion. We anticipate spending between $300 million and $400 million on acquisitions, with primary focus
on expanding our services offerings. And dividends are planned to be a use of around $300 million, given current
payout and number of shares outstanding.
With that, I will turn it back to Ursula to wrap up.
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions.
2011 presented its share of challenges, and our performance in the fourth quarter, and for the full year, reflects our
operational discipline in delivering strong bottom-line results, while scaling our services business, and maintaining our
leadership in document technology. Signings continue to grow for our diverse services offerings, installs are up for our
industry-leading technology. Both of these areas contribute to a healthy annuity stream that serves us well for the long
term.
In the near term, we are planning for continued economic weakness, so we're being somewhat guarded with our
expectations, and remain focused on operational efficiency. For the first quarter, our expectations are for adjusted
earnings of $0.21 to $0.24 per share, including $0.01 to $0.02 of restructuring. And as Luca noted, we expect full-year
adjusted EPS of $1.12 to $1.18.
Throughout 2012, our productivity initiatives will be balanced with making the necessary investment to expand our
services business, and aggressively pursue growth opportunities in key markets around the world. And our business
model will continue to yield strong cash flow.
I'm confident we have the right strategy, the competitive strength, the skilled leadership team, and the disciplined focus
on execution, to build on our progress.
With that, I thank you again for joining us today, and let's open it up to questions for Luca and me.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Thanks a lot. Luca, given the lower cash-flow estimates and the pension being $400
million plus in terms of funding, do you plan to issue more equity like you did a quarter or two ago to fund the

pension? And is that an option to you? What would be the offsetting share count impact?
<A - Luca Maestri>: So, Ben, yes, pension contributions are going to be in total similar to what we've seen in 2011.
So, at this point, even though we have not made a final decision, we are planning to issue stock in a similar size of what
we've done in 2011. Bear in mind that the contributions to the pension plan this year is going to be skewed towards the
first half, as opposed to the second half, as we had last year.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Is there any benefit to issue equity and be buying back stock at the same time, rather
than just fund the pension with cash and then just buy back less stock? Is there a reason to go through the motions of
buying back stock while you're issuing equity?
<A - Luca Maestri>: The reason is the same that I talked about last year. It really gives us a bit more flexibility with
our cash. It allows us to be more consistent in the market as we buy back the stock. And frankly, particularly because
these contributions this year are so skewed towards the first half, we want to make sure that, you know, we retain, you
know, appropriate cash balances throughout the year.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Can you just recap how many shares you issued in the last tranche? Was it 16 million,
right?
<A - Luca Maestri>: 16.6 million shares.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Right. So, when you say similar size, maybe you do it a few times like that?
<A - Luca Maestri>: We would be looking to do – I'm talking about, you know, the absolute amount that we're talking
about, right? I mean, last year we did about $130 million. It's probably going to be a similar size. And obviously the
amount of shares is going to be depending on the share price on that day. But we're thinking of doing one single
contribution in stock.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. Then, my follow-up issue is with regard to cash flow. So it sounds like, you
know, you were at $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion in cash flow from ops, now we're at $2 billion to $2.3 billion. So call it
$600 million of a difference. You're going to issue some equity for pensions. So it sounds like pensions may be $200
million of the lowered cash flow, you know, from the May. Can you talk about where the extra $400 million in lower
cash flow is coming from now, if I'm right on the pension?
<A - Luca Maestri>: You're right on the pension. And, if you remember when we were talking at the investor
conference back in May, we gave guidance on earnings of $1.18 to $1.28, so that's come down. So we got about, you
know, $200 million in earnings there. And I think when you think about earnings, you need to think about currency,
you need to think about the economic outlook for Europe. And also, the pension expense itself is $100 million higher
than we were expecting at the time. So you got about $200 million in earnings, $200 million in pensions, and
restructuring. We're going to be doing a bit of restructuring. We talked about $150 million of restructuring in 2012, but
we were expecting only nominal payments back in May. So that's the rough math.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. So that gets us to the $600 million. And then, with all that, my final question is,
you know, okay, we know about 2012 now – you just went through the bridge really. Does 2013 have a snap back
now? You know, if we have flattish cash flow this year, slightly up, and then, do to all these headwinds – where current
rates are today, and best we know without, you know, giving earnings guidance or anything, technically do we have a
snapback in cash flow next year, or do similar factors keep it flattish next year?
<A - Luca Maestri>: The one thing that I can tell you right now, all else being equal, that pension is necessarily going
to be a tailwind going into 2013 and 2014 and 2015. So, we are at a point where you've got discount rates which are at
historical lows. Given the dynamics of our pension plans, we've now frozen future service and accruals. So, we kind of
capped the exposure there. We've had a great return on assets on the pension plan during 2011. So, if discount rates do
not come down further, you could have, you know, certainly well over $100 million just from pension moving forward.
And then of course, you know, we're going to be trying to grow the business and all the other things that should bring

Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Good morning.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Good morning, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: My first question is with regard to Europe. Ursula, could you give us a little more color on
sort of linearity during the quarter, where you specifically saw some of the weakness. And have you seen any changes
as we've entered 2012?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So on linearity, it got worse as the quarter went on. If you recall, last quarter we spoke about
Europe and we were guarded because we still had positive results in Europe, or, you know, good results in Europe. But
we knew – we were suspecting that something would happen. It started to happen in the early parts of the quarter, and it
definitely continued throughout the quarter. And I don't see any – foresee any significant change in either direction in
Europe. That's the way that we're planning. We're planning for continued weak activity in Europe. So linearity, yes, it
got worse as the quarter went on.
And it's all over Europe. Obviously Southern Europe, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, etc., are worse than the rest of
Europe, but we do see weakness even in the stronger countries, where decisions are delayed and activities a little bit
lower, etc., etc. So we do see a significant change in Europe.
Interestingly enough, balance that off against what's happening in the United States and developing markets.
Developing markets were strong throughout the year. You know, it had up and down based on war here, or war there.
But strong business throughout the year. And the U.S., as the year went on and we implemented changes, and kind of
rationalized our coverage, got better every quarter, every month in every quarter. So we see a relatively strong on the
equipment side U.S. business, and a strong developing markets business, offset by weakness in Europe.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And can you talk a bit about the services business, just in terms of the contracts
that you've signed, the 14%, I think or 15% year-over-year increase in signings. Like what type of contracts are you
signing? Where are you seeing the strength? And maybe talk a little bit about ITO as well?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes. So think about our services signings almost across the board. So, you know, we've
signed in the public sector, we've signed transportation contracts with -- in Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, for
example, which we announced earlier. We signed in the private sector with airlines, with banks. So we are seeing a
broad range of signings, primarily in the U.S., obviously, which is where most of our business is. But we also have
signings in Latin America, in developing markets, and signings in Europe.
As we spoke before, Europe is in the BPO business and the ITO business is the smaller portion of our business. A
smaller portion. And we did a change in strategy at the end of the third quarter, or in the third quarter, to move an
executive there to actually manage, stick-handle our European business, which is particularly important now, since
we're seeing some headwinds in Europe. Not yet in the services business, but we want to make sure that we start off
that business with the right cost base in mind. So across the board signings in all – everywhere, it's really good.
ITO signings were unbelievably strong. We are managing ITO – the ITO business is one that clearly we're learning
about as we go through more and more. ITO signing – as you know the – we have some cancels from last quarter that
are hitting us on the revenue side this quarter. We also have a business in ITO that's a resale business, an equipment
resale business that, while good, should not be our major focus, and will not be our major focus on a go-forward basis.
That also puts some pressure on our revenue.

So our purpose with ITO is twofold. One is to actually accompany the rest of the business we have, and make ourselves
more relevant in the rest of the business, the document outsourcing and the BPO business. But in and of itself, it's to get
around these things that you're now hearing the vernacular, [ph] sig (34:15) verticals, where you're not just selling a
bunch of technology, or not just selling some software, you're actually trying to sell a solution around a vertical market.
Healthcare is the most obvious one to talk about, it's the one we're spending the most time on.
So ITO, what we're doing in ITO is re-positioning it. Focusing on longer term, more higher valued engagements with
our clients, focusing on assuring that we renew. This is a problem that should not exist. Renewals should not be a
problem for us, and it was in quarter three, and a little bit in quarter four. So we're focusing on actually changing that,
and making sure that we actually have value with our clients, and intimacy with our clients.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: ITO should be good.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. And then my last question is sort of more of a philosophical one. As you think about
the fact that you're getting strong growth from services and good signings but it's clearly impacting the margin a little
bit with the pressure that you're seeing in Europe. How do you sort of balance, and think about the investment required
on the services side, versus the growth, you know, given some of the macro trends that are out there?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes, it's a great question, by the way. And – and the way I would think about this is to think
both in the short and the longer term, right? So in the short term, we have to make sure that anything that we sign falls
within a set of parameters that allow us to deliver it with high quality, and not sink our financials, right? So, we get lots
of deals proposed, but proposed deals – some of them would not be good if we took them in the beginning. If we did a
lot of California Medicaids, I said this over and over again, we would be having a significant amount of problems. By
the way, the good news is the winning at least one or two or three Medicaids, because they are big and foundational for
our business.
So what we do with signings is we look to make sure that we can operate them well, that we can actually stand them
up, that we can deliver the revenue – the SLAs the revenue and the profits that we want, and have strong margins.
That's in the short term.
In the long term, we try to make sure that we have platforms that are repeatable. That lightens the load. We stay close
to our customers, that keeps our renewal rates high. And we continue to expand outside of the areas that we have today
to continue to grow our services offerings.
So, the way we think about services, it is an engine for growth, and if we, and when we, operate it well, it actually does
fuel the growth that we – that we are seeing today. 6% growth even with a very poor ITO revenue quarter.
Thank you very much, Shannon.

Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question.
My first one, I guess, is on operating margin. There wasn't explicit operating margin guidance for 2012. And it feels
kind of flattish, I guess, after we adjust for the share buyback. But I just wanted to confirm that, and get your thoughts.
Thanks.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, Ananda. To confirm, I think we're planning around operating margins to be flat to slightly
up. As you go through the year, probably, you know, they're going to be accelerating throughout the year because we're
going to be seeing better growth as we go through 2012. So flat to slightly up.

<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Okay, great. And I guess just, sort of follow-up to the services comments you guys made.
How – the BPO signings I guess just optically appeared to be a bit light, particularly after last quarter. Were they in line
with your expectations, or were they, in fact, light? And if they were light, with the strength in ITO signings, does that,
you know, maybe push out some of the ramp to margin expansion as we move through this year and maybe even into
'13?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So, Ananda, signings were a little – BPO signings were a little bit light, but then, I mean,
they were not significantly off. Nothing to panic about. They were a little light. We had a huge signings quarter, as I
said, up, and as Luca said, up, 150 – some huge number in ITO, and document outsourcing remains a strong thing. I
wouldn't – I don't see any real issue with BPO signings. You know, it's bumpy, it comes, they come and they go. And
we're focusing on them. So they should continue to come.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Got it. And would it – Ursula, would it tend to shift your thinking around the road map to
operating margin expansion over the next, you know, year to two years, given the mix of the – of the services signings?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I don't think so. But, let-
<A - Luca Maestri>: So, if I understand the question correctly, Ananda, as we look at operating margins, we know
that in the short term we've got a number of pressures. Pension is one, currency is another one, and obviously some
weakness in Europe.
At the same time, we have a number of tailwinds, and obviously we want to capitalize on those positive factors. We've
got the very strong signings that we bring in, you know, from 2011. We've got a technology portfolio which is
market-leading. We've gained share in every geography of the world, and obviously in share repurchases, we'll have a
bit on earnings. And we will continue to do tuck-in acquisitions. So, as we think about it longer term, longer than 2012,
of course it's our aspiration to continue to grow operating margins.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Okay, thanks a lot, Luca. Last one from me. Just regarding the comments about the
restructuring that you'll be doing as we move through the year, can you give us some sense of how we should layer
those into our quarters in terms of earnings, just so we get the linearity of earnings appropriately set? Thanks.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Well, let me give you Q1. I think we said $0.01 to $0.02. It's part of our guidance. We said $0.21
to $0.24. You should model, you know, $0.01 to $0.02 of restructuring. As we go through the year, we'll see how much
we're going to be doing. It really depends on the environment and, you know, and many other factors.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Could it top out at $0.02 or should we almost certainly expect something beyond that as we
move through the year?
<A - Luca Maestri>: It may round up.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you, Ananda.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. Look, I wanted to ask just on the – for the guidance, for the sale of the IP
that happened in Q4, did that get recognized in Q4, or is that more coming in calendar year '12? So that'll be – is that
included in the guidance as well?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, it's included in the guidance, Keith. And we've got it well laid out in the MD&A. The
majority of the sale was recognized in Q4. I think the profit impact was about $16 million. But then we've got smaller
amounts in '12 and '13 because of the way we set up the arrangement.

<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. So, could I say the amount in '12 and '13 is relatively-it's not material to the

<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, again, in the MD&A it's $12 million and $8 million respectively.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Then let's go to the -
<A - Luca Maestri>: [indiscernible] (41:33) guidance.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Let's go then to the – in the EPS forecast, could you give us your underlying assumption for
operating tax rates, please?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes. We are guiding at 29%.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. You've been consistently coming in below that.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Well, we-
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, well we'll go with 29% then. Then, on the – perhaps this is for you, Ursula, if I could.
The operating margins, just confidence that that works its way through. I think it's understandable that as you ramp new
contracts, it's a bit tougher for the new contracts versus the maturing contracts. But just confidence that you're going to
be able to manage that margin sequence, particularly in ITO where those renewals, I think, have been a bit tougher than
you anticipated.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Well, I mean, it is the operative question, and the place that we spend a significant amount of
our focus, Keith. We are confident. I mean, we're confident -- as confident as you can be before you do it. We have
mapped it. We know the customers in ITOs. It's all around renewals here, right? Because the signings are coming, we
know the ramps. We don't have any really egregious contracts, you know, large contracts outside that will – outside of
California, in which we already are comprehending for sure, that will take up a significant amount of investment before
we get revenue. So that we have a normal kind of layout of contracts. And so, our focus is going to be on renewals.
Our renewal rate overall is a little bit lighter than normal. BPO is a little bit light; but it's fine. Document outsourcing,
not really that relevant. The big place we have to spend a lot of our attention is in ITO, and we are doing that. So we're
getting the business, and now we're managing the customers to assure we stay intimate with them. And if there is a
nonrenewal, it's because the customer no longer needs the service versus they're not pleased with our service delivery.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, yes. You just hit – my follow-up on that one would be to say the different way you're
not losing those ITO renewals on price, it's just the customer's, say, in sourcing?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes. Price is generally not the issue here. There are two – there are three reasons why you
can lose. Obviously one is that the customer doesn't need your service anymore, they in source, or the contract is just
done.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: The second one is price, meaning – or some other competitive type thing; price, or terms or
conditions, which'll end up in price. And then the third is outright losses. I mean, you compete with a company and
they say I like Joe better than Peter, or like Xerox better than someone else. The place that we have to make sure that
we continue to focus, price is not going to be our issue. We will manage price. If we want to win it, we will win it, if it
looks good in the long term. That's not the issue. It's all around assuring that we continue an even level of contact and
service with the clients , and making sure they understand that we are in their camp. It's basic customer care.
We will – we are, we've taken a really big focus on this in the ITO business, and we'll continue to do that, which will
drive up the business. Clearly price has something to do with everything, Keith. Everything.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Ok. Fair enough. I'm going to ask one more philosophical question, particularly for you,
Ursula. If I look at your layout on page 13, Slide 3 excuse me, about 25% of your available cash, for 2012, is targeted
to acquisitions, with the balance towards share repurchase. And I just wanted to know, kind of an IBM type of question,

is that how you think about the model over the next number of years? Or is there any kind of comments or color you
could give that we should be thinking longer term?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes. I think the way that we should think of it – for 2012 clearly the – you know, the plan as
that's laid out in Slide 13 and the philosophy is pretty much the same as happened in 2011.
The way that you should think about 2013 and beyond is along the same buckets. So clearly we're going to use our
available cash to buy back shares, think about a dividend. So that type of shareholder return, acquisitions and
dividends.
But the mix may change. It depends on – a lot on the price of the shares, what's available in the marketplace. Right now
we're using a disproportionate amount of our cash towards share repurchase, and it may change. But it will not be so far
different. So we will not walk away from share repurchase. It's still a very valuable tool for us and very lucrative for the
shareholders. So we'll continue to do that, and the whole question is on, you know, around the edges.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: [indiscernible] (46:22).
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Well, I'd encourage you to think about mix more, but I will cede the floor, and thanks

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Well, thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Hi Richard.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Good Morning. I wanted to – I guess, not to beat a dead horse, but to go back to the
services margin decline a little bit more, and maybe try to ask the question differently.
You've always said that 5% to 10% was sort of the right – well, I think it's fair to say that you've said 5% to 10% was
the right growth rate to think about for the services business. And yet the margins are coming in a little lower year over
year. And so I just wanted to see if you could help us parse out how much of that is contract ramps, how much is
contract runoff, and how much is price pressure?
And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes. I'll give it a try, Richard. We have been – you know, when you think about the dynamics of
gross margins and clearly they came in, on the services side, slightly below what we were expecting. And I think the
issue has been around the combination of a – you know, contract ramps, which were pretty much included in our
projections, and renewal rates, which were below the historical ranges. So we've always talked about renewing at about
85%. Ideally aspiration is to to 90%; you know our renewal rates have come in, in the low 80s for the year. So that's
where you really see that level of gross margin compression that we want to avoid going forward.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay, and in light of that, Luca and Ursula, could you talk about the right way to think
about operating margins for services for this year, and I don't know, maybe even philosophically for 2013?
<A - Luca Maestri>: I would say for 2012, we probably during the first half, we're going to be seeing a continuation of
what you've seen in 2011. But we believe that we're going to be improving margins in the second half, because there's
going to be an acceleration also in the revenue growth for services.

Page 13 of 17
And then as we go into 2013, of course, again our aspiration is to grow margins all the time. But we need to recognize
that if, you know, growth accelerates and we end up winning very large deals, like we've done in the past, for example
in California, this is something that in the short term, because they're so sizable will have an impact on margins. But as
you look longer term, they become profitable contracts, and they expand our position in the marketplace.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay, thank you. And then one other question from me, and that is, was there any
meaningful benefit from Japan expedite expenses going away in the fourth quarter? I think that had been a meaningful
drag for you earlier in the year. Could you talk about whether that was a benefit in Q4, and whether there's any residue
left there, or if we're back to zero?
<A - Luca Maestri>: We've had very minor expenses related to the destruction in Japan in Q4. It wasn't a big issue. So
quarter on quarter it was obviously a slight positive. I'd like to step back for a second and talk about operating margins
for technology for the year. We were up, in technology, 60 basis points in operating margins, in spite of all the disaster
from Japan, in spite of currency. I mean, the yen, you know, is more than 30% higher against the dollar over the last
three years; in spite of the weakness in Europe. So, I think if you step back and you look at our performance in
technology in terms of preserving margins, I think it's been admirable.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay, great. If I can sneak one more in. Ursula, have you seen any movement on supplies
pricing in the marketplace? We've heard from some contacts out there that there are general price increases going
through on the supply side here in January and February, and I'm wondering if you're seeing that, and whether you
think that could potentially benefit Xerox here in Q1.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: In – through to Q4, this earnings period, we didn't see any. And we've heard the same things
that you've heard. And we'll look around and see how our – we're positioned competitively, and if we have space we'll
take it. If we're positioned in a place that allows us to take price up, we'll do that. We want to stay competitive to the
marketplace; we want to make sure that we continue to gain share, and so we'll look at the marketplace out there, and if
we can fit it in, we'll do it.
Thank you very much, Rich.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Thank you. I have a question on the services division as well. You know, specifically
drilling down on the some of the challenges you're having with renewals. Can you help us understand exactly how you
address those challenges, particularly this year? And from your prior experience, how much control do you really feel
you have over this dynamic? And I guess really what I'm trying to get to is, can you give us some assurance that this
isn't a sign of an emerging problem with competitive positioning or anything?
<A - Luca Maestri>: So we have – Bill, we've got a long history around renewing contracts. And, you know,
particularly ACS, but also on the document outsourcing side. And we've always been in a range of 80% to 90%, and
clearly our target is to be 85% to 90%. What we've seen during 2011 as being a specific issue around renewal rates,
exclusively in our ITO business, and it's been related to three or four meaningful contracts. It hasn't been a widespread
loss on renewals. It's been specific, three or four specific situations; different reasons. At the same time, we have signed
up significantly more that what we've lost. So the net-net of the two things, the growth in signings versus the loss of
renewal is clearly a positive that will translate in to revenue growth, we believe starting from the second half of 2012.
So there isn't anything systemic that we're concerned about.
And I would say that having grown signings by 15% year over year, actually tells us that we are quite competitive in
the marketplace. If you exclude the California and Texas contracts that we signed in 2010, mega deals, very specific
events, actually, our signings are up 40%. So we feel very, very, good where we are in the marketplace. We had

specific circumstances in ITO. It's about customer engagement and that's what we need to work on.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Well that makes sense. And then a final question. I know we're coming towards the end here. On
cash flow, if there are any further downward surprises, whether it's macro or whatever it may be, or mix. At what point,
you know, just trying to gauge the risk here – at what point do you have to be more constrained with your cash usage in
terms of the share repurchase plans in particular? Is there a line in the sand that you're looking at where you'd have to
step back a bit, or where it would make sense to step back a bit? Or do you feel fairly comfortable at this point that
you've really factored in all the risks to this cash-flow outlook?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Well, just to be practical, and we've included this in our – also in our earnings range, we – you
know, we'll be doing most of our repurchase activity during the second half of the year. So we're going to have much
better visibility. If something happens, you know, any collapse somewhere else around the world, we would be dealing
with it. We don't need to make a decision right now. We feel at this point, given all the puts and takes, we feel very
confident that we can deliver on this capital allocation strategy.
Of course, at any point in time, we can revisit. It's very difficult for us to get ahead of ourselves because most of the
activity will happen towards the end of the year.

of restructuring, and probably more restructuring down the road if the macro worsens?

We have really a gold mine there in terms of removing complexity, streamlining the portfolio, rationalizing
components. And again, we have a significant infrastructure. It's a legacy infrastructure. We're not near the end. We
will continue every day to come to the office, to look for efficiency in our operations. If we can get, you know, revenue
growth that efficiency will go into the revenue growth. If we cannot get revenue growth, that efficiency will go towards
cost reductions.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And just – muscle are things like research, are selling resources, customer engagement, that's
muscle. And I think what Luca is saying, that while everything is needed – a lot of things are needed to run the
company, there are certain things that are really hard to rebuild if you take them away. We're not focusing on those
areas. Those areas for as long as we've done restructuring, back to the 2000 time, have been protected and exalted
because we know it's difficult to get them back.
But we have a lot of cost in this company. And as the world changes, we're going to have to actually morph the cost to
actually be more appropriate to where growth is coming, or just remove it from the company. So, and that's what we're
– that's the path that we're on.
Thank you very much.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. My second question is around cash flow. Clearly, it's been a hot topic for investors
over the past year, and I kind of share Keith Bachman's sentiment here. So I was trying to figure out if you're cash
usage is being applied appropriately here. And what I mean by that, is we've been hearing now, for almost two years,

about all these signings, and eventually we're going to get the revenue and thereby the cash flow. But I hear more about
band-aids than I do really about return on the cash flow here. And I'm just wondering if you need to maybe jumpstart
the acquisition machine to really get that cash flow, and the return on the cash flow, working in the right direction over
the next 12 months to 24 months.
<A - Luca Maestri>: ...I don't know where to start. I think we are – you know, we are making the investments that we
believe are appropriate. We're looking at acquisitions in a very disciplined manner. ACS has done it consistently. We
keep doing it even now. And so we look at attractive returns on our acquisition investments. And so, you know, we're
going to be looking at opportunities. We bought 16 companies during the course of 2011.
It is very important for us that, you know, our cash flows are sustainable for the long term. And so, you know,
sometimes we get asked why our cash flow has come down a bit versus, perhaps, expectations. And one of the reasons
is because we've put a lot of investments into the business. And sometimes they don't come through acquisitions.
Sometimes they come through a new large contract, like California for example. So maybe there's been a bit of a shift
between investing in acquisitions versus investing in the organic business. But again, I think we look at it from a return
on capital perspective, and that's the way we actually assess our investments.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you Mark. Next question, Please.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the sustainability of technology margins.
Specifically, I'm interested on what you're seeing from a pricing standpoint on equipment. It sounds like you've turned
a bit more aggressive on equipment to drive some unit placements. How does that flow through to margins over the
next couple of quarters, number one? And number two, is it fair to say you have gotten more aggressive in order to
drive those unit placements?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I think that you can look at the unit placements from two different perspectives. Price, we're
still in a range of 5% to 10% price erosion on a year-to-year basis. Maybe a little bit higher this quarter, at the higher
end of the range than in the past, but not anything outside of that range.
The big driver here is mix. Mix is a – mix in all of the categories, entry, mid, and high. If you look at the products that
we've been very successful on, and the products that we've launched, these 27 products, they're skewed towards the
lower end of the mix range, the price range. So we get lots of activity, we'll get good [ph] pull (1:00:35) sale, but the
revenue doesn't necessarily map to it in the short term because the prices are lower.
I think that the margins for the technology business, connecting it to the previous conversation that we just had, the
previous question, are – I mean, we're in a range where they're sustainable. They take work, it'll take work to get there.
This is where we manage cost and expense, you know, continuously. Simplification, et cetera, et cetera. But I do
believe that they are sustainable. And I think that we're showing good results on that.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes. Just to add to that. So as we get into 2012, as I said, 2011 was very good for margins in the
technology business, we actually expanded margins in spite of all the pressures. We continue to have currency issues,
and we continue to have pension expense issues, for 2012. And so that will put some pressure on technology margins,
and that is the reason why we're talking about efficiencies, and we're talking about restructuring. And we keep
managing it.
But, I would say, you know, net-net, when you look at technology, we are industry leader, gaining market share,
expanding margins. I would say that it's a testament to the quality of our products.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you. Last question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Great. Thanks very much. First, just a clarification, if I could. I just want to confirm that
your revenue guidance for the year does include the impact of acquisitions, which I expect would probably add a
couple of points of growth in itself?
<A - Luca Maestri>: It does include acquisitions, Deepak.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Okay. And then Luca, if I can just follow up on Europe. Can you remind us of your
revenue exposure to Europe in the technology segment, and ex-Europe can you give us a sense of growth in the
technology segment in the fourth quarter, and maybe just talk us through your expectations for the year, both for
Europe, versus ex-Europe.
<A - Luca Maestri>: So, Europe, in total, is about – we're exposed about 20% of our revenue base. In technology, just
to give you a sense, Deepak, equipment revenue for the company was down 2% in Q4. It would have been up 2%
excluding Europe. So both the U.S. and DMO were solid in Q4. And we definitely saw the weakness in Europe.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Okay. That's really helpful. And then maybe lastly for Ursula. In the technology segment,
can you give us an update on where you are in terms of just expanding distribution, particularly to reach SMB-type
customers, and any metrics that you can share around contribution to the overall tech segment revenue, and perhaps
growth that you saw in your SMB revenue last year would be very helpful. Thanks so much.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes. Expanding distribution is something that's been very successful for us. I think it's
showing up, by the way, in the U.S. revenue dynamics, and the activity dynamics, that we just talked through. The
performance of the tech business without Europe, which would have been up, which is a change, which is a change for
us. The U.S. has been on and off. We have, I think, a solid footing now, primarily focused on the product set and the
expansion of distribution. So it's worked out fairly well.
We have everything that comes available that is good for us to tuck in, we tuck in. You know, my – I don't think I've
said this publicly before, but after a while you run out of things to buy. I don't know if we're quite there, but we may be
getting there on the tech side. So a lot more of our acquisitions will be focused on services as we go forward. We'll pick
up the odd SMB distribution capacity in the United States.
So good news across the board. I think that we've done as much as we can do with a little bit around the edges to
expand it, and we'll be focusing on services on a go-forward basis.
Ursula M. Burns
To all of you, thank you very much for your time and for your interest, and have a good first quarter.
