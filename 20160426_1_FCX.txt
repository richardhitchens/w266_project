On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we've also got Red Conger here, and Mark Johnson.
I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results, and then, turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to
our presentation materials on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for Q&A.
Today FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion or $3.35 per share for first quarter of 2016.
The loss included net charges totaling $4 billion or $3.19 per share primarily for the reduction of carrying value of oil
and gas properties, idle rig costs then other items. After adjusting for the net special items, the first quarter adjusted net
loss attributable to common stock totaled $197 million or $0.16 per share.
The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first quarter approximated $873 million and
there's a reconciliation of that amount on page 32 of our slide deck. Consolidated sales totaled 1.1 billion pounds of
copper during the quarter, just over 200,000 ounces of gold, 17 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.1 million barrels
of oil equivalents.
Our realized price for copper during the first quarter was $2.17 per pound. That was below last year's first quarter
average of $2.72 per pound. Gold prices were slightly above last year's average in the first quarter 2016, our gold prices
averaged $12.27 per ounce and our realized price for crude oil during the first quarter of 2016 was $29 per barrel. That
was significantly below last year's first quarter price of $44.54 per barrel, which included about $12 per barrel in
realized gains on derivative contracts.
We reported very good cost performance during the quarter and are on track to meet or exceed our cost guidance for
the year. The average cost of production net of by-product credits for our copper mines averaged $1.38 per pound in the
first quarter of 2016. Those were lower than last year's first quarter of $1.64. We had the benefit of volumes and also
the impact of our ongoing cost reduction initiative. Our average cost of $1.38 was below the estimate we provided in
January 2016 of $1.44 per pound.
We generated operating cash flows totaling $740 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures were just under $1
billion at $982 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $20.8 billion in debt, and our consolidated cash
was $331 million. Richard's going to be talking on this call about our efforts to reduce debt significantly and our
progress on our asset sale program. We ended the quarter with availability under our revolver of totaling $3 billion at
quarter-end. And at the end of the quarter, we had 1.25 billion common shares outstanding.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation.
Richard C. Adkerson
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. It's been a very active and
encouraging quarter for us here at Freeport. We're just mailing out our Annual Report. The theme of it's Proving Our
Metal. That's the ability to face a demanding situation in a spirited and resilient way. And I can tell you, our team here
couldn't be approaching its work in a more positive way from that standpoint. I'm very proud of all that our team is
doing.
We have a clearly defined strategy that our board has set and we're really focused on executing it now. We experienced
strong operating results in the face of weak commodity prices and we made a lot of progress in achieving our strategic
and financial objectives during this quarter.
Our reported earnings were in line with our plans; actually, a bit higher because we had somewhat higher copper prices
during the quarter. We did have a significant additional impairment charge, which is substantially all in our oil and gas
business. And we have taken recent steps to restructure that business to reduce cost and that is progressing well.
We've got a really good operating team there, some good assets and we're focused on attacking cost aggressively and
have begun to do that. We're continuing to look for opportunities to sell or monetize assets in the oil and gas business.
But we're now working with – and it's a tough market, admittedly, a tough market to try to do that, but we are working
with our operating team on new plans to preserve and enhance value of our assets for the future.

With our mining business, we're performing well. The Cerro Verde startup is proceeding exceptionally well. We'll talk
a bit more about that. Mining CapEx are declining as we've been talking about in the past. Volumes are increasing.
Costs are being constrained and copper prices have risen from the lows in the face of an admittedly uncertain global
market. But there's been positive movements recently.
We are continuing with our efforts to improve our balance sheet and have increasing confidence that we're going to be
able to do that in an effective way. And after we get our balance sheet situation developed, we're going to have a –
continue to have an industry-leading copper company and we remain very positive about its long-term fundamentals.
With the copper market itself, the initial benefit came, of course, from monetary policies; policies to encourage
business activity in China and [indiscernible] (08:22) position by the U.S. Fed initially created a more positive
environment for copper and other commodity prices. But recent data out of China, its internal economy has been
encouraging in power grid business, automobiles, but recognize that it's a mixed situation there as construction remains
subdued. But there is improved market sentiment, short positions have been closed, long positions have been taken,
which is just a function of the marketplace.
And globally, demand is improving modestly. So the net of all this has been that the large anticipated surplus in the
copper markets have not materialized. Companies are reducing cost as we are and we're pleased with our progress
there. There's been some curtailment, not as much as might be expected, but almost 800,000 tons year-to-date, but the
pipeline of new supply of projects is declining as companies are deferring projects, cutting CapEx. And all of this is
resulting in a longer-term outlook for very positive copper price environment and that's what we're focused on finding a
way to structure our business to take advantage of that.
Page five is a slide that illustrates the theme that I've been talking about for years. Existing base production is declining
over the next 10 years. Wood Mackenzie predicts an 18% decline in production from just under 20 million tons a year
to just over 16 million tons a year. If you take very modest outlooks for global consumption growth, they use 1.7%.
You end up with a shortfall of mine supply in relation to consumption of 7 million tons.
Right now, Wood Mackenzie estimates that highly probable mine development's only 2 million tons. That leaves 5
million tons to be made up by other projects. The top 10 mines in the world produce about that level. So that shows the
extent of the shortfall. And one-third of that 5 million tons has to come from new projects that are not considered
probable today. That's over 3 million tons. That's three Escondido; roughly eight Morenci. So there's got to be a lot of
new mines developed at an incentive price even in today's world for developing new mines is at prices that are
probably 50% higher than the current price. So that's what we're in the business for and we remain confident about it.
So what are we doing right now? That's what's on everybody's mind. And that's what we're focusing on. We are
executing our strategy. We're going to strengthen our balance sheet. We're going to maintain a high-quality portfolio of
assets and we're going to position them for value creation. We've adjusted our mine plans, curtailed some high cost
production, have contingency plans for taking further steps, if need be. That's going well. We are completing our major
projects. With the Cerro Verde project, that's the completion of the third of three projects that we started in 2011. And
all three of those have gone well and will be beneficial to us in the coming years.
We've financially suspended our dividend. We've issued $2 billion of equity in 2015. Our asset sales progress, which
we commented on in some detail at our fourth quarter earnings release is going very well. We are really encouraged by
the nature of those discussions and now we've taken steps through restructuring our management, oil and gas business,
taking cost cuts to align that business with our corporate objectives of improving our balance sheet by reducing cost,
approaching future investments in a different way. And so that is what we are doing and what we're all about.
In terms of cost experience in the mining business for the first quarter, you can see on slide seven that we made
progress. We achieved levels at lower than our January guidance, consolidated $1.38. We're reducing that further as
you'll see for 2016 as a year, particularly strong performance. And Red Conger's here with his team in the Americas
where we've come in below our fourth quarter numbers and our guidance for site production and delivery cost in the
Americas. And we continue to have our low-cost operations in Indonesia and Africa. Volumes were good, consistent
with our guidance going into the quarter. So running fundamentals of our business is important, and our guys are doing

great, doing it.
Asset transactions that we've announced to-date includes the Morenci transaction and two smaller transactions. Good
values in those. Morenci is scheduled to close in the second quarter. No hitches there. And we recently announced a
transaction involving the Serbia exploration project, Timok, which we're getting both good initial values,
accomplishing some strategic objectives and getting initial development going on the upper zone, while we were going
to retain a significant interest in operational control of the potentially much, much larger lower zone. So that is going
good.
We're advancing discussions on additional transactions, very pleased with that project. Much more confident today than
we were early during the first quarter when the market was in such a concerning situation. But what we're seeing here –
and we're in advanced discussions – is the scarcity of quality assets in the copper business is attracting significant
interest from potential purchasers who share our longer-term positive view of the marketplace. So we're confident that
we're going to be able to achieve the goals that we set out. And beyond that, we have other opportunities that are
available to us that we're not currently pursuing, but in which parties have stepped up and said they're very interested in
those.
So while we don't have specific transactions to report today, I'm telling you that we internally are very optimistic,
confident that we're going to be able to go forward and meet our goals in a way that's going to be positive for our
company and positive for our investors.
The reason we can do this is because of this portfolio of assets. We got pictures here on page nine of Morenci recently
expanded largest copper mine, very profitable in North America, very long-lived. Cerro Verde, as we developed it, had
the world's largest concentrating facility, and it has ramped up very well. And without the typical startup issues you
have in terms of cost and schedule and mechanical issues going forward. It was a big project, $4.6 billion but lots of
support from the local community in the Arequipa region of Peru; great team, has gone very well.
Grasberg, where we continue to have discussions with the government of Indonesia on our contract, is remarkable
long-term resource, one of the industry's historically largest copper and gold reserves, and it's an asset that is very
important to our portfolio, important to the government of Indonesia, important to the Province of Papua.
And then Tenke Fungurume is the most successful largest mine in the copper belt region of Katanga, Zambia and
operating extremely well and has a long life with very significant development opportunities associated with it.
Coming back to Grasberg, we, of course, want to refer back to the important letter that we received on October 7 when
the mine's minister, with the support of the President, indicated that the government would move towards granting our
contract extension on terms that were consistent with our existing COW in terms of the financial aspects of it and the
enforceability of it.
The revised revisions to the regulations that were anticipated in unfortunately have not been adopted. Instead, the
country is now working on revising its mining law and the related regulations. The government officials continue to
express support for the position in the October 7 letter. We have agreed as part of that to divest incremental interest in
PTFI at fair market value, up to 30%. Press reports out today about a government position referring to replacement cost
and a lower valuation than the $17 billion valuation we submitted in January of this year. The official letter from the
government did not give a valuation amount within the press, but it wasn't in the letter. They refer to regulations, not
specifically replacement costs.
I want to tell you that in all of our agreements with the Government of Indonesia, we have indicated any divestment
would be at fair market value. That's consistent with our contract, and that remains our position.
Slide 10 shows the Cerro Verde project. You can see you how well this thing has ramped up. We began first copper in
September, and month by month, we've increased the throughput through our new Concentrator 2 Project.
In March, we hit above capacity, 373,000 tons a day. Strong performance on capital cost management startup. So that
was an issue for us. That was our objective a year ago to talk to you at this call about what we were going to do in
2015. Here's an example of how we executed.

Since we did the Phelps Dodge deal nine years ago now, I've talked, I think, on every conference call about the strength
Freeport has been in our copper resources. Very large proved and probable reserves, very large mineralized material at
our existing mines that provide assurance of the opportunities to invest when the markets fit, and then, potential that is
huge that goes beyond that.
So that's what we still have. And this is what's going to allow us to deal with this balance sheet issue by raising capital
through property sales or otherwise and then end up with a very substantial copper resource-based company as we go
forward. That's our strategy, and this is the reason why we will be able to execute it effectively.
Now to show you – I think those of you who follow us know we've got a great copper business underneath all this
market issue and issues associated with oil and gas investment. The company has a remarkable copper business. This
has shown that by 2015 when we're still investing in Cerro Verde so aggressively, and we had EBITDA that matched
our CapEx. Going into 2016, as we were wrapping up, Cerro Verde even in lower copper prices averaging $2.17,
EBITDA substantially exceeded CapEx.
And as we look forward to the year 2016, at varying copper prices from here forward, first quarter's in the books, but if
it's $2 for the rest of the year, we would have $4.6 billion of EBITDA; $2.25, it's $5.7 billion; $2.50, it's $6.8 billion.
And our CapEx is only $1.8 billion as we've completed Cerro Verde, and as we're continuing to invest in Grasberg
underground and managing maintenance capital in a very effective way. So we've got a business that is generating
substantial cash flows to help us with our financial objectives.
Now, in the oil and gas business, the debt level that we have of roughly $20 billion was created by the initial oil and gas
investments and subsequent spending in that business on an aggressive growth profile. That was really upset by initially
the fall in oil prices and then when copper prices fell, that took away the ability of the copper business to support it with
its own cash flows.
So that's why we're having to take these really aggressive actions now to rectify our balance sheet. We've got a new
organizational structure in the oil and gas business. It's now being integrated into our Freeport-McMoRan corporate
structure being run as an operating division as opposed to a standalone corporate entity that it has been doing since the
acquisition in 2013. This is allowing us to reduce cost.
Last week, we reduced employment by roughly 25%. And we're continuing to look for ways to reduce cost through
looking at office facilities and other cost elements. We're going to align the way we spend money in that business with
our corporate objectives in terms of how do we generate cash flows, how do we contribute to our balance sheet
improvement activities. We're winding down significant capital spending. We have recently completed a series of
tieback wells to our production facility. That's going to allow us for a period of time to maintain near-term production
without additional drilling.
In the Holstein Deep area, we commenced initial production just this month. Two additional wells are coming on in the
second quarter. At the Horn Mountain and Marlin tiebacks, we commenced production on the D-13 King well in the
first quarter. The Kilo/Oscar Quebec/Victory tiebacks are in progress, and we have four additional drilled wells that are
in our inventory, including Horn Mountain Deep that we're going to be able to bring on production without drilling new
wells. That's going to allow us to maintain production for the foreseeable future.
And when you step back and look at these assets, they're very attractive. It started with the acquisition prior to the
merger of three underutilized deepwater platforms in the deepwater to Gulf of Mexico, the Horn Mountain, Holstein
projects and Marlin. That's where our tieback activities are going.
We also have interest in the non-operating new producing projects at Lucius and Heidelberg and a long-term
development project in the Vito area in Mississippi Canyon. This is the structure of our business. We have significant
production in California, but these are really good assets.
We looked for potential buyers for the business during the first quarter aggressively. The board has special financial
advisors. We worked with our established bankers and canvassed the market and because of the conditions in the
marketplace, with low oil prices, with credit pressures on companies from the very largest through the business with the

lack of credit, we just concluded at this point that the values that might be available in sale or monetization transactions
simply didn't reflect the long-term value of these assets.
And that's why we've taken the steps to restructure our business. We've got an operating team there that's really
impressive. They're experienced. They're well-recognized in the industry. They've got a great track record. And so
we're very comfortable of our ability to manage this business in an effective way and realize long-term values for our
business.
Now, turning to slide 15, you can see the leverage to prices that our oil and gas business has and at $35 Brent we have
$600 million, but at $45, it's $1 billion, $1.4 billion, it's $55. These are EBITDA numbers, and $1.8 billion, it's $65.
We've reduced CapEx for 2017 to $500 million. We do have some idle rig costs of about that amount that we're dealing
with. But it is a business that is leveraged to oil prices. No guarantees, but there's certainly opportunities for oil prices
to increase.
We can maintain production, continue to monitor the marketplace and look for ways of contributing to our strategic
objective of improving our balance sheet. We've updated our numbers for the outlook for 2016. This does reflect the
closing of the Morenci transaction, where we're selling additional 13% interest in Morenci and so that's the basic
adjustment for copper and other adjustments are more in the nature of just typical ongoing adjustments.
I'll point out that the unit cost for copper has been dropped to $1.05 consolidated. That's down from $1.10, reflects
some improvement in gold price by-product, but also the efforts of all of our team to reduce cost before by-products.
Strong production cost of $15 a barrel, $14 a barrel for our oil business, which is down $1. Operating cash flows, as
we've talked about earlier, at $4.8 billion, $2.25 copper. And each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year,
the last nine months of 2016 is $340 million variance for us. CapEx are in line with our previous estimates.
As we look forward to 2017, we will see copper at $4.6 billion; gold sales rising as we complete mining the open-pit at
Grasberg. Molybdenum sales being adjusted for the market, and as I pointed out earlier, oil sales being maintained at
the current level of close to $160 million a day.
EBITDA variations are shown and cash flow variations are shown on slide 18. Starting with EBITDA, this includes
first quarter actuals and sensitivities for the remaining nine months, averaging 2016, 2017. But at $2, it's $5.6 billion;
$2.25; $6.7 billion; $2.50, $7.8 billion for EBITDA and cash flows varying over prices going from $2 to $2.50 between
roughly $3.5 billion and $5 billion. Capital expenditures are dropping.
Page 19, we have cut capital in half for 2016, cutting it another 50% for 2017. You can see how that splits out between
our oil and gas business, our major mining projects, the remaining major mining project is the Grasberg underground
development, and then, what we're doing with maintenance capital.
I keep mentioning we're committed to improving our balance sheet. We are going to get this $20 billion debt level
down. We're going to do that by running our business right, constraining cost and capital spending and also raising
capital through asset sales.
The improvement in our share price and our bond trading may give us some opportunities for capital transactions, but
for the time being really focused on these asset sales discussions that we're advancing. We have a very manageable
near-term debt maturity schedule. We have roughly $3 billion available under our $3.5 billion amended bank credit
facility, have $300 million in cash; virtually no – very low maturities at least in 2016 and manageable maturities in
2017. So from a corporate standpoint, our near-term liquidity is very strong.
Come back to saying we're focused on execution, had a great quarter in terms of execution to begin the year off with
and I'm very confident we'll continue that track record as we go forward into the year. So that's a quick overview, and I
wanted to run through it so that we can have time for your questions.
And so, Tony, I see you're first up.

[Operator Instructions] The first question does come from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Anthony Rizzuto>: Thanks very much. Hi, Richard, Kathleen, Red and Mark. Good to see the progress thus far.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks, Tony.
<Q - Anthony Rizzuto>: I've got several questions here. The first one on Indonesia and I was interested in the
comments about capital spending deferrals. I was wondering if you can comment about that a little bit further. And then
also, the mill issue that you experienced during the quarter and you applied a temporary fix to it. Just wondered if you
could just talk about that a little bit more and what you're doing there and that type of thing. And I've got a couple other
questions about different areas.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay, Tony. First of all, we have taken steps to reduce capital – Mark Johnson's here. To
reduce capital, we revised some mine plans and we are reducing capital. What we have not done yet is defer the
fundamental development of our underground resources. We completed the Deep MLZ extension of the DOZ mine.
That's really a long-term extension from our initial Block Cave development beginning in early 1980. This is the most
recent major extension on that. That was completed last year and is ramping up.
The underground development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is really beneficial to the asset, beneficial to
Government of Indonesia, and, of course, Freeport, for us to continue with that so that when the pit is completed,
roughly, at the end of 2017, we would have that mine ready to begin ramp-up. And so we've been very reluctant –
remain very reluctant to suspend that. But that is drawn into question seriously by not having the regulations amended
and getting our contract extended. We obviously are spending that money in expectation and confidence that we will
get extended. And the government officials keep saying that but have not taken the actions that are necessary to
document it yet.
Roughly, 75% or more of the production from the underground is going to be realized after 2021 when our primary
term ends. So we're currently engaged with the government in explaining that to them. We also have the issue there
with the smelter that we've agreed to develop, provided we get our contract extension and we're unable to spend
substantial money on advancing the smelter project without having the contract extended. So that's the big issues we
face. Discussions are ongoing as we speak, and our board is considering what actions we should take for it.
With respect to the mill issue, Mark, why don't I let you explain that briefly?
<A - Mark Johnson>: Okay. Yeah, Tony, in late January, we had a bolt fail in our 38-foot Siemens wrap-around mill.
It's a gearless motor, electric motor. The bolt failed and it ended up shorting out about seven of the coils. There's about
648 coils that are part of the stator. As you mentioned, we initially were able to bypass that damaged segment and we
were able to run the mill fine about 5% B rated. Since that period, we've evaluated the longer-term repair and got
prepared for it and determined that we should take it down in April, which we did, still over eight to drill. We took the
mill down. We got Siemens there to help us, some other contractors. So we're just eight days into the repair, but it's
going very well.
We scheduled about 32 days of downtime for this repair, but we're pretty confident where we sit right now that that will
be closer to 24 days, 25 days. So in addition to repairing the mill, we're going to look at some of the issues and we
think we can address any of the issues that might have caused that bolt to fail in the first place and we're also obviously
taking advantage of this downtime to do some opportunity maintenance throughout the plant.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: All of these things are reflected in our outlook, in our costs, in our production volumes
and so forth. First time this has happened in 20 years of operation of this mill, and it's happened in other places and
we're confident of getting it fixed on schedule that Mark talked to you about.
<Q - Anthony Rizzuto>: Thanks, both. Richard, just a follow-up on Indonesia in terms of the bigger picture from a
standpoint of the negotiations, the discussions with the government. Is it still the biggest logjam there? Is that still the

refusal to this point for the government to want to discuss this extension only until two years before the original COW
is due to expire?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, that is the current regulation. Our legal position is that regulation doesn't apply to
our contract. But so far the government has not taken steps to revise that regulation. My observation is that there's a
wider recognition of that being a problem, not just for Freeport, but for the mining industry in general. And the
anticipation by many is that that would be addressed in the revision to the mining law and the regulations.
So that is a current issue for the government officials. We thought it would have been resolved by now. It has not been.
And so now the government's working with the DPR to address it that way. That has an uncertain timeframe for getting
done and you have to admit uncertain outcomes, because of the different political views. So anyway, we're continuing
to work with them.
<Q - Anthony Rizzuto>: Okay, Richard. And then, I want to ask a question with regard to the asset sales process. And
I think you mentioned in your comments, you mentioned something about other opportunities and I didn't quite know
what you meant by that.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: All right. Well, let me address this, Tony, and then we're going to need to let others
come and ask questions.
<Q - Anthony Rizzuto>: Okay. Understood.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: But all I'm doing is referring back to my original comments in the fourth quarter
year-end earnings release that to convey to the market that we are putting our highest priority in fixing our balance
sheet and that we would look for opportunities involving any of our assets. And so what we've done since then is we
focused on transactions that would help us achieve our transactions in a positive way. We're going to work, and I
believe we will get those transactions completed.
But beyond that, we have other assets that are not part of our current transactions that we would turn to if we're not
successful with this initial round of discussions. I'm telling you, I believe we'll be successful with the initial rounds of
discussions, but if for whatever reason we're not, we have other alternatives to turn to.
<Q - Anthony Rizzuto>: Understood, Richard. I appreciate that. And I'll get back in queue. Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, thanks, Tony. And I just want to say, you've got to appreciate that these are
confidential discussions. They take time and due diligence, and a lot of issues go into it. But I am feeling much better
today than I did in January.

Your next question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Good morning, Evan.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: I had a question on Cerro Verde. I guess there's been some reports out that water allocation
issues with Rio in Chile, and it seems like from your guidance that you're managing to move through this without any
sort of issue. And I'm just wondering if there's any risk to that.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, the reports came about, because this El Niño effect's having weather consequences
throughout areas where we operate. And there was a drought period there. The river was affected by it because of the
upstream dams. And so there was some allocation deals. There has been returns of replenishing rains, and we worked
this out. We don't anticipate that being a problem at all.

<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Okay. Thanks. And then, one question on Heidelberg. Cobalt had put something in their 10-K
that I picked up on, something about the appraisal well leading to them – I can't remember the exact language, but
concerns that there could be a material downgrade to plan. Is there anything you can comment on there as far as what
you're seeing out of that?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Sure. First of all, when you look at these earnings releases of different companies, they
acquire their interest in different ways. And so their book carrying values are going to differ company to company.
The geology at Heidelberg is [indiscernible] (42:55) analysis has changed; some of the locations of the wells are being
revised. Our team still has confidence about the resource, and this will be handled. And so what you're seeing now is
the effects of some of the initial development wells having to be relocated in terms of where they're being drilled to
access the reservoir. Visited with the team last week, and they feel confident that it's not really a detriment to the
overall resource that's available there.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Okay. Thanks. And just maybe one final one, if I may. At the last half of the year at the market
equity raise, the stock price was actually lower than where it was trading today. I'm just wondering given the rebound
in the equity, if that's something that you may consider following up on?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, yes, I made a brief reference to that, to the fact that share price is up and the
trading in our bonds has really improved over the last six weeks, and so that opens up consideration for other types of
capital raises for us. We currently believe that it's beneficial to us for us to first look to asset sale transactions because
we believe that we're going to be able to accomplish those in a positive way, and hopefully, and the market's going to
be driven by a lot of factors is they will be well received by the market and that might give us opportunities in the
future to do better. So that's kind of the strategy of what we're looking at.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And Kathleen's giving me a note, just to remind everybody that the basic source for our
mill water at Cerro Verde is not from the river or the dams for the expansion at least, but from this waste water system
that we put in for the city of Arequipa. And the issue that Evan raised was the downstream water was affected by this
lower flow through the river, and that's what led to it. But our water's coming from the waste water system for the
expansion.

Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Francis Gagliano>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to drill down a bit more on the
divestment plans on the mining side. First of all, in Indonesia, what are Freeport's alternatives if for whatever reason
the Indonesian government doesn't agree to Freeport's expectations regarding the fair value of that ownership interest?
That's my first question.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Let me answer that, Dave. The ultimate resolution mechanism that we have is
international arbitration. That's a provision that's in our contract. And based on all the legal advice that we've gotten
over the years and recently, our position in an arbitration proceeding would be very strong and – because of legal –
legality. The contract is available on file with the SEC. You can read it. It's straightforward. It's been in place since
1991. And so we believe it's ironclad.
We're trying to avoid that. It's such a long-term asset. We're trying to avoid going into a legal proceeding like that, but
that's our ultimate fallback. Under our contract, we have no obligation to divest. That was acknowledged by the
government of Indonesia in the mid-1990s in a letter that we have on file. And all of our discussions since then where
we voluntarily offered to divest to try to be responsive to the new mining law and to the aspirations of the government
has always been at fair market value.

<Q - David Francis Gagliano>: Okay. Okay. And just as a follow-up to that, is there any specific deadline or timeline
that we should be thinking about here for this or it's open-ended negotiation?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: There's not a specific timeline, but we are spending so much money together with Rio
Tinto, we're spending about $1 billion a year on this underground development. And we simply just can't keep doing
that without bringing this issue to a head. And the government wants us to proceed with this smelter, and best case for
constructing a smelter based on global experience, all the smelters that have been built in China, is that starting all out
today would require us to go to 2019 to build a new smelter. And without having contract assurance beyond 2021, we
simply can't do that as a practical business matter. And that's the message we've been conveying to the government.
<Q - David Francis Gagliano>: Okay. That makes sense. All right. And then just my separate question related to the
divestment plans. Just regarding the comments about discussions on additional transactions, which of the mining assets
specifically are actually currently being negotiated for sale or JV, et cetera, aside from Grasberg, and obviously, not
looking for anything other than just the assets that are currently under negotiation?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Dave, because these discussions involve multiple parties, and we have multiple
alternatives to consider, I just don't think it's an answer I should publicly state right now. And I know all of you want to
have more details. We want to get this thing done. We have a real sense of urgency for it. I'd just comment to you the
process is one that involves a great deal going into it in terms of negotiating the details of the transaction and people
conducting due diligence. These mining assets are complicated, complicated assets. We've got great assets and lots of
support to values. So all I can tell you is I feel real good about where we are. I wish I could share more details, but I
simply can't.
<Q - David Francis Gagliano>: Okay. Appreciate the position you're in. All right. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Korn>: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Question on the
copper market, we had CESCO a couple weeks back, and most folks seem to come out of there with the sense that the
copper industry really sees cost cutting, not curtailment of supplies, the best path to take in the current market.
I was wondering, Richard, if you believe we're going to need any more cuts in production over this next year to help
support pricing, given some projects ramping up the rest of the year, given Grasberg ramping up. And then for you,
would you consider maybe fully idling any of the assets where you're currently at half rate or so?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, thanks, Matthew. The reality to this, and I've been through a number of these
cycles and have gone through this is that decisions to shut down mines are very complicated, because of the transition
cost that you incur in having to do it. Not only is there an issue of the – and this varies country by country depending on
labor laws, but the cost of employee severances. But it also often triggers reclamation obligations and shutdown
obligations, because a mine is an operating system and when you operate that system, you're able to manage a lot of
environmental issues in a particular way by the way you process material.
And once you shut it down, then you often have to come up with new systems of how to operate water flows and so
forth. That's one of the things we faced at Sierrita. And those are complicated. So the barriers to shut down mines that
you're seeing across the industry has to do with these transition costs. And sometimes those costs are economically
more significant than operating losses at marginal profitability or even losses. Now, clearly, the lower prices go, the
more pressure will be and the more shut-ins you'll have. We would have some more.
But, for example, at our – and sometimes it's not the entire mine, it's segments of the mine, which we did in Morenci in
2008/2009 when we cut back our mill processing and cut back our mine rates in the crushing rock we put on our
SXEW stacks, our lead stacks.

For example, we cut back El Abra by half. But the remaining half that we're operating at El Abra is profitable at these
prices and at lower prices. So it's a dynamic situation. It will be driven by prices. But what we're seeing is people are
really focused on cost. Now the thing that I think that we're looking at in a positive way and I would suggest that the
market looks at is what is the price of replacing the shortfall that's looming for the copper industry.
I gave you numbers 10 years out, but the market does not have a significant surplus balance today. Who knows what's
going to happen? There's risk in the global marketplace, but there's opportunities. And this thing could come back, and
even today, the incentive price to develop new production, and man, we know this, because we've got all these
resources we've been studying for years. It's going to take a very high price, $3, $3.30, to develop new resources from
known resources. They're not major new discoveries. The expansion projects that are available to the industry are either
expensive underground projects or projects that require low grades and lots of infrastructure development.
So absent just a calamity in China or the global marketplace, I still am very positive that this copper business is going
to be a great business to be in and that Freeport's going to be a really strong leader – player in that industry.
<Q - Matthew J. Korn>: Thanks. That actually leads well to my next question. Given your position as a leader in the
industry, when you're looking at and considering the sale of the mining assets, how important is it for you that you still
maintain operating control over that asset? And I'm wondering whether that has limited the opportunity set, the set of
potential buyers who maybe not be interested if you're really just talking about minority stakes?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, listen, if you just listen to what I just said, you know how bad I feel about selling
any of our assets. We have put together a great company that had a diverse set of assets and now circumstances have
led us to have to do something we really don't want to do. So that answer to your question varies asset by asset.
When we look at our business, there's certain of our assets that we create a lot of value for by having them manage
together. We're able to share equipment, technology, people, resources, and that's a huge benefit for us. And so one
thing we're looking is how can we do transactions that retain that ability for Freeport to create value. Other assets,
which we don't want to sell, but we have to look to sell, would involve a transfer of ownerships. There's certain
companies in the world today, who would only do a transaction if they can be operators.
You read about it every day in the paper. So we're having to look across the board for that. And at the end of the day,
we're looking for transactions that are executable at acceptable values and in ways that help us meet our financial
objectives.
<Q - Matthew J. Korn>: Got it. Thanks much and best of luck.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeremy Ryan Sussman>: Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question and certainly good job on the costs this
quarter. In terms of the asset sales process, I guess, you've announced $1.4 billion since mid-February. Obviously, in
your release you noted that you expect to show additional progress, I think, specifically in Q2 was what was mentioned.
And I know there's a springing collateral and guaranteed trigger that was added, which basically means, I think, you
need total of $3 billion in aggregate announcements by midyear or so.
Assuming my math is correct, that's another $1.6 billion or so in announcements in the next couple months. So I guess,
do you feel comfortable with the timeline? And maybe just conceptually, how would you describe activity level relative
to your initial expectations in terms of just parties at the table? Any big picture color would be great. Thanks, guys.

can't meet the hopes that many had that I could give you very specifics. But to tell you how much more positive I am

This year started out really tough. I'm not telling any of you that. It really started out tough with uncertainties in the
global commodity space and uncertainties about China and copper, a lot of unknowns as to how we receive. We
thought internally as we talked among ourselves about how we approach the market that we would get good
receptivity, because of the high-quality of our assets. Now we know we're getting good receptivity. So we know it

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Domenic Mancini>: Hi, there. Just a quick question. Most of my questions were answered. But in
terms of cash management, when you do realize the proceeds from the sales of Morenci and your JV with reservoir, do
you intend to buy back some of your higher yielding bonds at that point? Or are there covenants in your credit line that
would require you to hold a cash balance to pay that down first?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Chris, this is Kathleen. We have agreed to a cash flow asset sale, cash sweep to our term
loan lenders of 50% of asset sales. And if our leverage is greater than six times, which we're not currently, they would
get 100% of proceeds. So we'll have opportunities, we believe, to not only repay term loan, but also look to repay other
debt in the capital structure and look at – take care of the upcoming maturity.
So that is what we're thinking at this time. And as Richard said, the debt levels, the trading levels have improved from
where they were earlier in the year, which opens up other opportunities. But we're focused on absolute leverage
reduction, but also giving ourselves enough runway over the next several years in terms of maturity schedules.
<Q - Christopher Domenic Mancini>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, and good luck with the asset sales.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Chris, I can't tell you the frustration looking six weeks ago where our bonds were

<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you. I was studying slide 23, which has the oil and gas output, price realization and
direct cost. And it looked like the margin was $7.96 per BOE times the 12.1 million or 96 million for the quarter, if I'm
reading it right.
Or put a different way, a $0.09 upswing in the copper price would give you as much cash flow as oil and gas has in the
March quarter, admittedly, probably at the bottom of the oil price we all hope. Do you think it's worth just shutting in
all the oil and gas output and preserving the resource and waiting for a better day after the market gives us $0.25 of
upside on copper?

Page 13 of 16
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, John, that's a kind of scenario analysis that in hindsight you could say maybe that
would have been the right answer. We can't live in that world. And the nature of oil production is such that you just
cannot make decisions like that and preserve the reservoir, preserve the asset.
So I recall back in 2008, you may have been at a meeting I had one time when somebody said why don't you just shut
in all of your North America production. The market doesn't need it and it would balance the market and it's not – my
answer then was running these kinds of assets is not like managing a portfolio of stocks and bonds. You can't just sell
something and get out of it. You have to manage a lot of complicated operating factors in doing it.
I understand your financial analysis. The practicalities of it are that we can generate some cash to help meet our
obligations that we have. We're cutting these costs aggressively now. We'll continue to do that. And we'll take the
actions to preserve these assets and create some incremental value over time. We're working on contingency plans now,
for example, of how do we look forward in terms of drilling some of the really attractive tieback opportunities. We're
not going to spend money now, but we're going to be prepared to as markets increase to help arrest the natural decline.
There's a big difference in these average numbers that you talk about between California, which is a significant
production and the Deepwater. California doesn't have the decline issues that the Deepwater has and we're able to
basically breakeven out there and preserve all of the resource but continue to operate it. If you were to try to shut in that
California production with the nature of the way that it's produced, you are doing that. So the oil and gas business is in
tough shape. It's just in tough shape, because our plan was to have it fund its own CapEx. And there were all – besides
the acquisition, I mentioned there were all these commitments made to fund an aggressive growth project that was then
– the legs were cut out of that by the drop in oil prices.
And now that business has committed cost and obligations that's well over its current resources. We know that because
we just try to sell those resources. So we've got a profitable copper business. We've got to manage this oil and gas
business in a different way to reduce cost, focus on how to preserve the asset, because in the offshore depletion will
happen at some point in the future, not in the next period of time because of success we've had in drilling, but it's a
challenge.
I'm not going to pull any punches on it. But we've got a good team. I'm really enjoying getting to work with these guys
directly. They're doing a great job. They're well-respected in the industry. I know that because I've talked to a lot of
people outside our company about how they run their business and we're going to find a way to get value out of these
assets.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you. If I can ask a simpler question just about the accounting. Over the last six
quarters the oil and gas charges have been about $22.9 billion. Is there only about $5 billion in carrying value left? And
what was the 12-month average oil price for the March quarter, full cost test and would think that at some point the
balances would wind down and the charges would pretty much be de minimis?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: John, it's Kathleen. If you look at the balance sheet, we separately identify the capitalized
costs for oil and gas. And we've got – at March 31, we have roughly $3.4 billion, which includes $1.7 billion that's
subject to amortization, which is part of this full cost ceiling test that you referenced. And we've got about just over
$1.7 billion not subject to amortization. And those are things where we don't have proved reserves booked at this point.
And in terms of the 12-month trailing average that we used at March 31 for the ceiling test write-down, it was $46 a
barrel WTI.

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We've had a lot of discussions about that recently and over the years. Going back 25
years or more, we've looked at doing that. The asset where we have the biggest streaming opportunity is Grasberg with
the big gold component associated with it. That gold component is what makes Grasberg such a strong strategic asset
for us and reduces our cost. And it's not an inexpensive place to operate. We've got 30,000 plus workers there and one
of the world's largest mills, what will be the world's largest underground development, complicated environmental
issues to maintain, complicated community issues and community support issues, logistics issues.
And so really we've concluded, and thank God we didn't succumb to that idea in past years, because today that would
have been a bad decision. But we really believe having the gold component of Grasberg together with a high copper
grade is what makes it such a great strategic asset for us. So we look at that. We watch what's going on in the industry.
We talk to companies involved and bankers. And if something makes sense, we would be open to it. But to date, we've
concluded that it has not made sense.
<Q - Chris Terry>: Okay. Thanks so much. And just a final one given the importance of the second half of Grasberg
and the mill issues you've highlighted, can you just remind us what's the mill split between the open-pit and the
underground for 2016 and 2017?
<A - Mark Johnson>: This is Mark. Right now, the underground provides about 45,000 tons of ore out of 200,000
tons, so the remainder is coming from the pit. And that will change next year. 2017 the pit starts to wind down a bit,
and the underground ramps up. It's more like 130,000 tons and 70,000 tons; 130,000 tons from the pit and 70,000 tons
from the underground.
<Q - Chris Terry>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And we vary that from time to time based on the nature of the material in the pit.
<Q - Chris Terry>: Got it.
<A - Mark Johnson>: We're looking at the highest value material we send to the mill. So that drives that
determination.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: I visited there and went through the team and it's – and I've been around since the initial
development of the Grasberg and to see the technology advances, it's what we're able to do underground is remarkable
through remote mining of equipment, the safety factor of that, but also the efficiency that we have. We're working very
well with our contractors, and our team there is doing that.
So where once at this point in time we were looking at having a significant reduction in mill throughput as a result of
going on ground, now we look at it and we're going to be able to keep our mill filled. We're going to have to make
some – actually some enhancements over time in the mill, the resource has just grown, and the economics of mining
large scale underground mining have become much more attractive than we would have thought in years past.
<Q - Chris Terry>: Thanks very much for the color.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah, thanks, Chris.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Fields>: Hi, everyone. I just wanted to ask there's been – I know you're laser-focused on asset sales, and
it seems like you're pretty confident about hitting that June 30 deadline to avoid the spring collateral. But I probably
shouldn't ask this as a credit analyst, but what's so bad about secured debt? If I'm an equity holder, I think I'd rather
grant the bank security over some assets rather than giving away a chunk of future earnings.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Well, I think as an investment grade company, we worked hard to have a structure – a
flexible capital structure where everyone was secured. Our objective, as Richard has talked about, is to take down

leverage very significantly. We think over time we have the ability to convince the rating agencies of the strength of
our assets, and we like to return to investment grade and we also see the benefits of having an unsecured capital
structure.
Now, having said all that, we recognize the relationships we've had with our bank group, the commitments they've had
to support our business, and we're going to work cooperatively to make sure that all the lenders are protected, but also
just to make sure we have an ongoing continuation of bank relationships that will allow us flexibility in the near term to
navigate through this situation.
But we worked hard to get to a completely unsecured structure, and we want to get our balance sheet back and restore
the strength that we had previously, and I know it's a tall order, but we're very focused on taking the steps to get there.
<Q - Matthew Fields>: Okay. And then I think just one more follow-up. I think earlier on the call you said that the
proceeds from Morenci, you obviously have that 50% cash flow sweep, but that you could look elsewhere in the capital
structure. I think in the press release when you announced it, you said that FCX expects to use the proceeds to repay
borrowings under its bank term loan and revolving credit facility. Is that still the thinking for that $1 billion of
proceeds?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yes. As you saw, we had $500 million drawn roughly at March 31 under our bank credit
facility, and we've got the mandatory prepayment on the term loan, and we'll use the balance to reduce borrowings
under the revolver.
<Q - Matthew Fields>: Okay. And then just lastly just real high level on this whole asset sale versus secured debt
question because I get it a lot, and it's something we talk about a lot in the credit world. Obviously, there's a disconnect
between the way your securities are trading when we see the spot copper prices and where strategic assets trade on a
future basis with obviously a much higher longer-term price deck. Is the tradeoff do I sell assets at this valuation versus
a secured debt deal that could clear my runway for a number of years, what's the tradeoff there?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Just to be clear, we're not doing these asset sales to avoid secured debt. That was just a
provision that we agreed to in our bank facility. We're doing the asset sales to repay debt and restore our balance sheet
strength. So it has nothing to do with secured versus unsecured. It simply is the reality of us needing to accelerate our
debt reduction and that's what we're focused on.
And we're looking for ways to do it in a way that reflects long-term values in these assets, not the kind of spot pricing
that's currently reflected in the market. But long term value for these assets as you saw with the Morenci transaction
where we were able to demonstrate very significant value. And it's reflective of that long-term asset of the resource
there and the price view of other participants in the industry not to use spot pricing but a longer-term view of prices.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yep.
<Q - Matthew Fields>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one last real quick. Is the priority overall debt reduction
over just clearing the deck for the next four years, five years of maturities?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Matthew, let me just make a broader comment. Our company is over-leveraged. In the
nature of the business that we're in, where you have such high operating leverage from commodity prices, you just
should not be this leveraged because when conditions unfold as they do from time to time, and your revenues drop
because of what's going on in the global commodity prices, having this kind of debt is a killer.
And unfortunately, we're in the position that we're in. So from a broader perspective, we've got great assets. We need to
get back to where we have a balance sheet that does not put us in an over-leveraged situation. And that's what we're
about fixing that.
It's unfortunate. We got here and now we got to fix it. So all the other issues about managing maturity levels and doing
that is part of the tactics of how do you do that. But at the end of the day, we have good assets. We have great
resources. We can create a good company. We have to give up some of those to get us to a position of where we're not
over-leveraged.

Your final question will come from the line of Justine Fisher with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justine Fisher>: Thanks. I'll make it quick since it's just been a long time. Just on – Kathleen, on the working
capital comments in the press release, you said that based on certain price assumptions the company expects $4.8
billion of operating cash flow this year including $800 million from working capital and other tax payments. My
question is how sensitive is that $800 million to pricing, i.e., if we have a different price deck than you guys, could we
assume that most of that $800 million might still materialize, because that number was a lot – was a much larger gain
than what we had expected. So I just want to know how much certainty we can have around that number if our price
deck is different.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah. It wasn't materially different, Justine, at $2 copper. We're getting – and we've
received some already, but we're getting some refunds, tax refunds in 2016 related to payments made in previous years
and then also with our international business the timing of when we pay taxes based on the prior year has an impact on
it. But we did, going into the year, expect a working capital source. And it's somewhat price-sensitive, but not
significantly price-sensitive.
<Q - Justine Fisher>: All right. Fabulous. Thanks very much.
