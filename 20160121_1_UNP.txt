This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015. This equates to $1.31
per share, which compares to $1.61 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Another quarter of solid pricing gains were not
enough to offset the 9% decrease in total volumes. Carloads volume declined in five of our six commodity groups with
Coal and Industrial Products down 22% and 16%, respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot for us in the
quarter with the volume up 8% versus 2014.
On the cost side, we continued to adjust resources throughout the quarter and also made solid progress with our
productivity initiatives. You'll hear the team talk about some of the highlights here this morning.
As a result of these efforts, we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 63.2%. We continue to be laser-focused on
running a fluid and efficient network while safely providing value-added service to our customers and delivering solid
returns for our shareholders.
So, with that I'll turn it over to Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Lance; and good morning. In the fourth quarter, our volume was down 9% with continued gains in Automotive
and more than offset by declines in other business groups. While we generated core pricing gains of 3.5%, that was not
enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 8% in the
quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 16% reduction in freight revenue.
Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 12% on a 5% reduction and
a 7% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain was down 12% in the fourth quarter. High worldwide production and a
strong U.S. dollar reduced grain exports by 23%. Solid growth in domestic grain shipments partially offset the export
decline. Grain products decreased 4% for the quarter driven primarily by softer export soybean meal and DDG demand.
Ethanol shipments were down 3% driven by lower exports. These declines more than offset a 14% increase in canola
meal shipments due to another strong canola crop. Food and refrigerated products volumes were down 1% for the
quarter as strength in beer was offset by declines in fresh and frozen food shipments.
Automotive revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter as an 8% increase in volume was largely offset by a 6% reduction
in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter driven by continued strength in
consumer demand. 2015 annual sales in the U.S. were 17.5 million vehicles, levels last reached 15 years ago. The
seasonally adjusted annual rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8 million vehicles; the fourth highest quarterly sales pace
on record. On the parts side strong vehicle production increases and a continued focus on over-the-road conversions
drove an 8% increase in volume.
Chemicals revenue was down 7% for the quarter on a 2% reduction in volume and a 5% decrease in average revenue
per car. Lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continue to impact our crude oil shipments, which were
down 42% in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting this decline was continued strength in the LPG markets, including
propylene, propane and butane demands. Finally, petroleum products volume was down 6% primarily due to weaker
residual fuel oil shipments, as a result of a slowing in China's production and export sectors.
Coal revenue declined 31% in the fourth quarter on a 22% volume decline and 11% decrease in average revenue per
car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 24% in the quarter as mild weather and low natural gas prices
dampened coal demand. Temperatures in the fall were 3.3 degrees warmer than average and set a record for the lower
48 states. Coal inventory levels are 105 days through December; 39 days above normal and 43 days above last
December. Colorado/Utah tonnage was down 40% driven again by soft domestic demand and reduced export
shipments. Nationwide, electricity generation by coal dropped from 37% market share in the fourth quarter of 2014 to
32% in 2015 as natural gas captured the share loss from Coal.
Industrial Products revenue was down 23% on a 16% decline in volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per car
during the quarter. Reduced rig counts and shale drilling resulted in a 42% decline in minerals volume, primarily driven
by a 52% decrease in frac sand carloadings. Metal shipments were down 27% from softening industrial production,

reduced drilling activities and the strong U.S. dollar. Specialized markets were up 7% in the quarter driven by increased
waste shipments.
Intermodal revenue was down 14% in the fourth quarter on a 7% lower volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue
per unit. Full-year 2015 domestic Intermodal achieved its seventh consecutive year of record volume. However, our
fourth quarter results were down slightly as continued highway conversions were offset by the discontinuation of Triple
Crown business and sourcing shifts.
International Intermodal volume was down 12% if the quarter in a challenging market environment, primarily due to
market volume headwinds for several of our ocean carrier customers. Imports in the Trans-Pacific's trade remained
sluggish due to weaker than expected domestic U.S. retail sales.
Let's move to how we see our business shaping up for 2016. In Ag Products, we expect high global grain inventories
and strong U.S. dollar to have a continued impact on the export environment. Food and refrigerated should continue to
see growth in import beer. We expect soybean meal to have another strong export year, but will likely fall short of the
record level reached in 2015.
Turning to Autos, we expect low interest rates and gasoline prices to continue to positively impact demand driving both
finished vehicles and part shipments. However, we are cautious as to Auto sales sustaining these record levels.
We expect the coal market will continue to be dampened by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. As
always, weather conditions will continue to influence demand.
In Chemicals, we expect most of our markets to remain solid in 2016 with particular strength in LPG markets. Low
crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will continue to present significant headwinds for crude by rail shipments.
Fertilizer shipments will also be impacted by grain export headwinds.
In Industrial Products, low crude oil prices will also challenge our minerals and metals volumes. We expect our lumber
franchise to grow with demand from the slowly strengthening housing market, and demand for construction products
and specialized markets should be solid.
In Intermodal, we anticipate highway conversions will continue to drive domestic Intermodal volumes. However, high
retail inventories and sluggish retail demand are expected to mute growth in our international Intermodal volumes,
ramping up while the strong U.S. dollar, low energy prices and sluggish retail sales will continue to drive headwinds
and uncertainty in some of our markets, we're optimistic in others. Mexico continues to be an opportunity driven by
energy reform and Mexico's autos manufacturing market.
With our growth depended on both the national and global economy, we'll continue to strengthen our customer value
proposition and develop new business opportunities across our diverse franchise.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron.
Cameron A. Scott
Thanks, Eric; and good morning. Starting with our safety performance of our full-year reportable personal injury rate
improved 11% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.87. Successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace has
clearly having a positive impact as we achieve annual records on a way to an incident-free environment.
With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 14% to 3.42, driven by an
increase in yard and industrial reportables. While our reportable rate took a step backwards in 2015, we are confident
that our strategy aimed at eliminating human factor incidents, and hardening our infrastructure will lead to improved
results going forward.
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 3% versus 2014 to 2.28. We continue to focus on
reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns to drive improvement in the

future.
Moving on to network performance, after making a step-function improvement in our operating metrics during the third
quarter, we've continued to make solid incremental progress. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell
improved 13% and 5% respectively when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.
Record fourth quarter velocity of 27 miles per hour was at the best ever at a level of volume handled during the quarter.
In fact, the last quarter we ran at this velocity was six years ago when our network was handling 7% fewer carloads.
The strength and resiliency of our network allowed us to mitigate the impact from flooding events in the eastern portion
of our network during late-December, thereby minimizing service delays to our customers. So, while we've made
significant improvement in our metrics, we know there is still more work to do as the team continues a relentless push
to further improve service and reduce cost.
While we noted back in October that our resources were more closely aligned with demand at that time, further
declines in volume prompted us to make additional resource adjustments in the fourth quarter. In addition to adjusting
to lower volumes, our improvement in network performance has translated into fewer recrews, lessening resource
demands of our network.
By the end of the year, we had around 3,900 TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status
compared with 2,700 at the end of the third quarter. Overall, our total TE&Y workforce was down 18% in the fourth
quarter versus the same period in 2014. Around half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training
pipeline.
Our active locomotive fleet was down 13% from the fourth quarter of 2014. As always, we'll continue to adjust our
workforce levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictate.
In addition to efficiently rightsizing our resource base, we also realized gains on other productivity initiatives such as
train length. And while we're unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we ran record train lengths in
all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as productivity initiatives led
to record terminal productivity even with an 8% decline in the number of cars switched. In addition to process
improvements, capital investments have also enhanced our ability to generate productivity and increase the fluid
capabilities of our network.
In total, we invested $4.3 billion in our 2015 capital program. For 2016, we are targeting around $3.75 billion pending
final approval by our board of directors. More than half of our planned 2016 capital investment is replacement
spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network. The
plan includes 230 locomotives as part of our previous purchase commitment. This commitment wraps up with the
acquisition of an additional 70 units in 2017. We also plan to invest an additional $375 million in positive train control
during 2016.
In summary, we finished 2015 on a solid note. In 2016, we are carrying that momentum forward as we continue to
focus on those critical initiatives that will drive future improvement. Above all this includes safety, where we expect
once again to yield record results on our way towards zero incidents. In the face of uncertain volume environment, we
will continue to adjust our resources to demand while also focusing on other productivity initiatives to further reduce
cost. And where growth opportunities arise, we will leverage that growth to the bottom-line through increased
utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will create value for our customers with an excellent customer experience.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight, Jr.
Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.2
billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, an even more challenging business mix,
and a negative fuel comparison more than offset solid core pricing gains achieved in the quarter.

Operating expenses totaled just under $3.3 billion, decreasing 13% compared to last year. Significantly lower fuel
expense along with volume-related reductions and productivity improvements drove the expense reduction. The net
result was a 19% decrease in operating income to $1.9 billion.
Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, down $43 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by
2014's real estate gains. Interest expense of $164 million was up 12% compared to the previous year, driven by
increased debt issuance during the year. Income tax expense decreased 23% to $665 million, driven primarily by lower
pre-tax earnings.
Net income decreased 22% versus 2014; while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued
share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.31 per share, which fell well
short of last year's record $1.61 per share.
Now, turning to our top line, freight revenue of approximately $4.9 billion was down 16% versus last year. Volume
declined 9%, and fuel surcharge revenue was down $438 million when compared to 2014.
All-in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel price was an $0.11 headwind to earnings in the fourth quarter versus
last year. And keep in mind, we did report a $0.05 positive fuel benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014, and this includes
the net impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs.
As we expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter. The
primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel shipments, and bulk grains, partially offset
by a decline in international intermodal volumes. A 3.5% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight
revenue in the quarter. Slide 22 provides more detail on our pricing trends.
Pricing continued to be solid throughout 2015 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our
customers in the marketplace. Of the 3.5% this quarter, about 0.5% can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy
business that we renewed in 2015. And with the exception of a few smaller contracts in the out-years, 2015 marks an
end to any further legacy repricing opportunities.
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which
decreased 5% versus 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies.
Labor inflation was around 4% in the fourth quarter driven primarily by agreement wage inflation.
Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee head count declined 7% when compared to 2014. Reductions in
TE&Y, training-related activities, as well as employees associated with capital projects, all contributed to the
workforce decline. At this point in time, given current volume levels, we are being very cautious with our hiring plans
for 2016. On average, for the year, we would expect overall force levels to be down somewhat depending, of course, on
how volume ultimately plays out for the year.
Labor inflation is expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by agreement wage
inflation, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the
2% range for the full year.
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $424 million, down 48% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel
prices along with a 14% decline in gross-ton-miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the
fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rates increased 1% driven by negative mix, while our average diesel
price declined 39% to $1.61 per gallon.
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 11% to $589 million.
The reduction was primarily driven by a lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our
locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $517 million, up 6% compared to 2014. In 2016, depreciation
expense is expected to increase slightly compared to last year.

Slide 26 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rent expense totaled $305 million,
which is up 3% compared to 2014. Lower volumes and improved cycle times were more than offset by a favorable
one-time item in 2014.
Other expenses came in at $235 million, up 3% versus last year. Higher state and local taxes, and increased personal
injury expense were partially offset by a reduction in general expenses. Other expenses for the full year were flat when
compared to 2014, consistent with our full-year guidance. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase
between 5% and 10%, excluding any large unusual items.
Turning to our operating ratio performance. The fourth quarter operating ratio came in at 63.2%, a 1.8 points
unfavorable when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, I'm pleased to report an operating ratio of
63.1, which is 0.4 points improvement from 2014. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, rightsizing our resources to
current demand, ongoing productivity initiatives and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to improving our
overall margins.
Slide 28 provides a summary of our 2015 earnings with a full-year income statement. Operating revenue declined about
$2.2 billion to $21.8 billion. Operating income totaled almost $8.1 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to 2014, and net
income was just under $4.8 billion while earnings per share were down 5% to $5.49 per share.
Turning now to our cash flow. In 2015, cash from operations totaled more than $7.3 billion, down slightly when
compared to 2014. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $524 million for the year. This is down just under $1
billion from 2014, primarily driven by lower earnings along with higher cash capital and dividend payments. This
includes the two dividends that we incurred in the first quarter of 2015 resulting from the timing change in our dividend
payments. As expected, the net impact of bonus depreciation on 2015's cash flow was close to neutral as the benefit
from 2014 bonus depreciation offset cash tax payments associated with prior years.
Taking a closer look at 2016, we will see the benefit from both 2015 and 2016 bonus depreciation since the legislation
was passed just before year-end. With factoring in the two years' worth of benefit in 2016 against payments from prior
years, we expect that net impact from bonus depreciation will be a tailwind of roughly $400 million on this year's cash
flow.
Slide 30 shows 2015 capital program of $4.3 billion. And as Cam just mentioned, we are targeting a capital plan in
2016 of about $3.75 billion, pending final approval from our board of directors in February. This would be a reduction
of over $500 million from last year's capital program. The chart on the right shows the returns on these investments
over the last few years. Return on invested capital was 14.3% in 2015, down 1.9 points from 2014, driven primarily by
lower earnings.
Taking a look at the balance sheet. While cash from operations was down slightly year-over-year, we increased our
balance sheet debt by 24%, resulting in an all-in adjusted debt balance of about $17.4 billion at year-end 2015. We also
finished the year with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7, which increased from 1.4 at year-end 2014. Longer
term, we're continuing to target a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than two times.
While we did increase our debt levels to reward shareholders, we also maintained a strong balance sheet, which is a
valuable asset particularly in the face of economic and strategic uncertainties. In 2015, share repurchases exceeded 35
million shares and totaled about $3.5 billion, up 7% from 2014. Over the past five years, we have repurchased 15% of
our outstanding shares
Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $5.8 billion to our shareholders in
2015. This represents roughly a 20% increase over 2014, continuing our strong commitment to shareholder value. So
that's a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results.
Looking ahead to 2016, we do have some significant hurdles. Our energy-related volumes will continue to be a
challenge. Compared to last year's strong first quarter, we expect this year's first quarter coal volumes to decline around
20% or so. And given the headwind we currently see with coal, it is likely that total volumes for the first quarter will be
down in the mid-single digits. For the full year, we currently expect total volumes to be slightly negative depending on

coal and the strength of the overall economy as the year plays out.
Fuel prices will have a negative impact on earnings, at least in the first quarter, given the $0.08 positive fuel benefit that
we reported in the first quarter of 2015. While it is still early, we are preparing ourselves for volume and mix pressures,
particularly in the first quarter and likely throughout much of 2016. We are counting on record productivity and solid
pricing to drive an improved operating ratio again this year as we work towards our longer-term operating ratio target
of 60% plus or minus on a full-year basis by 2019.
And as always, no matter what the environment, we remain committed to running a safe, efficient, productive railroad
for our customers while generating strong returns for our shareholders.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thanks, Rob. As we discussed today, this past year was a difficult one in many respects, but our team did outstanding
work in the face of dramatic declines in volumes and shifts in our business mix. Overall economic conditions,
uncertainty in the energy markets, commodity prices and the strength of U.S. dollar will continue to have a major
impact on our business this year.
However, our velocity is at an all-time best for the current level of demand. The network is fluid and we're driving
towards further improvement. We're well positioned to efficiently serve customers in existing markets as they rebound.
The strength and the diversity of the Union Pacific franchise also will provide tremendous opportunities for new
business development as both domestic and global markets evolve. When combined with our unrelenting focus on
safety productivity and service, these opportunities will translate into an excellent experience for our customers and
strong value for our shareholders in the years ahead.
So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conduction a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Due to the number of
analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question
to accommodate as many participants as possible. Thank you.
Our first question is from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. Rob, with regard to your comments
about the legacy pricing, clearly we saw about a half a point in the fourth quarter. When you reprice some of the legacy
contracts, you had pulled forward some from 2016. Should we still be considering some sort of incremental benefit in
2016 to the core pricing metric as we look out or should that effectively be a zero for next year?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. I would say, basically effectively zero. I mean, there might be a tad bit of a little
carryover, but I think for your modeling purposes those are pretty much behind us.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Got it. And then, I guess, shifting gears, Eric, to the Intermodal segment, you had called out
some headwinds in the fourth quarter related to Triple Crown and some sourcing shifts. Can you kind of quantify how
we should be thinking about that Triple Crown headwind for 2016 or call out specifically the volume challenge that
you guys saw? And should those sourcing shifts that we saw in the fourth quarter continue to weigh on Intermodal load
growth for the domestic volumes as we look out?

<A - Eric L. Butler>: Hey, Rob. As we indicated, we always expect our highway conversion strategy, which we're
firmly focused on to continue to drive growing domestic Intermodal volumes, and so we continue to see growing
domestic Intermodal volumes despite headwinds from Triple Crown and other things that occur all the time.
We do expect, as I called out, to see headwinds on the international Intermodal side just because of all of what's going
on with the transpacific trade in the China markets. But on the domestic Intermodal side, we continue to see our
strategy working, which is growing volumes through highway convergence.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Got it. Appreciate the color.

Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Yeah. Well, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Lance or Eric, I
mean, can you guys just give us some context here, because I've only been covering the industry for about a decade.
But the volumes seem pretty bad right now, I mean maybe not quite as bad as 2009 and yet we're still getting jobs
growth in the U.S. So how do you look at the environment right now? Is the U.S. headed into a broader recession? Or is
this just limited to energy and industrial? And are there specifics in your business that maybe look worse than the
broader economy?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Brandon, this is Lance. The impact on our railroad has been acute, as you pointed out, in
energy, in commodities affected by the strong dollar like export grain, the steel markets, and those are not necessarily
indicative of a broader U.S. reality. I will share with you though, there's also questions that we have about U.S.
consumers. There are indicators that the consumer is healthy like the unemployment rate is at a comfortable 5% level,
the consumers are buying automobiles, as Eric outlined. But labor participation rate isn't that great, and fourth quarter
retail sales for goods was not that great. So I'll let Eric give you a little more technicolor.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, I'm not sure there's much else I would add to that. I would say, the consumer is spending,
there is consumer confidence, household income is going up. There appears to be a shift between consuming on
products or goods to spending on services. There does appear to be that shift. So it does – some of the changes is
impacting our business in the industrial space.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Brandon, one last thing. Early in the year, we talked about the impact on energy from low
natural gas prices and the effect on coal, the effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration and development, and we
said ultimately that should be a benefit to other industries we serve like plastics, manufacturing and consumers. And we
just haven't seen yet the offset, the positive offset, from the headwinds that we've experienced.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: I know it's difficult for a lot of investors on the line here too. Rob, can you talk a little bit
about the outlook for an improving operating ratio? What are the big drivers here, especially with the uncertainty in
volume?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. The big driver, I mean, volume is obviously our friend, and I guided as you
picked up that we expect full year volume to be slightly down. We'd obviously like to see that improve from there, but
given that slightly down sort of view of the world in a positive improving operating ratio is our conviction around our
ability and our focus on continuing to drive productivity and our ability to continue to provide quality service to our
customers enables us to get price in the marketplace.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Okay. Appreciate it.

<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to touch a little bit on the outlook, or stay on the outlook
for 2016. Rob, I know you don't give earnings guidance specifically, but if you can get sort of slightly down volumes,
you have an improving OR, mix is going to be negative certainly in the first quarter or so of the year, I mean, how do
we think about the other puts and takes that potentially sort of impact that, whether you're flat to down or flat to up? I'm
just trying to make sure I understand how much you can control on the expense side to maybe offset some of this
negative mix that we're expecting?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, Chris. I mean, and the reason I'm not giving earnings guidance is because of all
those unknowns. Again, we're confident we can control what we can control, which again is the productivity, quality
service, continue to drive positive price, but there is so much uncertainty at this point in time in terms of what the
absolute volumes will be and what the mix of those volumes will play out. So that's why we're not in a position right
now to give earnings guidance. But I assure you we're focused on driving improvements on every aspect that we can,
and we certainly would like to see as positive a result as we can drive.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. And then, maybe just a follow-up on that. In terms of the expense side what you can
control, you talked about head count a little bit in the outlook, and I think you said it would be down a bit. I guess,
you're entering the year with a down, a little bit more than that, and kind of trying to chase that volume number down. I
mean, how do we think about head count for the full year in a little more detail?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. Chris, as we've said all along and I'll say it here again for 2016 is that volume
will drive what our head count ultimately is, although there's still productivity. So if volumes are slightly down, I
would expect that we would have down head count driven by volume and layering on our expectation of driving further
productivity. So it will flow directionally with what volume is, but we're very focused, again depending on what the
mix actually plays out, very focused on driving productivity in those numbers and being as efficient as we can.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Chris, we outlined for you the expectations for volumes in the first quarter in a few specific
areas. I would say, we're in a much better posture entering 2016 from a realizing productivity and a head count
perspective getting the resources right for the volumes than we were entering 2015. We're just in a very different place.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: That's helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.

Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Thanks. So following up on the previous question, how much of a volume
decline do you think that you can handle while still generating positive earnings growth? You did mention expectations
for a slight decline, but if carloads [ph] drop (36:10) down 5%, 6%, 7%, is that sort of where you're thinking about the
tipping point?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Allison, this is Rob. I mean, I can't give you in not giving guidance on the earnings, so,
I mean, I get the point of your question, but really the driver would be what's the mix, what volumes actually move, et
cetera. But I can just assure you that there is obviously a tipping point at some point if that were to go so negative, it
would flip negative. But we're going to squeeze out productivity and continue to drive price where we can, and so I
can't give you a direct answer as to where that tipping point is, but we're focused on – in regards to what the volume is
on controlling what we can in driving positive OR and earnings.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Understood, thanks. And my second question would be, what your expectations for overall
cost inflation are for 2016? Thank you.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. As I said, Allison, overall inflation assumptions for us in 2016 are around 2%.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. Excellent. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Rob, just wanted to clarify a few things that you said. In terms of head count down slightly or
something like that, we're going to be starting the year down 9% or so year-over-year. Are you talking about down
slightly from where you're ending the year at that [ph] 44 or 45 (37:39) level?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Basically that guidance or that view of the world, Scott, that where I say slightly down
is a year-over-year assumption at this point in time. And again, full year – and again, what will drive that is what the
ultimate volumes end up being.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Scott, just a little point in detail. At the tail end of many years, there's a lot of moving parts that
affect head count, the absolute head count number. That average is the one that's most useful.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So are you thinking about adding head count from where you are right now? Because if you
take where you are right now, I mean, it should imply a pretty meaningful drop in head count.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: We're going to continue to match head count to whatever the volume situation is. The other
thing to note is, head count comes in and out on capital programs as, for instance, in the winter time, we start shutting
down capital spend because of weather and spooling it back up in the spring. There's just a lot of moving parts
quarter-to-quarter sequentially.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. In terms of pricing, I wanted to ask, so I think BN has talked about giving up some price
to incent some coal demand. Are you guys doing anything similar like that? And maybe if you can talk overall on
pricing, it sounds like you expect solid pricing in 2016. Is it reasonable to expect some kind of deceleration in the
pricing environment just given what the volumes are doing? Or do you think we can hold steady around this 3% range
ex-legacy?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Hey, Scott. This is Eric. So I cannot speak to what the BN does with pricing strategy. They do
their own independent strategy, and I cannot speak to what they do. We continue to hold on our strategy of pricing to
our value. We are driving a value proposition that we want to be an industry-superior value proposition, and we're
going to price accordingly for that. We do think that there are places in the market and the economy that are growing
there, and we think that those provide value for us to continue to price according to our long-held strategy.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.

Our next question is from the line of Alex Vecchio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Alexander Vecchio>: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Rob, I know you didn't give explicit
earnings guidance. But, in the past two years, you had noted in your slide deck record earnings. And that comment was
notably absent this time around. So I just want to confirm that we should interpret the lack of that expectation for
record earnings to be what it is that you won't – at this point, you do not expect to achieve at least the $5.75 in earnings
per share that you achieved in 2014, which was the last record. I just want to confirm you're essentially expecting this
year to be below that figure.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: That is correct. Now nothing would please us more than to see the economy turn and
things go favorable. So we're going to fight like heck to do the best we can. But yes, you are correct. At this point in

time, we do not see record earnings.
<Q - Alexander Vecchio>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just to touch back on the pricing discussion, you noted that
you expect inflation to be 2% in 2016. In the past, you've always suggested nominal pricing above inflation. Is that still
your expectation for 2016 to achieve pricing above that 2% inflation level?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yes. But as you know, we don't set our prices based on what current year inflation
numbers are. And as has been pointed out and we've discussed here today, we price to market. Every market's a little
bit different. We clearly don't have the benefit of, call it, half-point legacy renewal that we had enjoyed in 20s16. But
having said all that, yes, we are still focused on pricing above inflation.

Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the volume side. So you've
commented on first quarter, and I think, Eric, in his slide with the 2016 outlook gave us a view by segment. If I look at
that view by segment, it's either kind of plus and minus or, I guess, for Coal, it was minus, minus. But it seems like by
segment, it's pretty negative. But on a full year basis, you're saying it's down only slightly. So I assume slightly is not
down [ph] 3% or 4% (42:31), it's maybe down [ph] 1% or 2% (42:33).
How do you kind of bridge those two together? Is it just a function of the comps get so much easier in the second
quarter or are you expecting adjusted for seasonality improvement in demand later in the year or how do you put those
two together? Because, by segment, it looks a little more negative than the comment about a slight decline on a full
year basis.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Let me just start off, and Eric may want to comment further in terms of maybe more
specifics. This is Rob. I would just say that, Tom, to your point, we clearly are highlighting it, as you know, that the
comps particularly in the first quarter is particularly challenging, and that's where we're calling out the down volume in
the first quarter, and Coal clearly in the 20% or so range. So the comps do change throughout the year. But our view of
the world right now is that the energy environment, which impacts our coal, impacts our shale, impacts our metals that
supports the shale activity on top of the continuing strong dollar, those are going to continue to be hurdles and
pressures for us. But the comps do change as the year plays out, and I think that's what's driving sort of maybe the math
that you're wrestling with.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric, have you got anything else to add to that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: No, that's it.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: So you would say, it's more comps than anticipation of improved market [ph] later in the
year (43:57)?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: I'd say that's a bigger driver.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah, okay. I appreciate that. What about mix? If I look at your slide in third quarter mix, I
think there was a 1% year-over-year headwind, and that got a lot more challenging in the fourth quarter, which I think
was the big thing we missed in our assumptions for fourth quarter with that 4% mix headwind. I know it's a tough one
to forecast, but do you think mix in 2016 is more like the 4% or more like the 1%? Because that's a pretty material
consideration.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. Tom, this is Rob again. I would say again, as you know, we don't – it's very
difficult, and in fact frankly impossible to precisely predict exactly what mix is going to be. But I would say just
directionally, if you look at the full year mix impact of 2015, it was about 1.5 point negative. And you're right, fourth

quarter was particularly bad at – down at 4%. We do expect to still see mix headwinds as 2016 plays out. I don't
anticipate that it would be for the full year as bad as we saw in the fourth quarter. We do have a comp challenge in the
first quarter, but as the year plays out things should get easier. While mix will be a headwind for the full year, it should
get better than what we saw in the first quarter – will see in the first quarter and what we saw in the fourth quarter of
last year.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Recall, Tom, first quarter of 2015 we grew frac sand shipments, coal was still relatively
healthy, grain was healthier than what we saw as the year progressed into later quarters. So, markets have really
changed pretty dramatically from the first quarter of 2015.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: So, the mix comps might be similar to the volume comps since they get a bit easier beyond
first quarter [indiscernible] (45:47).

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you. Hey, Lance, Rob, Eric, Cameron. How's everyone doing?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Jason.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: I want go back on the pricing side and focus on Intermodal and any of the truck competitive
merchandise traffic that you're hauling. Clearly, right now it seems that there's excess trucking capacity. And all the
data points at least we track are pointing to truck pricing going down, both contractually and on a spot basis. How
should we look at your ability to not only price, but grow the Intermodal business ex some of the headwinds that we
talked about with Triple Crown as we move throughout 2016?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. This is Eric, Jason. So, a big reason, as you know, for kind of the shrinkage in truck
pricing is, fuel is coming down, which is the major cause. So, our customers are also seeing a cost reduction benefit as
fuel goes down because of the fuel surcharge going down, so they're seeing that natural cost reduction benefit. So, the
gap, if you will, between the value proposition for Intermodal rail service versus truck, I think, that gap is still there in
terms of Intermodal providing a value proposition to manufacturers.
We've talked in the past about, just by laws of physics, steel wheel on steel rail is a lower cost than rubber tire on
asphalt or concrete. So, there still is a value proposition there that we think gives us a leverage to continue to drive
highway conversions which we demonstrated in 2015 and we're going to continue to focus on in 2016.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: And, Eric, your team continually works with trucking companies themselves in terms of
helping them with their cost structures. And they look at Intermodal conversions as an opportunity to modify their own
cost structures as they compete in their marketplace. And those opportunities continue as well.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. Now, that's good color. As I look on the Ag side, it seemed like there was a couple of
puts and takes, but net-net for the year, would you guys say you were positive or slightly negative for Ag?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I'm not sure I understand the question. Or...
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: In terms of your outlook for 2016?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Oh. We don't give volume guidance for 2016. I think, if you look at the Ag markets overall, I
think the Ag producers are expecting pretty good yields for 2016, of course, dependent on weather and number of acres
planted and all of that, maybe not record levels, but pretty good levels. I think a large factor will depend on worldwide

Ag production, the strong dollar and how competitive U.S. Ag is in worldwide markets. There is a lot of corn, a lot of
wheat in storage right now and presumably, as U.S. Ag becomes more competitive pricing-wise in worldwide markets,
that's got to move, and when that does move, presumably, we, as a transportation provider, will have a benefit in
moving it.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Lance, I want to revisit one of the earlier questions in terms of
looking back in market downturns and looking at the volumes. How do you figure out how to stay ahead of that in
terms of furloughing employees or dropping locomotives in terms of then being not, I guess, not overdoing it, so you
can catch that rebound? How have you acted differently this time versus whether it was at the end of 2014 and
beginning of 2015 when we ramped up maybe too much and then versus what you saw in 2008-2009? Maybe can you
give us a little feedback in terms of how you prep for that?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure, Ken. We've been clear historically about time lags in decisions that are just the nature of
our business. In terms of hiring somebody to operate a train, that's about a six-month process. So we have to, by nature,
when we're planning crews, look out six months, 12 months, 18 months. And when we're talking about capital planning
or locomotive acquisition, those lead times get longer. So it all begins with our business planning process and making
sure that we have a tight connectivity between what Eric and the commercial team are seeing, and then how we're
boiling that into a transportation plan and the resources necessary to run it. Every time we see a significant shift in
volume whether it's a significant growth or significant shrink, we try to learn from that situation.
As we're going into 2016, we think our business planning process is tighter. We think our connectivity between what
Eric sees in the marketplace and secondary and tertiary indicators of demand, more of that is being absorbed into our
estimating process. And I shouldn't miss the opportunity to talk about also doing a better job of shrinking some of the
timelines, let's say, in terms of hiring and bringing a crew onboard or acquiring equipment. We're also better, candidly,
at when we have to store equipment, storing it quickly and efficiently. And we're also better at trying to find the right
mix of the right employee base, where they're located and training them for alternative jobs. So, we're just getting a
little better in all those ways, and that adds up, I think, into a better posture overall.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: And to clarify that, you don't see that is rounding into like the 2008-2009, not that deep
of a recession, but into, I guess, so far what you've seen doesn't seem a recession environment to you?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: It's hard for me to speak and predict on whether the economy is going into a recession.
Certainly, our volume drop-off as the 2015 year progressed quarter-to-quarter and as we're entering 2016 is dramatic,
and it's dramatic in historical reference. But, it's nothing – it's not approaching what we experienced in 2008 to 2009.
Also, again, a 6% decrease year-over-year and a quarterly 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% decrease year-over-year is pretty dramatic
volume change.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great. If I could do a follow-up, just a quick comment; I guess, yesterday or a couple
of days ago one of the other rails noted your quotes on M&A and said that, I guess, prior you had talked about how it
impacted Union Pacific and you were opposed to that. Maybe can you clarify your comments on your thoughts on
industry M&A; why it would or would not matter to you given you're operating in your own region and does an
industry change impact Union Pacific?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Ken, we do not support mergers or consolidation in the current environment. We think that the
regulatory outcomes, the regulatory impact would be substantial. The Surface Transportation Board has been clear that
the next merger that they consider, it has to enhance competition not just maintain it. It has to improve operations for
customers, and they also have to consider downstream impacts whether one merger triggers a string of consolidations.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Autos is, obviously one area
of growth year-over-year. It looks like it's going to continue into next year. But, how much of that is attributable to
Mexico and what type of impact do you see when it comes to or seeing some reported first-half retoolings and
changeovers south of the border? And do you think this would really have an impact on your length of haul or mix of
business in that vertical?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Brian, before I hand it over to Eric, I just want to say we are very bullish on Mexico, in general,
in the long-term. It's a vibrant economy, it's got a vibrant middle-class and our access to the six primary rail gateways
to and from Mexico give us a real great opportunity to participate in that economy. Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Brian, historically, Mexico produced about 1.7 million vehicles. I think, full-year 2015, the
number is probably close to about 2.9 million vehicles, call it, [ph] 17.5 (56:10) that was sold. With all of the plant
expansions, new plants, I think, it's on its way to 4 million or 4.5 million in the next, call it, year-and-a-half to two
years. As it's been said, we have a great franchise for Mexico, and we think that that will be a strong part of our
business portfolio going into the future. It's always – the issue is, when the sales drive total volume and so our total
volume will be aligned with whatever sales are, and our strategy is to have a franchise to move it wherever it is
manufactured.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Okay. And just quick on that, about 50% of your Auto comes from is attributable to
Mexico, if I'm remembering correctly?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Historically, we've said that, yes. And that's about what it was, yes.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Okay. And then just one other quick one on train lengths; I think, on the last call you
mentioned you have about 90% or about 7,000 foot capable [ph], let me guess, (57:21) in terms of sidings. Third
quarter was around 6,000 foot average train lengths, so clearly you're highlighting some of the best ever lengths in three
of the five areas. How much further and, I guess, how much faster do you think you can take that up, and when would
you hit the upper limit? I know it's different in every market. And I guess, the Intermodal has clearly got some
headwinds here, but I think that's really the one for [ph] good (57:47) economics to really work best when you really
need to get the longer trains. So, maybe, if you could, focus on that and just some general comments about train lengths
overall [indiscernible] (57:54).
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Cam, do you want to talk a little bit about the productivity opportunity in train length?
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: Coal is about the only program that is nearly optimized, although there is opportunity still
within Coal. Every other commodity group has plenty of train size productivity opportunity. And you will see us
continue to make progress, balancing customer needs along the way.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Okay. Thanks for your time, guys.

Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Yeah. Good morning, everybody. A quick question about Coal, specifically, a lot of push-back we
get from investors with respect to UNP, specifically, as you have a competitor who, due to some service issues and
perhaps a much larger portfolio strategy, has invested a significant amount in CapEx out west. And there's concern
given the structural market share loss in Coal that the competitive dynamic has structurally changed in their favor. If I
look at a 20-year market share chart of Coal, you and the BN used to swap share and were about 50% each every year;
and then in 2011, we saw a split; and then again in 2014. So, there's been roughly a 10% shift where what used to be
50/50 is now 60/40. I was wondering if you could just put some color around that. I know that there were service issues
in your line last year, but even if I normalize for that spike, the line and the trend is pretty consistent over a five-year
basis. I'm just wondering how you can address structurally the investor concerns that something hasn't changed in the
West as it relates to Coal.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Matt, I think, if you go back historically and go back to the 1980s, when really the Powder River
Basin franchise was developed for us certainly, in addition to our competitor, I think it's been roughly, call it, a 55/45
split over time as opposed to the 50/50. But, we don't look at markets in terms of what share we have in a market. We
look at it in terms of what's the value of that market, what's the value of our franchise, where we think we have a value
proposition to offer the market, and we sell our value proposition, and we're comfortable with the outcome in terms of
the distance that we win or lose based on the value proposition that we sell.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Right. So, I guess, again, in the context of people choosing to invest or not invest in your stock, if I
look at the dichotomy in volumes, Burlington Northern positive on volumes last year in Coal and Union Pacific down
double-digits in Coal. You're saying you're comfortable with that?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: What we're comfortable with, Matt, is the diversity of our franchise. Coal remains a nice book
of business for us, generates an attractive return. That's how we look at all of our book of business in terms of can we
generate an attractive return. And we invest for that and we price for that. And I think our track record speaks for itself.
We've done a pretty fair job of making that happen.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Okay. Understood. My quick follow-up would be then if I look at cash flow, you yourself said
reducing the CapEx budget by north of $500 million, you've got some other tailwinds, you talked about bonus
depreciations, pretty material numbers in terms of incremental cash flow potential. You slowed the pacing of share
repurchases in the fourth quarter. Just wondering with that excess potential cash flow in 2016, is there an opportunity to
step-up share repurchase, what are the gaining factors in terms of either debt ratios or whatnot in terms of how
aggressively you're willing to use what should be some surplus cash flow in 2016? Thank you.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob, you want to take that?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. Matt, you're right. I mean, our expectation coming off of, certainly, last year's
low number from cash flow, that we will, hopefully, positively, generate increasing cash flow. And yeah, we'll continue
our philosophy of being opportunistic in the marketplace as it relates to shares. So, I would expect that we will continue
to do that. And as I called out, by the way, in the third quarter that was a high watermark, if you will, that we've seen, at
least in modern times, of a rate of which we were buying back shares and that clearly was not our ratable rate in terms
of shares. But, we are opportunistic in terms of when we buy and how much we buy, and that attitude that philosophy
will continue in 2016. But, if we can generate stronger levels of cash, that gives us greater opportunities. And as we
continue to walk up our debt-to- EBITDA, as we've said and as we have, that gives us further opportunity.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah. Job one is generating cash from operations. It all starts there and we're laser-focused on
that.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Understood. Thank you for the time.

Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John Barnes>: Hey. Thank you for taking my questions. So following up on that question around cash flow, I
hear what you're saying in terms of your opposition to M&A, but if it were to take place, Burlington Northern has
already said that they're going to be involved if there is a wave of consolidation. Given the cash flow that you're
looking at generating in 2016, do you feel the need to maintain some of that as dry powder in the event that you're
forced to react to a consolidation wave in the sector?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: John, in addition to saying we don't support rail mergers at this time, we've also said we are
paying close attention to the situation where we're monitoring it and as things evolve we'll do what's in the best
interests of our shareholders and our stakeholders. If you look at our capital structure, we are in a solid position,
strategically, if we had to do anything. But, what we're focused on right now is that in the current environment we think
mergers are not in the interest of our customers, and just monitoring that and keeping close tabs on it.
<Q - John Barnes>: Okay. All right. And then my follow-up is, look, I hate to ask you such a short-term type of
question, but, Eric, you mentioned in your commentary from the Intermodal risk perspective record high inventories
and you talked a little bit about your thoughts on the consumer. We've got the Chinese New Year kind of right around
the corner. Normally there is typically kind of a surge in activity ahead of that. Do you anticipate or are you hearing
from your shipper base, customer base yet that maybe there is some intention to use that period as an opportunity to,
kind of, clear the decks a little bit, maybe clear the baffles on inventory and so you come out of maybe 1Q in a little bit
better inventory situation, or do you anticipate that you will still see maybe that normal pre-Chinese New Year type of
surge in Intermodal volumes?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We're hearing nothing specific from our shippers surrounding the Chinese New Year to disclose
here. I would say that every BCO is looking at rationalizing their inventories because they exited the holiday season
higher than, I think, expected on inventories with sluggish retail sales. I think across the board you hear every customer
talking about trying to right-size their inventories.
<Q - John Barnes>: Very good. All right, thanks for your time, guys. Appreciate it.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Thank you, John.

Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks, and good morning. I was wondering if you could provide more color on the magnitude of
the record productivity you noted in your comments, and how much of that is predicated on a slightly down volume
environment. In other words, if volumes end up being worse than you expected here, is record productivity still
achievable?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I'll make one quick comment and that is what we saw in 2015 was both cost coming up because
of volume, getting the structure right, and a much more fluid network in the second half of the year generating excellent
productivity opportunities.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. Justin, I would just add – this is Rob. I would just add that, kind of, what gives us
that confidence. The marker that I would point you to is our improvement in our operating ratio throughout the full year
and our confidence that we'll continue to do that. In terms of at what pace we can do it when we were all about doing it
as quickly and as efficiently and safely as we can, but what will drive sort of the timing of that productivity as we move
with volumes is going to be the mix effect and the timing of when there are volume changes. And as you know,
throughout 2015, the first half, we're kind of chasing volume down, and then we were able to, sort of, take advantage as
things neutralized or straightened out a little bit in the back half. And so, that will be a factor, too, in terms of what
volume swings may or may not occur. But, what we're focused on squeezing out productivity on everything we do and
that's all I can point you to, is that we'll look at every stone and uncover it and look for opportunities.

<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Great. And I know you're not giving specific EPS guidance for 2016, but just putting
together the pieces here, slightly down volumes, core price increases, record productivity, better OR, the benefit of
share repurchases, just from a directional standpoint, would it be correct to say that you're thinking about EPS being up
year-over-year?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Well, the reason I'm not giving guidance on the earnings is because there are so many
uncertainties, of which mix, by the way, is another headwind I would remind you of that I did call out, and that will
dictate, I think, in large part exactly how this year plays out. So, with all the uncertainties out there, we're going to
certainly focus and fight like heck to take advantage of whatever the economy plays us to turn in as positive of earnings
and returns in cash generation as we can, but we're not giving guidance as to exactly what the earnings will end up
being for the year.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the time.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure thing, Jeff (sic) [Justin].

Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been answered, but let me come back to
the cash flow question if I can. Could you remind us of where you ideally want to have your debt levels, whether you
think about them as a debt-to-cap or a debt-to-EBITDA? And when I think about the positives to your 2016 cash flow,
you mentioned about $400 million bonus depreciation, about $500 million less spend on CapEx and, for better or for
worse, with the shares down the way they are, you can buy back shares that won't cost as much to still hit your numbers
on the share repo. When you look at 2016, given the increased uncertainty, are you more likely to say, okay, we're
going to buy back whatever shares we're going to buy back, but with the excess cash flow we just may not need as
much debt to fund it? Or is your view that you're still under-levered and you're willing to go to higher debt-to-cap
levels?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. Jeff, I would just remind you the guidance that we've given, which we are
comfortable with, and is working towards that debt-to-EBITDA of 2x. I mean, we've said sort of that's a marker out
there. I think we still have a little bit of room from the improvement we made on that metric in 2015. So, I would
expect that we'll continue to march forward, if you will, and as I pointed out, we do expect, largely, because of the
reduction and we hope to generate stronger cash on the front-end, but we also have the benefit of lower CapEx and the
benefit of the bonus depreciation that I outlined. And we may do debt this year, we will look at that. That would not be
an unrealistic expectation that you'll see us take on additional debt this year. All of that gives us additional – gives us
opportunities to generate stronger free cash flow and gives us opportunities to continue to be opportunistic in the
marketplace.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. And so, basically you were saying we have, I think, you're 1.7 times
debt-to-EBITDA, and you're saying we can go to 2x, so we can take on a little more debt, but more likely we would use
the cash flow just to fulfill our obligations. One final...
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I don't think Rob said that. I think, he said, we're going to generate cash, we've got room in our
balance sheet and we'll see how the year plays out.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. That's all I have.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Yeah. Thanks. Eric, could you remind us what your percent of carloads yields are tied to the
underlying price of the commodity that it hauls?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I'm not quite sure what you're asking. If you're asking about our pricing strategy, we don't really
talk publicly about our pricing strategy. We have historically said, we don't think philosophically that you need to tie
transportation to swings in commodity markets. We've said that philosophically, but we don't talk about our pricing
strategy publicly.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Yeah. I'd say – I guess, I'm not interested in the strategy specifically. Is there a percentage that
you provide of carloads that have the yield component that is specifically tied to the price of the underlying
commodity?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, again, we don't talk publicly about our pricing strategy. We don't talk about what our –
how our prices are developed.

Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Good morning and thank you. I wanted to talk about mix in terms of length of haul. I've seen
length of haul getting shorter this quarter not just for Coal, but also Chemicals and Industrials. Is there a structural
change going on? What are the drivers of that? And where do you see that trend? Thank you very much.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric, do you want to talk about that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Our length of haul is down slightly this year. And again, it is other things that we have been
talking about in terms of the mix headwinds with our Coal business, some of the mix headwinds with our frac sand
business, our long-haul grain export business, those are all mix factors that has impacted our length of haul, which was
down slightly this year.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I don't think we see anything structural that's some kind of long-term trend.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Okay. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is tied to one of your comments earlier that you
haven't seen the benefit from low oil prices. Not just you, but many of us were talking about some kind of silver lining.
So, what are you hearing from your customers? Do you get the sense that they are postponing decisions just due to
uncertainty, or they are signaling to you that there is simply lower demand? And what do you think might trigger a
boost for the industrial economy that would reflect in your volumes? And I know that's a long question, but maybe tied
to that, if you could, discuss where you focus your business development as a result. Thanks very much.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Cleo, so I'll focus the answer on your question about not seeing the benefits of low oil. There's
multiple moving parts in there. We are seeing capital investment occurring specifically along the Gulf Coast in our
Chemical franchise. Those investments just haven't yet turned over into operating units. And so, that's a matter of time.
That's an, end of this year, 2017, 2018 kind of, impact. We're still hopeful for that impact.
The other part of it is consumers doing something with the windfall of lower energy costs, and that's where it's really
hard to see that showing through in the goods that we ship for retailers. And their feedback is, while maybe services
consumption is relatively healthy, goods consumption isn't necessarily showing them.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Okay. So, then your business development remains focused in the Chemical Gulf Coast
footprint?

Our next question is from the line of [ph] Sammy Hession with Investors Group. (1:16:07) Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q>: Good morning, all. Thank you for taking my question. And I apologize in advance if any of these questions have
been asked. I missed part of the call. With respect to the head count reduction, I see that it's principally and obviously
within the running trades, the TE&Y, taking that a level above, are there any plans to review the support and/or indirect
head count as a consequence of the volume environment? And I have a couple of other questions with specific volume.
Thanks.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: [ph] Sammy, (1:16:38) this is Lance. We, in the third quarter of last year and into the fourth
quarter, we announced and executed an involuntary force reduction on our non-agreement or our management ranks,
and that's been executed. And then as we look forward, we continue to look for opportunity to get our overall structure
sized right for the markets that we're serving. Attrition is our friend in that effort. We typically get an attrition rate of
7% or 8% a year, and we will use that to our advantage as and if we need to continue to adjust our overall structural
cost.
<Q>: Thanks for that, Lance. On the Industrial side, with respect to frac sand, did you call out exactly how much that
was down and how much it now composes as a percentage of revenues?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We did in both the prepared remarks and I think in the materials that we sent out.
<Q>: So, I should take minerals as mostly frac sand?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes. The minerals is down 52% (sic) [42%] and the majority of that is frac sand.
<Q>: Great. Thank you. Thank you very much, gentlemen.

Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Good morning. Rob, I think you called out an $0.11 headwind from fuel in the
fourth quarter. Have you guys thought about trying to range what we can expect from a fuel headwind for next year? I
mean, obviously, there's a lot of moving parts to that as well, but if we were to just assume that oil prices kind of
stabilize here and we move forward, could you talk a little bit about how big the absolute fuel headwind could be in
2016?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: I didn't put a number on the full year, but it could well be a headwind. I did call out that
the first quarter, remember, that we had about an $0.08 positive last year. So, we clearly have that as a hurdle facing us
as the first quarter continues to play out. Of course, how fuel and the timing within any particular quarter will dictate
exactly what that number ends up being year-over-year, but we do see that as a headwind certainly in the first quarter

and could continue at some pace throughout the year.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: But, similar to the volume comp issue, you'd say that if oil prices were to stabilize, the
worst of the fuel impact would be frontend-loaded?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Depending on what mix is and what volumes actually are, that's a fair assumption. Yes.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. And then, I guess, just as a general question, it seems like on some of the
published surcharge tariff tables fuel prices are getting to the point where surcharges actually zero out. Is that kind of a
correct read of those tables or do you think that the fuel revenue will still, kind of, be positive as we get through most of
2016?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Well, as we said, those are publicly seen and the calculations for those you probably
have an accurate calculation. David, this is Rob. I would just remind you and others that remember, we have some
60-plus different surcharge mechanisms that have different starting points, different components, different timing
mechanisms around them. So, it's very difficult to draw any kind of a straight line conclusion, but currently at these low
prices, some of them are probably near the edge.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. Excellent. Well, thanks a lot for your time; it's been a long call. And good
luck getting through the next couple of tough quarters here on the volume side.
