I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us.
In the second quarter of 2014 we again grew our earnings on a year-over-year basis, excluding DVA and excluding a
discrete tax benefit in the quarter, earnings increased 46%.
The fruits of our strategy were evident with the stability of our Wealth and Asset Management businesses providing
significant ballast. The trusted partnership we have with our clients in Investment Banking and institutional equities
offset historically low levels of volatility and reduced client activity. Our role as a strategic advisor for clients across
our franchise including M&A, prime brokerage, credit, research and other deep, content-rich businesses positions us to
benefit significantly from accelerating positive trends.

I will now take you through the six points we laid out for you in January and then turn the call over to Ruth. First, we
continue to improve Wealth Management margins through cost discipline and revenue growth. For the first time since
the acquisition from Citi of the remaining stake in the Wealth Management JV, we've achieved a greater-than-20%
margin in our Wealth Management business and record earnings since the inception of the joint venture.
We reached this level through a combination of revenue growth; our revenues grew 5% on a year-over-year basis
despite reduced industry-wide transaction activity and continued expense discipline. We drove our non-compensation
expenses down by 9% during the same period and our total expenses grew only 3%. We continue to expect to drive our
margin to the 22% to 25% target set for the end of 2015.
Second, we have improved our ROE in Fixed Income & Commodities and continue to optimize that business to be
appropriately sized for this firm. Although our revenues, excluding DVA, were flat in the first half of 2014 we've also
reduced average RWAs and expenses, thereby increasing ROE in this business year-to-date. At the end of the second
quarter 2014 our RWAs in Fixed Income & Commodities were $192 billion. In addition to this systemic reduction of
deadweight capital, more broadly, we've taken significant steps in Commodities to improve returns. We closed on the
sale of TransMontaigne on July 1, the first of two physical oil businesses we are selling and continue to work towards
closing the sale of the other physical business later this year.
And as discussed at our financials conference in early June we're optimizing head count and reducing grossed up
balance sheet in Fixed Income while maintaining a global franchise by leveraging our clearing and electronic
capabilities. Our objective remains to deliver a global offering to the firm's clients and an attractive return for
shareholders.
Third, we're driving additional expense reductions and improvements in our expense ratios. In the first half of 2014 we
grew our revenues by 3% while keeping expenses flat. Our non-compensation expenses have declined while the
firm-wide compensation ratio is also lower. In aggregate, overall expense ratios have improved from 79% to 76%
compared to the first half of 2013. We continue to see opportunities to increase efficiency through both tactical and
strategic moves, investing in technology and systems that simplify our business and position us to better serve our
clients.
Fourthly, we continue to make progress regarding Morgan Stanley's specific growth opportunities, most notably in the
bank. In the last several months we drove new production records in both mortgages and securities-based lending
despite sluggish demand for mortgages across the industry. Our success has been driven by the relatively low
penetration of our product within Wealth Management versus peer firms. We've seen a network effect build within our
system as financial advisors use the products and find them effective for their clients they discuss opportunities with
additional clients; the successes are then being shared throughout the system leading to more activity.
As Ruth said before, lending growth will enhance the stability of revenue and earnings for the firm as a whole and
make our client relationships deeper and stickier.
Of great importance to us however, is that we grow our banks in a prudent and measured fashion. We've known since
2009 that we would have a very significant deposit base and have spent the last five years investing in risk
management, technology and client service.
Turning to the fifth point. We continue to steadily increase capital returns to shareholders. We discussed our plans for
capital returns with you on our last call in extensive detail and we remain committed to increasing returns over time
subject, of course, to regulatory approval. Of note, a key driver of capital returns are stable and consistent earnings
which we continued to demonstrate this quarter.
Finally, we're working towards achieving returns in excess of our cost of capital and, of course, subject to our capital
returns. We did achieve our target of 10% this quarter though it was obviously flatted by the discrete tax benefit.
However, excluding DVA in the first half of this year and last year and excluding the tax benefit of this quarter, our
underlying ROE was still higher.

Of greater significance, we demonstrated improved performance and momentum in many areas across the firm that are
important to driving our ROE sustainably higher including the following.
One, in Investment Banking we had a very strong quarter driven by the strength in our Underwriting and Advisory
franchises.
Two, we continued to drive industry-leading results in Institutional Equities despite lower market volumes around the
world and this is due to the depth and breadth of our franchise and the partnership we've built with our clients over
many years.
Thirdly we drove our Wealth Management margin higher even in a relatively subdued transaction environment. We
also reached importantly $2 trillion dollars in client assets, a tremendous achievement and more than three times the
assets we held in 2006 on behalf of our clients.
Fourthly our relative performance in Fixed Income was solid and we made progress towards one of our last strategic
business change objectives with the closing on the sale of TransMontaigne on July 1.
Fifthly we also successfully raised our first major post Dodd-Frank Merchant Banking fund in Asia. This was coming
in ahead of our expectations with significant institutional representation and with a sizably less firm capital versus
earlier funds.
And finally, as Ruth will discuss in more detail, we increased our pro forma SLR estimate under the U.S. proposed rule
to 4.6%, up from 4.2% last quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Ruth to discuss the quarter in more detail and look forward to your questions at the end.
Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Good morning.
I will provide those GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the
footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures.
The impact of DVA in the quarter was positive $87 million with $50 million in Fixed Income sales and trading and $
37 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm wide revenues were $8.5 billion, down 3%
versus the first quarter.
The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the second quarter was 1.6% reflecting a discrete tax benefit of
$609 million or $0.31 per diluted share principally related to the re-measurement of reserves and related interest.
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were $1.8
billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share, excluding DVA, were $0.91 after preferred dividends.
On a GAAP basis including the impact of DVA firm wide revenues for the quarter were $8.6 billion. Earnings from
continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $1.9 billion. Reported earnings from
continuing operations per diluted share were $0.94 after preferred dividends.
Book value at the end of the quarter was $33.48 per share and tangible book value was $28.53 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $827 billion at June 30, down modestly from $831 billion at the end
of the first quarter. Deposits as of quarter end were $118 billion, up $1 billion versus Q1. Our liquidity reserve at the
end of the quarter was $192 billion compared with $203 billion at the end of the first quarter. The decline was primarily
driven by the deployment of excess cash from deposits into loans, which reduces our bank liquidity and is consistent
with the bank strategy we laid out previously.

Turning to capital, this quarter the required Basel reporting regime moved to a Basel III advanced denominator whereas
last quarter the required denominator was based on Basel I plus 2.5. In both quarters the numerator is calculated based
on the transitional Basel III rules. Although our calculations are not final we believe that our common equity Tier 1
transitional ratio will be approximately 13.8% and our Tier 1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately
15.2%. Basel III transitional, risk-weighted assets are expected to be approximately $423 billion at June 30.
Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma common equity Tier one ratio using Basel
III fully-phased-in advanced approach was 12.1% at June 30, up from 11.6% in 1Q. Our pro forma standardized ratio
was 10.8%, up from 10.2% in 1Q.
Pro forma fully-phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $431 billion. We estimate our
pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the U.S. regulatory proposal to be approximately 4.6% at June 30, up
from 4.2% at the end of the first quarter. These estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision. We continue to
expect to exceed the required 5% level in 2015 including an assumption for increasing returns of capital to
shareholders.
Turning to expenses; our total expenses this quarter were $6.6 billion, flat versus the first quarter. Compensation
expense was down 2% versus the prior quarter. Non-compensation expense was $2.4 billion, up 5% reflecting seasonal
trends.
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities revenues excluding DVA were $4.2 billion,
down 8% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.2 billion, down 1% versus the first quarter. Compensation was
$1.7 billion for the second quarter, down versus the first quarter on lower revenue reflecting a 41% ratio including
DVA. Non-compensation expense for the second quarter was $1.5 billion, up versus the first quarter also reflecting
seasonality. The business reported a pre-tax profit of $927 million excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact
of DVA, revenues were $4.2 billion and pre-tax profit was $1 billion.
In Investment Banking, revenues of $1.4 billion were up 26% versus last quarter reflecting broad-based strength across
products and regions with substantial growth in EMEA. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked
number two in global announced and completed M&A and number three in global IPOs at the end of the second
quarter.
Notable transactions included in advisory, Morgan Stanley is acting as defense advisor to Shire in its discussions with
AbbVie regarding a potential $55 billion combination. Morgan Stanley also acted as lead financial advisor and lead left
arranger on the bridge financing for Tyson Foods in its $8.6 billion acquisition of Hillshire Brands.
In Equity Underwriting we again evidenced the strength of our global franchise. Notable deals include acting as joint
global coordinator and joint book runner we priced a $3.5 billion capital increase for the National Bank of Greece and
Morgan Stanley successfully executed a $1.3 billion unregistered block trade of YPF SA, amongst other international
offerings.
In Debt Underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as global coordinator on the successful $40 billion consent solicitation of
debt securities for Pemex. In addition, acting as joint book runner, the firm sourced $9.9 billion of debtor-in-possession
financing for energy future holdings. Morgan Stanley and its partner, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ played a leading
role in structuring, underwriting and syndicating the debt facilities.
Advisory revenues of $418 million increased 24% versus our first quarter results due primarily to increased activity
with particular strength in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Underwriting revenues of $1 billion increased 27% versus our first
quarter results driven by equity underwriting revenues of $489 million, which were up 55% versus the first quarter on
higher-issuance volumes in a strong market and a meaningful uptick in EMEA.
Fixed Income underwriting revenues were $525 million, higher versus the first quarter, primarily driven by higher
investment grade and high-yield volume.
Equity Sales and Trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $1.8 billion, an increase of 5% from last quarter. Prime
brokerage revenues were up, reflecting the benefit of increased client balances and the dividend season. Cash revenues

remained resilient against declines in market volumes across regions. Derivatives revenues were down as lower
volatility reduced client activity.
Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1 billion, down sequentially driven in
part by typical seasonality. Commodities revenues were down substantially from a very strong 1Q.
Outside of commodities, revenues in most product areas declined due to lower volatility, which resulted in lower client
activity. In contrast, rates revenues were modestly higher quarter-over-quarter due to improvements in both the United
States and EMEA. CVA continued to be a drag in the quarter due to the tightening of our credit spreads. Average
trading VAR for the second quarter was $48 million, down slightly to the first quarter.
Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 3% sequentially. Asset
Management revenues of $2.1 billion were up versus last quarter reflecting the benefit of higher market levels and
positive flows. Transaction revenues were essentially flat to last quarter consisting primarily of commissions of $511
million, down 5% versus the prior quarter due to lower activity consistent with lower exchange volumes. Investment
banking -related fees of $213 million, up 18% versus last quarter reflecting higher equity and preferred stock
underwriting activity and trading revenues of $267 million, down 3% versus the first quarter reflecting a decrease in
Fixed Income trading, partially offset by higher returns on deferred compensation plans.
Net interest revenue increased 7% to $578 million driven primarily by higher revenues from our bank deposit programs
and continued growth in our lending products. Non-interest expense was $2.9 billion, flat versus last quarter.
Non-compensation expense was $762 million also flat to last quarter. The compensation ratio was 59%, down versus
the first quarter driven by seasonal trends.
The PBT margin was 21%. Profit before tax was $767 million. Total client assets surpassed $2 trillion. Global
fee-based asset inflows were $12.5 billion. Fee-based assets under management increased to a record $762 billion at
quarter end representing 38% of client assets. Global representatives were 16,316, essentially flat to the first quarter.
Deposits in our bank deposit program were $127 billion, down versus the first quarter due primarily to outflows related
to tax season. Approximately $109 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks.
Our Wealth Management lending balances continue to grow reflecting the ongoing execution of our bank strategy. Our
PLA balances increased $1.9 billion and mortgage balances increased $1.6 billion. Production in the second quarter
was at record levels for both products.
Investment management revenues of $692 million were down 6% sequentially, predominantly driven by the
deconsolidation of certain legal entities associated with a real estate fund sponsored by the firm. A number of years ago
we provided a liquidity facility for the fund and thus had to consolidate revenues and capital. The liquidity facility has
expired. Accordingly, certain legal entities associated with the fund were deconsolidated. The deconsolidation
eliminates the related revenue as well as a portion of our non-controlling interest and is net income neutral.
Additionally the deconsolidation reduces both balance sheet and risk-weighted assets.
In traditional asset management, revenues of $436 million were flat to the first quarter and real estate investing
revenues of $111 million were down 15% driven by the deconsolidation. Merchant banking revenues were $145
million down 16% driven by lower gains in investments. Non-interest expenses were $487 million up 2% from the first
quarter. The compensation ratio was 42%, up versus the first quarter driven primarily by the revenue impact of the
deconsolidation. Non-compensation expense was $196 million, up from $192 million in the first quarter. Profit before
tax was $205 million, down 22% sequentially due to the deconsolidation. NCI was $7 million versus $54 million last
quarter, again driven by the deconsolidation. Total assets under management increased to $396 billion driven by market
appreciation and positive flows.
We also successfully completed a fundraising for Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia IV in the quarter, our first major
post-Dodd-Frank fundraising effort.
Turning to our outlook, while June was stronger than the first two months of the quarter, recognizing that trading
markets remain uncertain, we are of the view that it is too early to determine conditions for the balance of the rest of the

year. However, we see strength and opportunities across our businesses with several encouraging trends.
First, M&A volumes remain strong with a healthy backlog and growth in larger transactions which is our sweet spot.
Last quarter we discussed three catalysts for heightened M&A activity and they remain: healthy corporate,
cross-border, and activist activity, suggesting M&A will remain vibrant.
Second, financing markets remain receptive with a strong pipeline in equity underwriting and a positive outlook for
debt underwriting benefiting from M&A activity.
Third we are seeing an increase in activity in Europe. The second quarter was the strongest in Europe since the
beginning of 2012 with notable improvement in both Investment Banking and Fixed Income product. Given the
strength and breadth of our corporate and institutional client relationships, we are well-positioned to benefit from these
trends and are focused on delivering for our clients.
More specific to Morgan Stanley we are also increasingly seeing the fruits of the many steps we have taken during the
last five years to better position the firm with three tailwinds worth noting.
First, we continue to benefit from lending growth, which is supported by our leading client franchises in both Wealth
Management and institutional securities. Given the scale of each of these franchises, we have ample opportunities with
our existing clients while maintaining tight credit standards. As evidenced by the growth in our funded loan book again
this quarter we continue to execute against this opportunity and there remains significant upside. We are prudently
building a balanced portfolio on our way to being the tenth largest depository in the U.S.
Second, as discussed before, Wealth Management continues to deliver higher profitability with growing revenues on a
higher PBT margin. Now with 100% ownership of the Wealth Management business the operating leverage translates
into a growing contribution to the firm.
Finally, the outperformance of our cash bond spreads enable us to finance the firm more efficiency, that, over time of
course, will result in additional upside.
Thank you for listening. James and I will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. I was wondering if you could clarify how you treat something that you
mentioned but didn't quantify in your remarks, which is the CVA on the derivatives books of the markets businesses. I
think everyone is pretty clear in the industry now about calling out DVA but I'm not sure that CVA gets very consistent
treatment. And in particular since we're also focused on how FICC and Equities are trending, I just want to make sure
that I understand how you treat CVA and how much your credits spread swings might've impacted FICC in particular
in regard to CVA this quarter?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So as much as we call out DVA and talk about revenues excluding DVA because that does not flow
through to capital, CVA does and so – it flows right through the P&L. When we discuss our Fixed Income &
Commodities revenues it reflects the impact of CVA and to your point, firms do it differently but it does reflect at
Morgan Stanley the impact of CVA and given the meaningful spread tightening we had, in particular, year-over-year,
it's pretty notable. So for example, year-over-year our Fixed Income business was up in all major products except
foreign exchange. However, given the spread tightening, we had a big drag in CVA and if you exclude the impact of
CVA, our Fixed Income & Commodities business would've been up.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And was the impact much more in FICC than in equities?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, thanks. Also just to pick up on something else that you mentioned, I seem to recall
that in years past, like before the last couple of years, your prime brokerage business did a very strong seasonal
business in European dividend arm in the second quarter in particular. Can you give us a sense of how much that
might've contributed in the second quarter this year?
<A - Ruth Porat>: That does continue to be a benefit in the second quarter and again, along with the strength we had
in PV more broadly with growth in revenues, clients and client balances we continue to benefit from the seasonality. So
if you look at year-over-year performance in equities that would normalize for what continues to be a second-quarter
seasonal event.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Thanks. One more question which is really more on capital. You moved equity
capital, it looks like, from the parent into the business units, a couple of billion dollars on the average into Institutional,
about $500 million in Investment Management which is a fairly sizable percentage increase for that business. Is this
also because of the regime change that you talked about in terms of going to the Basel III or is there something else
going on there?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No. You've nailed it. The way we disclose the allocation of capital across the various businesses is
based on the capital regime in place at that point in time and so this quarter as result of yet another regime change both
the numerator and denominator are under Basel III transitional. Last quarter the denominator was Basel I plus 2.5, this
quarter the denominator is Basel III transitional advanced. So it's a regime change, we're just following the required
regime quarter after quarter. The result is more capital moved from the parent to Institutional Securities.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay. That's great. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. Quick question first on the $192 billion RWA in FICC, does that include
TransMontaigne?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We closed TransMontaigne as of July 1 and so that would include TransMontaigne because that's a
second-quarter number.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Perfect. Can you help us think about how much that might help reduce that number in 2Q?
Or 3Q rather, excuse me?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So TransMontaigne is about $2 billion of risk-weighted assets and there's also a modest liquidity
benefit.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Great. Thanks. So we noticed that deposits in the bank deposit program fell this quarter.
Was that seasonal? And can you help us think about that this year? Because it didn't seem like we noticed as much of a
seasonal decline in prior years, so was there anything unusual going on there?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So firm wide, the deposits are reported in two lines, you've got the bank and then the parent and
we've had the on-boarding of deposits from Citi. The deposits overall were up $1 billion, $5 billion from contractual
ongoing of deposits, but to your point, that was offset by the typical season outflows for tax payments. So tax payments
were actually greater than outflows and what we saw was increasing use of PLA or securities-based lending products
by clients to pay taxes.
I think what's worth noting is in the fourth quarter, deposits tend to be higher due to year-end selling and then on the
flip side, we see deposits going down some in the second quarter with tax payments. So net/net, year-end selling and
tax payments do tend to even each other out over the period but what you're seeing here is the second quarter

seasonality.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Great. And then just clarifying because I got a handful of questions about it before the
opening, the bank program deposits include Citi's portion, right? And if we look down at the footnote, we can see
Morgan Stanley's piece and that went from 108 to 109 this quarter. So the rate slowed but it still was headed in an
upward direction. Correct?
<A - Ruth Porat>: In the Wealth Management line?
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Right.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Wealth Management went down, right.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Perfect. Okay. And then also on the comp in the Wealth Management business, is it possible
to think about how much of that is from the amortization of forgivable loans written to recruit brokers? Because the
past several years we've gone through sort of an elevated recruiting environment, and if we think about, I think maybe
James made some comments at the Morgan Stanley FIG conference about how recruiting and competition may be
moderating a bit. And so if we think about turnover staying at current levels, is it possible that you guys can help us
think about how much the roll off of maybe an elevated amortization expense might be a tailwind to Wealth
Management comp over time?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, let me give you a couple pieces. So the comp ratio was down this quarter and that reflects
typical first quarter seasonality with FICA and it's typically down, it was here. The reason we're guiding down to the
55% or lower comp ratio over time really goes to the growth in net interest income and the execution of our bank
strategy and the tremendous operating leverage we have as we continue to deploy deposits into lending product.
So if you, again, looking at the overall business, we will be driving it to 55% or lower because the margin on that
product, the lending product, is pretty significant and the lending product is not on the same formulaic comp grid. So I
think if you're trying to gauge where is the comp ratio going, the biggest driver of it will be NII and the growth in
lending product.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Hey, Brennan, just to separate it, I think your ratio is around the amortization, also, of
the deals in addition to what Ruth just described. Long term, strategically, in an oligopoly structure, you would expect
there'd be less movement of financial advisors between firms. That doesn't translate yet into the financials. But over the
long term, we think it will.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, great. And you're exactly right, Jim. I completely get the NII and how that's not
necessarily on the grid type of payout and therefore should help the comp. I just was hoping to try to get at maybe some
of that amortization. So I guess the only color you guys could give is over the longer run, assuming competition stays
down, that should also help as a tailwind overall, as well, too.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Yes, it will.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then last one for me, touched on it a bit prior, but prime brokerage was definitely
a positive. You hit on seasonality, but as you said, when we look year-over-year, that should normalize for the
seasonality. And you guys were flat, which in this quarter, flat is the new up. So maybe could you help us in parsing
out maybe any other benefits that you might have had and was it mostly in prime brokerage? And aside from
seasonality, were there any drivers and tailwinds there?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, as we've talked about for many quarters, this is a stellar franchise. They've had consistency of
performance for many quarters. It's a diversified global franchise across products and geographies. We often talk about
managing and leading it across a nine box strategy, with the products, cash derivatives and DV on the one hand and the
regions of the world, Americas, EMEA and Asia on the other dimension, and looking for leadership in delivering for
clients within each of those boxes and then looking at opportunities to build adjacencies across those various boxes.

We had strength this quarter led by prime brokerage, as I noted already, with growth in revenues, clients and client
balances. And then in terms of cash products we continue to have strong performance in cash. We do believe we took
wallet share there. We had good client engagement in index rebalancing. Derivatives was a bit lower on the back of
lower volatility, but overall it's a very strong franchise that continues to deliver.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. Ruth, you mentioned you're moving to leverage your status as the tenth largest depository in
the U.S. And looking at the bank data from Call Reports, it looks like the ROA of the bank is only 60 basis points and
I'm not sure if we should just look at the bank in isolation. And also, if we look at the information in your package
today, it looks like a loan to deposit ratio of 39% or so. If you could just confirm whether this is at least one way to
look at your company and highlight where you want to go with say the loan to deposit ratio or the ROA of the bank.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So what we've tried to lay out in a number of presentations is the contractual growth in deposits,
where we are in terms of asset mix and as you look over time, how we look to deploy those deposits moving more from
cash into lending products. And clearly the yield today continues to be pretty low given where we are still overweight
in cash.
Philosophically the way we're looking at is deposit growth is going to support lending. It is supporting lending in both
Institutional Securities and Wealth Management. Both are leading franchises with a large base of untapped clients, and
we have a very strong opportunity, therefore, to continue to build out a nice diversified asset mix here, while
maintaining strong credit standards.
So I think if you look at the decks that we've put out is you'll see where the yield on that should go over time. There's a
lot of noise in the Call Reports but directionally it will give you a sense of the mix between these two franchises,
Wealth Management and Institutional Securities.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: How much would Morgan Stanley benefit if interest rates increased by 100 basis points, maybe
just on the bank side or for the firm as a whole? I don't think you guys have articulated it in that way.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Quite meaningfully. I mean what we have articulated is the cost pressure in the bank and so again,
our AFS portfolio continues to be very short duration and as we're looking at continuing to deploy deposits into lending
product, a rising rate environment's quite meaningfully the margin in the bank, given we have no bricks and mortar, we
have no customer acquisition cost because we're really lending to our existing client base, which is not only a cost
benefit but a credit risk management benefit. We've already built the infrastructure to support the loan growth and I've
already commented on the compensation approach. It's not on the formulaic grid, so the bank has a very high margin.
Rising rates would be significant.
What we did in the deck that I've already alluded to is we indicated where we were at a point in time and just following
the forward yield curve what kind of lift you would see in the yield if we were just following the forward yield curve.
And what we tried to do is give you all of the various levers so that between the onboarding of deposits, the current mix
of assets, the deployment plan over time, you can toggle it how you want.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, James, you gave a comment, it was almost an aside, in talking about your ROE
targets, saying well perhaps 15% ROE is possible some day, and it was the first time I heard you say that 15% would
even be possible for an ROE and that's a long way from where you've been and it's a nice stretch from where you are
now. But did you say that and why did you mention it? Do you feel more positive about the outlook or is this just a

hypothetical one day sort of statement?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I think the time that I said that was in the context of what was available for the
industry, and this had been an industry, Mike, as you know where ROEs of 20-plus percent were the norm. You double
the capital, you shrink the balance sheet and unless you create new businesses, your 20-plus percent ROEs immediately
drop to sub-five percent, which is exactly what happened with the industry. The industry is now working its way back
to 10% ROEs through buybacks, more efficient capital usage, further balance sheet management, and in our case,
building diverse businesses that use less capital and obviously contribute to ROE.
So I think I'm certainly not making an immediate projection. This is sort of a stage view of where the industry is going.
Is it probable the industry returns to 20%-plus ROEs? No, I don't think that's probable. Is it probable the industry stays
below 10%? No, I don't think that's probable. So it's sort of framing it.
Now you would draw your own conclusion about Morgan Stanley's business mix versus obviously lots of other
financial institutions, and I think your point about the bank you just asked Ruth about is exactly at our sort of strategic
core. Part of the next evolution of this firm is to develop a $130 billion deposit bank within Morgan Stanley, which is a
very exciting prospect. It's not going to happen immediately and it's going to be done with prudence with respect to
lending, but it will be done and it will be done over several years.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: If you have a superior business mix it should eventually mean a superior ROE. Otherwise it
might not be a superior business mix. So at some point with higher rates is it possible Morgan Stanley could get an
ROE of 15% or so?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: There's a great old phrase of a journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step, and
we're working our way towards 10%. When we get there, we'll have another conversation with you.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

The next question will come from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Firstly, first quick question, first a question on Investment Management business, Ruth, in the
Investment Management business the core Asset Management fee line was up 10% linked quarter, which is a little bit
surprising just given AUM growth was closer to 4%. Any color you have on what's driving that would be appreciated.
<A - Ruth Porat>: We have continued to execute in that business. We had good flows in the business, have been
investing in distribution. You can see flows were up across the board in traditional Asset Management and I think that
the team continues to execute well.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay, got it. James, on the Wealth Management business I mean first of all congratulations on
getting to the $2 trillion club. While asset growth has been strong, both financial advisor head count and branch growth
have been more muted. I appreciate your focus on that business has been on increasing productivity and efficiency.
That said, I'd be curious if you guys actually have plans to grow your core advisor base and locations going forward?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So as we've talked about for quite some time, we're focused on productivity and quality of that base
rather than just sheer number. And in fact, have over time reduced the lower productivity financial advisors. We feel
very good in and around this level. We're not managing to a specific number. And as a relates to the number of
locations that we have, we've had an opportunity, in particular post-closing the acquisition of the joint venture, to look
at places where we could consolidate offices within major cities. And again, that's done on a case-by-case basis.

As we look at leases rolling off the question is within any particular area is there logic in combining an office? Where
you have a fully staffed office with a great culture, working really well it doesn't necessarily mean you want to try and
merge two offices together. That may not be the most effective for clients or the best experience for financial advisors.
So we've reduced the number of locations quite a bit over the last couple of years. I think the big bulk of the
opportunity we've really achieved there and now you'll see one to twos depending on any particular market but no
plans. We feel good about where we are.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Thanks. And then lastly from me just on the Prime business, you spoke about it a lot
today, just curious what you're hearing from your clients in terms of pricing trend just given the implications for
supplementary leverage ratio across the industry?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We are starting to hear some peers are re-pricing balance sheet as it effects this business and in
Fixed Income product as well, very much to your point, as a result of the SLR.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Ruth, just circling back to the SLR for a moment, I'm looking at the
slide that you and James put out for the update in January which highlighted the potential sources of increase and I'm
wondering if you can help me understand kind of what the approximate contribution of these categories were to the 40
basis point improvement sequentially?
<A - Ruth Porat>: The biggest driver taking us from 4.2% last quarter to 4.6% this quarter was the numerator. That
was most of the improvement and that was due to the combined benefit from earnings, the preferred issuance we did
early in the quarter, the multiplier effect with DTA and investment capacity deductions we've talked about previously.
We've continued to focus on mitigating some of the other numerator deductions and then the remaining improvement is
from the denominator items. So we've talked about previously some ongoing compression. RWAs were obviously
down in Fixed Income where you see the PFE gross up. Some mitigation, just early days of mitigating the net long
CDS sold and some modest balance sheet reduction. But the overwhelming, the majority of it was in the numerator and
we're executing against the opportunities now in the denominator.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And is there any change to the guidance given at that point of those various benefits
generating 180 to around 200 basis points of potential improvement?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, the rules change, so with now the inclusion of net long CDS sold and we've obviously had a
big move in the ratio from 4.2% to 4.6%, we're still very comfortable with greater than 5% in 2015 with higher returns
of capital, which may not surprise you given we're sitting here at 4.6% today. And as I said, across the various work
streams we're continuing to execute to reduce PFE where it makes sense, while still supporting our client activity and
client franchise.
There are certain areas, the best example of which is compression, which I characterized in the past as just good
hygiene. It's effective to reduce the overall PFE through compression activities and we're executing there. The pace is
strong. We've accomplished a lot year-to-date. The protocol around it has improved and so we expect the pace will
continue to be good. So we're continuing to execute against each of these. The mix may change a bit as we've added
now net long CDS sold mitigation as an added opportunity given the rule change.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. If I can just transition quickly, on page seven of the supplement in the other funded
loans category, which I recognize is small relative to the balance sheet, but up very significantly. I think the footnote

suggests that much of this could be purchased loans. And I'm just wondering what would be the strategy behind
growing a purchased loan portfolio?
<A - Ruth Porat>: I'm glad you asked because the growth within the lending book, again, across Wealth Management
and Institutional Securities is really executing with our clients in areas where we have a strong franchise, strong client
base, domain expertise. So within Institutional Securities, it is in areas consistent with what we've discussed today. I've
talked about it as small sleeves across a number of different areas including commercial real estate, warehouse, project
finance. That's really the bulk of what drove the increase in funded loan balances up about $5 billion, which as you
said, is a good increase but small relative to the scale of our franchise.
As an example, commercial real estate, we've got a 20-year track record. We've built leadership with a really high
quality franchise there and we have history originating loans outside the bank. We're now doing more in the bank but
we're targeting very much our client base in areas where we have domain expertise.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks. And just finally, I'm speculating that the fact that you called out no legal costs
suggests that they were de minimis in the period?
<A - Ruth Porat>: I'm sorry. I didn't hear the question.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: That there was no call out on legal costs suggests that they were low in the quarter?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Right. There was really not much to note.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi. Thanks. Ruth, you mentioned the lower funding costs earlier and it's clear that they've
gone down a lot. How should we think about how long it takes to work its way through? Is it really just the inverse of
maybe the average maturity? So in other words, you get a 15% to 20% of that benefit each year as your debt rolls?
<A - Ruth Porat>: That's a fair way to think about it.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. So I wouldn't call it material, but it can move the needle in the firm's overall earnings
on a year-by-year basis?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes, and our view is you've seen real compression across the industry, but we've outperformed
peers. And I think that our view is that reflects all that we've done over the last number of years to reposition both the
business mix and the balance sheet. So we view it as yet another tailwind that we will leg into, to your point, over time,
but it's a benefit and it will be a benefit even in a rising rate environment on a relative basis given our spreads have
come in more than peers.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. That's fair enough. I don't know if you've already addressed it in pieces across the other
questions, but you mentioned pieces of re-pricing or attempts to re-price in prime brokerage, maybe a broader question
of how you think the SLR is mostly impacting the big banks and brokers or impacting the markets and how it impacts
how you do your balance sheet planning?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We do think it continues to be the bigger constraint for banks on both sides of the Atlantic and
you're seeing the reduction of balance sheet in lower return assets. And as I noted, some peers are re-pricing balance
sheet using a harsher lens on allocation of balance sheet. So we are seeing wider bid/offer in certain financing markets.
There were some dislocations in Treasury sales, which we see as transitory and the Fed prevented additional dislocation
with the buy side using the RRP program, prevented a more painful readjustment period. But you're seeing the impact
on a ripple through in a number of different ways.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: It sounds like a lot of that stuff has made its way sure through. In other words, it has rippled
through but it's not creating a sea change. I'm putting words in your mouth, I realize.
<A - Ruth Porat>: I think you're still seeing an evolution here. I would agree, for example on Treasury sales, we view
that as transitory. But as firms reposition where they're using balance sheet and putting balance sheet behind client
activities, I think it continues to evolve, in particular given some of the requirements for the European banks.
We feel good about where we are because we've evolved our business mix, not to keep coming back to that, but it's a
really important way we think about our business given the changes that we've made over the last several years with the
strength of Wealth Management, the lens we have on balance sheet within Fixed Income going back quite some time
now, we feel we've taken the steps we need to take and have clarity about the execution path within Fixed Income,
equities continues to be performing as it consistently has and we have opportunities to support our banking clients with
the growth in lending products. So we feel good about where we are but I wouldn't say that it's necessarily done across
the industry.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, and then just a little cleanup. Did you have a market gain in the quarter and where was
it?
<A - Ruth Porat>: That was in the investments line. It wasn't a meaningful impact.

The next question will come from Steven Chubak with Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So had a follow-up question on operating leverage at the bank and what I was hoping to
clarify is when we go through the modeling process for Wealth Management earnings in a higher rate scenario, the
implied comp ratio that we derive is actually closer to the very low 50s, so about 300 or 500 basis points better than
your stated target of 55% and I was wondering whether your mid-50s target contemplates the benefit from higher rates?
And maybe even in that same vein, where do you see operating margins peaking in a more-normalized rate backdrop?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the 55% comp ratio and the PBT margin guidance of 22% to 25% assumes a flat rate
environment and we specifically did that so that you can model in your outlook for a rising rate environment. But very
much to your point, there's tremendous operating leverage in a rising rate environment for the Wealth Management
business and through the growth in that lending book and through what we're doing in the AFS portfolio. So there is
upside and you will see that flow through as rates rise and we'll let you forecast when that happens.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, great. And just switching gears for a moment to – I have a capital question pertaining
to FICC and just in an effort to help us better monitor your ongoing FICC ROE progress under all the different binding
constraints that exist today, it would be really helpful if you could help clarify the current level of required capital as
measured under the SLR to support the FICC business specifically? And also given how proactive you've been on the
mitigation front, how we should think about required capital levels trending over the next couple of years.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So we've broken out a lot of detail here in particular. Risk-weighted assets within institutional
securities, breaking it down to the Fixed Income level, so that you can get a sense of the progress we're making in that
business. You can see revenues year-to-date and I think that's where we're going to leave it. We've been indicating
ROE is higher and I think that's intuitive given the lower required capital, separately we're breaking out a lot of the
components of the various capital ratios and the leverage ratio and are on a good path forward to this greater than 5%.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Has been any change to, I guess there's roughly $5 billion plus or minus of FICC
revenues that were required to achieve your targeted 10% ROE within FICC. Presumably it would be a little bit lower
just given that you've been more proactive once you got on the mitigation front?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, as I indicated, we're very much focused on increasing ROE and there are multiple levers to
get there between revenues, expenses and capital but as an example a couple of quarters ago when I was talking about
our commodities businesses, the physical oil commodities businesses that we're selling, they have revenues but are
PBT break even with some capital tied up in them, so exiting physical oil may reduce revenues but it's accretive to
capital and accretive to earnings and again that's why as we're looking at it we said we want to be very clear, we're not
looking at revenues for revenues sake, we're looking at what's the most vibrant Fixed Income business unto itself and
when we talk about our Fixed Income business we're looking at a return on capital greater than 10% within Fixed
Income and moving in that direction and then beyond that, it's accretive to the returns of the firm.
And I talk about this often on these calls, but it is key, within Investment Banking yet again this quarter we had over –
we has about $500 million of Fixed Income underwriting revenues, which is accretive to those client relationships,
what our clients are looking for from us but really does benefit from the execution capabilities within Fixed Income.
And similarly within our Wealth Management business our clients want Fixed Income product, municipal product,
more specifically and that benefits from the strength of what we have within Fixed Income. But we're holding Fixed
Income to a standard, like all of our businesses, of generating an appropriate return on capital and systematically doing
using each one of those levers to drive to a higher return and then everything else that's accretive to the other businesses
benefits the bottom line.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, great. That detail was extremely helpful. Ruth, thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.
Operator
Our final question will come from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks. Just one quick last one, when we think about the outlook on the Institutional
Securities business and this is either James or Ruth, can you give us some sense, I guess two parts, just on the
Investment Banking side, given the pipeline of M&A, when, from a timing standpoint, when a lot of those things will
close once it's announced? And then any other revenues that can kind of shoot off from there? And then on the trading
side of the business, we're used to normal seasonality based on the last 20 years. Given that the business has changed
and firms have restructured some parts of it, has anything changed on that front, whether it's because of a client mix or
because of its product mix that we see less seasonality than we have in the past?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So starting with the first part on M&A and closing and implications for revenues as you look
through the year, it obviously varies depending upon the nature of the deal, the industry, whether regulatory approval is
required. So it can be from a month to many months. I think three to nine months just to indicate that it can cut across a
number of different periods. And typically much of the financing is done towards the latter end of that as you're
closing, although there can be some hedging activity up front.
I think the main point that is encouraging is that the pipeline continues to be very healthy across all products and in
M&A, I noted the momentum with these key drivers: cross-border, corporate activity and activist activity and now
we're seeing larger deals.
But probably one of the most additional encouraging elements for the team is that the velocity of deals has really
picked up as well. In other words, if you go back a year or two we talked a lot about a healthy pipeline that just wasn't
crossing the finish line and getting it into execution and being announced whereas now what you're seeing is much
greater clarity and velocity going from identification of a strategic opportunity to announcement and execution. That
velocity we think is encouraging and the underwriting calendar does remain strong globally. It remains strong in
particular on the equity side outside of the U.S. So that should be – that should give us, again, all things equal, some

momentum going through the balance of the year.
And then on the trading side it's tough to call. As I said, we saw a pick-up in June but too early to call whether that has
real legs to it given most of this year we saw lower trading volumes, lower volatility. So a bit of a pick-up in June is not
something I would say it's fair to extrapolate from yet, and as you pointed out, summer seasonality is in front of us.
Whether the trends change over time in trading businesses as a result of regulatory requirements, tough to say. I think
the one that's clear is summer seasonality.
