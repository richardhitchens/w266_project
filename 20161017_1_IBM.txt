to drive some volatility in results. But what you see in our third quarter results is stability in our revenue, with
continued strong growth in strategic imperatives and a top and bottom line consistent with what we expected.
Our revenue was essentially flat relative to last year. Looking at the revenue dynamics, I want to point out a few things.
Our clients are focused on becoming digital businesses and our strong growth in cloud, security, mobile, and across our
analytics portfolio reflects this. In total, we continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our strategic
imperatives led by our cloud business. Cloud delivered as-a-Service is part of a solid recurring revenue base across
software and services, and our annuity revenue continued to grow.
Of course, the acquisitions we've made in the last 12 months contributed to growth, about the same amount as last
quarter. And for the first time in quite a while, currency was a modest tailwind to revenue growth. I'll talk to our
revenue at constant currency going forward.
Looking at revenue from a segment perspective, we had very good performance in both Cognitive Solutions and
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms. Cognitive Solutions was up 5%, and within that solutions software was up
8%. Technology Services & Cloud Platforms revenue also grew, with continued strength in our infrastructure services
and growth in integration software as we help our clients build hybrid cloud capabilities. And with another quarter of
signings growth, our GTS backlog is up year-over-year.
Global Business Services made some progress this quarter in revenue trajectory, as we continue to shift and mix
towards digital offerings. Our Systems revenue was down this quarter. The z Systems performance reflects the fact that
we're seven quarters into the product cycle, while Power reflects the secular decline in UNIX mitigated by growth in
Linux. There's a tremendous amount of change in our industry, and we're continuing to invest where we see the best
opportunities. With this, we're addressing new opportunity areas and building new markets, as well as delivering
innovation in our existing businesses.
We're investing organically and we're acquiring key capabilities. We're remixing our skills and we've had success in
rebuilding our IP income base, utilizing partnerships that enable us to continue to innovate in some of the more
traditional high-value areas of the business. With all of that, we continue to have a very high margin business and we
generate a lot of profit and cash. Our results reflect the success we're having in helping our clients to leverage cloud for
speed and innovation and become cognitive businesses.
You see this in the growth in our strategic imperatives, which were up 15%. Over the last 12 months, strategic
imperatives delivered nearly $32 billion in revenue and now represent 40% of IBM. We had strong performance in our
cloud offerings, which were up over 40% led by our as-a-Service offerings. We exited the third quarter with an
as-a-Service run rate of $7.5 billion. That's up from $6.7 billion last quarter and the bulk of the increase is organic, so
we're building scale in these businesses. We also had strong revenue performance in security and in mobile, and we had
strong growth in our analytics offerings, which were up 14% this quarter with contribution from the core analytics
platform to cognitive offerings including Watson Platform, Watson Health and Watson IoT.
We are building the industry's broadest and deepest cognitive solutions in cloud platform portfolio, and we're extending
our capabilities. For example, this quarter we continued the global expansion of our cloud footprint and we now have
49 cloud centers. We formed a partnership with Workday, where IBM Cloud will become the foundation for Workday's
development and testing environment. And we extended our partnership with VMware to enable easy hybrid cloud
adoption.
As we've talked about in the past, cognitive is about using data and adding intelligence into products and services to
help clients make better decisions. It's about augmenting human intelligence. This quarter we introduced and expanded
Watson Platform offerings, including Watson Conversation service and Watson Virtual Agent for customer service.
We're training Watson for cyber security, expanding the amount of security data Watson is ingesting.
In Watson Health, we launched Watson for Drug Discovery and Watson Health Core. And in Watson IoT, we added
new capabilities around blockchain and security to draw insights from billions of sensors embedded in everything from
machines to cars to drones to ball bearings, to buildings and even to hospitals. Where we're seeing real value is in
providing cognitive capabilities in the IBM Cloud.

The third critical element of our strategy is our industry focus, and in the third quarter we introduced an Industry
Platforms business that integrates cloud, cognitive, industry and ecosystems capabilities to provide targeted solutions in
specific industries. Initially, industry platforms will address two substantial opportunity areas, Watson Financial
Services and blockchain solutions. We believe blockchain has the potential to do for trusted transactions what the
Internet did for information.
We're building a complete blockchain platform and are now working with over 300 clients to pioneer blockchain for
business, including CLS, who settles $5 trillion per day in the currency markets, to implement a distributed ledger in
support of its payment netting service, and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi for smart contracts to manage service level
agreements and automate multi-party transactions. And in the third quarter we opened a blockchain innovation center
in Singapore to accelerate blockchain adoption for finance and trade, and we now have blockchain garages open in
New York, London, Tokyo, Singapore, and San Francisco.
In Watson Financial Services, just a couple of weeks ago we announced the acquisition of Promontory Financial
Group, a leader in regulatory compliance and risk management consulting. So, just as we trained Watson on clinical
research and medical guidelines to work with doctors treating cancer, we will apply the expertise of Promontory to
train Watson to directly address escalating regulation and risk management requirements in financial services.
I'll expand on some of these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment
discussions. But first, let me walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $19.2 billion. As I just mentioned, currency was a modest tailwind to growth, about 80
basis points this quarter. On a geographic basis, we had sequential improvements in both the Americas and Europe. The
Americas revenue was flat as compared to last year, and the U.S. was also flat. Latin America was up 5%, led by
Brazil. While the environment remains uncertain, double-digit growth in Brazil this quarter reflects the importance of
our z Systems platform to the banking sector. Europe performance improved four points sequentially, driven by the
UK, Germany, France, and the Nordics. Asia-Pacific decelerated, including a decline in Japan and weaker performance
in China. India continued to post strong results.
Our gross margin was down this quarter. Across the business, the decline is driven by higher level of investments,
including the acquisitions we've made and the mix to as-a-Service businesses that aren't yet at scale. I'll address the
margin dynamics that are segment specific within the segment discussions.
Our expense overall is down versus last year. I want to spend a minute on a few of the expense drivers. We've been
investing at a higher level, both in organic capabilities like cognitive, security, cloud and blockchain, but also through
acquisitions. When we look at the acquisitions we've done over the last 12 months, this drove about five points of
expense growth. As we look at our investment levels, we want to allocate our skills to where we see the most
opportunity and growth. Some of our assets are high value, but not necessarily in growing markets. So we are licensing,
not selling, our intellectual property to partners who are allocating their skills to extend the value of these assets.
This quarter we signed three such agreements, resulting in a higher level of IP income. Licensing as a part of a broader
partnership to drive future innovation is a relatively new model for us. It allows us to retain and potentially grow the
revenue stream, while shifting our spending profile to a more variable cost structure. IP income is just one that way we
monetize our technology; sometimes selling our intellectual property, other times licensing IP.
The last thing I want to mention relative to expense is that we continue to have a year-to-year impact from currency,
not only from the translation, but also as we wrap on last year's hedging gains. This drove a three-point impact to
expense. So, while currency is a modest help to the top line, they continue to have a meaningful impact to our
year-to-year profit. Put it all together and our reported expense is better 2% versus last year.
Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing effective tax rate of 18% for the year, which is in line with the
expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year of 18%, plus or minus a couple of points. It also includes a
discreet benefit for closure of a foreign tax audit, which lowered the tax rate in the quarter by two points. From a cash
perspective, we generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and nearly $13 billion over the last 12 months.

This is over 100% of our GAAP net income, and over the same period we returned about two-thirds of our free cash
flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now turning to our segments. Our Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 5%, which is a sequential improvement from
the second quarter's rate. Our solutions software revenue was up 8%, while transaction processing software was down
2%. Analytics was a growth driver and we grew revenue on all spectrums of Watson. We saw strong SaaS
performance, with double-digit growth in revenue. Overall, gross margin was down due to the mix shift to SaaS and the
acquisition content. Our pre-tax income performance also reflects ongoing higher levels of investment in strategic
growth areas, like our Watson businesses.
Our analytics business, which is the largest portion of the solutions software portfolio, grew again in key areas, such as
information integration, big data, and Watson. Watson underpins our cognitive strategy, and continues to gain
momentum. Watson's Conversation service launched in July, provides developers a simple and easy entry into the next
generation of engagement. Through quick setup and tooling, developers without deep machine learning expertise can
leverage the science of Watson to develop engagement experiences across multiple channels.
We introduced our Watson Virtual Agent for customer service, building on our conversational capability to provide a
cognitive repeatable application trained for customer service. For example, we recently announced that the Royal Bank
of Scotland will begin using a Watson-powered chat bot for customer service. The chat bot will help seamlessly route
customer service requests through the correct channels and answer specific banking queries.
Turning to our vertical plays, we're focused on scaling our Watson Health business. We have over 7,000 employees and
target four major areas, life sciences, oncology, imaging, and value-based care. We launched new offerings such as
Watson for Drug Discovery, which is a cloud-based scalable platform that helps life science researchers discover new
disease pathways, new drug targets, and additional drug indications. We had several major client wins, including
UPMC and Best Doctors. And earlier this month, we announced a strategic alliance with Siemens to help healthcare
providers deliver value-based care to patients with chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer. With Siemens,
we'll focus on accelerating U.S. adoption of Watson's population health management offerings. Siemens will use the
Watson Health Cloud as its preferred global technology platform.
We've also been growing our geographic footprint, expanding into China, South Korea, Finland, and the United
Kingdom this quarter alone. Hospitals in both China and South Korea announced plans to adopt Watson for oncology.
And in Finland, we announced a partnership with the Finnish government that will utilize Watson cognitive computing
to help doctors improve the health of its citizens. Their vision is to build an open healthcare ecosystem based on
compliant and efficient utilization of healthcare data. So Finland will put their healthcare data on our Watson Health
Cloud.
When you think about an entire country entrusting us with its healthcare data, this should give you some perspective as
to how clients believe we have the right technology and consider us a trusted partner to drive healthcare innovation.
This builds on a similar announcement we made with the government of Italy earlier this year.
We also made great progress in Watson IoT. We opened our German location, where we will co-create with our clients.
We added new capabilities to our offerings, so now you can share IoT data from connected devices on a blockchain,
proactively identify potential security risks and protect devices, and tap the Watson IoT platform to develop new voice
interfaces for customers, all by leveraging these capabilities. IBM's leadership in IoT was recently highlighted by IDC.
We more than doubled the number of new clients on our IoT platform in the quarter, including Schaeffler and Thomas
Jefferson University Hospital. Schaeffler, one of the world's leading automotive and industrial suppliers based in
Germany, is using Watson IoT to transform its business from its supply chain through to manufacturing and sales. This
is a good example of how deeply embedded into our clients' businesses we are becoming, down to the ball bearings
themselves.
We are seeing exponential growth in both devices and developers, and now we're expanding our industry
differentiation and our reach with Watson Financial Services. As I mentioned last month, we announced plans to
acquire Promontory. Together, we will create cognitive solutions for risk and compliance.

Global Business Services delivered $4.2 billion of revenue, with a one-point improvement in growth trajectory from
last quarter. Our digital practices, which now make up more than half of GBS, were up double digits, with strong
growth in cloud, analytics, and mobile. Our cloud practice was up nearly 70% this quarter as we build and implement
digital strategies to move our clients to the cloud.
By line of business, we grew 2% in application management, driven by growth in our digital foundation and mobile
platforms. This was offset by a decline in consulting revenue, as some larger contracts wound down and clients
continue to move away from on-premise enterprise application work to new business models focused on digital and
cloud.
Enterprises are looking for new ways to reach their customers and empower their employees to make faster decisions.
We continue to see strong double-digit growth in our enterprise mobility solutions that are helping clients redesign
workflows with specific industry context. Our growing collection of MobileFirst for iOS applications are delivered on
the cloud and can connect back to their core systems and infrastructure. This is reinventing the way employees make
real-time decisions, by putting the power of the enterprise in their hands.
We continue to bring new customers onto the platform, including VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam,
RIMAC Insurance in Peru, and Amica Insurance here in the U.S. We also opened a new IBM MobileFirst Garage in
Bangalore, part of a network of centers that helps clients around the world achieve mobile-led digital transformations at
speed and at scale.
Turning to profit, GBS gross profit margin was down 90 basis points. We expanded margins in application
management as we mix to new cloud and digital platforms. And with the benefit from our workforce rebalancing
actions, we're driving productivity in our delivery model. Consulting gross profit margin was down, reflecting the
investments we're making to grow our digital practices. Also, there were some accounts that required additional
spending to deliver on important commitments. These dynamics are also reflected in our PTI margin.
We're continuing to shift the business, as we've added nearly 10,000 resources over the past year to our strategic
imperatives. The acquisitions we've done over the last year impact our near-term profit but add important capabilities,
like cloud consulting skills around Workday and salesforce.com. We've also expanded the IBM Interactive Experience
and our digital design capabilities. We're focused on integrating and scaling these new skills as we continue to expand
our digital practices.
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms delivered $8.7 billion of revenue and grew 1% year to year. Global
Technology Services again grew signings and backlog, and has now grown revenue for six consecutive quarters. As we
shift from systems integration to services integration, we continue to see momentum in our new offerings. Across the
segment, our strategic imperatives were up over 40%, with cloud up over 50% and the as-a-Service run rate up over
60%.
Looking at the lines of business, infrastructure services was up 2%, as our hybrid cloud strategy continues to resonate
with our clients. We provide enterprise-grade cloud solutions that are secure, agile, and leverage the data and
investment in their core systems. We continue to expand our cloud infrastructure, announcing the opening of new cloud
centers in South Korea and Norway this quarter. We now have 49 centers around the world, enabling low latency
connectivity to cloud infrastructure.
In moving to the cloud, our clients need be sure their data is secure. Those in regulated industries need to know where
their data is, and many need to keep it in-country. Our cloud infrastructure allows clients automatically to provision
virtual with bare metal servers, while meeting their data sovereignty and regulatory requirements.
At JFE Steel, one of the largest steel manufacturers in the world, we announced a five-year outsourcing agreement that
will migrate core systems to the IBM Cloud through a hybrid solution that will consolidate their infrastructure and
streamline business operations. This will allow the company to speed up systems development and services
deployment, strengthen IT governance, and reduce costs.

And last week, we announced a new Cloud Object Storage service that will enable clients to scale large unstructured
data volumes across hybrid cloud environments. Bitly has adopted this new object storage service to more quickly and
easily analyze data that's being produced by the more than 10 billion clicks it processes each month.
Looking at the software component of our hybrid cloud solutions, integration software grew 4%. We saw continued
strength in our Connect products that integrate applications, data and processes for on-premise and cloud environments.
We also grew in some of our mission-critical offerings, such as WebSphere Application Server. We continue to shift
more of our portfolio to an as-a-Service model through our Bluemix cloud platform, which continues to scale across a
broad catalog of high-value services, including cognitive, weather, Internet of Things, and blockchain APIs.
We continue to build our partnerships and ecosystems to help clients move to the IBM Cloud. Through our partnership
with VMware, nearly 1,000 clients have begun moving their VMware environments to the IBM Cloud, including
Marriott International, Clarient Global, and Monitise. We're helping organizations extend existing workloads to the
cloud in hours versus weeks or months.
Turning to profit, our gross margin for Technology Services & Cloud Platforms was about flat year-to-year. We
expanded margins in infrastructure services as we see the benefit from productivity actions we've taken and continue to
streamline our processes.
We're investing in our technology and using our cognitive capabilities to shift to a more automated delivery model to
improve performance and drive efficiencies. Our technical support services margin declined, driven by the mix to our
multi-vendor support offerings. Our PTI margin also reflects these dynamics as well as the continued investments we're
making to build out our cloud platforms.
Turning to our Systems segment, there are some important market shifts in this business, like spinning disk to flash, the
rising importance of the hyperscale data market, and new opportunities in blockchain. We're shifting our business,
delivering innovation in our offerings, and introducing significant new capabilities. As always, our performance in the
period is based on product cycle dynamics and portfolio transitions. And given where we are in the transitions in Power
and Storage and in product cycles more broadly, our revenue and profit is down after a strong 2015.
Our z Systems results reflect the product cycle dynamics. Seven quarters into the z13 cycle, revenue was down, while
margins continued to expand. We continue to add new clients to the platform and we are introducing new technologies,
like blockchain. We announced new services to make it easier to build and test blockchain networks in a secure
environment. As we build our blockchain platform, it's being engineered to run on multiple platforms, but it is
optimized for scale, security, and resilience on both the IBM mainframe and the IBM Cloud.
Our z Systems are well-suited for these new workloads due to its advanced security features that help protect data and
ensure the integrity of the overall blockchain networks. We're currently working with over 40 clients on pilot
blockchain use cases running on z. Our Power performance reflects both our performance in a declining UNIX market,
as well as our growth in a growing Linux market. While our margins were relatively stable at the high-end of Power,
mid and low-end margins were down, driving a decline in overall Power margins. We've been shifting our platform to
address Linux, and in the third quarter, Linux grew at a double-digit rate and faster than the market. It now comprises
over 15% of our Power revenue.
Supporting that is our success with HANA, where we're bringing in new clients and we're replicating this strategy with
others. This quarter we expanded our Linux-only server portfolio, leveraging OpenPOWER partnerships to deliver a
new high performance computing chip and system with NVIDIA GPU acceleration and new data optimized servers.
And our Power architecture had another win, this time for a major hyperscale data center with one of the world's largest
Internet providers based in China. And finally at the end of September, we introduced new Power mid-range and
high-end systems designed for hybrid cloud computing and flexible consumption models to transform on-premise IT to
the cloud. So in Power, we're shifting to Linux, while continuing to serve the high-value UNIX space, but this is a long
transition. In the near term, we're focused on stabilizing the margin base.
Storage hardware was down 9% this quarter, reflecting the ongoing shift in value towards software. Gross margin is
down, reflecting both volume and price pressure. The hardware decline was mainly driven by low-end and mid-range

traditional disk storage. Our high-end disk storage grew this quarter. All flash array revenue grew, as we have
expanded all-flash technology across our product portfolio. We recently rolled out new products and transitioned to a
full suite of flash offerings, making us competitively positioned.
And while not in our Systems segment, we also continue to see double-digit revenue growth in software-defined
storage. So across Systems, we're facing product cycle headwinds and some transitions in Power and Storage, while
continuing to deliver important technologies and capabilities to address cognitive and cloud.
So now let me wrap up the segment discussion with the performance of software across our segments. Our total
software revenue was $5.7 billion, up 3%. This is the third consecutive quarter of improvement in our software revenue
growth trajectory. We've got a broad software portfolio, from solutions that provide cognitive, analytics and security
solutions, to core transaction processing, to connecting on-prem data and processes to private and public cloud
environments. Our software is open, running on IBM and non-IBM environments.
From a business area perspective this quarter, we had solid growth in Cognitive Solutions and integration software,
while operating systems continued to be a drag, in line with the longer-term secular trend. Across software, software
annuity revenue was up mid-single-digits, led by our SaaS offerings. Acquisitions contributed to our SaaS growth, but
SaaS was up organically as well. Our transaction revenue declined mid-single-digits, which is a significant
improvement in the trajectory as compared to the last several quarters. As is typical in the third quarter, our
transactional software content was less than 20% of our software revenue. But remember, in the fourth quarter due to
seasonality, transactions represent a larger portion of the software revenue.
Moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $3.3 billion in cash from operations, excluding our
financing receivables. After $850 million of CapEx spend, we generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.
Through the first three quarters of the year, our free cash flow of $6.9 billion was a little lower than last year, with
lower tax payments largely offsetting the year-to-year operational performance. Through September, our CapEx
spending is consistent with last year.
As I mentioned earlier, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was over 100% of our GAAP net income. This
performance continues to support our expectation that we will deliver the high-end of the full year free cash flow
guidance range we provided earlier this year. This includes the expected cash payments related to the workforce
rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year, as well as the expected tax payments in the fourth quarter.
Looking at the uses of cash, so far this year we've invested nearly $5.5 billion in acquisitions. We've acquired 12
companies, the largest being the digital assets of The Weather Company and Truven Health Analytics. And in the last
nine months, we've returned $6.6 billion to shareholders, including nearly $4 billion in dividends and we bought back
almost 18 million shares. We ended September with just over 950 million shares outstanding and $3 billion remaining
in our buyback authorization.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended September with $10 billion in cash and $42.5 billion in total debt. About $26
billion of our debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at about
seven-to-one, and the portfolio remain strong at 51% investment-grade. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was about
54.5%, which is essentially unchanged from December and down about four points from a year ago. Our balance sheet
continues to be well-positioned to support our business over the long term.
As I said upfront, in an environment where there are lot of open questions, our business is showing a lot of stability.
That stability is driven by the kind of work we do for our clients. We are applying deep industry skills and innovative
technologies to change real business processes and outcomes. This supports our ability to invest to create new offerings
in markets and our ability to find new ways to monetize our intellectual property. In the third quarter, we made progress
across our business, with continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives, some moderation and declines in our
core businesses, remixing our skills, and adding new capabilities through organic investments, acquisitions and
partnerships.
You'll recall, in July we said we expected our second half EPS dynamics to be improved over the first, and we laid out
a half a dozen or so areas where we expected to drive that. Now based on our third quarter performance and our view of

the fourth, we'd say the second half improvement is pretty much in line with our view 90 days ago. While we may see a
little less improvement from software revenue mix, we're more successful in monetizing our software through IP
income.
So bringing it all together, and as we look at the full year, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.50 of operating
EPS and free cash flow at the high-end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year.
And so with that, we'll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts
at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from
multi-part questions.
So let's please open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may proceed with
your question.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. Martin, I have a hopefully straightforward clarification and then a question,
please. Just on the clarification, the year-over-year IP gains were about $340 million, or $0.30, and I appreciate that
you're licensing real software IP to get that. But how do we think about this as being sort of more one-off rather than
ongoing IP? And should we be thinking of IP income increasing on an ongoing basis? And similar, if you could just
clarify the tax rate. I had 14.2% as your tax rate. You talked about two points being helped from a discrete tax item.
Was there something else that was impacting the tax rate that appeared to get it down to, at least by my model,
something that's closer to 14%? So if you could clarify those two that would help.
And then the question is just around free cash flow and how to think about it. This year you're going to be at the very
high end of your range, probably free cash flow being 100% or more than 100% of GAAP net income. As we look
forward next year, given your guidance is typically lower than that, should we not be thinking about free cash flow
declining on an absolute basis in 2017?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Okay, I think I got them all, Toni. So we'll do the clarifications first, and we won't count
that as a multi-part question. We'll count that as a multi-part clarification, and then we'll talk about free cash flow, so a
couple things. On IP, and this is actually a really important point I think, Toni. Our IP income has been flat to down
over the last, say, three, four, five years, and we've been thinking about how do we continue to drive IP income. If you
look back – and I'm sure you have, by the way. You have all the data as well. If you look back 15 years ago, we had as
much as $1.7 billion of IP income. Now a lot of that was driven from the fact that we developed really good
semiconductor manufacturers and really good semiconductor manufacturer processing technology. And our ability to
license that technology drove a lot of income.
We've been thinking about how do we reinvigorate, if you will, the IP income business, and part of it is what you're
seeing now is we're realizing some of these. So the clarification that you asked about, is it about $340 million year to
year? Yes, that's right. That's about $340 million year to year. But more importantly, we are going to continue to drive
IP income. Now we got a good third quarter. On a year-to-date basis we're about $1.1 billion, so we're kind of flat. I
don't think that we have enough to set a new annual record when we look back at the $1.7 billion that we printed 15
years ago or so. But it is certainly a focus.

And keep in mind, I think that these are relationships that are long-term relationships. So, they're not all public. There's
a lot of our – some of our partners don't want to talk about what they're doing. Those that are public though, they're
multi, multiyear relationships where they can drive now some of the value that they see they can capture within the
marketplace. Again, we license it to them. We don't sell it to them. So we have an interest going forward as well and
can get some of the upside here. So this is a really – it's a terrific model. It's got a lot of legs. We see an opportunity for
this over the next few years to continue doing this. So I think that handles your clarification
On tax, the two points as you – your notes were right. Two points were from the discrete piece of it. And then we are –
our view of the year now, because of the mix of our business, has an operating ongoing effective rate of 18% plus or
minus, which is where we were at the beginning of the year. So it's really a view of where the mix of our businesses
looks for the rest of this year.
On free cash flow, your question, we have been running at a realization which is above our model. Now keep in mind,
we won a tax case earlier in the year, and that means we got our money back, so that was a pretty substantial inflow.
Though we also had some pretty substantial outflows in terms of our workforce rebalancing payments and things
through the year. So as we said in our guidance, we would expect to finish at the high end of the guidance. We said that
already 180 days ago. We still feel confident about our ability to generate cash.
As we start to look at next year, we don't see anything that fundamentally changes our realization from where we are in
our model. So our model, as you know, is in the 90%, so somewhere between 90% and 100% realization. And we don't
see anything – knowing again, everything we have now year-to-date plus what's coming in the fourth, we don't see
anything that would say our free cash flow realization is going to change. And so when we get through now the fourth,
and we see where we are for 2017 in 90 days, then we'll talk more about the absolutes. But we don't see anything in the
realization that's going to drive our realization to be anything other than, again, 90% to 100% for next year.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Okay. Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
And our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Thanks. Good afternoon. You didn't close any major acquisitions this quarter, and yet
Cognitive gross margins fell 400 basis points year on year, 200 basis points sequentially. Should we not expect to see
improving margins as the as-a-Service revenues scale on the fixed cost base of data centers?
And then, Martin, just connected to that, you mentioned that the one variance to your plan for the year is that the
software business margins aren't tracking to plan. Can you maybe touch on why that is? Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, so I'll address actually the second one first, Katy. So when we talked about first half
to second half and we laid out where we saw the business in the second half, one of those elements we had on that chart
last quarter was the idea of software mix and as-a-Service margins, and it would turn into a modest positive. And I
would say that's more neutral now.
So not a dramatic change, and it really has to do with the mix of business. We're getting the kind of growth rates we
would expect. You saw, third quarter we had software up 3%, which is an acceleration from the prior quarter. But it
really is that we're also seeing good momentum in our cloud platforms business. So it's really a mix statement that is
driving that as opposed to something happening within our software margins.
On the Cognitive margin component, the phenomenon you described is absolutely accurate. As we slow down those
investments, we'll see the as-a-Service margin scale. We're starting to see the as-a-Service business scale, but we still
see so much opportunity, we're going to keep driving the investments. And so we haven't gotten to that point yet where
the scale overtakes the investment levels in that as-a-Service business.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Katy. Can we go to the next question, please?

Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great, thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the transactional sales down 5% in the third quarter,
I'm curious if there's any good line of sight here into the fourth quarter and what you might expect there in relation to
what you saw in the third quarter. And maybe this is a stupid question, should we start to think about transactional sales
and IP income maybe together? I don't know if there's any correlation between the two in any way. Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Thanks, Tien-Tsin, so a couple things. The transactional business, as we noted, in the third
at down 5% was an improvement from where we were in the second. So it – we had reasonable transaction closing
rates. Now, the thing to keep in mind as we go into the fourth, it is a much bigger transactional quarter for us, and so
while we have what I would call a good opportunity pipeline, we've got now 85 days or 75 days to see how the
environment holds up, and that will obviously drive the fourth quarter and drive the full year.
When we look at – when I look at the revenue streams in the fourth, our annuity business, which, again, smaller piece
in the fourth, our annuity business has been growing pretty consistently quarter to quarter to quarter, and I would
expect that growth to continue into the fourth. That transactional business, which is, again, much larger, tends to get a
pretty good quarter-to-quarter sequential bump, if you will, about $1.5 billion. And based on our opportunity pool, we'd
say that that's – that looks about like what we'll get done in the fourth as well. But there's some uncertainty in the
environment. Here in the U.S. we've got an election to get through. But right now, I'd say that my line of sight into Q4
says the quarter-to-quarter impact in third to fourth is about $2.5 billion as we head – just for that transactional
business.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Sam, can we take the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. You talked quite a bit about Watson. You've been running many Watson
ads. I just wonder if you can give us any update from the Analyst Day on Watson. How much revenue are you
generating? The revenue you do generate, is it in the software or consulting buckets? Kind of relatively speaking, what
do you expect going forward? You mentioned, I think, four ways or five ways you were looking to monetize Watson at
that meeting. I guess, which ones are working? And you talked about it as a platform as well, and I wondered if you'd
consider running Watson on someone else's platform, like on AWS.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Okay. So, Steve, I'll start with the last question first, and the last answer to that question is
no. Watson runs on our cloud, and our technology and Watson will run on the IBM Cloud.
With regard to the progress we're seeing, we've talked a bit about – you've seen many of our announcements around
where Watson is showing up and the kind of work it's doing. All of that, as you know, gets reported within our strategic
imperatives, and all of it goes into the Cognitive Solutions space. That's where our Watson Health business is, that's
where our IoT business is, and that's where the Watson platform is. So I'd say that with the Cognitive Solutions
business, we talked about it in total at plus 5%. The sub-segment of that, where the Watson content shows up, which
we also provide, is up 8%. So good growth in that software solutions space.
But keep in mind that we're also building new markets here, and it's going to take some time for us to take the
technologies and the processes that we bought, for instance, in our Watson Health business, and now layer on the
Watson technologies to get the ramp in growth that we expect to get out of some of them. So, yes, good progress. Yes,
it's a long-term investment. And again, all within that Cognitive Solutions segment, and no, it's not going to run on
anything but the IBM Cloud.

Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is open.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Lou, we can't hear you. Are you on mute?
<Q - Louis Miscioscia>: Hello?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: There you are. Now we can hear you.
<Q - Louis Miscioscia>: Okay. Let's hope it's coming through okay. So on the software area, which was up 3%, maybe
can you go in there and just share with us what is organic? And would you say that we've actually gotten past the
flexible pricing situation that you've been obviously dealing with from a negative growth standpoint for a couple of
quarters, or actually maybe about over two years now?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: So a couple things, Lou, on organic. As you said, software up 3% and an acceleration
from where we were. Across IBM, the acquisition impact was about the same as it was last quarter, so about two points
across all of the businesses. Now, a lot of those businesses are software. So, obviously, an impact in software in the
quarter, but not dramatically different, again, from what we saw in the second.
We have – we continue to have good annuity content performance. Our annuity business continues to grow. The
phenomena that we've talked about, with regard to our largest customers, is still part of the discussion with every large
customer. It's a question of how do they best view the deployment of their licenses, how do they best view the use of
our technologies in order to make sure they're optimizing their own workloads and make sure they're optimizing the
projects they have going on.
One of the things – and an important thing to us is, are they – to make sure they're still using our software and are they
still, for instance, paying S&S and are they renewing that. And our renewal rates have stayed very high and very
consistent through the third quarter as well, and so we're confident that our software business has the right appeal, if
you will, to our clients, because they continue to use it, they continue to deploy it on any large customer bases. Any
large customer, the discussion could be a little bit different. But again, good software performance in the quarter. Some
benefit from acquisitions, but I would expect that our annuity base will continue to keep growing as well.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Lou. Sam, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: Yes, thank you. I have a quick clarification and a question as well. So, Martin, when you
alluded to sort of moving into this high transactional quarter in the fourth quarter, I think you alluded to about $2.5
billion sequential improvement quarter-on-quarter in that business. Is that the baseline that is needed to achieve this
$13.50 guidance? That's my clarification.
And for my question, if you think about sort of the unique one-time benefits in 2016, so you have tax, which was a big
driver for first quarter. I know you had associated investments. And then now you look in the third quarter, there's some
significant IP other income, and I appreciate your comments around the increasing nature and sustainability of this.
And I know you're not guiding yet to 2017, but conceptually, these elements make it seemingly tougher to grow
earnings in 2017, especially at a time when the pace of buybacks are moderating at sub-$1 billion for the last four
quarters and gross margins continue to compress. So maybe you can help us think through at a high level maybe some
puts and takes, and what potentially the positive drivers are offsetting some of these headwinds in 2017.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Wamsi. Again, the multi-part clarification with a question is an interesting approach.
So first on the revenue quarter to quarter, yes, so when we look at our third to fourth, as I said, we typically get about
$2.5 billion in transactional revenue in the quarter. And that's built into one of – I mean, we've got a lot of different –

Page 12 of 15
we have a lot of different scenarios on what the year might look like. But that is certainly the predominant, if you will,
scenario on how the fourth comes in.
On the view of 2017, which I'll come back to in a moment, again, I know you – and you said it – I think you did listen
to my answer on IP, but this is not a one-time thing, right? Again, IBM has had as much as $1.7 billion of IP in our
income statement. It is one of the ways we monetize all of our intellectual property. It's only one, right? We also
obviously sell a lot, too. But we license our IP as part of our business model. It is – I don't think about it as one-time.
We're going to continue to drive this and hopefully grow it. We've got a reasonable pool in the fourth of clients and
partners who want to license our technology. So you shouldn't think of it as one-time at all.
Now as we go into 2017, with our big transactional quarter coming up, obviously in 90 days we'll talk about what we
saw in the environment and what that positions us for 2017. But I do think we know a few things as we head into next
year already today. So we know, for instance, we've got good momentum in our strategic imperatives, and we continue
to see, with our investments and our view of the market, how that resonates with clients. And I think we would expect
to continue to see good strategic imperatives performance, which also, by the way, will drive some investments. But
keep in mind that, with everything we've got done this year, the bulk of the spending, the bulk of the investment dollars
we freed up next year, that's a much bigger number next year. So we have a freedom and an ability to invest more
heavily, given what we've gotten done so far this year. So that's one thing we know.
Secondly, we're seeing good signings and backlog performance in our GTS business. That was both signings and
backlog up again. And within the GTS business, the biggest part of that, our infrastructure services business, which
drives by the way that backlog, also expanded margins in the quarter. So that's a big deal for us, obviously. We also
saw expanding margins in our – in parts of our GBS business, in our application management business, again, as we
drive productivity.
So we know, again, good performance and momentum of strategic imperatives. We have good signings and backlog
growth in our GTS business, with margin expansion in some of our services businesses. And then at this point, we'll see
where currency winds up in the next 75 days. At this point, it's kind of neutral-ish, if you will. it's certainly not the $1
billion plus impact we took this year as we wrapped on all the hedging from last year. So it's far more neutral next year.
Now, at the same time, as you said, we don't have another tax case that we're going to close next year. But at the same
time, most of that was reinvested, if you will, or consumed elsewhere. It didn't show up in the bottom line. So, yes, too
soon to tell. We'll get through the fourth. We'll talk about it in 90 days when we see. But there's some – there's
momentum here in parts of this business that we'll be spending more time on.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - David Grossman>: Thank you. So, Martin, if we look at organic growth rate of the imperatives, it looks like it
began decelerating in the fourth quarter of last year and through the second quarter of this year. And then it looks, at
least if my math is right, they bounced back this quarter. And you did a good job of telegraphing that last year's growth
was not sustainable. That said, the number just seems to be a little bit more volatile than expected. Is there any way you
can help us parse this disclosure and just help us better understand what drove the deceleration and then what drove the
subsequent rebound this quarter?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. I think the best thing to do, David, is to look at all of this on a trailing 12-month
basis. We recently started giving this on a quarterly basis. It's a good disclosure in the sense that everyone's asked for it
and we tried to provide the components of our strategic imperatives within each of our new segments. And I think in
general, people appreciated having that level of detail.

But to your point, if you're looking for my advice on how best to interpret this, I'd interpret it on a 12-month trailing
basis. Our clients aren't making big, big investment decisions, like who do I trust with my data and what cloud am I
going to move onto. That's a decision that is going to last much longer than, say, a 90-day reporting cycle. So in any
given reporting cycle, there will be volatility. My advice, look at it on a trailing 12-month basis and you can see the
trend.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, David. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Hi, thank you very much. I also want to ask about Cognitive Solutions. You
mentioned that the rollout of SaaS, if you will, or Software-as-a-Service is impacting the margins. Yet it's still a very
small part of the total. It's perhaps 10% of the current revenue base. As that ramps, won't that continue to place pressure
on your margin structure? Or to say it in a different way, could you characterize if we look at 2017, would margins in
Cognitive Solutions be at a minimum flattish? How are you thinking about that?
And one clarification also, just did you mention what the total revenues in organic sources were, or was M&A about
two points of help this quarter as well?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: So in total, Keith, our acquisitions contributed about two points of growth, same as second
quarter.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Okay, yes.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: So on our Cognitive Solutions and our margins, so first, keep in mind, this is our highest
margin business. It is primarily software. And within that, it's got very heavy high-value content in the on-premise
category, if you will. And so these margins, which are very high, we want to and we're moving some of this business
and investing in the as-a-Service. So as that moves into the margin profile, the Cognitive Solutions, could it see a little
bit of margin pressure over the long term? Yes, but it's coming from a very, very high base. And the as-a-Service
component that's going in is still better margin than all of the other segments in general. So yes, the as-a-Service
component of Cognitive Solutions may have a bit of an impact just on that segment, but overall it will still help IBM.
And again, this is a very, very high margin segment at north of 80% here.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Keith. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you very much and, Martin, thanks for the explanation about the additional investments you're
doing that impacts gross margins. Can you help us understand incrementally going forward, so not, say, year over year,
but incrementally going forward, the efforts you've been doing this year, should we expect the same type, or
incrementally do you feel like you're going to have to incrementally do more investment forward, or just at this level?
Thank you very much.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. Sure, Jim. I'd say that given – one, yes, we will continue to invest. Do I think the
rate of growth of investment has to continue? The short answer is it may. But again, remember how much we got done
this year in terms of making room in the overall IBM equation and the productivity we're driving in parts of our
services business. As I noted, we're seeing margin expansion in some of those. So yes, we will continue to invest. And
in fact, I think some of these markets require this level – or the markets require this level of investment in order to be at
the leading edge with our clients. But we do make a lot more room, if you will, in the overall IBM equation, given
everything we got done this year. And we'll spend more time in 90 days on how all of that plays out for 2017. But

again, we've made a lot of room for investments for ourselves for next year.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thank you. Can we please take one last question?
Operator
Thank you. And our last question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks, glad I snuck in. I'll keep it to one clarification and one question. I guess the question
is, when I look at your free cash flow usage over the last four quarters, it's been more skewed towards acquisitions
versus what one would have thought in the past. As you look at 2017, do you think it optimizes more; i.e., buybacks
could be much more than the $1 billion run rate you guys are running at and acquisitions could be small? Just help us
understand the mix as you go forward.
And then just to clarify, when you talk about 90% to 100% conversion of net income to free cash flow in 2017, is that
off the GAAP or non-GAAP number?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, I'll do the clarification first, Amit. So that's our GAAP net income realization. We've
just kept it consistent in terms of GAAP net income. It was the most straightforward, we think, for everyone to
understand. So the free cash flow realization data is GAAP net income.
On how free cash flow skews next year and the application of our capital, I'd say first, you can be assured that we are
going put all of our money to work, as we have. We don't tend to – we don't keep capital here to the extent it's excess
after we've invested it organically and after we've purchased what we think we need to through acquisitions. And after
we've paid the dividend, we do return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchase. Over the long term, as
we've said now pretty consistently, we think over the long term we can reduce our share count by 2% to 3%, and that
obviously recognizes that we will continue to be acquisitive.
So I would say that, Amit, again, we'll talk more about what we have assumed when we get to 2017, but we will
absolutely continue to invest organically. We'll absolutely continue to be acquisitive. We'll absolutely continue to grow
the dividend. And then to the extent that we have excess capital to return, we will return it and over the long term that
number from a share repurchase would be 2% to 3% reduction.

So let me conclude by reminding you that we're running a highly differentiated play here. We're building, obviously,
cognitive capabilities well beyond what others are doing with individual AI services, if you will. And we're building
the platforms to help deliver that. And we're making all of that available on another platform, the IBM Cloud. And it
came up as you heard on the call, will Watson run on someone else's cloud? And no, it won't. It'll run on the IBM
Cloud. And we're doing all of that with deep industry expertise, and that's what our clients are looking for, that
cognitive capability on the IBM Cloud with deep industry expertise. And you can see that in our Health, you can see
that in our IoT, and you can see now in Financial Services, which we just announced a couple of weeks ago.
So we are very excited about what we're doing and we're very excited about the businesses we're building. And, of
course, we're very excited with the Health and what we're allowing and enabling our clients to become, which is
cognitive businesses. So as we do that, we'll continue to be deeply embedded in the fabric of how they run their
businesses in the most important work they do. They trust us with their data. They trust us to be their partner in
becoming cognitive businesses. And quite frankly, that's how we make sure that we're successful over the long term.
So thank you for joining our call today.
