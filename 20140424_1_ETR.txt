Thanks, Paula, and good morning everyone. By any objective measure, the first quarter of 2014 was extremely
successfully. Our operating groups provided excellent service to our customers under extreme conditions. Our
commercial groups continued to provide growth opportunities while aggressively managing risks. Our support
functions continued to evaluate and implement more standardized lower cost end-to-end business support processes
spanning multiple functions within the company. We continued our mission to support our communities through
assistance programs and our direct contributions and, as a result, we created value for all four stakeholder groups; our
customers, our owners, our employees, and our community.
This performance was achieved in both the Utility and in EWC and our financial performance followed suit, namely
operational earnings per share were more than double those of last year setting a new first quarter record and were
driven by top line growth and lower costs. This quarterly performance coupled with higher Northeast forward prices for
the next nine month let us to raise 2014 earnings guidance by more than 20%. To be clear, weather is not a strategy.
Colder than average temperatures for multiple stretches of time in the Northeast and in the four-state utility service
territory had a significant impact, but weather is just one part of what we think is a strong overall story. We must
perform day in and day out. To that end, our employees and equipment performed great this quarter.
Let me give you some highlights. Starting with EWC, our nuclear plants performed well overall to help serve increased
power needs due to increased demand in New York and New England over the past three months. To put this into
perspective, the weather in this region is measured by heating degree days was 11% colder than normal and 13% colder
than last year. As it relates to the EWC fleet operations, the EWC nuclear plants first quarter of 2014 forced loss rate
improved by nearly 60%, with the shortest refueling outage ever at the Indian Point site at 24 days.
We also successfully completed a refueling outage at the Palisades plant which took a total of 56 days. Our outage
performance would have been better. However, it took 15 days longer to make necessary and proactive replacements of
plant components following a planned inspection. Another planned activity during the Palisades refueling outage was
an inspection of the reactor vessel head in accordance with the revised NRC rulemaking on reactor vessel
embrittlement. The inspection went as planned and the results identified no discrepancies. We have a high confidence
that our analysis puts operation through the end of Palisades operating life and that the NRC will approve our submittal
reflecting just that.
As it relates to our point of view on our hedging strategy, while we certainly have been challenged with lower market
prices over the recent past due to lower natural gas prices and market design concerns, I believe we have been very
consistent in communicating our bullish point of view related to the Northeast market. This point of view was based on
our model-supported views surrounding undervalued forward heat rates generally due to a lack of liquidity, but there
are a few natural buyers and many more generators seeking to sell resulting in a larger discount than at time of delivery,
a robust winter demand picture for the Northeast region supporting natural gas prices and a constrained Northeast
infrastructure that offered asymmetric upside potential. While the severity of cold seen this past winter and the degree
of price upside that was realized exceeded our point of view, we were directionally prepared to benefit from it due to
our hedging practices.
A few years ago, we made adjustments to our hedging strategy to incorporate more financial products in part to protect
our hedge portfolio against certain risks that include operational and liquidity risks and also to position our portfolio for
asymmetric upside exposure in a cost-effective manner and to allow for more upside consistent with our bullish point
of view on power prices.
It is important to note that we continued to remain bullish in the intermediate term as it relates to our point of view on
Northeast gas and energy prices for the reasons I previously mentioned.
That said, I'd like to talk about longer-term market issues. We believe the Northeastern U.S. energy market face several
challenges which could lead to a repeat of the volatility experienced this past winter. Market design problems do not
support the continued operation of critical generating resources in the region, resulting in declining reserve margins
over time, a lack of fuel diversity in the region, and an overreliance on natural gas.

If we continue to see the Northeast power markets drive what should be economic units to retire prematurely and not
fairly reward generators for the attributes they provide including fuel supply diversity and reliability as well as
environmental benefits, what was a volatile outlier this winter and last, could become a recurring situation.
In addition, this year's winter exposed serious infrastructure limitation which constrained the operation of some
resources during periods of high demand. For example, there is simply not enough natural gas pipeline capacity in New
England to serve both heating demand and natural gas-fired power plants during the extreme cold. Concern over this
lack of pipeline in delivery systems in New England is shared by the Obama Administration. Earlier this week, U.S.
Secretary of Energy met with 150 state officials and industry executives, environmentalists, and others in New England
as part of a federal review of energy issues ordered by the President. The region is evaluating the situation, but any
solution whether new pipelines or gas by wire that is new transmission lines into New England from Canada or other
places will be difficult, expensive, and will take a considerable amount of time.
Whether any of these options deliver the most reasonably-priced power for consumers or meets regional environmental
price stability, economic growth and other objectives is unclear. We believe the markets today are not structured to
value these attributes. We are committed to constructively addressing these market issues with regulators and other
stakeholders and we are seeing signs of progress. For example, the downward slope in demand curve in New England's
next forward capacity market is a start. The sloping demand curve is important, because it values all resources not just
at the point of resource inadequacy. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered ISO New England to
have this in place by the next forward capacity auction. However, keep in mind, that price signal won't be realized until
mid-2018. In making exceptions for renewables as was proposed by ISO New England in its April filing with FERC
further undermines the efficient operation of the market.
Poor market design and continued interference with market mechanisms is what has led ISO New England to the place
they are today with declining market margins, inadequate resource diversity, and the risk of additional retirements in
the region. We will continue to constructively work with the stakeholders in New England to develop proposed market
designs changes.
In New York, we have also seen progress as it relates to improved market design, yet future challenges do remain. To
give the market proper pricing signals for locational capacity needs, the Lower Hudson Valley zone approved by FERC
will become effective next week. The summer strip auction covering the months of May through October cleared at
nearly $10 a kilowatt month. This summer and May monthly auctions cleared at similar levels. All in all, these pricing
data points demonstrate the need for capacity [ph] to supply (9:00) customers in this constrained zone of New York.
To summarize these operational hedging and market advocacy activities of the past three months, our focus on
advancing our EWC strategies of preserving optionality and managing risks. What has transpired illustrates ways the
portfolio has option value and we have the ability to capture that value both now and into the immediate future given
the realities of those markets. Realizing that requires the plants being online both now through solid operations and in
the future, including the license renewal of the Indian Point, a balanced hedging strategy tilted towards our point of
view, but maintaining adequate downside protection, and continued emphasis on changes in the market design so that
the reliability, fuel diversity, and environmental attributes provided by these units are both valued and compensated.
The Utility also performed well this quarter. Our performance in storm restoration illustrates our capability and
dedication when more than 13,000 employees, contractors and mutual-assistance workers responded to four ice storms
from January through March.
Our employees are not only storm tested, they are leaders in storm restoration and proactively keeping our customers
informed during outages as recognized by J.D. Power and Associates. It was unprecedented when our utilities were the
top five performers in proactive outage communications in J.D. Power's 2013 Electric Utility Residential Customer
Satisfaction Study, but we did it again, as reported earlier this month, in the 2014 study.
Also exemplifying our storm performance is the fact we earned, yet again, the Edison Electric Institute storm Recovery
and Assistance Awards for 2013. Entergy has earned EEI's Emergency Recovery Award or Emergency Assistance
Award every year for 16 consecutive years, the only utility in the country to do so.

Also during the quarter, our weather-adjustment sales growth was solid for our residential, commercial, and industrial
segments. For industrial customers, expansions make up one-third of the growth this quarter. This is not new. In fact, in
the last five years since 2008, we have seen over 50 expansions by our current industrial customers as well as a couple
of new major facilities.
Expansions during this time have driven an average industrial growth rate of nearly 2% per year. The factors driving
the economics of these historical expansion projects are similar to the factors we are projecting for new facilities in the
coming years, namely favorable domestic input energy prices against competitors and other countries, infrastructure
and regional benefits of consolidating and expanding in the Gulf South versus other parts of the country, and supportive
communities and constructive regulation.
The next phase in this regional industrial expansion has the potential for a significantly greater impact. That's what we
have been analyzing and preparing for this past year. We've identified around $65 billion of high potential projects
through 2019. Noteworthy developments include a ruling on the air permit for the new Big River Steel plant in
Arkansas that is expected tomorrow. If approved, construction could start this summer.
In Louisiana, an expansion of an existing steel mill began operation late last year and ramped up faster than expected
this quarter. In Mississippi, teams worked with local communities to qualify four large industrial sites in four counties.
We expect to complete this process by November 2014.
Finally, in Texas there was a groundbreaking to build the largest methanol production plant in the United States at a
cost of approximately $1 billion, which will bring in approximately 3,000 construction jobs and approximately 240
permanent jobs in the Beaumont area of our service territory. Some of these projects we have contracts to serve, others
we are working on.
The bottom line is for us to help bring these projects home to our communities. The economic impact from the direct
jobs, ancillary companies, and services, new customers, taxes and other resulting effects will benefit our business in the
long-term, even as it benefits our communities, customers, and employees in the short-term. That is why economic
development is central to our utility strategy and we are looking into all areas to support and promote it.
One example of how we can support economic development is in the regulatory arena. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana notified the Louisiana Public Service Commission this week that they will file a study in June
containing a preliminary analysis of the business combination of the two companies. This is a study we agreed to
complete in connection with the resolution of the company's rate cases. While we expect to learn more once we
complete the study, we anticipate that a larger company would be more nimble and efficient, benefiting our four key
stakeholders and simplifying the regulatory process for our regulators. The combination could improve financial
flexibility, helping to finance the Utility's investment required to serve new industrial customers and supporting the
state in bringing to Louisiana jobs and regional economic growth opportunities.
We continue to make progress on other regulatory agenda items in support of our utility strategy. In Texas, earlier this
month we filed a unanimous settlement in the rate case, allowing for an $18.5 million base rate increase and two
limited term riders to recover costs. The return on equity of 9.8% reflected in the settlement matches what was
authorized in the 2011, 2012 rate case. The settlement also sets baselines for future use of the purchase capacity costs,
distribution, and transmission riders. The unanimous settlement is now before the Public Utility Commission of Texas
and a decision is expected next month.
In Arkansas, the Commission took up our rehearing request for the 2013 rate case, including our request to review the
low authorized ROE and a financing formula for construction projects that do not fully compensate Entergy Arkansas
for its costs. The next steps are up to the Arkansas Public Service Commission, but we are cautiously optimistic that we
were able to explain our concerns about how the prior order hinders our shared objective of economic growth in the
state.
Again, to take a step back from the details this quarter, our utilities performed when needed most. We responded to
numerous storms while maintaining safe and reliable service. We saw strong retail sales growth including industrial
sales and we continued to make progress in our regulatory jurisdictions for constructive outcomes that align the

interests of our four stakeholders. It should not surprise you that industrial expansion in the Gulf region is one of the
topics we will explore on June 5 at our Analyst Day.
While we are actively preparing for our event, I wanted to give you a preview. On a macro basis, there are two things
trending in our favor: the industrial renaissance that is currently impacting our service territory and the market price of
power. We plan to explore with you why we are so optimistic about both of these market conditions and why they can
coexist. We can position ourselves to succeed when we recognize opportunities such as these. We are not simply
passive participants. We see that as a duty and a privilege, to have a role in bringing these benefits home to our
stakeholders.
So the second broad area we plan to cover on June 5 is what we are doing to capture these market opportunities. Our
goal is to give a better picture of our strategy and levers to not only meet but exceed your expectations. We know that
will be a tall order and this certainly won't all be solved in one day, but rest assured I and the entire executive
leadership team are committed to explaining our strategy and why we believe it can be successful, to providing a clear
roadmap of where we are headed and then most importantly to continue to mobilize the entire organization to deliver
on our commitments. The first quarter is the sample of what we know is possible.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew.
Andrew Marsh
Thank you, Leo, and good morning everyone. Today, I will review the financial results for the quarter as well as our
updated 2014 operational earnings guidance.
Starting with slide 2, our first quarter results for the current and prior years are shown on as-reported and an operational
basis. Operational earnings per share were a robust $2.29 for the first quarter of 2014 compared to $0.94 in 2013. The
significant increase was due largely to higher net revenue from EWC's Northeast nuclear fleet, while Utility net
revenue was higher as well. Operational earnings excluded special items from the decision to close Vermont Yankee
and HCM implementation.
Turning to operational results on slide three. Starting with Utility, operational earnings per share were $1.13. This was
$0.40 higher than the $0.73 earned in the first quarter of last year and there are a few key drivers that I'll highlight
starting with net revenue.
As reported in the pre-release, weather was positive in the current period compared to the mild temperatures in the first
quarter of last year.
In addition, positive weather-adjusted sales growth contributed about $0.05. On a weather-adjusted basis, billed sales
were 2.1% higher than the comparable period. The increase was consistent across the residential, commercial, and
industrial customer classes with industrial sales growth for the quarter at 2.5%.
Industrial gains were broadly spread across multiple segments. The net effect of regulatory actions was also a factor for
Utility net revenue, but was largely offset by other line items and therefore contributed only about $0.03 to the
quarterly earnings increase. The net revenue increases were partially offset by an unfavorable, unbilled revenue
variance of approximately $0.09 quarter-over-quarter. Besides net revenue, non-fuel O&M was also favorable
quarter-over-quarter, reflecting lower pension expense from a higher discount rate as well as last year's cost reduction
efforts which resulted in fewer employees and changes in benefit plans. When taking into account expense increases
and have designated net revenue recoveries such as storm reserves and energy efficiency program costs, the
quarter-over-quarter improvement was about $0.10.
Now moving on to EWC. EWC's operational earnings of $1.39 per share in the first quarter of this year was higher than
the $0.46 earned in the prior period. EWC results included an income tax benefit which resulted from a change in New
York state tax law. The change resulted in a onetime reduction in deferred taxes of approximately $21 million.

Turning to EWC EBITDA drivers on slide four, the $261 million increase was driven by higher realized wholesale
energy prices for EWC's Northeast nuclear assets.
The average realized price for EWC's nuclear fleet was $89 per megawatt hour. Leo mentioned that our hedging
strategy was part of the story for EWC's earnings this quarter. To add to that, I will simply remind you that we
maintained upside in many of our contracted hedges through protective calls to address operational and liquidity risks
in high-price environments like we experienced in the first quarter. This discipline actually reduces our overall risk
profile.
We view slide five for some time to illustrate how our contracting strategy provide asymmetric upside opportunity.
Note the positive slope to the line at higher prices illustrating the protective call strategy. Also included in net revenue
is certain mark-to-market activity which includes a range of items. In the first quarter of this year, mark-to-market
activity netted to approximately $21 million pre-tax which included the positive turnaround of the $45 million pre-tax
mark in the fourth quarter of 2013.
A natural question is whether or not this quarter could repeat next year and beyond. As Leo discussed, we analyzed and
prepared for longer-term fundamental changes. We don't rely on weather to achieve our goals but we do remain bullish
on our point of view of energy pricing in the Northeast market. We witnessed higher volatility in these markets the last
two winters and believe this will continue in the foreseeable future due to constrained Northeast infrastructure. Looking
forward to next year, should the same conditions repeat, we would expect to be able to again capitalize on the
optionality of our portfolio. However, note that we will not have the benefit of a largely unhedged Vermont Yankee
unit as we did this winter and our revenue opportunity will depend on the specific positions we have.
Recently, the cost of volatility has gone up and some products we used this winter are more expensive or are currently
not available from counterparties for next winter. We are constantly evaluating the EWC portfolio to determine which
product will best position us for 2015 by balancing cost and risk against our point of view. Nevertheless, if the same
market conditions were to prevail next year, we think we could experience up to 80% of the first quarter of 2014
EBITDA without changing our hedging philosophy. The bottom-line is that our portfolio going forward still has plenty
of price upside opportunity and embedded option value.
Now moving on to operating cash flow as shown on slide six. OCF was $767 million in the current quarter, up $223
million or more than 40% higher than 2013. Again, higher net revenue from EWC and Utility was the largest driver,
demonstrating that the high quality earnings we realized in the first quarter resulted in near term-cash flow.
I'll now turn to 2014 operational earnings guidance on slide seven. The strong first quarter results and increased
volatility in Northeast spot and forward power markets pushed our 2014 earnings expectations above our original
guidance range. Our revised operational earnings per share guidance range is $5.55 to $6.75.
Starting with Utility net revenue, there are a few drivers to note. First, we had $0.18 of positive weather that was
partially offset by an unbilled revenue as we noted earlier. Also, the outcome of some rate actions were different than
originally planned last October.
Looking forward, we still see 2014 Utility weather-adjusted retail sales on track to achieve the 1.9% growth we had
previously noted.
At EWC, based on realized prices to-date and forwards at March 31, net revenue is expected to be significantly higher
than we thought last October. Approximately, $0.90 per share was realized in the first quarter results and approximately
$0.45 per share is yet to come and still subject to market price variations. The revised midpoint also reflects the
combined negative $0.20 in O&M and other, which is largely driven by the expectations for opportunistic spending in
O&M, partly attributable to EWC's performance this year and partly attributable to the potential to accelerate projects
aimed at improving operational performance and reliability to benefit customers.
Looking at the opportunities available to us now, this number may be lower over the balance of the year at both Utility
and EWC. The higher expense is also net of the expected benefit from a higher pension discount rate.

Moving down the line, we currently see a higher effective income tax rate which reduced earnings $0.05 per share. The
overall variance is the net effect of changes in the two businesses. About half of the effective rate increase is simply
due to the application of statutory rates, the incremental pre-tax earnings causing the overall effective tax rate to rise.
At the same time, some of our expected Utility tax benefits are now more likely to fall into a future year.
On the Utility segment, I will also note that most of the changes are not fundamental to the underlying strength of the
business. And there is no change in our expectations in Utility earnings growth for 2016. Of course, we still may do
better in 2014. Overall, our guidance range reflects our expectations of earnings and volatility today. Despite all that
has happened, it's still early in the year and undoubtedly things will continue to evolve. We won't update the guidance
range for changes as they arise, unless we expect year-end operational results will likely end up outside the current
range. The first quarter of this year was a good beginning. We created real value for our stakeholders and highlighted
the optionality of EWC's business as well as the value of nuclear fuel diversity in the Northeast markets. During the
quarter, we've also seen encouraging signs for capacity auctions as well as improvements in forward power prices
beyond 2014, moving towards our long-term bullish point of view.
At the Utility, with much of the uncertainty from 2013 behind us, we're focused on positioning ourselves to take
advantage of the opportunities ahead.
In particular, the strong economic development pipeline beyond this year as seen in a new format on slide 11. As Leo
said, we will delve deeper into these and other opportunities at the upcoming Analyst Day. We look forward to seeing
you there and now the Entergy team is available for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take a question from Kit Konolige from BGC.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: So congratulations on a pretty amazing quarter.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: A couple of follow up items. So can you go into a little more detail on the increase in the O&M
spending is – if I understood it correctly, I took away that it's an opportunistic spend due to the improved revenues and
a sort of reinvestment, if you will. Are there particular segments or companies or projects that you're spending that
O&M in?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Thanks, Kit. Yeah, so, at EWC, that is certainly the case as well as the Utility. And so, at
EWC, part of that is paying people for the great performance that Leo talked about in the first quarter and part of it is
looking for opportunities to move projects forward, if those arise. The challenge associated with those, of course, is that
they are difficult projects to plan. It's not easy to move a lot of O&M forward like that and so we are getting an early
start on it. It's easier to pull back than it is to decide at the end of the year that you want to move a lot of O&M forward.
At the Utility, we're a little ahead in that same regard. It's something that's beneficial for customers in terms of rate
stability if we can offset some of the beneficial weather. And since it's still early in the year, we don't know that we'll
be able to actually have the opportunity at the Utility to do that and we'll certainly be looking at each company, because
not all utility companies will likely have that same opportunity. So – but that's what we're working on today. We're
preparing, we're trying to form up projects, and we're looking for those opportunities, but there is no guarantee that
we'll openly end up spending that O&M.

<Q - Kit Konolige>: Okay, thank you. And on a separate area, you mentioned that – if I heard it right that 80% of the
EBITDA in 2014 first quarter could recur in first quarter 2015 and that $0.90 a share of the increase in the guidance
range was due to the first quarter. And first, I just wanted to confirm that, that those were correct and I just want to try
to get an idea of how much of a, if you will, permanent baseline change there is here in the level of EPS and EBITDA
is that, that will recur in 2015 and forward. Obviously forward prices have gone up some and as you say volatility has
gone up and so on. If you can give us some idea of what we're looking at going forward, that would be a big help.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: I'll start with the math part and then I'll turn it over to Bill for the point of view discussion. So I
think the math that you had, Kit, was correct, but I'd put a bunch of caveats in there as well. So those are – it's 80%
under the same market conditions that we see next year in the first quarter and, yes, that is against the $0.90 increase,
plus the part that we already had built into guidance. So it's the overall EBITDA that I was talking about when you look
at it that way.
And so part of that is from the fact that Vermont Yankee is not going to be in our portfolio next year and part of that is,
as you said, forward prices have already moved up. So we do have some still open positions in our remaining portfolio.
They benefited from some of the price moves so far and so you get up above what Vermont Yankee's contribution was
this quarter, because some of our other positions have benefited from that early price rise. So with that, I think I'll
turn...
<A - Leo P. Denault>: This is Leo. Kit, let me just jump in to make sure – I want to make sure you get the right
specifics. The 80% Drew was talking about is if the same price volatility happens next first quarter that happened this
first quarter, we're positioned that we could capture that value. If you want to look at – when you were asking about
permanent, the slide we have in the deck on EBITDA, that's where the market is today and so you may not have been
thinking this, but I just want to make sure. We're not saying that we already have 80% of what we got this quarter, first
quarter next year. If the same thing happened, we're positioned to capture it, that's what Drew is trying to say.
[indiscernible] (32:45).
<Q - Kit Konolige>: The same market conditions, but not the same weather, obviously.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, Kit, whatever reason, it might happen because of weather. That'd probably be why it
would happen, would be because of weather.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: I get it, okay. It's basically just removing the Vermont Yankee impact?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: That and some of the price rise that we've already seen so far this year [indiscernible] (33:06)
prices have come up a little bit already.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Got it, got it. Very good.

Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Good morning guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Just a quick one on the, the slide 21 you're just alluding to, talking about the look at
market today and, obviously, you don't specify the numbers, but it seems from the movement in the 2015 number in
particular that it's probably up about $100 million of EBITDA outlook versus the prior version of this slide. I guess my
question is, you got 74% hedged. You now expect to realize $53 on that versus $49 before, which is a $4 uplift, and
then the market pricing slide is also a $4 uplift. And it seems four times your generation ought to be closer to $150
million than $100 million. So is there some offset? Does my math make any sense there? And is there some offset
embedded in there or are you embedding some conservatism about next year in particular?

<A - Andrew Marsh>: I'm not sure I followed all the way through on the last part, but I think it should all hold
together. I don't think there is any big offset built into the numbers that we're showing you there.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: But your hedged is up $4 and your open is up $4, you've got 35 terawatt hours, it just
doesn't seem that the bar is moving as much as it should by some reasonable margin?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Well, there is a bit of rounding in there as well, but we don't have any unplanned or hidden
offsets in there. We're showing you just the revenue uplift there.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. And then if I may, on this discussion you just had about the 80% and the 20% if we
had a repeat of this year's conditions next year. Can you be a bit more specific about what kinds of products that you
used this year are not available in the market for next year and just some more color on how you're adapting to changes
in available products in the market?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Sure, this is Bill. I think as we've explained previously, we use a variety of different
products. So some of that includes unit contingent, some of that includes cap collars and we use a variety of different
option structures both European, which clear on a forward basis versus Asian options, which clear more on a daily
basis. As you can appreciate, as the volatility in this market has increased, and if you look at daily volatility, for
example, from winter 2013 to winter 2014, we've probably seen a pickup of over 50% between 2014 and 2013.
Obviously, some folks who were willing to sell those products in the past have reconsidered their risk profile and so
right now they are not as willing to offer those products and so we have to readjust our portfolio to what's actually
available in the market to be able to capture that. However, as Drew said, we still believe we have the opportunity to
capture a significant portion of those upside, but it will be a different portfolio and there will be different prices
associated with the products available due to that increased volatility.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay, great. Thank you guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Thank you very much. I think I just want to better understand the changes that are taking
place in the Utility guidance for 2014. I guess the starting point would be, there's a $0.20 reduction in the midpoint, and
that includes the $0.18 of positive weather in the first quarter. So are we really looking at a delta here of $0.38? Is
that...?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Yeah, this is Drew, Paul. That's a good question. So, in the net revenue line, there is an offset
to that $0.18 in our unbilled revenue category and unbilled is something we don't normally talk about because it's
usually plus or minus right around zero. But this quarter it's a large number and it has to do with the estimates at the
end of each quarter that we make. And so it's really a holdover from the very end of 2013 when it was really cold, those
last couple of weeks in December. Those dollars have since gone into the billed revenue category and we're backing
them out of the unbilled category and you see the offset to the billed. So it's about, as I said, it's $0.09
quarter-over-quarter, it was about $0.10 between December and the first quarter of this year. So that's the biggest thing
in that net revenue line that you're probably not seeing completely there.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Right. So that – but in other words, if that's $0.09 out of what would be potentially $0.38,
what would be – or is it $0.09 out of what really is $0.20, that's what I'm trying to figure out, because don't I need to
add the...?

<A - Andrew Marsh>: If you're looking at $0.30, I think you're looking at a quarter-over-quarter versus the $5.20
midpoint is just for 2014.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Right.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: And so our expectations for 2014 from the net revenue perspective have been largely met,
except you would say plus $0.18 for weather, minus $0.10 for...
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Right.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: ...minus $0.10 for unbilled and then a little other noise in there to get you to that plus $0.05.
And then...
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Okay. But then that still leaves like $0.28. So in other words, I'm just trying to figure out
what's driving the $0.28 and whether we should look at that as potentially recurring items or non-recurring items? So -
<A - Andrew Marsh>: I'm not sure I'm following where you're getting the $0.28 from, I'm sorry. I think when we said
$0.28, it's plus $0.18 weather this quarter versus minus $0.10 first quarter of 2013. So there is a $0.28 weather delta
there. Is that what you're looking at?
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: No, I'm just taking the $0.20 change in the midpoint of the guidance, adding in the weather of
$0.18 and then subtracting out the $0.09 or the $0.10 that you gave before...
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Okay. So if you come down on the guidance table, maybe what you're seeing is there is a bit of
the opportunity spending and then the other part is the taxes piece; there were some tax items that we thought would
occur this year when we set guidance in October. It looks like those have pushed back a little bit, probably into 2015.
And so, that has moved out. We still think those things will happen; the timing has just changed on them. So those are
the – from the guidance table, those are the main drivers.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: And the opportunity spend and the taxes together would sort of represent the difference?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: And, because you also mentioned somewhere in there rate case outcomes?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Right, right and so that's a smaller piece that's in that net revenue line item. That's part of what
gets you down to the $0.05 and has more to do with the Arkansas rate case at the end of the year probably than
anything.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Okay. And still the expectation, so even with sort of – so, in other words, if the Arkansas
decision isn't reversed, you're still confident that you can come up with other offsets by 2016 to get to the same $950
billion utility net income number?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: That's correct, that's correct. And as Leo said, we're looking for ways to exceed that. So we feel
pretty good about where we are in terms of our 2016 number. Recall that doesn't include any tax benefits in it and we
have all the industrial renaissance and economic development opportunities in front of us. We think that's pretty safe
right now.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Thank you very much.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Thank you.

<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hi, good morning guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Just on the hedging strategy, just to make sure I understand this. In the ratable or kind of point
of view base that you guys are using, you didn't really increase hedge positions in the quarter. What is the thought
process for adding on in the out-years as we move through this year and what kind of percentage hedges do you want to
have maybe going in 2015?
<A - William M. Mohl>: I mean typically when we look at [ph] prompt year (42:42) we hedge 85% of that position.
So that's kind of the guidelines that we followed and we'll expect to continue to follow. Of course, this year, effectively,
we were a little less than that due to the fact of the uncertainty around VY and how long that unit would run and the
uncertainty around the CPG, but we would intend to be hedged in the 85% level.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And then with the MISO integration, having had a little more time with it and then some
of these issues that have come up between transfer between MISO Classic and MISO South. Can you maybe give a
little color on how you guys see that getting resolved? What impact that's had on maybe the value proposition of
joining MISO from what you guys originally anticipated? And is that going to have any bearing on potential CapEx
opportunities with the MISO transmission?
[indiscernible] (43:34 – 44:49)
<A>: Okay, great. The point I was making on the SPP, MISO issue for the company. SPP file the complaint at FERC
seeking to in essence to have FERC charge MISO for any excess capacity beyond the 1,000 megawatt limitation and
the tie-in between MISO North and the MISO South. The point being that we are in the initial stages of the litigation, if
you will, and we have not ruled out the possibility or likelihood of resolving that issue by the way of settlement, but if
we were to ultimately go to hearing and if SPP were to maintain their position, that's essentially what they're seeking to
limit that in the regional dispatch to 1,000 megawatts and to issue they have payments to SPP from MISO for any
megawatt beyond the 1,000 megawatt capacity. So the debate is really about that. We don't have a point of view on
how MISO would address it if FERC were to find that SPP's position was well founded, but again it's early in the
process and so we really don't know kind of how that plays out at the moment.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: If this were to not get resolved with this effect the value proposition of you guys joining MISO?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: No.

Next, we'll hear from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: I just wanted to first clarify how the LHV pricing came in relative to your expectation of a
$2 increase for the full-year, maybe just some color on that?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yeah. I think, as you know the LHV pricing came in for the summer strip rider a little bit
under $10 May auction, spot auction was around $12.25. So that's in excess of our original estimate.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Not by a whole lot.

<A - William M. Mohl>: No, no, I mean not significantly higher, but I mean it was a little bit higher than what we had
used as our kind of midpoint.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. It was real hard to tell, because the $2 like an average for the year, so if we were
thinking about this for summer strip, was it $1 or $2 or something like that above what you would have thought for
summer strip price.
<A - William M. Mohl>: It's less than, much less than $1 on [indiscernible] (47:43) basis.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. So, thus, any LHV pricing that's assumed in the EBITDA, a New York capacity
pricing assumed in the EBITDA charts that you have, should be pretty close, even though you didn't update for that. It
shouldn't be that different based on what came out?
<A - William M. Mohl>: No, that's right, it should be consistent with what came out.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay, one other question just on clarifying, kind of your point of view on New England and
the like? One could argue that there's obviously some pretty severe constraints. We also did seem to have some
relatively severe weather, maybe not as much just in New England, but like the kind of the whole regional area or
maybe the whole Northern part of the country. So when you're talking kind of the bullish point of view and keeping
your strategy the same, is it – in a normal winter weather situation, do you think there would be this much extreme or
still have kind of an extreme option value that things are that bad in New England at even normal weather you want to
keep a big option position?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yeah, I mean, here's the way we think about it is we've seen volatility in those markets in the
last two winters, okay, and this winter obviously was more severe than the winter of 2013, but nevertheless we saw
volatility. Now take into consideration for 2014, you've got Salem Harbor coming off, that's about 750 megawatts. VY
will be off in the first part of 2015. It will actually shutdown at the end of this year. And then you've got other units like
Brayton Point that will come off in 2017. So you're losing a substantial amount of resources over the next four to five
years. In fact if you look at their overall portfolio, you're going to lose about 4,000 megawatts which represents about
10% of their generation – over 10% of their generation capacity and reserve margins, obviously, have declined to the
point where FCA 8 resulted in a deficiency and you went to basically new billed prices for new resources. So there is a
lot of dynamics going on there, but we believe that there will continue to be constraints while there's a minimal amount
of new pipeline capacity coming on due to compression projects, that type of thing, we don't believe it's adequate to
replace the additional capacity that will be retired.

opening comments which sort of indicated substantial concern with the way the market is being structured and what
have you. And so, I guess to follow up on this. I mean I know what you guys are planning in terms of your filings and I
saw your Exelon and Entergy joint filing on the forward capacity 9, but is there a plan B, if in fact we don't get the
market structure that you guys contemplate or should we think basically that things are going in your direction and you
guys are cautiously optimistic and we're going be seeing this sort of process continue in the stakeholder process, what
have you, and see how it plays out, or is there perhaps another strategy you guys might be thinking about to get more
value for your generation plant?

<A - William M. Mohl>: Well, it gets to be a little bit complex, but let me lay this out. So we're working through the
stakeholder process both in New York and in New England and at FERC and we believe there's improvements to be
made in the capacity market design. We believe there's improvements to be made in the energy market design and we
also believe that there are opportunities for generators to be fairly compensated based on the actual attributes they
provide; for example, onsite fuel, zero carbon emissions, et cetera.
That is going to be a fairly lengthy process. We think we will see some immediate improvements, for example, on ISO
New England, with real-time energy pricing coming up by the end of this year. Leo mentioned the slope demand curve.
In the interim, as we have mentioned, we expect to see quite a bit of volatility in the markets just due to the constraints
themselves. And so when you say, is there a plan B, we're working all of those in parallel and we expect to see some
continued volatility until some of these market issues get resolved. And I think the polar vortex brought to the attention
of all the markets and to the regulators that we've got some structural design issues that need to be addressed.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Going back to forward capacity auction number 9, there is this new entry pricing
extension that's being proposed. And I was wondering if you have any thoughts – I mean obviously you guys are
against it. I understand that – but if you have any thoughts about what the impact might be if that provision stays in the
proposal that New England put forth.
<A - William M. Mohl>: Make sure I understand, are you talking about the exemption as it relates to the renewables
associated with that and the slope demand curve?
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Yeah, I was talking about the slope demand curve filing and the new entry pricing extension,
they're going to increase by 40% at least they're proposing from five to seven years for new entry pricing.
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right. And I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about what that impact might be or if
that's significant given the constraints you're talking about on the gas side or...?
<A - William M. Mohl>: I think our point of view is, we're not necessarily probably hung up on the five to seven
years. What has been the most challenging for us is that when the ISO has new capacity enter the market, they choose a
number of $7 a KW-month to provide existing generators. And so we believe, with the slope demand curve, that we
have the opportunity, depending on resource availability, to see additional upside probably somewhere – to $10 or $11
a KW-month once that slope demand curve gets put in place.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Regardless of these other market design issues such as the extension and the MOPR exemption
that you were discussing earlier. Even with those in place, you still think that that capacity price will probably get up
there? Is that right?
<A - William M. Mohl>: I mean obviously we're concerned about the exemptions, because it's another intervention
into what's referred to as the competitive market, but even with that we believe that there is some additional upside
from a capacity and pricing perspective.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Excellent. Thanks a lot.

those offer potentially more transmission spend than you've been currently contemplating?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Theo?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yes, Stephen, this is Theo. I guess when we talk about it, we would probably want to
answer the second part of your question, really more around customer class maybe somewhat. When we look at
residential and commercial, I think for the past few years we've expected what we saw last year, a dip in growth, that
being driven primarily by energy efficiency policies, primarily at the federal level, primarily around lighting.
And I think what you're seeing now in 2014 in the first quarter as compared to 2013 is really a return to what we had
probably seen on a simple average load growth 2010 through 2012 prior to 2013. And it's something we somewhat
anticipated post the dip we saw in 2013.
When you now talk about industrial and you talk about the industrial renaissance, we've talked about fairly extensively,
Leo mentioned on this call and we've talked about previously. As that growth shows up and it shows up to the extent
that we've embedded it within the context of our guidance numbers and to the extent it shows up even greater, yeah,
there is the opportunity for additional transmission investment to connect resources to that demand growth, to that load
growth.
We have, obviously, a transmission [ph] bill (57:35), we have within the context of our current construction plan
reflects the expectation we have relative to 2% to 2.5%, 2.25% sales growth but to the extent that that growth goes
beyond that, which again, given what we're seeing, we view as a possibility. There could be transmission to connect
those load pockets and we could see additional transmission spend associated with that.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Stephen, from a transmission point of view, obviously, the way to think about it is we've got a
plan, the construction plan of the $1.7 billion over the next three year period that would include, as Theo said, some of
the economic development activity we have in our plan for that timeframe, the 2% to 2.25% load growth. The
renaissance, the projects, the $65 billion that's been announced and that we were talking about that goes out to 2019 so
that's even farther. To the extent that we pick up more, as Theo mentioned, there is an increment that could show up
just in the base business. So you get the current run rate – if we get outsized growth on top of that outside growth, we
get more. But I guess the other two buckets also, obviously, [indiscernible] (58:55) the growth. When you look at the
FERC Order 1000 issue [ph] MEP, MVP (58:58) projects that's out there as well that we would anticipate participating
in it at some level, certainly within our service territory and then there is that opportunity outside of it too, which we
certainly are going to consider what we do there as well.
So the transmission part of the business is actually more complicated and more interesting because of it given those
different buckets that are all pretty robust at this moment, the normal load growth in and of itself is pretty good based
on what we've already got line of sight on. The incremental piece on that could make that even better if we're
successful in our strategy to attract and serve that load. And then we've got these other two buckets that we're
evaluating and certainly we're going to have to make sure we do everything we can to do the right thing for our
customers and work with our regulators on how you would all work through that, but that's an extremely interesting
part of the business for us right now that we get to work through.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: That's very helpful. And I just had a very quick factual question just on the EWC business. I
assumed that the forecast still includes the DOE nuclear waste disposal fee, is that correct?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Yes. Well, Stephen, there is, as you know, the possibility that that might not be in there. We
sort of factored that into our midpoint at $6.15. If it comes in or I should say it goes away sometime in June, it would
be about $0.08.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Understood, but in the out-year EBITDA number you're still assuming that you still pay that
fee.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: That's correct.
