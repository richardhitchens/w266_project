I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group,
Stephen Hemsley.
Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we will review our 2014 third quarter and nine
months financial results, results which have been consistently in line with or ahead of the outlook we shared with you
nearly a year ago. We're seeing steady progress across our businesses and over the next two years expect our overall
business performance to further strengthen and accelerate in both top and bottom line growth.
Our top line performance this quarter suggests an improving environment for our offerings, combined with steady
consistent execution. Revenue grew 7% year over year, led by growth in senior and public sector benefits and across
Optum's portfolio of health services. Consistent execution is evident in our performance in managing medical and
operating costs, successful state Medicaid expansion, moderately improving Medicare Star Ratings and the value
clients are realizing in Optum's provider, payer and government markets. And all of this is in the face of unprecedented
healthcare reform across the United States.
Our third quarter revenues were $32.8 billion and earnings per share grew 7% to $1.63 per share. UnitedHealthcare
results clearly strengthened, with Optum again contributing 30% of our enterprise-wide operating earnings. Operating
cash flows of $3.2 billion were exceptional at twice our net income level, despite remitting $1.3 billion in federal ACA
taxes during this quarter.
This morning, we are affirming our 2014 revenue outlook of $130 billion and raising our net earnings projection to a
range of $5.60 to $5.65 per share. As always, our goal is to perform to the upper end of our range.
We remain focused on executing a deliberate quality and cost agenda because improving healthcare quality and
affordability is core to delivering value at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. On any given day, we average 27,000
members in the hospital and another 14,000 at skilled nursing facilities. We have nearly 2,000 clinicians across the
nation, working with attending physicians to help keep our members on course for optimal medical outcomes,
successful discharges, and to avoid unnecessary re-admissions.
Optum expects to perform 1 million Medicare house calls and home visits this year to engage our members, understand
their health status and needs, close gaps in care and advanced clinical care paths and services.
Over the past five years, our commitment to affordable quality care has become ever more integrated, targeted, and
refined. Modern plan designs harness greater patient responsibility with online tools and consumer engagement
services that help people make better choices and decisions to get the right care at the right facility for the right cost.
We serve nearly 6 million people in consumer-directed health plans, up from 2.9 million people just five years ago.
And these consumers have set aside $2.7 billion in healthcare funding through health banking and investment accounts
with Optum. These consumers and those in similar consumer-centric programs are motivated to engage and make the
best choices about their health and healthcare.
Consumer engagement includes making quality and pricing transparency tools available right at people's fingertips,
right on their smartphones. These tools tap into our Premium designation quality networks, a commercial benefits
program we began in 2004 that now helps link people to nearly 120,000 network doctors recognized for consistent,
superior quality and efficiency. These doctors practice in clinical areas that generate more than 80% of our consumers'
medical cost experience and their results are consistently outstanding.
Our Premium cardiac physicians have 28% fewer repeat procedures and a 29% lower complication rate for implantable
cardiac device surgeries. Our Premium orthopedic surgeons have 41% fewer repeat procedures and a 17% lower
complication rate for knee surgeries. There are more examples like these demonstrating that getting an engaged
consumer to the right doctor makes a meaningful difference.

Our commitment to affordability extends to the care delivery side. Value-based contracting has become foundational to
UnitedHealthcare today. Contracts that align care provider incentives around healthcare quality outcomes, appropriate
use of services, and total cost of care. Our contracts with value-based medical spend now total nearly $35 billion per
year, up from less than $13 billion just three years ago, and on a path to $65 billion by 2018 if not sooner.
The modern health system is being shaped around aligned incentives, supported by transparent information and
consistently high-quality clinical services. These changes are helping our nation in turn to achieve optimal
evidence-based utilization and cost. We are among the leaders shaping this next generation healthcare system with
Optum working hand in glove with care providers in local markets, helping them improve consistency, quality, and cost
structures so they can preserve and grow their patient bases as their market shifts to performance-based revenues.
The progress is apparent in UnitedHealthcare's year-by-year decrease in hospitalizations per member in every major
product category, including in 2014. Over the past six years, UnitedHealthcare has realized a cumulative 26% reduction
in inpatient use per Medicare member, and a 16% reduction in inpatient use per commercial member, while continuing
to improve overall quality of care.
To begin a brief but more detailed discussion of third quarter results, we'll start today with UnitedHealthcare. Third
quarter revenues grew 6% year-over-year, exceeding $30 billion. UnitedHealthcare earned more than $2 billion in the
quarter, driven by overall revenue growth and an efficient operating margin of 6.8%, even considering the growing mix
toward lower margin public and senior sector customers.
Third quarter was again led by Community & State where we grew to serve 250,000 more people. We are now on
course to grow by just under 1 million new Medicaid members this year. This record level of organic growth is well
balanced with about 60% from health reform market expansions and 40% from an established states under new
programs that complement established approaches as well as natural growth within the traditional programs.
And Medicare continues to be a growth contributor as we approach organic growth of 500,000 people across all
products in 2014, a strong and consistent outcome in a year where we took necessary steps that caused some
membership losses to position our Medicare Advantage products for future growth and to benefit seniors in the years
ahead.
Today, we have a more focused and aligned network supporting Medicare Advantage, a Part D program qualified to
serve low income seniors in 97% of the markets nationally for 2015, and a rising Star quality that will continue to
advance. For the 2015 payment year, we expect more than 37% of our MA members to be in plans rated 4 stars or
higher. We expect a similar percentage in 2016 and sharply improved performance in 2017 and 2018, based on efforts
launched earlier this year and establishing themselves across our markets.
The open enrollment season began yesterday, we believe our products are well positioned locally, our sales and
marketing resources are properly staged and supported, and we expect solid growth in our Medicare Advantage, our
Part D, and Medicare Supplement offerings in 2015.
In the commercial markets, we remain focused on pricing discipline relative to cost trends, balancing margin and
market positioning, all with an eye towards consistency and sustainability for both customers and consumers. The
multi-quarter decline in risk-based enrollment has slowed. And the modest decrease in self-funded products were due
to employment attrition. In the individual market, we remain on course to participate in nearly two dozen state
exchanges in 2015, consistent with our original public exchange strategy.
In Brazil, pricing increases reflect new baseline costs in delivering expanded, mandated healthcare benefits, leading to
a conscious reduction in membership this year. Despite this decline, Amil's revenues were strong in the third quarter,
with international revenues increasing 19% year over year.
Turning back to medical costs. Our third quarter commercial care ratio was 79.1%. The consolidated care ratio was
79.7%, a decrease of 90 basis points over last year's third quarter. Earnings were strengthened by continued favorable
reserve development across the business, as our affordability initiatives continued to perform well.

Moving to our healthcare services platform. Optum's third quarter included a healthy balance of growth, earnings
performance, and focused strategic market activity. Through the first nine months, Optum revenues have grown 26%,
and earnings from operations by 24%. We believe the fourth quarter will be strong for this platform, and Optum
remains on pace to contribute roughly one-third of UnitedHealth Group's 2014 cash flows from operations, all while
investing significantly in future growth.
In the third quarter, Optum's revenues grew 21% year-over-year to $12 billion. Earnings from operations grew 27%
year-over-year to $865 million. Operating margins rose a full percentage point from the second quarter and 30 basis
points year-over-year to 7.2%. OptumRx led this quarter's results. Revenues grew 27%. Earnings from operations grew
65% to $326 million. And operating margins were above 4%, improving 0.5 point since the June quarter and 1
percentage point year-over-year.
The market is responding to the value of synchronized pharmacy and medical benefits where OptumRx uses data,
technology and an integrated service model to address the total medical experience and related costs, rather than solely
the pharmacy silo. We have seen a number of new opportunities with employers for 2015, and we believe we have been
awarded more than our fair share of that new business. This growth has added to the growth that flows naturally from
the businesses of UnitedHealthcare each year.
OptumInsight's growth was led by Optum360 revenue management and government exchange services. We continue to
deliver services in the development and operation of federal and state healthcare exchanges, and look forward to
continuing to leverage Optum's expertise to serve our government partners in this important work. With the passing of
this quarter, we have fully cycled through last October's regulatory pullback in hospital clinical compliance services.
To put the magnitude of this pullback in perspective, OptumInsight's underlying operating earnings growth would have
been more than 15 percentage points higher than the 6 percentage point growth we reported this quarter, which only
highlights the strength and momentum of the diversified product offerings we offer in this segment, including a
commercial version of our hospital clinical compliance capabilities that is gaining traction with hospitals in the market
and is becoming a future growth driver.
In our position as a valued service provider to hospitals further advanced with the recent acquisition of the
MedSynergies organization. MedSynergies has deep expertise in revenue management for hospital employed
physicians and medical groups. Connecting MedSynergies with our Optum360 inpatient focus creates an end-to-end
revenue management offering for large, sophisticated integrated care delivery systems. Coupling these with Optum's
clinical software, analytics and workflow tools gives us a comprehensive and market-leading solution to serve delivery
systems, covering both administrative and clinical domains across the full continuum of care settings.
Within our Optum's analytics businesses, we expect to end the year with more than 50 million lives of longitudinal
clinical data, up 50% in a year, and easily one of the largest such resources in the country, if not the largest; and it
supplements our 155 million-person administrative claims data repository. Increasingly, we are harnessing this
sophisticated data resource for advanced analytics across multiple platforms to meet growing market needs around
managing the health of populations.
OptumHealth reported an 11% operating margin in the third quarter, with earnings from operations up 16%
year-over-year. These results were led by our collaborative care businesses. Today, Optum touches two million
consumers through our collaborative care physicians and clinical professionals who are prominent leaders in their local
markets, recognized for clinical quality.
As our medical groups transition to Optum technology, we further improve their execution on behalf of the patients and
payers they serve, help grow their business, and generate superior financial returns. More broadly, within
OptumHealth, we look to meaningfully improve clinical outcomes and patient well-being across multiple settings:
outpatient, within institutions, and in the home.
We expect Optum overall revenues to be at the upper end or perhaps above our target of $45 billion to $46 billion, with
earnings from operations near the upper end of our previous outlook of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. Optum's future
growth should continue to be strong, supported by our $7.7 billion contract revenue backlog and exceptional levels of

customer pipeline activity.
To summarize, 2014 performance remains consistently strong through the first nine months, particularly considering
the ACA headwinds this year. Revenues have grown year-over-year by 6%. We have increased our full year net
earnings outlook to a range of $5.60 to $5.65 per share. And this earnings outlook accommodates expected fourth
quarter seasonality, strong Optum performance to close the year and fourth quarter investments in growth, including
strong Medicare Advantage marketing and the launch of our individual products on health exchanges in 19 new states.
We expect 2014 cash flows from operations will be around $8 billion, possibly more. Our growing earnings capacity
this year positions us well for 2015.
At this distance, I would offer that the consensus earnings estimates for next year do a pretty good job of calibrating our
2015 outlook, reflecting the combination of opportunities we expect to pursue and the challenges we expect to manage.
We remain fully committed to consistent fundamental execution with the objective of realizing as much of our true
potential as possible in every endeavor. We will provide details of our 2015 outlook at our Investor Conference on
December 2 in the context of our long-term strategy and our opportunity to serve people and to build value.
So now I'll turn this call back to our moderator for your questions. And I would ask this morning that we limit our
questions to one a piece. So thank you very much. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Justin Lake of
JPMorgan.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Thanks. Good morning. My question's on the commercial business. First, can you talk about your
early view on exchange positioning in terms of products and price rolled to the peers and how we should think about
profit targets here, given the losses in 2014 that we see across the industry? And then just a quick comment on New
York Small Group and how we should think about it for 2015, given the pushback on pricing you're seeing from
regulators? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Okay, Justin, we'll respond to your two-part question. I'll offer some perspective that we
are trying to participate thoughtfully in exchanges, and have not – don't have – have not built excessive expectations on
that. I think Jeff will talk to exchanges and then maybe to New York.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Sure. Morning, Justin. It's Jeff Alter. So on your first question, or your first part of your single
question on public exchanges, I would say it's keeping with our strategy that we waited to see what was going on in
2014 and then are using that knowledge. [ph] You've (18:59) built a different platform for exchanges. So when you
think about where our products are positioned, many of those products come with a network construct that's probably
nontraditional to what you might expect from UnitedHealthcare.
We feel good about where we're positioned. We are targeting profitability in 2015 probably a little bit lower than that
3% to 5% long-term range that we've talked about, but still profitable. And from what we know today, we feel pretty
good about where we're positioned in many of the exchanges, particularly the larger states where we expect to grow the
most.
New York, I would say nothing's changed much in New York from the competitive environment that we're in the
middle of this year. The rate approval actions by the regulator pretty much give us, for the most part, the same
competitive marketplace in New York for 2015 that we have today. We're fortunate to have a broad portfolio, fully
insured business across the country and we're managing through some of those regulator responses right now.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Yes. Thank you. Maybe I could ask about Medicare Advantage, if you could just – I
realize you'll go into detail at the December 2 Investor Day, but maybe you can just talk to the scope of the benefit
changes that you made, and if you can characterize how they look to you at your initial look versus what the
competition has put out. And maybe directionally, if you think you'll be able to grow membership and earnings next
year?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, I think we feel pretty good about it. Steve, you want to comment?
<A - Steven Nelson>: Sure. Hi, Matt. Steve Nelson. Yeah, we really like our position going into 2015. Benefits shaped
up about as we expected. We think we're positioned very well to grow in 2015 meaningfully at sustainable margins. I'll
just offer, we did add premiums, which was an important step to the long-term viability of this product, but we are very
thoughtful about that. We added premiums in markets where premiums already existed, and we added to about
one-third of our members.
In a third of those cases, we added zero premium alternatives. In places where we didn't do that, we enhanced our
benefits in meaningful ways that we knew based on our research would be important to seniors. So we feel very
positive one day into open enrollment, and we expect to grow meaningfully at sustainable margins.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Okay. And the earnings growth? Sorry.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, we expect to grow earnings across the board for 2015. Actually, we think all of our
businesses are really better positioned than they were as we entered into 2014, and really, the underpinnings of our
2015 outlook, obviously they – different contributions, but we're expecting growth really across all our businesses.
Next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Peter H. Costa>: Can you talk about your expectations for cost trends going into the end of the year? And then to
next year, how you expect to be pricing for that cost trend for next year in the commercial side of the business?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I think Dan Schumacher will respond to this.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Good morning, Peter. Thank you for the question. On the medical cost side, I'd tell you in the
quarter, we were very pleased with our performance in the quarter, both in aggregate as well as across each of our
businesses. And frankly, it was a little bit better than we expected, and you can see that in the care ratios. You can see it
in a little stronger prior period development relative to the last couple of quarters. Each year, we set a trend expectation
respectful, mindful of underlying medical costs and then we endeavor to outperform it. And we have strong medical
cost management disciplines that we apply, and you're seeing us outperform that this year.
As you look at our full year commercial cost trend for 2014, we expect to perform at the low end of our range of 6%,
plus or minus 50 basis points, possibly a little bit better. As you look into next year on the cost side, we expect similar
themes, and we'll go through the specifics of that with you at the Investor Conference. But certainly, a major
component of that will be unit costs, as it is every year. It represents anywhere from two-thirds to three-quarters of the
underlying cost trend, and that's something that is founded on negotiations that are happening each day, every day. So
we've got very good line of sight on that.
With respect to pricing, I'd ask Jeff Alter to comment on that.

<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning, Peter. We've had a very successful long-term pricing discipline, so nothing's changed
in our philosophy. We continue, as Dan mentioned, to be very mindful of cost trend. It's the number one driver of our
premium, and we've got a lot of programs in place to outperform those medical forecasts. So that's a big underlyer. And
there's a lot of other things that make up the price: provider network, product attributes, business mix, but we're not
changing our discipline. It's been very successful for us, and we expect it to continue to be very successful for us into
the future.
<Q - Peter H. Costa>: Just to clarify, are you guys saying that you expect cost trend to be the same next year as it was
this year or are you just saying that similar to this year?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Similar [ph] themes (25:02).
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, Peter, similar in approach. We tend to view our costs as we enter the year. We tend
to endeavor to outperform them. We continue to see medical cost trends and inflation going forward and we position
ourselves and price accordingly. All of that is completely consistent with the way we have approached the business for
the last several years, no different, and we don't plan on changing that in 2015.
<A - John S. Penshorn>: Peter, it's John Penshorn. We'll be fully detailed on this on December 2. We're really not
trying to walk through 2015 today, so I think we'll be able to fully answer that question here in just a few weeks.

Our next question comes from Christine Arnold of Cowen.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Morning. Thanks for the question. You've had great growth in Medicaid and David
suggests that the expansion population's pretty young and healthy. Could you speak to where your Medicaid book of
business is coming in this year and your expectations for next year with respect to that book?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yes. Austin, do you want to comment?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Sure. Thanks for the question. Well, first of all, we're very pleased with the growth. We are
honored to have the opportunity to work with this new population; help them guide through the healthcare system. We
expected higher utilization in the expansion population. In almost every case, we got paid for that higher expectation of
cost and that's what we've seen. So we expect long term for the population to perform in that 3% to 5% margin and are
very confident about the continued growth.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: And what do the rates look like for that population next year and the profitability for that
book, directionally?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Sure. Again, we expect the rates will be appropriate for the population and support
long-term sustainability. We work hand-in-hand with our states across all the markets to ensure that, on an ongoing
basis, that that's the case. And everything seems to be showing up as we expected.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And we have long [ph] stead (27:14) that margin ranges for those businesses are in the 3%
to 5% zone, and that's kind of how they're playing out.
Thank you. Next question.

<Q - David Windley>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, slightly nearer term question. If I look at the ranges and
point estimates that you've given on factors like your medical cost ratio for 2014, operating costs at kind of 16.7% and
even, to a lesser import, your tax rate, it would seem that one or more of those would need to trend below what you've
most recently said to get to your guidance range. I'm wondering which of those I should focus on as performing better,
if you can elaborate please?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: My reaction to that question is, I would stand back and look at the totality of the business.
If you take a look at the spectrum of UnitedHealth Group, and that's who we are speaking to, you have continued
performance of the Optum business; we have a very strong Medicaid business, in terms of its growth. We have an
international business that we think will make a meaningful contribution going into next year. We have been
historically very strong in our operating cost disciplines, and have structured those programs across the expanse of our
businesses. I think we have nice momentum coming in our Medicare business and our commercial business. So I
wouldn't lay it out to one factor, or try to basically triangulate on a ratio that, really, when you have a business as
diversified and as expansive as this one. So that's why I think that that's perhaps the perspective you should look at into
2015.

Our next question comes from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities.
<Q - Sarah James>: Thank you. Optum's always been a source of growth, but this quarter, it really seemed to stand
out, particularly in growth in the external revenue for OptumInsight, as well as improvements in the OptumRx margins.
I know you touched on it briefly in the prepared, but I was hoping you could dig in a little bit further and talk about
some of the programs you have in place driving that, and how we should think about the potential of continued
improvements there?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We'd be pleased to. Larry, can you start that off?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Hi, Sarah. It's Larry Renfro. Let me break it into three areas, and I think we'll get – as John
has said many times, we'll get more into detail about this at the Investor Conference, but this might help you get ready
for the Investor Conference. Obviously last year, at the previous Investor Conference and into this year, we've been
talking about investing in the future, especially in OptumHealth and in OptumInsight. We had that all planned and
we've absorbed, obviously the impact, and all of our financials are in line as we continue to finish off the investment for
the development in these new programs.
I think in the third quarter, you saw that OptumHealth went to a 14% top line growth and 16% bottom line growth
year-over-year, you also saw that the OptumInsight went 4% up on the top line and 6% up on the bottom line. So what
you're starting to see is what we said would happen during the year, that our investments are starting to tail off and as a
result, really, our outcomes are starting to kick in. So we believe that that'll create a strong fourth quarter, as Steve
referenced in his remarks.
The second part of this answer is that we're obviously going after 10 large accounts that we have identified that we
would do by 2016. We have probably as many sales metrics as we do financial metrics in Optum, so we are in line with
all those sales metrics as we go forward.
I'd say too that you might want to look at, that would really tell you something, would be our backlog. That backlog is
at $7.7 billion, up 21% year over year, and our sales pipeline, that's up 166% year-over-year. So that's the second part
of the answer.
The third part on the growth would be the five areas of focus that we're really concentrating on now, and this will be in
the future as well, that's medical groups, Optum360, the PBM, international, and the government business. So, I think

that if you kind of go back to the question you asked, I think we're pretty well positioned for growth and we're pretty
much hitting on all these programs.
<Q - Sarah James>: Got it. And just to follow up, the margin improvement in OptumRx, should we think about this as
being the new bar for that segment, or is there further upside from this?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: OptumRx had a great quarter. And I think if you go back to what we were talking about a few
minutes ago in terms of investing in the future, that's what we did a couple of years ago when we built the platform and
started the process of moving the business in-house. That's been a great move on our part. What I would say is, what
the margin really does is validate the guidance that we've been giving, that 3% to 4%, and I think we'll expand upon
that more at Investor Day.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dirk, you want to add anything?
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Yeah. Hi, Sarah. It's Dirk. What I would say is if you look at the third quarter, the major driver
of the better margin was things that we did in executing that drug purchasing and acquisition strategy [ph] which really
(33:26) at the gross margin line is where we had that [ph] big full (33:29) uptick in the quarter.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And those should be sustainable.
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Right. And as I already said, we'll stick with 3% to 4% from the long-term op margin
perspective.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Next question.

Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks. Morning. In the release and in your prepared, you suggested and talked about sort of
restrained utilization and obviously the MLR performance would suggest that as well. Just hoping you could maybe
provide a little bit more on specific inpatient and maybe outpatient metrics, if you're seeing any change on sort of [ph]
acuity (34:01) levels, any measurements there would be helpful. And then, just last quarter, you said MLR would track
at the higher end of guidance, is that still the case? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. We don't actually ever get into those kinds – that level of granular statistics, but I
think we can give you some commentary to give you some sense.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Ralph. This is Dan Schumacher. On utilization specifically, as we've
mentioned, we continue to see very stable trends across our businesses, which is to say that we see the same
comparable increases in 2014 as compared to 2013. As you look at the componentry underneath, and obviously
pharmacy is higher in the hep C category and that's being offset – more than offset by a better performance in inpatient
in particular, followed by physician and outpatient. Our medical cost management plays a very significant role in this.
As I said earlier, we do set expectations and then endeavor to outperform them, and we're doing that this year.
I think some of the other things that are probably contributing to the performance and utilizations, certainly some
greater consumer responsibility and higher concentrations of value-based reimbursement. And again, those are things
that are a significant focus of our enterprise. So overall, very stable utilization patterns.
I think perhaps people ask how do we know, and – looking at external data and so forth, and I'll tell you, as Steve's said
in the prepared remarks, you look at – we have 41,000 people in any given day in a facility. And we have 2,000 people,
they wake up every morning and they look at who's going to be admitted, who has been admitted, how long they've
been there, what they're being treated for, and most importantly, working with them, their family and their caregivers
on appropriate discharge plans, so that they can be successful when they leave. And all of that is enabled by near
real-time technology, and we're going to have an opportunity to show that to you at the Investor Conference. So that's

what we're seeing on the utilization front.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Okay, thanks. And then just MLR guidance.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: MLR guidance, again, I think we'd reiterate comments from last quarter, which is to say we'd
expect to be near the higher end of the range on both the consolidated and the commercial ratios, albeit a little bit better
than what we were thinking leaving the second quarter.

Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of UBS.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just to ask you about the international business. It looks like there's an
acceleration in top line performance at Amil this quarter. I know there were some issues around government changes
down there and utilization and so forth. Are you pretty much back to where you wanted to be in a normalized operating
trend?
And then more broadly, I guess you guys have been mentioned in several international sales situations. Can you
comment on your appetite for international deals at this point and [ph] whether your thinking's (37:03) involved and
what you might or might not do?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. We are basically coming around the bend on a full year in terms of the changes in
Brazil. And I think that they are – we see some pretty positive sense in terms of that marketplace. And I'll have Dave
comment on that and the others.
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Thanks, A.J. Thanks for the question. I think what you're noticing in Amil is what we
noticed as well, is it's beginning to show tangible results from the various initiatives that we put in place, largely in
response to this ANS regulatory change which happened just over a year ago.
As you know, there was a lag on the market's ability to respond to that change, so one of the things we had to do was
ensure that all of our plans were in good standing, get our renewals up. And so even in the face of declining
membership, which is largely around dealing with high costs of [ph] bought (37:58) business, if you will, we are
showing strong revenue growth, which is largely a reflection of the activities we have underway with respect to getting
renewals in place in response to that regulatory change.
We're also pursuing managing our costs and they're coming out and we're making, I think, all the right changes to the
business. And notably, our hospitals continue to perform very well as well. So it'll take some time, A.J., to work our
way through this. It'll be maybe all the way to the end of 2015 till we get to what I would characterize as a more
normalized level of profitability in the business, but we clearly see line of sight towards that.
As it relates to the international markets and our appetite there, yes, we are active predominantly in Brazil,
predominantly in the healthcare delivery space, predominantly in the – along the long lines that I described before,
which is to move beyond the centers of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro into the contiguous cities, if you will, and then
also to pursue growth in the northeast part of that country. Our efforts there have gone very well.
And then, of course, we have other interests internationally, but I'd say most of those are aimed towards the South
America and Latin American markets. And then as we think about, more broadly across the globe as well as in those
two markets, we see great opportunity for Optum, which we're just beginning to pursue.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

Next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to take a step back just on the benefits business and the
M&A landscape. And it's been, I think, two years now since there's been any major M&A on the benefit side and it's
been even longer for United. So I'm just curious, is there a reason for this pause? Is there something in the market that
changed with reform? Is it just an unsure landscape as to who the winners and the losers are in some of the benefits
business? Just maybe your perspectives on M&A, maybe even broadly beyond UNH, just in the benefits segment,
specifically.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. I'll just comment that perhaps the highest levels, certainly with the healthcare
reform efforts that have been going forward, I could easily see this marketplace being fairly occupied in making sure
that this is – for everybody in this space that they are prepared to in responding to the changing regulatory landscape,
and to make sure that they're pursuing the opportunities and managing the challenges those regulatory changes brought
forward. And I think that continues to go forward. I think it's been a very successful first year across the industry in
terms of how that has been responded to.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: And when are you less occupied with those responses?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I think – my view is that this year was, by far, the most amount of changes, but
they're going to have to be digested in the marketplace over the next two years to three years. But I would not
necessarily suggest, then, that there'll be a time when there will be market activities around M&A begin to pick up and
so forth.
I'm not sure I would necessarily – when we take a look at the expanse of our business, we are well diversified across
our benefits business, continue to be interested in growing that and making sure it continues to innovate and drive value
from an organic point of view, and to be in a position where we see opportunities to expand that business that make
sense, that lie into our strategic path, bring capabilities, bring market positions or scale that we would have an interest
in and I would imagine others will as well. We have opportunities to also allocate capital to services and to
international markets, and we would have to assess those as well.
So I don't think it's – my sense is it requires a little bit more thoughtful reflection than just when will the reform run its
course or not. And I think that – I'm impressed that, across the space, these businesses have been mature in terms of
how they responded and I think everybody's focused at the opportunities at hand.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Thanks. I just had two quick ones. Just first, how much of the $200 million in the targeted Optum
investment spend has now been completed through the 3Q and how much remains for the fourth quarter? And then just
secondly, I know it's very small for you guys in the overall context of things, but just interested on Texas Medicaid.
That's been one of the states that has still been reticent to cover the industry fee. And we've heard some mixed feedback
from different plans on whether they expect to get paid on that or not, so definitely very interested in whether you've
heard something from Texas on whether you're going to get recouped for the industry fee this year. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So that will go from one side to the other, so John, do you want to respond first?
<A - John Rex>: Yes. Scott, John Rex here. So yes, correct, we've talked in the first half about investments that we've
been making, particularly within the OptumInsight and OptumHealth businesses, and we'd sized that up in the first half

at $140 million; talked about $200 million or more for the full year in terms of anticipating and investing in those
businesses. So in the 3Q we would've invested an additional $60 million, so we have hit our $200 million. I do
anticipate that we will continue to spend in the fourth quarter, albeit at a diminished rate, however, that is within the
scope of our guidance where we've talked about our comfort with the high end of our $3.2 billion earnings range.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Okay. Austin?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Sure. Thanks for the question. I guess first of all, I'd comment that we've had great progress,
as you know, in getting arrangements and agreements in place with our states on the recovery of this fee. There is one
instance, as you mentioned, that we don't have written agreement yet. We do expect to be paid. We expect all of these
to come in before the end of the year. We haven't recorded revenue in that one instance, but we feel very good overall.

We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Great. Thanks. Couple quick questions on the individual [ph] or the (45:06) exchange
business. I want to clarify something first. You said that you expected to be slightly below kind of the longer term
margin in that business of 3% to 5%. But I think in the past, you've talked about pricing that business to profitability
kind of excluding the three Rs, not relying on them to make a profit. And I would think that if you were pricing that
way, then with the three Rs, you would be at least at that average number. So I just wanted to clarify that before a
follow-up on the exchanges.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Hi, Kevin. It's Jeff Alter. Yeah, so we're not exclusive of all of these Rs, so we would not rely on
corridors. We will obviously rely on the reinsurance and the risk adjustment; risk adjustment's a big part of it. So while
we will get into that 3%, probably closer to the 5% as market matures, we also recognize that it's still a market in
development. And our competitors that are already in the marketplace, we need to be able to come in at a price point
that attracts a little bit of growth, but still profitability and then build into that marketplace. So this is a long-term build
for us. So just clarifying, we will not rely on corridors, but the other Rs are important parts of that business, and risk
adjustment will always be an important part of that.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Okay. So, is this a clarification then, or is this something that, now that you've seen the
pricing and everything else, that it's a little bit different? I just wasn't sure.
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Kevin, this is Gail Boudreaux. I just want to sort of add on to Jeff's comments about what
he said. I mean, it's not so much a clarification, it's always been our long-term strategy. We see this market as a really
good growth – long-term growth opportunity. As we said in the last several calls, we don't expect to rely on subsidies
as part of that, and we are pricing to profitability. But in any new market, as you enter a market, we don't necessarily
think that we'll see our 3% to 5% earnings range in the first year. And again, remember, 75% of this market is yet to
develop, and we are seeing it firm and stabilize a little bit, but it's still only the second year in the market. But overall,
we went into this market with an expectation of earning a profit in it.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Okay. Because that was going to be my real question, was just how you think the
market is going to evolve in 2015. Do you think the CBO target of 13 million people makes sense? And then how do
you think about your positioning as, I guess a strong second mover versus the incumbents? In retrospect, if you had
known that membership would be 7.3 million, would you have been more aggressive in year one? Or, I guess just any
thoughts there.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: No, no. We like where we are we, or we would've played this just exactly as we have. We
think the second vintage will be better. The third vintage will be better after that. This market will form. It will be
different market by market. It will take time for it to evolve. It will eventually evolve into about the profit margin range

that we have been discussing.
We're not going to comment on CBO. We have no idea, from that point of view, whose projections are correct. So far,
all we can say is, everybody's projections have been wrong. And so we will just play this and participate as we see this
market evolves, which has been completely consistent with our perspective on this. And we do anticipate that we will
participate in this way that is sustainable from a growth and profitability point of view.
But we don't have that kind of mature margin assumption in your first couple years of participation, and we really don't
have a lot of this into our 15-year outlook, but this is really just our introduction. We expect to participate, we expect to
grow, but we're not expecting tremendous profit out of that first year of participation. So I think that ought to be the
way you think about it.

Our next question comes from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Andy Schenker>: Thanks. Good morning. So, one of your peers just pulled out of the Delaware Medicaid
program over a rate disagreement. I believe you're the only other MCO in the program. So first of all, do you expect to
enroll the 130 members next year? And then, more broadly, how are your rate discussions going for Medicaid next
year, any areas of pushback on rates? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Austin?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: This is Austin. Thanks for the question. We do have an agreement in place with Delaware.
We look forward to continuing to serve the people of Delaware and stay focused on being ready to do that. I won't
speculate at this early date on where that membership will play out, but overall, we continue to feel confident in our
relationships with our states, our ability and proven track record in working with states to really serve those populations
and deliver that long-term sustainability in that 3% to 5% margin.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And the states see value in that. These are complex programs, they're invested in them,
and the Medicaid programs are continuing to establish themselves very well.
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: I think the great growth that we've seen this year and our ability to work year-over-year with
states is a reflection of the trust they put in us to serve their populations.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And I think Medicaid has been one of the strong successes of the ACA effort. So, next
question please.

Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Thanks – good morning – for taking the question. The questions on the employer market and
mix shift potentially in 2015, given the data points of Walmart, which dumped I think 30,000 workers. Some of your
competitors are talking about small group under 10 dumping into exchanges, but on the flip side, the private exchange
market and adoption's been slower from the recent [ph] Eon (51:20) data points, and there's an employer mandate
1/1/2015. So are you looking at 2015 as a big year of mix shift? And is there potential for disproportionate share gains
for you? Because brand stickiness is not that great. And what are you assuming in your soft 2015 EPS guide of kind of
in line with consensus?

<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Sure. That is quite a question. There's a number of things embedded. Let me first talk about
the mix shift question you had, and take it in a couple of parts. The first – let me deal with your question on small
employer dumping. We have not seen a lot of that. We don't really expect an acceleration in that, given how reform has
laid out in some of the offerings that are still in the marketplace. So I don't expect any significant increase in dumping,
although we do expect some decline in the market, which has been happening over time but not a significant dumping.
In terms of the overall market, you mentioned employers getting rid of or taking down their part-time employees. Let
me start with our expectations around the large marketplace. Overall, the national account marketplace has been – we
feel positive about that marketplace. We're pleased with our competitive position in it. And we do expect a better result
in 2014 than in 2013, we've had a stronger close ratio.
But with that, getting to your second question, we do have a very focused strategy when there is an opportunity in
exchanges to help convert some of our self-funded business to fully insured exchanges, and we are seeing some of that,
which comes out of our commercial enrollment. And the other sector of the market that's happening is the retiree
population is moving from the self-funded book of business, particularly in our national accounts, to our Medicare
Advantage, our Medicare Supplement, and our Part D products. And again, we've been very successful in that in 2014
and we expect to be successful in 2015. That's been a very specific strategy. So those are the kind of changes going on
in the market and we feel good about our positioning in that.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, I'd say just the expanse and the diversification of our benefits offerings suggest that
even if there are shifts in the marketplace, we're really well-positioned to accommodate those shifts and I think pretty
agile in that context. So perhaps just one more question.

Our next question comes from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.
<Q - Carl R. McDonald>: Great. Thank you. On the cost trend, so sub 5% last year, a little bit under 5.5% this year.
Can you walk through what's accounting for that, call it, 50 basis point increase this year versus 2013?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure, Carl. This is Dan Schumacher. One of the primary elements of the increase
year-over-year is reform related. We talked about that at the Investor Conference last December that as people moved
into richer plans, complied with community rating and so forth, that was one of the elements that – principal elements
that drove the increase.
<Q - Carl R. McDonald>: Thank you.
Stephen J. Hemsley
Thank you. So I think we will close. And as we close the day I'd like to remind you that 2014 performance across both
Optum and UnitedHealthcare remain strong through the first nine months of the year, and we expect to continue that
consistent performance through the rest of 2014 and to remain in line with or ahead of our outlook that we shared with
you today. And in 2015 and beyond, we expect our overall business performance will further strengthen and accelerate
both top line and bottom line. And we look forward to sharing more detail with you around 2015 performance at the
Investor Conference on December 2 in New York. So thank you for your attention today. Thank you.
