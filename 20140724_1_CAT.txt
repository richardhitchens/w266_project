Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caterpillar second quarter 2014 earnings results conference
call. At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions
and comments following the presentation.
Now I'd like to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael L. DeWalt
Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm Mike
DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Strategic Services. And on the call today I'm pleased to have our Chairman and
CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.

with the SEC in February of 2014 and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release.
Now, in addition to that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in our release today and again it's

Okay. Let's get started this morning and I'll be covering three things before we get into the Q&A: Second quarter sales
and profit, the outlook for 2014 and our announcement this morning of additional share repurchase expected in the
third quarter.
Now before we really get into the quarterly numbers I thought it might be helpful to summarize the major themes from
this morning's release. In other words, what were the key points we're trying to get across?
The first point is around stability and consistency. Back in October of 2013 we provided a preliminary outlook for 2014
sales and revenues. And back then we said it looked to us like 2014 would be a relatively flat year with 2013. That was
the case then and that's the case today. The midpoint of our outlook today is within about 1% of 2013 sales and
revenues.
The second main theme this morning is around execution which has been good. Manufacturing, SG&A and R&D costs
are close to $500 million favorable in the first half versus the first half of 2013. Cash flow has continued to be strong.
We've improved inventory turns, PINS continue to improve and we've raised our profit outlook again this morning.
Now the third major theme this morning is cash deployment and the actions we've taken to help drive shareholder
returns. With the stock buyback we announced this morning we expect that from the start of 2013 – last year to the end
of the third quarter of this year that we will have repurchased $6.2 billion worth of CAT stock and made two substantial
increases in the quarterly dividend. So that's three things: consistency, execution and shareholder friendly cash
deployment.
Okay. Now let's get into the second quarter results. Sales and revenues were $14.2 billion and that was about 3% below
the second quarter last year. Construction industries was up 11%, Resource Industries down 29% and the rest – Energy
& Transportation, financial products and our all other segment combined be roughly flat with the second quarter of last
year. Now, for construction North America has been an area of strength and you might be surprised to hear, so is our
EAME region particularly Europe in the second quarter. It's been better as well.
Now construction sales in Latin America were about flat with the second quarter last year but as we get into the third
quarter Latin America will likely turn a bit negative versus last year and that's not driven by big economics. It's
primarily related to large sales of backhoe loaders and motor graders that we've had to the Brazilian government. It was
positive for sales last year and through to the first half of this year but those orders are complete. So you should expect
to see in the retail statistics that we release each month, some decline there. So don't be surprised if you see that. We
expect that. It's included in our outlook.
Now construction sales in Asia-Pacific were down slightly and that includes weaker sales in China. Now in China, we
started the year 2014 with improving construction equipment demand but over the second quarter it weakened a bit.
Our Resource Industries segment, which again is mostly mining, was down 29%. It was down 35% to 40% in every
region of the world except North America. North America was much less negative than the other regions partly because
of the steep sales decline in North America started earlier. In other words, it was probably closer to the bottom a year
ago. In addition, better sales to quarry and aggregate customers was also a factor. That part of Resource Industries tends
to be a little more closely aligned with construction and particularly in North America that's been performing better.
So again, overall mining sales weak. However, this was the first quarter since 2012 that resource industry sales were
higher than the previous quarter. So that means second quarter of 2014 sales were about 6% higher than the first
quarter. Sales improved from first to second for both new equipment and for parts. In fact, for parts it's the second
consecutive quarterly improvement. Q1 of 2014 was up slightly from Q4 of 2013 and Q2 this year was a little better
than Q1. Now it's too soon to suggest that the mining business is turning around but it's good to see sequential
improvement.

Moving on to Energy & Transportation, it's been incredibly stable, high-performing business over the past few years
and this quarter was no exception. Overall, sales for Energy & Transportation were stable with the second quarter of
last year. And even if you take it down to the next level and you'll look at sales in the major industries served by
Energy & Transportation and that's oil and gas, power gen, transportation and industrial the sales were individually
pretty flat with the exception of power gen. And that was down high single digits but even there we see that being an
issue around the timing of some large projects.
So in summary, on second quarter sales and as you probably expected going into the quarter construction sales were up
nicely, mining sales were lower, everything else was pretty much flat.
Okay. I'll shift from sales to profit in the second quarter. Headline numbers: profit per share of $1.69 excluding
restructuring and $1.57 including restructuring costs. In comparison profit was $1.45 in the second quarter of 2013.
Now, by segment Resource Industries was the only segment that we had that declined versus the second quarter last
year. The rest were up. And a couple of big bright spots were a profit increase of more than 80% for Construction
Industries and an all-time record profit for Energy & Transportation and in fact their first quarterly profit over $1
billion.
From a consolidated perspective, we provide an operating profit comparison by reason in our release and today that's
the graphic on page six of our financial release. Because the individual buckets in that waterfall graph are relatively
small I'm not going to go into each one of them in any detail. But I would summarize by saying that manufacturing
costs and price realization were modestly positive and the negatives were a bit lower sales volume, the restructuring
costs in the quarter, an absence of a sizable $135 million gain that we had in the second quarter last year related to a
settlement with the previous owners of our Siwei acquisition.
So that's the quarter. Let's turn to the outlook for 2014 where we've made a modest change to sales and revenues and
increased our outlook for profit. For sales, half of the year is behind us and we've tightened up the range and lowered
the midpoint slightly. Now, as I mentioned at the outset of the call this morning our view of 2014 sales and revenues
has remained reasonably constant, in other words, a flattish year versus 2013. We thought that was the case last year.
We think that's still the case today. That said, with half of the year over we've tightened the range and we've – the
updated range is a forecast of $54 billion to $56 billion in sales and revenues and for reference, the previous range was
$56 billion plus or minus 5%. That meant a range of just over $53 billion to just under $59 billion.
The middle of the new range is $55 billion and that is slightly lower than the previous midpoint of $56 billion. And
most of that change is in Construction Industries and reflects the weaker sales expectations in China based on the
reporting out of China. That probably shouldn't be much of a surprise and a decline in expectations in the CIS and in
the Africa, Middle East region and given the political turmoil in those parts of the world that's probably not a big
surprise.
In terms of profit, for a better understanding of results, we're providing the outlook again both with and without
restructuring costs. Today, we've increased the outlook for both. Now excluding restructuring costs we've increased it
to $6.20 a share. That's a $0.10 increase from the prior forecast. Now, our expectation for restructuring costs is near the
bottom end of our $400 million to $500 million range and with restructuring costs all in, our updated outlook is profit
per share of $5.75 which is $0.20 per share better than the previous outlook.
Now to help you think about the rest of the year, the third and the fourth quarter, there is one more thing I'd like to
cover and that's how we're thinking about the last two quarters. There's typically seasonality in our sales and we think
that's going to be the case this year as well. So we've got half of the year behind us and you know the midpoint of our
outlook. We basically have the second half of the year not a lot different than the first half.
Now we expect sales and revenues in the third quarter to be similar to the first quarter of 2014 and fourth quarter sales
to be more in line with the second quarter of 2014. In terms of profit per share with the lower sales in the third quarter
it'll likely be the weakest profit quarter of the year and with higher sales in the fourth quarter profit per share should be
similar to the average of the first and second quarters of 2014.

I hope that helps you think about our expectations and how the third and fourth quarter could play out and if you
missed writing that down, again, we'll be reposting the transcript of this call on our caterpillar.com website.
Now in addition to our financial results, this morning we announced that we expect to repurchase another $2.5 billion
of Caterpillar stock in the third quarter. This repurchase is a part of the $10 billion that the board authorized earlier this
year. Now, the context behind our repurchases really over the past two years is consistent with our cash deployment
priorities. Coming out of the 2008 and 2009 Great Recession, we had work to do to improve the strength of the balance
sheet. We needed to invest for growth and with very low interest rates our employee benefit plans needed additional
funding. Over the past few years, we've made significant progress. Our Machinery, Engines (sic) [Energy] (13:44) &
Transportation debt-to-capital ratio is at the low end of our target range. Benefit plan funding is in good shape and we
generally have the production capacity in place that we think we'll need for the next few years.
And although we'll continue to be opportunistic we aren't expecting any large acquisitions. So with nearly $9 billion of
Machinery, Engines (sic) [Energy] (14:11) & Transportation operating cash flow last year in 2013 and nearly $4 billion
in the first half of this year and with significant cash on hand we've had the opportunity to take substantial actions to
improve shareholder return. In 2013, we repurchased $2 billion worth of stock and raised the dividend by 15%. In June
of 2014, we increased the dividend again an additional 17% and by the end of the third quarter of this year we expect to
have repurchased about $4.2 billion of stock in 2014. That's the $1.7 billion in the first quarter and the $2.5 billion in
the third quarter. Rewarding stockholders is an important goal and our actions demonstrate our commitment.
So in summary, we had a pretty good second quarter. We raised the profit outlook for 2014 and we announced another
$2.5 billion of stock repurchases.
So with that, we're ready to shift over to the Q&A portion of the call.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your affiliation.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: I'm from Barclays. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Hey, Andy. Good morning.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: So, Mike, you said in the release that dealer inventories declined about $500 million in the
quarter and you also talked in the release about the decline in inventories this year now being more than you previously
expected, mostly driven by Resource Industries. How much did this contribute to the reduction of your sales forecast
and what kind of visibility do you have to a bottoming in destocking really across the company, but particularly in
Resource Industries?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, good question, Andy. And dealer inventory has certainly been a factor. Versus our
original outlook when we started the year it kind of looks now like dealer inventory's going to be down maybe $1
billion or so more than we thought. In fact, the first quarter and the second quarter combined were still up slightly for
the year. We had a $700 million increase in the first quarter, a $500 million decrease in the second quarter and a lot of
that is seasonality.
But in the second half we're looking for about $800 million of decline per quarter, so about $1.6 billion coming out in
the second half. So that's having an impact on second quarter or I'm sorry – second half results and it's a couple of
things. One, we've not really had a turnaround in mining yet and so dealers are continuing to satisfy some demand out
of inventory. We thought it was going to be a lot less coming into the year and things might start picking up. We really
haven't seen that yet. So that's one factor.
And then I think on construction, dealer inventory, we're going end the year probably a little bit lower than we thought
and that's actually despite a pretty darn good year so far for construction. I think it's a case where we talk a lot about

execution. We've actually been able to take down our lane one channel inventory that we have and dealers have been
able to take their inventory down as well. I think we're – when you think about what's an adequate supply going back to
your question – it's within a range and I think particularly for construction it's getting down to a pretty good level. So if
demand doesn't decline then you'd have to think going forward that dealer inventory's going to be in even better shape
at the end of this year than it was last year.
So in summary to your question, I know that was long-winded, dealer inventory's having a bit more of an impact this
year and it's a principal reason why the second half sales aren't going to be better than what's in our forecast.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Okay, Mike. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting gears, you talked about the
timing of large projects negatively impacting your E&T retail sales but that your – really your outlook for E&T really
hasn't changed. Can you talk about your visibility in the segment? Do you still feel good about it because backlog is
up? And maybe specifically about power generation, what you see there?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I'd say E&T overall – I'd say we feel very good. Second half looks like it's going to
be pretty strong. We've had, I would say, very good order rates over the last quarter particularly for oil and gas. For
large engine products in general but oil and gas has been particularly good. So that's contributed to the increase in the
backlog there.
With electric power, we kind of have a couple of different businesses. We have – we break it down between the
investor business which is essentially large-scale installations that – and then small – we call it retail gen sets. The big
gen set business – the big end has been pretty good and that's the piece of it that can tend to be lumpy around big
projects. We had some last year, we'll have some this year. The timing affects how that plays out certainly by month
and by quarter. And you see that in the retail statistics. It'll move around quite a bit. I'd tell you we feel pretty good
about Energy & Transportation overall. Really most of the sectors within there and particularly oil and gas.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Thank you, Mike.
Operator
Okay. We'll take our next question from Robert Wertheimer. Please the state your affiliation.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: Hi. It's Vertical Research Partners and good morning, everybody. Mike, you mentioned
the oil and gas strength and I know fracking's been ticking up and some of your channel partners have been bullish on
that and pipeline and a bunch of other stuff. If I'm not mistaken you have a Tier Four change-over in some of the oil
and gas engines for next year. Could you talk generally about the high horsepower Tier Four? How many engines you
have running, how confident you feel, whether there's any kind of a pre-buy going on there?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I'm going to have to defer that question, Rob. I'm not an expert on that. I don't know that
number. Sorry...
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: Okay. No. That's fine. That's fine. I'll follow up after. I should have sent it before. And
then I guess the second question, you just addressed at length so I apologize for going back to it, but the dealer
inventory, which you gave good disclosure on. But are you comfortable that the construction which has been very
strong and your gaining share in an up market so it's really hard to sort out, but are you comfortable that construction
inventory hasn't restocked a little bit too much? Can you tell that especially in LatAm where some of the markets look
really soft? You mentioned the big government project. So I'm just curious if you think the construction inventory over
inflated at all in the first half. Your margins were quite good in the first half and you're signaling down. So that's my
second question.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, no. I think the first and second quarters played out pretty close to what we thought.
If you think about it, the first quarter for sales to end-users is always one of the lowest quarters of years. Dealers
commonly stock up and then sell it down in the second quarter, which they did this year. It came down and in the third
quarter is usually pretty weak as well. A lot of Europe is on vacation, a lot of other parts of the world take vacation time

and we feel that in our business, so certainly a bit more of that'll come out in the third quarter and then again more
probably in the fourth quarter.
It's always tough to forecast this with massive accuracy. We look at what a reasonable months of sales are but that
varies by region and it's a reasonable range. And I think construction based on where we are in terms of the timing of
the year, what their expectations are for year end is definitely within that reasonable range.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: Thank you. And then are you able to say what the total mining dealers DD stock is this
year? You've said it but I just want to make sure I back into it right.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I think it's going to end up being about $1 billion if memory serves me. I'm not
100% sure on that but I think that's order of magnitude.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: Thanks, Mike.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Which is more than we thought coming into the year.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: Yeah, thank you.
Operator
Okay. We'll take our next question from Jamie Cook. Please state your affiliation.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Hi. Good morning. Credit Suisse. I guess a couple questions around the Mining or the Resource
business. The sales were up sequentially, which was nice. The margins were down sequentially. I get the
year-over-year issues. But I guess the margin in Resource disappointed a little relative to my expectations in particular
when you said aftermarket was up again. So can you just talk about that? Is that just investment that you incurred this
year that you held off on last year? And then I think last quarter you said in terms of Resource margins you expected
them to be about flat with the first quarter. Is that still the way to think about it?
And then my second question again, sorry, a follow-up on just the Resource business. You said I think OE and
aftermarket was up. Can you give a little color around what markets or both on OE and aftermarket – just a little more
color on that commentary you mentioned in the prepared remarks? Thanks.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yeah, this is Brad Halverson. Just one comment on our Resource Industry segment in
terms of its margins. This segment is critically important to us and we've made a conscious effort to continue to invest
in the technology in autonomous mining and those types of things as well as our initiatives around Bucyrus. And so I
would say that we have made a conscious decision relative to maybe our normal expectations on pull-through to
continue to invest in this segment even where their sales are at.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Jamie, their incrementals I think too were really operationally better than the numbers look
like just right off the face of the statement. Last year, they had a $135 million gain from the Siwei settlement so if you
take that – if you adjust for that...
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: But is there any...
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Operationally they were pretty good...
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: No, I get that, but is there any way you can tell us what will the investment number this year
relative to what you were thinking about last year and then again how to think about margins for the full year?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, we're at a point now where margins are low enough and sales are low enough the
percentages – I think the dollars are probably in some ways a little more important and easier way to think about it. We
were $140 million something in the first quarter, $130 million something in the second quarter and I don't think you're
going to see material changes from that probably for the rest of the year.

<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Okay. Sorry. And then just any additional color on the commentary with the aftermarket being
up again in the quarter...
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Oh.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Was that a sequential uptick from Q1 and then just color where you're seeing it? And on the OE
side as well?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, actually from first to second, in fact what I looked at last night was less about
regions and more about products.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Okay.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: And was actually – small numbers. I'm going to start with that. Small numbers but fairly
widespread on the OE. And the part sales – we have strength in part sales on things like underground, coal, trucks,
traditional Cat product were actually a little better than most. Where we're seeing down side on the aftermarket now are
on things like deferred maintenance on big shovels and drag lines and the like. But I say that and the numbers aren't
huge. Even the increase quarter-over-quarter was actually relatively small but thankfully turned in the right direction.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Okay, great. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.
Operator
Okay. We'll take our next question from Nicole DeBlase. Please announce your affiliation.
<Q - Nicole DeBlase>: Yeah, it's Morgan Stanley. Good morning, guys.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Good morning.
<Q - Nicole DeBlase>: So I just wanted to address the locomotive business a little bit. Your biggest competitor there
saw pretty strong equipment order growth this quarter – I think like 40%. So I'm just curious how locomotive orders are
trending for CAT? Are you guys seeing the positive impact associated with the Tier 4 pre-buy at all yet?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, yeah, so this is a big year for locomotive sales. Probably the biggest since we've
owned EMD. There have been a lot of misconceptions about this and this is a good opportunity I think to clear some of
those up. EMD's been a great acquisition on our part. Their market share has gone up in North American locomotives
quite a bit since we bought them. Their sales have gone up quite a bit. And I wouldn't use the words pre-buy but
certainly dealers have ordered a lot of locomotives from us as well as our competitors for delivery this year. It's a big
year for us.
<Q - Nicole DeBlase>: Okay. And do you think we'll start seeing the sales pick up in like 3Q? Or is it mostly a 4Q
event?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Well, again when things get – production has been going pretty solid all year long.
Effectively, we're booked solid. We could have probably – if we could have built more, we probably could've sold a
little bit more this year but we are booked solid on locomotives. The timing of the sales is around when we deliver
them and we'll probably have a better both third quarter and fourth quarter.
Now on the whole Tier 4 question – we're close to our customers. There are not that many in North America. They're
largely the big Class One railroads and we have very close relationship with essentially all of them. We've been talking
to them about Tier 4 expectations for a long time. They've been telling us they don't expect to order much for the next
couple of years. We've talked to them about our Tier 4 plans – no surprise to them. Our view is that the marketplace
expectations over the next – or that the industry in North America over the next couple of years is going to be down a
lot from where we are right now. And the impact of the timing of our Tier 4 product is not going to have a very

<Q - Nicole DeBlase>: Okay, Mike. That's really helpful.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I would just add – it's Doug Oberhelman here. On the EMD acquisition in general, as
Mike said, we are really happy with that business. Since we've owned it sales have more than doubled. This is a big
year – a big pre-buy year for sure. We would expect and have in talking to our customers a post-buy anemia in 2015
and 2016. Based on that, we modified the Tier 4 development program that was in place when we acquired EMD
because we didn't really like what we saw in terms of the end product with that engine.
In doing that, we contemplated that there would be virtually no or little demand in 2015 and 2016 in North America.
That's why we ramped up this year, that's why we delayed our Tier 4 program and we will have a really good offering
late 2015, 2016 in Tier 4. Not to mention our natural gas program for locomotives that's already in place and some of
those will be available – in fact are running today.
So we think we've really got a good program going. Our market share has gone up significantly, as Mike said, in North
America and outside North America sales have been fairly active as well. So we're really pleased with the EMD
acquisition. One of our better ones.
<Q - Nicole DeBlase>: Okay. Thanks. And then my second question is on E&T margins. So the segment margins there
were really good, reaching a new high this quarter. Was there anything special to call out that drove the 19.5% or do
you think that that level of strength could continue into the second half?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I won't make any comments on their margin in the second half because we don't really do
guidance by segment. But they've been doing just a fabulous job of executing on sales that were actually down a couple
percentage points. They managed costs down and improved their margins. And they've been very stable. Whether or
not it is going be exactly the same as this quarter that depends a lot on production, mix of products, regions they are
sold so you can always expect some bit of up and down in the margin rate. But I think overall they've just done a great
job, not just this year but really over the past three years. Sales have been stable and profits have been going up.
<Q - Nicole DeBlase>: Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from Timothy Thein. Please announce your affiliation.
<Q - Tim W. Thein>: Great, Citigroup. Thanks. Good morning. Yeah, Mike, just coming back to the comments on oil
and gas and specifically within well servicing in North America, I'm curious as the capacity is starting to come back,
how do you feel about your relative position in that market in terms of now having the full offering in terms of pumps,
transmissions and engines? And related to that, are you seeing any – just given how quickly demand has come back
after being dead for 18 months or so, are you seeing or experiencing any particular product delays or extended backlogs
for your products?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Well, this is – it's not a business so much, Tim, that orders day and expects it tomorrow. So
we are increasing production of large engines, we're taking up the build rates in Lafayette because of the increasing
demand. And back to the original point we've been a leader in this business for a long time and I think the addition of
transmissions and now the pressure pumps with our JV strengthen that. I think it's a great business. It lines up well with
the strengths of Caterpillar: durability, reliability, service, dealer network, part supply. It's a great thing and you're right.
If you go back a couple years ago let's just say there was plenty of equipment in the market and it slowed down pretty
dramatically from there. Last year was quite a down year for well servicing. But I think they've gone through the –
maybe the excess inventory they've had. That plus a little bit lower supplies of – softer supplies of gas, supportive
prices. It looks like – and good orders from our standpoint – it looks like it's going be a pretty good business.
<Q - Tim W. Thein>: Okay. Thanks. And then just switching back over to – you touched earlier on the part sales in
mining. I saw one of the majors the other day – actually the largest miner who – they're guiding to production growth
across some of their key industrial commodities of 4% to 10% in their fiscal FY 2015. So and I recognize that the

industry's doing a lot more now to sweat their assets. But just going back to what's embedded in your guidance,
obviously you've taken the forecast down a bit on mining. But how long I guess do you expect before we start to see
more of a recoupling between your part sales versus underlying production?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Tim, that is the $64,000 question. We – it's been – baffling is probably the wrong word.
But generally mine production has been pretty good but equipment sales have been very poor. They probably had a
little more equipment that they needed. It's a little bit almost like the fracking situation, so it'll come back. There's no
doubt about it. They're selling – or they're buying right now at levels that are far below, far below what a normal
sustainable replacement level would be. But again the question is on, a little bit like fracking and well servicing, when
will it turnaround?
It's hopeful to think that with part sales starting to edge up a bit and the equipment sales not going down anymore that
we're at an inflection point. But both mining customers and ourselves have proven that it's an industry that's extremely
tough to forecast. So the honest answer is it needs to go up, it will go up. It's just the timing of when that's going to
happen that we don't know.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Just a little more color on that, Michael and Tim. There's no question that there was
an artificial boom up until 2011, 2012 in the world. The bust since then is equally I would say of the same magnitude if
not worse. We are seeing our customers delay maintenance, defer maintenance, do things that they have not done in the
past. So at some point and as Mike says we don't know when, this will come back to us even if it's replacement part
cycle which we haven't seen yet. Now, I fully believe and as do our customers that the bottom is just behind us and our
numbers are just almost miniscule in terms of ticking up but they are ticking up. And I think that anecdotally with our
customers they see that too.
When they start to get back into a normal parts replacement cycle and even normal OE replacement cycle is unknown
but a lot of that will depend on how they're mining. And I saw that announcement as well with the big one or two. I met
with a lot of them on the last couple of months and none of them are talking about taking production down. But most of
them are just talking about continuing more of the same. So the bottom line is we don't know when it's going to come
back but it will come back and I suspect we'll see replacement parts cycle first of some magnitude.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Thanks, Tim.
<Q - Tim W. Thein>: Thank you.
Operator
Okay. We'll take our next question from Larry De Maria. Please state your affiliation.
<Q - Larry T. De Maria>: Thanks. Larry De Maria, William Blair. Just stick with EMD for one minute. I think you
mentioned that you had an offering late 2015 or 2016 for Tier 4. Is that ahead of schedule for the 2017 launch? And
how successful are we now in building an international book to offset the decline that you mentioned domestically?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, a couple of things. Our view is that we should have a Tier 4 diesel offering for 2017.
We have actually a big aftermarket rail business, a big service rail business and we sell locomotives and components
internationally and we're increasing our passenger rail business as well. So there's a lot of aspects to this and I think
with the big push in North America that we've had this year – with the big demand from customers one of the things
that we've done our best to do is to defer as much of the non-North American demand as we can into next year. So
we've done that.
I'm not going to maybe give a forecast for next year at this point. It's a little early for that. We'll talk about 2015 maybe
a little bit more next time we get together for one of these calls in October, but we have actively tried to focus as much
as we possibly could more on North America this year because of the big demand.
<Q - Larry T. De Maria>: Okay, thanks. And then moving over little bit, I know the business plan obviously calls to
increase field population and you've got some price in construction. But in the strong markets like North America are

we any closer to pushing through bigger price increases or are we still concerned with decreasing PINS at this point? I
know it's having some, obviously, reverberations in the industry, and maybe you're under-earning a little bit compared
to potential but you're improving your market position. So just curious about if we're any closer to getting more
outsized price gains?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I think our strategy over the last few years, and we've been just pounding through this
quarter after quarter, is to have very modest pricing, get cost-reduction, improve quality, improve delivery performance
and get market share and that's what we've been doing. Through that period, we've had a very stable pricing
environment. Not much up, not much down, and I don't see that changing in the near future.
<Q - Larry T. De Maria>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Okay, we'll take our next question from Theoni Pilarinos. Please state your affiliation.
<Q - Theoni Pilarinos>: Hi. Raymond James. You made it clear at your Investor Day that it was a priority for you to
take some of the cyclicality out of your business and make your cost structure more flexible. Just looking at the mining
segment, in talking about when it returns, eventually, it will return, and when it does, how do we balance the uptick in
demand that we've seen in previous cycles and the backlog that we get to with some of the restructuring and layoffs
costs that you're taking now? Do you think that you're going to be caught as you have in the past with not enough
capacity to meet demand?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Well, we put in capacity, physical capacity in the last cycle, and I think we have adequate
capacity in mining, even for a sizable upturn when it comes. What we have tried to do with our cost structure, as you
say, is make it more flexible. And that means being able to take out costs when volume goes down, and add costs when
volume comes back. In other words, try to make more of the cost structure as variable as we can. And we've done that.
Over the past two years in mining, we've taken a lot of costs out. We have taken fixed cost out-or we call it period
cost-out in our major manufacturing facilities.
But we've done that without materially impacting capacity. So when things turn up, there's no doubt we'll need to hire
more people to get the work done. But I'll just give you an example of the kinds of things that we've done to make that
happen. We increased capacity quite a bit for large trucks over the course of 2010, 2011 and 2012. But we essentially
did that in our Decatur facility. We didn't add any square footage to do that. It was all about how we laid out the
factory, the equipment, the processes, to get more production out of that facility. So other than depreciation, we didn't
add a lot of fixed cost get extra capacity. So that's just an example of the kinds of things that we've done. I hope we do
get a big turnaround that causes us to need more people. I mean, that would be good for us, that would be good for the
industry, that would be good for the country.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Let me just add a little bit more to that. Looking back at 2012, we did $65 billion in
volume at that time. This will apply to both construction, mining, as well as E&T, Energy & Transportation for that
matter. We've been working hard, as you know, on lean manufacturing, which is adding capacity every day in a very
lean way. As we go forward, that will come home to help us as well. So you've seen our CapEx numbers come down
the last two or three years. We invested early during this cycle to take advantage of that, which we did. We built market
share. So our CapEx needs are pretty well met, we think, organically the next few years, at least early through the next
upturn. So we're in pretty good shape with all of that. I don't expect to miss a sale, to tell you the truth on the way up
when the business returns in mining, and I'd go so far to say I expect the same thing in construction because of the lean
activities we're doing there that the help us with lead times, shorten lead times and better availability.
<Q - Theoni Pilarinos>: Okay, great. Thank you. My second question has to do with your recovery. You've kind of
described as slow and steady so far this year in the U.S. We've seen a couple of months now of non-res pickup, and this
has typically been the key turning point for you in addition to the Highway Bill. How do things fit now that we've had a
month or two of non-res pickup? How does that change anything from the slow and steady recovery we've seen, if at

all?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Well, it's been slow and steady overall. Actually, North American construction has been
pretty good this year. I would describe North America as a little better than slow and steady. And although we didn't
change it a lot, as a part of the updated outlook, the principal change was down for construction, as I said before, a little
China, and then the turmoil in the Middle East and the CIS causing caution. But in the midst of all that, we actually
edged U.S. construction up a little bit, and I think the signs there are encouraging.
And to put it in some context, though, Theoni, we've had a few years of improvement in North American construction.
This has been actually a pretty decent year, but even through all of that, we're still thinking this year on a kind of unit
basis, we're still thinking this year is going be sort of 15%, 20% below the 2006 peak. So there's still a lot of room, I
think, to run in construction in North America. We just need some sustained, decent economic growth in North
America. We need the Highway Bill to get sorted out. We need economic activity. Housing starts are well below what
the long-term needs to be to support population growth, and at some point, it's little bit like mining. That stuff is going
come back and when it does, it'll be positive. And it's starting to now.
<Q - Theoni Pilarinos>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Mike.
Operator
Okay. We'll take our next question from Ross Gilardi. Please state your affiliation.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Yes, Bank of America. Thank you. Mike, with respect to E&T and margins, I mean shouldn't
mix work strongly in your favor in the second half versus the first half given the pickup in oil and gas orders that you
mentioned, which at least the turbine business I think is your highest margin business. You've got the sharp pick up in
locomotive orders as well which is still in front of you for the rest of the year, or at least the locomotive deliveries,
excuse me, coupled with the weaker power gen market. So I would think margins would be – the mix would definitely
be a benefit in the second half of the year.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes, the stuff that you said was true, or much of it was, but it doesn't necessarily all come
to the conclusion that you've drawn. So oil and gas should be, we think, good in the second half. But I think most of the
areas of the Energy & Transportation business we think are going to improve in the second half. So it's not all going to
be concentrated in oil and gas. So I don't see a big impact on mix in the second half. We do have a couple of big orders
going out, or one big sale that we're expecting that'll probably be a little below the average. That will temper or it will
be certainly less than the average margin rate. That'll temper E&T expectations, I think, a bit later in the year.
And E&T is, in some ways, similar to a lot of the rest of the business, and we have higher discretionary costs in the
second half of the year than we do in the first half of the year. Some engineering programs are likely going to ramp-up
there a little bit, too. So I wouldn't get carried away on – margins this quarter were quite good. I wouldn't get carried
away at all thinking they're going to get a lot better in the second half in E&T. We had a great second quarter there.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Okay, great. And then you talked about pricing as the principal driver of the margin expansion
year-on-year in E&T. Can flesh-out a little bit more what's happening there and is it sustainable?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Say that again?
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Yeah, in your press release you attributed the year-on-year operating profit improvement for
E&T to pricing, and I was wondering what's happening there? Any particular businesses where you're seeing more
pricing power, and is it sustainable?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, so here's the thing. When the numbers are relatively small in terms of change, I
mean, operating profit, if memory serves me, was up a little over $50 million. It wasn't a lot. When you have small
changes in operating profit like that, and we're describing the reasons, sometimes it makes it seem as though it's maybe
more important than it was. The changes that we had in pricing for Energy & Transportation certainly weren't outsized.
Again, it's like this for the total company, if you look at the waterfall chart, all of the buckets are relatively small. So

describing anything that's inside them can make them seem a little more important than they are. So, no, there's not a
big price increase going on there. I don't see any big change in pricing activity going forward.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Okay. Thanks. Just a last one real quick. Was Russia and CIS, how big is it, and what are you
seeing with the sanctions?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, it's not a huge – the CIS is not huge for us. I mean, we don't do sales by country. It's
as you would expect, a lot less than someplace like China. The industry there is just not as big. But it has come off,
even though it's not big, it's come off a lot, and that's what makes it worth mentioning.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Okay. All right. Thanks very much.

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jerry Revich. Please state your affiliation.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Hi. Good morning. It's Goldman Sachs.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Good morning, Jerry.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Mike, at the Analyst Day, we spent some time talking about the focus on supplier
development and just improving connectivity. I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on how those efforts
are tracking. If you can share supplier on-time deliveries or other metrics that you're willing to talk about just to give us
a sense for progress?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Jerry, that's a great question, but of all the things I tried to prepare for for this call, that
wasn't one of them. I'd be happy to ask the purchasing guys, or our procurement group that question, but I'm afraid I
don't have a good answer for you. How about a second question?
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Jerry, maybe I'll just comment quickly in general terms and Mike can get the numbers
back in terms of percent. But I would say that our global purchasing group under the lead of Dave Bozeman, combining
that with our lean initiative, focused on built-in quality, right part, right time. And then more importantly, perhaps, the
customer lead times. The collaboration with our suppliers is outstanding right now. And we're seeing good progress
connected to our lean initiative across the board. So I would say, relative to our engagement with suppliers and
collaboration, and you're kind of seeing that I think in our material cost results over the last year-and-a-half. It's all been
very positive.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Okay. And my second question just on the restructuring costs. It sounds like the timing's
moving around a bit. Can you just give us a sense for what kind of cost savings you'll be delivering by the fourth
quarter on a run rate basis and what kind of tailwind we should look for next year?
And then separately, Mike, I guess in the past when the sales have stabilized at low levels in places like resources,
you've been able to deliver improved profitability and margins even at flat sales once you stopped cutting production.
And I'm wondering if that's a possibility as we think about 2015, if you're willing to address that.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yeah, I'll let Mike handle – this is Brad again – handle 2015 and the back half. But I
would say the restructuring has just moved a little bit. We'll have some of that cost move into 2015, I would say,
probably roughly around the midpoint of 450, it's still a good number in total, but some of that will spill over to 2015
and I would say the benefits are by and large consistent with what we've talked about before.
But it's not the only thing we're doing around cost restructuring or cost management, I would say. We talked a little bit
about what we said in terms of the last kind of conference. We're embracing the fact that we do have some cyclicality,
but I think the thing to remember is the fact that we have a lot of diversity. I mean, we really have one segment right
now that's not performing, and it's in the bottom of their cycle, but we have a strong Energy & Transportation business
and a Construction business, strong in North America, a little concern in developing world, but the margins have

improved significantly.
So I would say from an execution standpoint, how we're managing these businesses, and where we're spending our
money, we had good cost reductions last year, we had $500 million roughly in the first half of this year, and it's kind of
part of how we're operating now. So I feel pretty good about the fact that we have good, consistent execution.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, you didn't ask this, but I'm going to – I just wanted to chime in one more thing that I
thought might come up but hasn't and that's, if you look at the second half of the year and the first half of the year, we
got a headwind in the second half of the year that was a small headwind, it was a small tailwind in the first half. For the
year it's going be pretty neutral, and that's inventory absorption. We've had – not dealer inventory but CAT inventory,
we had a small increase in the first half, and we expect that to come down in the second half and finish the year little bit
– basically fairly neutral. But what that's meant is that's been a little positive in the first half of the year, and it'll be a
little negative in the second half of the year. And that's also one of the reasons why you're seeing a little difference in
first half and second half profit.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Thank you.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I think we have time for one more.
Operator
Okay. We'll take the next question from David Raso. Please state your affiliation.
<Q - David M. Raso>: ISI. Can I clarify the dealer inventory comments? Sequentially, did you say down $800 million
each of the next two quarters?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes, sir. We did.
<Q - David M. Raso>: And that includes engines and machines, or just machines?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, that's machines. I don't think engines is forecast to change much. Dealer inventory in
engines is smaller and has been much more stable. What I was talking about was machines.
<Q - David M. Raso>: So just to be clear then, the second half of the year, on a year-over-year basis, production then
is going be largely in line with retail?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Say that again, David?
<Q - David M. Raso>: The year-over-year – the first half of the year, you've had some nice help from the dealer
swings in inventory.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Well, it wasn't – I mean overall, it wasn't much. We went up $700 million first quarter,
down $500 million second quarter, so first half was a couple of hundred million. But...
<Q - David M. Raso>: Well, I was thinking year-over-year, Mike. The first half of the year you had about $1.8
billion...
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Yeah, it was about $1.8 billion help. Right? Just the year-over-year changes. The second half of
the year, just so I'm clear, it looks like the year-over-year change will be pretty much neutral. Because last year, third
quarter inventory went down $800 million, last year fourth quarter inventory went down $700 million sequentially,
right? So the year-over-year is a bit of a push.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: It will be similar, yeah.

<Q - David M. Raso>: So that said, if production's going to be basically in line with retail year-over-year, it implies
the dealer stats, the retail stats, you must be looking at something from the dealers that are telling you the retail data is
going to get also pretty close to flat year-over-year, because that's how you're forecasting your own sales for the second
half. I know the dealer stats don't include pricing, don't include parts. But just so I make sure I'm reading that right, as I
see the dealers stats come out, there must be some implication here that the dealer stats do get close to flat over the
course of the second half the year. Is that fair?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I think we would see it trending more towards that as the year goes on. I think that's
a very reasonable assumption.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Okay. And then the last one, the sequential from mining revenue...
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: David, I'll just go on from that.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Sure.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Throughout much of last year, the mining numbers were continuing to go down. And so,
what a lot of that will be is, we will be lapping what was actually a quite low Resource Industries. That's probably
where you'll see a lot of the improvement. You've already started to see that this last month on Resource Industries it
was less negative than prior month by a reasonable margin.
<Q - David M. Raso>: To that point, obviously people watch the monthly retails and the fact is if you look at the last
three months for machines, it was still down 10. Engines was also down 10. The way the guide plays out, obviously
must be looking at something from the dealers that tell you we're going to get pretty close to flat year-over-year in the
second half. And I don't mean just one month, I mean basically for the first half, the second half, right? That's how you
get to your own sales. So that moment retail turns positive, obviously the stock is going to respond of that. So I'm just
trying to figure out, am I reading that properly that there's something you're seeing from your dealers that's telling you
you're going to have a machine number, I don't care if it's Resource, Construction, but combined, those numbers are
going close to flat soon, as well as in engines or you couldn't a flat CAT sales in the second half because there's no
longer that big production in retail gap.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I'm not going to give you an exact kind of number because as you started out, parts and
service matters, pricing matters, currency impacts matter a bit. But I think you're underlying premise is that the retail
stats should, relative to a year ago, start looking better is absolutely true.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Now that we're passed 12:00 Eastern, I'll cut it off, I'll ask you my second question offline. But
thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Michael L. DeWalt
Okay. With that, we're a couple minutes over. We'll wrap it up. Thank you very much, everyone, and we'll see you
again in October.
