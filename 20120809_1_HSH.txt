MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Hillshire Brands' Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for fiscal 2012. Your lines
have been placed on a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at
this time. I would now like to introduce your first speaker, Ms. Melissa Napier, Treasurer and Senior Vice President of
Investor Relations for Hillshire Farms. Thank you, Melissa, you may begin.
Melissa Napier
Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the first earnings call for our Hillshire Brands company.
Today, I'm joined by our CEO, Sean Connolly; and our CFO, Maria Henry. Sean will provide his perspectives on the
quarter, progress being made on the plans that we provided at Investor Day and some comments around fiscal 2013.
Maria will then discuss segment performance for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year and provide guidance for
fiscal 2013.
I'd like to remind you that in our financial slides, we will only be talking about results through operating segment
income from continuing operations. In connection with the June 28, 2012 spin-off of the company's International
Coffee and Tea business into an independent public company named D.E MASTER BLENDERS 1753, Hillshire
Brands has classified the historic results of its spun-off International Coffee and Tea operations as discontinued
operations.
We issued a press release on August 1 reporting that accounting irregularities involving the previously-reported
financial results for the Brazilian operations of D.E MASTER BLENDERS were discovered, and as a result, D.E
MASTER BLENDERS will restate its previously-issued financial statements. Hillshire Brands also reported that it will
restate its previously-issued financial statements to reflect the impact on its results from discontinued operations. There
is not expected to be a meaningful impact on the results of operating segment income from continuing ops, and the

restatement is not expected to impact Hillshire Brands' fiscal 2013 results. An investigation is being conducted by D.E
MASTER BLENDERS, and as the investigation is still ongoing, we will not be providing additional commentary on
this matter during today's call.
Our results were released at 6:30 a.m. Central time this morning, and you can find that release along with the slides that
we'll be reviewing today posted to our website. We expect our 10-K to be filed by the end of August pending the
completion of the investigation in Brazil.
I'd now like to refer you to the forward-looking statement currently displayed and remind you that during today's call
we may make forward-looking statements about future operations, financial performance, business conditions and our
outlook for 2013. Actual results may differ from those expressed or implied in these statements, and all explanations of
non-GAAP financial measures are included in our release.
You already know that today's discussion will be focused on results for adjusted operating segment income from
continuing ops. I'd like to highlight some other changes that we've made in our reporting to provide our investors with
information that is most reflective of how we manage our business.
As we highlighted at Investor Day, the Aidells and Gallo businesses are now being reported in the Retail segment while
hog and commodity pork and turkey sales are being reported in the Foodservice segment. Our segment names have also
been slightly tweaked. Results from acquisitions are now included in our results from the time of acquisition.
In previous reporting, we had backed out the impact of those sales as a reconciling item between reported and adjusted
results. You'll still see the impact of acquisitions, in this case Aidells, in our earnings release bridges. We are also
discussing total adjusted sales and organic sales performance, which is without acquisition results and excludes changes
in foreign currency movements.
And finally, results for businesses that have been disposed of or exited, such as our Senseo business, are now backed
out of all reported periods. To help you understand the year-over-year changes, earlier this morning, we filed the
current report on Form 8-K that contains our quarterly segment results for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 consistent with
the basis of presentation reported in this release.
We will take your questions after management's prepared remarks conclude. And I'll now turn the call over to our CEO,
Sean Connolly. Sean?
Sean M. Connolly
Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Maria and I are excited to be speaking with you today and to share the
results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 performance. But before I jump into the quarterly results, let me just step
back a minute and frame up the big picture for you. Two months ago, we shared with you our plans to unleash the
potential of our company and drive strong and sustainable shareholder returns. These plans included our vision to
become the most innovative meat-centric food company in the U.S. This growth oriented vision was born of a
clear-eyed recognition that our greatest assets are our brands and that attempting to simply cut our way to prosperity
wouldn't drive a different outcome than we delivered before.
We also outlined the steps that we're taking to realize this vision, steps like upgrading our capabilities and team, fixing
some underperforming businesses, increasing our commitment to advertising and rebuilding the innovation pipeline.
And to fund these investments, we committed to delivering $100 million in cost savings over the next three years.
We were also explicit that fiscal 2013 would be a transition year. In fact, we characterized the three-year plan, fiscal
2013, 2014 and 2015 with the words fix, drive and expand in order to paint a picture of how we expect our plans to
unfold over the mid-term horizon. Now, with the spin behind us, we're aggressively executing against our plans and
incredibly energized about the future.
Now, let's talk the fourth quarter. Q4 came in where we expected overall. Adjusted net sales for continuing operations
were up 3.3% for the quarter and up 4% for the fiscal year, including performance from Aidells. Q4 adjusted operating

segment income declined, mainly attributable to challenges in our Foodservice business, which we will detail for you
on this call. Frankly, I'm encouraged by the big picture and have even more confidence that our disciplined growth
agenda is exactly what's needed for this company. MAP was up again for the quarter as it was for the full year. And
while very early days, I'm encouraged to see that spending done the right way and deployed in the right spots can drive
the business. I've been in the food and beverage space for over 20 years, and it's clear to me today as it's ever been that
a consumer-oriented philosophy backed by a great team and critical analytics can drive differential performance.
As we look at the reporting segments, our retail division clearly performed the best. Specifically in Q4, net sales and
operating income were up 5% and 3.7%, respectively, inclusive of Aidells. Foodservice struggled not only with channel
headwinds in dessert but also with the impact on our sweet baked goods business, stemming from our Tarboro, North
Carolina plant modifications. The net of all of this was a Q4 in Foodservice that saw net sales down 1.2% and adjusted
operating income down nearly 40%. Maria will provide more detail around the drivers of those numbers shortly.
Let me now give you some more texture on the underlying performance of the business and the progress we're making
on several of our key focus areas. In the Retail segment, overall volume trends continued to improve as we've
intensified our focus on price gap management across categories and we lapped the significant price increases put into
place last year. These numbers include the full year F-2012 volumes from Aidells.
Our core brands each had solid fourth quarters. Jimmy Dean had a strong showing in innovation, which I'll touch on in
a bit; Hillshire Farm turned the corner and had positive revenue growth in the quarter; State Fair finished out the year
with solid growth in both volume and revenue; and Aidells and Gallo had double-digit growth in both volume and
sales.
Ball Park had a strong fourth quarter, despite some overall sluggishness in the hot dog category itself. Increased MAP
spend, along with effective merchandising drove strong sales through Memorial Day and leading into the Fourth of
July. Specifically, we increased Ball Park volumes by 4% and sales by 5% versus the prior year. And while we're
happy with Ball Park's performance in quarter 4, we've got our eye on the category's softness as it's indicative of the
need for further innovation in the category. Now speaking of innovation. I should also mention that Ball Park's recent
innovation, the new Flame Grilled Burgers, are performing well in the marketplace and the early repeat data is
encouraging.
Shifting gears to Lunchmeat, our Lunchmeat trends improved in the quarter. You can see that we struggled in the first
nine months of the year, but we had a relatively strong Q4 after we really focused on improving our price gaps. Now
before you get too excited about the magnitude of the point change here, keep in mind that part of the optical strength
you're seeing here is easier comps. In the year-ago period, we gave little support to the business, and the results were
quite weak. So while we're encouraged with the progress in the Hillshire Lunchmeat business, we're quite clear that we
have more work to do, and we are on it.
Now I'll turn to Foodservice. The Meats business actually performed well with volumes benefiting from wins in the
C-store channel and stronger performance in national accounts but Bakery, however, was a different story. I've already
discussed the impacts felt in the quarter from Tarboro. As the capital investments were made in the back half of the
fiscal year, we were off-line from a manufacturing perspective, which impacted our volumes.
Heading into fiscal 2013, I'm happy to report that the capital investments in Tarboro are completed, we're back up and
running, service levels are returning to a steady state. However, we expect to feel some impact into fiscal 2013 as lost
volume may not return immediately and we'll need to reestablish the relationships with customers whom we were not
able to service while undergoing the plant upgrades.
Beyond Tarboro, there continue to be weak industry trends on restaurant dessert consumption. Now to counter this
trend, we're continuing to leverage Consumer Insights and invest in new product innovation, including expanding our
very popular line of pre-sliced pies and adding additional value-added products. This is important because with the
Foodservice portfolio we have today, dessert has to be solid for mix to be solid.
Now let me shift gears again and share with you some of the emerging progress we're making in a few of our most
critical focus areas. My management team is now largely in place. Sally Grimes, our new Chief Innovation Officer,

came on board in July, and she is responsible for strengthening our innovation practices and replenishing an innovation
funnel that, simply put, didn't have enough in it. Sally's a tremendous talent and we're thrilled that she's joined us.
Sean Reid will become our new Chief Customer Officer on August 20. Sean brings over 20 years of classic consumer
packaged goods sales leadership to our team. He's operated through diverse sales models, including broker, warehouse
direct, and he's restructured sales organizations to be more efficient and effective. He's helped with category
management discipline as well.
We're also happy to welcome Denny Belcastro to the team. Denny has over 30 years experience in the industry and
deep relationships across food and beverage. He's responsible for managing customer and industry affairs.
And we've also filled the new Revenue Management role with Curt Balara, who comes from Unilever. Curt and his
team will work hand-in-hand with our marketing and sales organizations to more closely manage trade spend as well as
pricing strategy and execution. We're thrilled to have all of these folks on our team.
We talked about the need to rebuild the innovation pipeline, and those efforts are now gaining traction, and several new
items are hitting the marketplace. As I mentioned earlier, we launched our new Ball Park Flame Grilled Burgers in the
third quarter and supported the overall Ball Park line with MAP in Q4. The burgers have been well received in the
marketplace, exceeding initial demand projections. And we're expanding distribution to meet increased customer
demand for this product as we speak.
The innovation pipeline is also building an Aidells where our all-natural hot dogs and all natural antibiotic-free dry
salami are now in test market. And you'll see these products rolling out more broadly down the road. On Jimmy Dean,
Meat Lovers Bowl is another innovation that's performed well. In fact, Jimmy Dean had a great fourth quarter and the
Jimmy Dean Breakfast Bowls performed very well, with sales up 11.9% versus the prior year, driven largely by the
new Meat Lovers variety.
A few highlights now on what you'll see unfold in the near-term horizon. First, we intend to increase our MAP spend in
2013, and this increased spend will help us further strengthen our core brands as well as support our new innovations.
Expanding into alternate channels is another initiative that we're making progress on. In the fourth quarter, our efforts
in nontraditional grocery channels continued to pay dividends as we gained new or expanded distribution in dollar
channels, convenience stores and club stores. This is another key piece of our growth strategy, and we will continue to
focus on it in fiscal 2013 and beyond.
Within our iconic Hillshire Farm brand, we have a new marketing team fully on board now and they're making good
progress on packaging and product changes. We hired a new advertising agency, Y&R, in the fourth quarter, and the
new advertising campaign will be on the air in the first half of our fiscal year. The new product and package changes I
talked about will follow later. You should also expect to see new news on our State Fair and Jimmy Dean franchises as
we advance our game plan to strengthen our core business.
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maria Henry, our CFO, who will walk you through the overall financial results
for Hillshire Brands and provide additional insights into the performance drivers in our business segments. Maria will
also provide our sales and EPS guidance for fiscal 2013. So Maria?
Maria Henry
Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. For the next few minutes, I'll walk through the fiscal
2012 operating segment results for Hillshire Brands' continuing operations excluding significant items. I will also
provide our fiscal 2013 guidance and comment on some of the assumptions behind the numbers.
Moving on to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 results, I'll make some high-level comments before we get into the
numbers. We had solid results in the fourth quarter that were dampened by issues in our Bakery business. Our volume
growth versus last year was positive, price recovery was positive, and MAP investment increased versus the same
quarter last year.

For the year, I would say that the business posted good results in a difficult environment. Given the headwind of $167
million increase in commodity costs and a tremendous amount of internal change, a return on sales from continuing
operations of 9.8%, though down from fiscal 2011, is a respectable outcome.
Adjusted net sales grew with the help of the Aidells acquisition and year-over-year price increases to cover higher
commodity costs. Successes in many of our brands have been overshadowed by issues we have been working through
in Lunchmeat, Bakery and with generally difficult Foodservice environmental trends. The significant cost reductions
that the business executed in the year, moving to a broker model for a portion of our accounts, major reductions in
G&A and manufacturing Lean savings, helped to protect the bottom line for fiscal 2012, and as Sean just discussed, we
gained some traction exiting the year.
Looking at the numbers, on this slide, you see a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results through operating
segment income for continuing operations.
Adjusted net sales were up 3.3% for the quarter including 1.2% of organic growth. For the year, our adjusted net sales
from continuing operations was up 4% with 1.2% organic growth. In addition to the acquisition of Aidells, our growth
was a result of pricing. I will show you the components of our sales growth in just a moment.
Adjusted gross profit dollars in the fourth quarter were up for the first time this year driven by our Retail segment
behind top-line growth. The adjusted gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of 28.3% was relatively consistent
with the gross margin rate achieved throughout the year.
For the year, the adjusted gross margin declined by 180 basis points from 30.2% to 28.4%. This is primarily a result of
price increases to cover commodity increases, which depresses the gross margin rate by increasing our sales dollars
without delivering associated gross margin dollars.
Our MAP spend was up 16% in the quarter versus last year, but that's against a very low spend last year. On a
percentage of revenue basis, MAP for the fourth quarter was 2.7%, which we consider very low. The major MAP
investment in the fourth quarter was the Ball Park Men-Easier-Fed-Than-Understood campaign, our first significant
media behind this brand in several years. For the year MAP was up 12.9% to $137 million, which is 3.4% of sales,
which is still a low number.
The SG&A in the operating segments for the quarter was up slightly as higher distribution costs offset lower selling
and administrative expenses. For the year, SG&A was down as a result of the cost actions taken in the segment. As
discussed previously, this included reductions across the board through a comprehensive restructuring program. The
benefit of those reductions was partially offset by the absorption of stranded costs and higher distribution costs.
Adjusted operating income for continuing operations for the quarter was $100 million, down 3.1% from last year. For
the year, we delivered $396 million of adjusted operating income, which was down 4.7%.
Looking at the composition of the sales growth by quarter, I draw your attention to the volume line. You see that we
have maintained the volume stability that we achieved in the third quarter, and we're slightly up in Q4.
Higher commodity sales in the fourth quarter was a contributor to our sales growth and, therefore, to our negative mix
which you see below. You can see that the contribution from pricing has diminished as we have lapped many of the list
price increases taken last year. And we have adjusted certain pricing to manage competitive price gaps.
For the quarter, commodities were up $8 million versus last year. Our price recovery against this increase for the
quarter was positive $6 million. We ended the year with only a $5 million negative recovery of the $167 million of
commodity cost increases that we absorbed into our P&L. As you can see on this slide, over the last two years, our
business has absorbed $385 million of commodity cost increases.
Looking at the reporting segments, our Retail business had a good quarter with volume, sales and profit all up versus
last year. Our volume growth benefits from the inclusion of Aidells for a full quarter in fiscal 2012 versus only a partial
quarter in the prior year. Aidells continued to grow its top line at a double-digit rate behind an expansion of their
marketing efforts and continued innovation.

Organic retail volume declined 1% in the fourth quarter. This was in part driven by the earlier timing of Easter in fiscal
2012 versus fiscal 2011. This volume performance is similar to what we saw in Q3 and much better than the first half
for the reasons Sean already discussed: largely, better management of price gaps and improved execution.
Net sales grew for the quarter and for the year from higher pricing to cover commodity increases as well as a favorable
sales mix. In addition to Aidells, Ball Park, Jimmy Dean, and Gallo all performed well in this quarter.
The Retail adjusted operating margin of 11.6% for the quarter and 10.8% for the year were below the prior year.
Consistent with the total company, the lower level of profitability reflects the benefit of lower SG&A costs being offset
by pressure on gross margin from higher commodity costs, higher distribution costs and the higher level of investment
in MAP.
Moving on to Foodservice, you see that the adjusted operating segment profit for the quarter was down 39% versus last
year and down 22% for the year. Clearly, this is a challenging area right now. Foodservice industry conditions remain
difficult, and we continue to see pressure on pricing. In addition, out-of-home consumption of pies and cakes continues
to be down as many consumers pass on dessert. Our approach to this difficult environment has been to maintain market
share and focus on selling differentiated new products like our pre-sliced pies.
Beyond these adverse industry conditions in the fourth quarter, we experienced material product outages and higher
costs as we took our Tarboro, North Carolina cake production plant offline to make some improvements.
These disruptions showed up in the financials as lost sales and higher costs of goods sold. These outages and costs
ended up being more significant than we expected. The good news is now we have a significantly upgraded facility that
we believe will be an advantage as the new standards from the Food Safety Modernization Act become mandatory.
Overall, our volume was up in Foodservice for the quarter. High commodity sales and an increase in Foodservice meat
products more than offset a double-digit decline in Bakery. Despite higher volumes in the fourth quarter, Foodservice
net sales were lower as negative mix and lower pricing offset the increased volume. This pricing was a combination of
the easing of commodity inflation and the ongoing industry pricing pressure. Full year sales increased 2.4% as higher
commodity-driven prices more than offset the industry pricing pressure, mix and relatively flat volumes.
In our Australia Bakery segment, the volume declines you see are in part due to actions to exit unprofitable businesses.
Excluding the impact of FX, net sales were flat in the quarter and down 3.5% for the full year. In the quarter, pricing
and favorable product and channel mix offset the impact of the volume decline.
Operating segment income of $1 million in the quarter and $4 million for the year is up compared to losses in the prior
year. The team in Australia has done a nice job, substantially completing its break from the prior Sara Lee International
operation and getting set up as stand-alone business in a new separate location.
Now let's move on to fiscal year 2013 guidance. I'll begin with a few thoughts on how we think about guidance. At this
time of the year, it's appropriate to provide a financial outlook for our business. We have recently completed our
operating plan for the fiscal year, incorporating what we know at this time. The teams are signed up for their piece of
the plan. As the management team, we're highly committed to deliver our mid-term guidance and the important
milestones along the way. We will be transparent with our investors as we move through the year. We will keep you
abreast of our progress.
When we get to CAGNY in February, we will provide an update on how things are evolving for the strategic
imperatives that are critical to delivering our mid-term financial goals of 4% to 5% sales growth and a 10% operating
margin. We do not intend to provide quarterly guidance. We're committed to doing the right thing to execute our
strategy and create value over time. With that said, our guidance for fiscal 2013 is net sales relatively consistent with
what we achieved in fiscal 2012 and adjusted EPS of $1.40 to $1.55. As stated in the press release, we expect adjusted
operating segment income to be flat to modestly down from fiscal 2012.
Our guidance is influenced by a number of factors. Fiscal 2013 is a transition year. We will execute the strategy that
we've discussed with you, increase our MAP, increase our investment in innovation, fix our troubled areas, and deliver

this year's portion of our cost savings program. We have some heavy lifting to do this year, and a lot of the benefits for
what we expect to get done will show up in the financial results post fiscal 2013.
Our guidance for relatively flat net sales reflects lower pricing on a year-over-year basis, offsetting the benefit of
expected volume growth. Since we last spoke in June, there have been a lot of movements in the commodity market.
The impact of unfavorable weather conditions has contributed to a negative outlook for this year's crop yield. We
believe much of the impact of that will be seen in our business towards the end of this fiscal year, and more
significantly, in fiscal 2014. In the near term, some of the meat commodities that we are most exposed to have
declining prices. So we expect to experience near-term favorability.
For this fiscal year, we expect modest commodity deflation versus last year. And that's what we've built into our
guidance. The timing of exactly how the conditions I discussed a minute ago will flow through the markets and affect
the basket of commodities we purchase will continue to evolve. We currently expect favorable year-over-year
commodities in the first half of the year. If we do experience favorable commodity costs, our Foodservice contracts will
require us to pass a large amount of that on to our customers. For some of our categories, we will have a similar
dynamic on the Retail side.
The expectation for rising commodity costs at the end of this fiscal year and into fiscal 2014 places even more
importance on our strategy to build our brands so that we have the brand strength and pricing power to adjust to
changing input costs.
Our SG&A for fiscal 2013 is expected to be up versus last year. The benefits from cost-saving initiatives will not fully
offset the impact of stranded costs, inflation, and certain other cost increases. We have full line of sight to the $40
million of cost savings we have included in our fiscal 2013 guidance.
Let me finish with some comments on a few other items. On capital allocation, we announced a quarterly dividend of
$0.125 per quarter or $0.50 on an annualized basis, which is in line with the range we previously provided. Along with
our adjusted EPS guidance range, this dividend level equates to a dividend payout ratio of 32% to 36%.
As previously discussed, our initial level of dividend payout was influenced by the legacy cash obligations we need to
fund this year and our desire to maintain flexibility through a transition year. We will evaluate our dividend payout
level on an ongoing basis and assess the opportunities in front of us to optimize overall total shareholder return.
We will have a starting cash balance of $235 million, which is much higher than my expectation of $120 million back
in early June. The higher opening cash balance is primarily due to three things. First, we will have a higher AP balance,
which reflects the timing of purchases and payments. There is no sustainable benefit from this. It's just a timing issue.
Second is the timing of the payment for certain legacy items. Again this represents timing and does not give us a
sustainable benefit. Finally, higher-than-expected foreign currency hedge gains due to the decline in the euro leading up
to the final spin date. This is a real benefit for us and strengthens our net cash position.
With the movement of some legacy cash items, I am updating our legacy cash obligations from $170 million to $190
million to $190 million to $210 million to complete the restructuring plans and other obligations trailing the spin-off
and transition from the prior Sarah Lee Corporation. We have a higher starting cash balance to cover these obligations.
Another update from what I told you in June is that not all of the legacy cash items were able to be booked into the
P&L in fiscal 2012. We anticipate approximately $65 million to $75 million or $0.35 to $0.40 of EPS will be charged
to reported EPS this year related to these legacy obligations. These charges will not impact our adjusted operating
segment income, which is the basis on which we provide guidance. Our opening debt balance of $944 million is in line
with what we expected.
I'll now turn the call back to Sean for some closing comments. Sean?

Thanks, Maria, and thank you all for joining us on our first quarterly call as the new Hillshire Brands Company. In
summary, our entire team is on board, aligned and highly focused on providing an attractive total return proposition to
our shareholders over the medium and long term. We know this is what our shareholders expect and it's what we expect
of ourselves. We intend to deliver this attractive return by combining a competitive dividend with sales and earnings
growth. And by the end of fiscal 2015 we expect sales to be growing at 4% to 5% and to deliver 200 basis points of
operating margin improvement, all supported by a strong balance sheet. I'm confident that by investing in our brands,
focusing on innovation, and operating efficiently, we will be able to create significant value for all of you in the coming
years.
With that, let's open it up to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ken Zaslow. You may ask your question and please
state your company name.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Ken Zaslow, Bank of Montreal.
<A - Maria Henry>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Can you hear me?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. We hear you, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: So, my first question, or the question I was looking at is, I was looking back at the past
slides, it seems like the sales growth outlook has been dampened a little bit in 2013. Is that true, or am I misreading it? I
went back to the old slides, and it looked like you expected volume and sales to be both positive. Now it seems like
you're more expecting it to be flat. Can you talk – is it just the Foodservice side and the Bakery stuff that you
addressed? Or is there something different?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Ken, we've not given guidance on 2013 until today. So as we mentioned back at Investor
Day, we were in the process of rolling up the annual operating plan, working with our board, and that today would be
the first time we unveiled the guidance.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Okay. And can you talk a little bit about how – is there any change to how you think about
2015 relative to the performance in the 2013 outlook?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: No change at all. As we've said, 2013 is a critical year in terms of teeing up fiscal 2015. But
in terms of the degree of difficulty, if that's where you're getting at, our 2015 outlook we believe is stretching but
plausible. And we are entirely focused on the same levers that we're pushing on that we referenced at our Investor Day.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Okay.

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: First off, I'm curious. Thanks for some of the guidance. And the EPS range you laid out is
relatively wide. And again with a lot of the knowns that we have for below the operating line items, it certainly seems
like it would take more than a modest decline in segment operating income to get to the lower end of that EPS range.
So first off, I'm just trying to get a sense, is that a reasonable assessment?
And then more importantly, what is it that we still have, I guess, the least level of comfort or visibility in on the
operating side, as we go through fiscal 2013? Is it that it's the volume piece that's most unknown, the amount of MAP
that you're going to need to spend? Is there something on the cost side that's still a little bit less clear? I just want to get
a sense of where you've got sort of the least and the most visibility that will require that sort of low end of the range
which seems a little bit tougher to get to.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah, let me give you my perspective on that, Andrew, and then we'll ask Maria to chime in
here. But the first thing I'd point out is that we are absolutely unwaveringly committed to do what's necessary to get this
business in a position where it's delivering strong and sustainable results. And that means we're quite clear-eyed in
terms of the things we've got to do this year to strengthen the business. And what we don't want to do is compromise
those things that will deliver sustainable performance over the long term because we're overly focused on the short
term. So we are committed to doing what's going to build long-term success.
Now with that said, I would say, to me, as you look at the range and the size of the range, the piece of it that we should
really focus on is the gross margin piece because we've got our assumptions on gross margin but, again, keep in mind
this is a transition year. So not all of our brands are fully to bright, which means they're not all at the pinnacle of their
strength right now. We've got to make sure that we keep the volumes robust. We've got to make sure we stay
competitive in the marketplace while we take the actions that are going to strengthen these brands over the long haul.
And that's our focus point because ultimately, the margin expansion that we're after over time is really contingent on
improving brand strength so we can have stronger equities and reduce the elasticities such that as we face commodity
headwinds down the road, we've got better pricing power and more strength in our gross margins.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one other one would be, I realize we don't have quarterly
guidance to sort of work with, but given it's sort of a new entity, going forward, I guess if there were anything even
directionally about things we should keep in mind, whether it be in what part of the year certain either launch costs
come into play. Obviously, we've got to think – it sounds like a little bit more back half loaded from a more significant
innovation standpoint, like the Hillshire, just so we can try and get ourselves in the right place from a modeling
perspective and expectations standpoint.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, we've got innovation that's going to sprinkle out throughout the marketplace – into the
marketplace throughout the year. I think, as important as the innovation that's going to hit the marketplace this year, is
the rebuilding of the innovation pipeline. And that is exactly why we brought in Sally Grimes and created a fully
dedicated team because, while we've got new innovations coming in in the marketplace this year, with the old
organization we had in the old days, it was basically equipped to get stuff to market but then not also parallel path the
stuff that would come next. So that's why I described our innovation pipeline as having not been quite robust enough.
So we do have stuff that will flow through the markets. From a modeling standpoint I'd say it flows throughout the
year, but different things obviously coming by quarter. But I think the key piece is that fiscal 2014 and 2015 will really
hinge on the work we're doing right now, and we have lots of good ideas that we're pursuing that we've got to validate
that will come to the marketplace later.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Maria Henry>: And we do have some seasonality in the business that I think you're used to from the segment
reporting with the second quarter and the fourth quarter being stronger quarters.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great. Thanks for that.

Thank you. The next question comes from Akshay Jagdale. You may go ahead with your question, and please state
your company name.
<Q>: KeyBanc Capital Markets. Good morning. This is [ph] Roland Park (38:10) for Akshay. Can you guys hear me?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: We can hear you.
<Q>: Okay, great. My question is on commodities and your outlook. I know your fiscal 2013 outlook assumes a
modest commodity deflation. Can you provide a breakdown of this overall deflation by commodity, like protein versus
the other major sub-segments of your basket? So what commodities do you expect to be up or down? And if you can
provide any color on the order of magnitude that would be very helpful.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: We don't get into detail in terms of which commodity is which. I think when we say we
expect commodities to be modestly deflationary, we're really talking about commodities there, not total costs.
Obviously, below the line costs we would expect to be modestly inflationary as we've already talked, but we don't
break it out by piece. So that's a level of detail that we won't get into.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you. And just a follow-up. How has your outlook changed over the last month, month-and-a-half as
a result of the drought in the Midwest?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I think the key to the drought, I know it's on everybody's mind right now, is that the
recent drought and heat events are no doubt going to impact commodity prices over time, but we currently see this as
more of a back half of fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2014 issue. And it really has to do with the cycle times associated with
raising different livestock species. So we expect the grain prices to roll through the proteins later not sooner.
<Q>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Alexia Howard. You may go ahead with your question, and please state your
company name.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Yes. It's Sanford Bernstein. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Can I ask about the MAP spending outlook? You mentioned that 3.4% for fiscal 2012
was low. I think you talked at the Investor Day about aspirations to increase that. How much do you intend to increase
it, ballpark, in fiscal 2013? And can you give us an idea of what the long-term percentage of sales might be?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well for fiscal 2015, when we come out of fiscal 2015, we talked about a MAP spend target
in the ballpark of 5%. That translates to a Retail division MAP spend of about 6%. And as I've said before, I wouldn't
go ahead and even spend across our brands. I think the principle we've got with respect to MAP is we've got to be
really focused on ROI. It's got to be MAP that has impact. So when I talked before around it's encouraging to see MAP
working, it's the right advertising and marketing work in the right spots on the right businesses.
So we had Ball Park in Q4 in a position where we were confident that it was ready for MAP spend. And what we saw
from that MAP spend in combination with our typical seasonal merchandising was good impact. We've seen the same
kind of thing from MAP on Jimmy Dean in the past. And as we've said, we are hard at work now trying to get our other
key equities in a position where they are equally ready to take on a MAP spend. Hillshire Farm and Hillshire Farm
Lunchmeat in particular is the one that we are hustling to work on. In terms of the flow of MAP by brand and the level,
obviously for competitive reasons, I don't want to tip my hand there. But you should expect that we will migrate toward
that 5%. And when we're confident that we can spend it prudently, we will spend it.

<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great. And just a quick follow-up on the sales growth, building on Ken's question.
You've mentioned that the sales are likely to be flat this year. What does that mean for organic sales growth? Is it
because of the timing of the dispositions in Foodservice and you do expect to see some organic sales growth? And are
we expecting to see positive volume and maybe price flat to down? Or how will that play out this year?
<A - Maria Henry>: Yeah. We expect our volumes to be up slightly. And in terms of organic growth, we had the
impact of the Aidells acquisition in fiscal 2012. And that's where we get the difference on the organic side. We have
not built any acquisitions into our guidance for fiscal 2013. So the comments would all be organic.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: I'd just add, underlying the volume Maria talks about, keep in mind as we had talked before,
we have some businesses that are clicking along quite nicely. We have other businesses that we know we've got some
challenges on. Those businesses we don't expect to be growing volumes right out of the gate. Those are the ones that
we've got product work to do, packaging work to do. And we will flow those through, through the course of the year so
we can rely on stronger volumes into the future.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Goldman. You may go ahead with your question. And please state your
company name.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Hi, everyone. JPMorgan. I'm still not 100% sure how to make the math work from your
guidance. If you're putting the segment EBIT at similar or down slightly year-on-year. And if you're still expecting
similar corporate expense year-on-year, then why would your EPS be down at the low end of guidance so much?
Maybe it's stranded costs? But if it's that, won't stranded costs be in the corporate expense line? Won't higher MAP be
either in each individual segment or in the corporate expense line? I'm just hoping for a little clarification on some of
the costs next year and how do you get from that similar EBIT number to down EPS, which is not down by an
insignificant amount, perhaps.
<A - Maria Henry>: We have a number of things. You mentioned stranded costs. Stranded costs are in the operating
segments. Those show up in the P&L both in cost of goods and also in SG&A, and so that affects our fiscal 2013
guidance as we had discussed. We have – there's a few other puts and takes for fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 related to
some one-time favorability that we had in fiscal 2012 that won't repeat, that we don't plan to repeat in fiscal 2013. With
the – then we had some changes in the way that our compensation worked that will increase our compensation expense
for fiscal 2013 that we didn't have in fiscal 2012. So there are some miscellaneous year-over-year cost items that will
hit us in SG&A in addition to the regular inflation in the business and the stranded costs that we will be absorbing in
fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Okay. I'll follow up with that offline, but then one follow-up. I'm still a little confused also about
what was your total company EBIT margin in 2012 versus what you expect it to be in 2013? Not just segments but
including everything: corporate expense, stranded costs, everything you just mentioned. Because if I assume $70
million in corporate expense last and $70 million next year I'm getting about an 8.1% EBIT margin last year and a
range of about 7.3% to 7.8% next year. Is that accurate, first of all? And if so, you previously guided total company
EBIT in 2013 to being a lot like it was in 2012. So I'm curious if there was a change there or whether maybe I didn't
hear that right the first time.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. On the fiscal 2012 numbers, when we file our K, you'll have all the information and at that
point, I'll be happy to talk through what you see in the K and reconcile that back to the basis that we're providing today
so that I can seek completely to cue those numbers. The comment that I made at Investor Day, while I noted we were
not providing guidance as we still had a few months until we got to a point where we were providing official guidance,
I did say that the expectation at that point was that fiscal 2013 would look a lot like fiscal 2012 in terms of the bottom

line. So a number of factors have evolved. We're smarter on what we think will be happening in the commodity
markets. And the other point is on the range, and this gets back to an earlier question of having a $0.15 range, we are
providing ourselves some room and flexibility to ensure that we can remain focused on doing the right things for
building value in the long term. And also some flex as the commodity markets and our opportunities for investment
evolve throughout the year.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: And I'd just add a little bit of color to that as well. Again, we are squarely focused on where
we need this business to be in 2015 so that it can deliver sustainable shareholder return. What we don't want to do is
give our shareholders a Pyrrhic victory where we come in at the high end of the range but we've not taken the steps
necessary so that we can sustain that performance year in, year out.
So we are again very committed that there are certain things we must do to the business this year in the area of R&D, in
the area of innovation, in the area of brand building that are going to be essential to future performance. We need to
give ourselves the flexibility to see those things through, regardless of what comes our way because that will be critical
to going forward. And as Maria said, we intentionally didn't give specific guidance back on Investor Day because a lot
was moving around then. We are much clearer in terms of where things are settling out now.
+On the year, again, commodities are mildly deflationary. But the magnitude of that favorability diminished somewhat
since we were at Investor Day. So again, keeping our commitment to the mid-term guidance really is the top priority
and knowing the actions we need to take, we believe that this range is the right range when you think about what's
necessary for long-term success.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: And, Sean, really that makes sense. And I do appreciate that. I just want to make sure I'm
hearing Maria correctly. So the guidance that was previously at 2012 would look a lot like 2013. You are backing off
that a little bit and saying that the guidance will look a little bit lighter on the EBIT margin side next year than what you
previously thought. Is that right?
<A - Maria Henry>: The guidance that I've given today is that it will be flat to down slightly.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: But the margin side is no longer a lot alike? Correct?
<A - Maria Henry>: Yeah, it's -
<Q - Ken Goldman>: You previously said the margin would look like it did last year. That's no longer a fair
statement. Is that right?
<A - Maria Henry>: The only thing I provided guidance on today is the operating margin. And I'll be happy to
reconcile it for you when I've got the 10-K out to what it was on a comparable basis for last year.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Okay. Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Maria Henry>: No problem.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Ramey. You may go ahead with your question, and please state your
company name.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: Good morning. It's D. A. Davidson. I'm just wondering about – you seem to be confident
that you can file the K at the end of the month, which is great, but some other restatement situations that we've been
through, we've had to wait a little bit longer for filings. What is it that makes you comfortable that you will be
relatively or exactly on time with the filings?
<A - Maria Henry>: The investigation that is ongoing by D.E MASTER BLENDERS is well underway, and our
ability to file on time is dependent on us getting the financial results from D.E MASTER BLENDERS so that we can
incorporate that into our filings as discontinued operations. And so while we don't control the investigation, at this

point, it is our understanding that the investigation will be completed in enough time to allow D.E MASTER
BLENDERS to provide us with its financial information that we need to include in our 10-K. Obviously, that is –
nothing's definitive until the investigation is complete and D.E has had the opportunity to understand all of those
financial impacts to get the financials done.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: Is there – and I assume the auditors are going to take some time to review that as well as
review the previous financial statements. Is there a full-on forensic audit being launched here? I assume so since there
was apparent fraud or misstatements.
<A - Maria Henry>: As I'm sure you can appreciate, I am not going to comment on the D.E MASTER BLENDERS
investigation. I would encourage you to direct any questions to the D.E MASTER BLENDERS team.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: Sure. Yeah. I just was concerned about your ability to file. I know you're not specifically
wanting to discuss specific commodities but I can understand why sows might go down a bit and that's important to the
Jimmy Dean product line. But wouldn't most of the rest of your product line be more sensitive to products that will be
hitting a little higher rather than a little lower? Can you maybe just flesh that out a bit?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, obviously the drought is having an impact on a lot of things, but what ends up
happening is you end up seeing animals getting taken to market and that can actually increase supply in the short term
and then it has a lag effect in terms of the supply being light down the road. So that's essentially – and that's also true of
beef, where you see the pasture land is quite stressed right now. So that's the dynamic that you tend to see where it
might seem counterintuitive, but you've got grain issues and corn issues in the short term, but you've got supply being
increased because you're seeing the – more animals are liquidated.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: Great. Thanks.

Thank you. The next question comes from Amanda English (sic) [Jason English] (52:47). You may go ahead with your
question and please state your company name. Ms. (sic) [Mr.] English (52:55), your line is open.
<Q - Jason English>: Thanks, guys. Yeah. Can you hear me?
<A - Maria Henry>: Hey, Jason.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: We can hear you now.
<Q - Jason English>: This is not Amanda. This is Jason. Thank you, guys, for the questions. Sorry for the pause; I was
a little confused there for a moment. So I – geez – I guess like Ken, I'm confused on how you make that guidance math
work, but it feels like we've beaten that pretty good. I'd like to ask some questions on innovation. Ball Park, when you
guys hosted your Analyst Day, I think you mentioned that your push into frozen was very much in test market phase
right now. Can you update us on the progress of that test market and where you stand in terms of national roll-out? Or
when we can expect national roll-out?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, we've got a variety of Ball Park items that are in market right now on a bit of a limited
distribution basis and that's intentional because it speaks to our philosophy around really making sure we have
empirical evidence on our innovations before we put big dollars behind them and scale them up.
The burger launch that I referred to in my comments earlier is farther along and it gained traction quickly and it began
to roll out into increasing distributions as we were moving through Q4. So we've got evidence on that now that says
we're confident. We will continue to work that and we're currently working through increasing our supply so we can
get that to market.
Our other products that we shared at Investor Day on Ball Park are very early days, too early for me to comment on
prudently and try to inspire a lot of confidence. But suffice it to say, I like what I see so far and that's just the beginning

of our overall innovation agenda.
<Q - Jason English>: Okay, thanks. And sticking with innovation, Hillshire Brands or the Hillshire brand specifically
in sliced lunchmeat, you didn't have a lot of innovation ready at the Analyst Day. We're still not seeing any today. Any
updates in terms of when we can expect to see what's next for that brand in sliced lunchmeat?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yes, it's a multi-phase action plan that we're executing in our lunchmeat business, Jason. As
we saw in quarter four, the first step was to really get our price gaps right. So to give you an example, our large
family-size lunchmeat at the beginning of last fiscal year was at about a $0.50 gap to Oscar Mayer, who is the closest
branded competitor. That gap nowadays is closer to $0.15 and therefore you start to see the volumes stabilize because
the products are very competitive. Step two is really around product quality and packaging, and while I don't want to
tip my hand to competition as to exactly when it's going to hit the marketplace, it will be towards the back half of the
year.

Thank you. We do have another question. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please. The next question comes from
Robert Moskow. You may ask your question and please state your company name.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. It's Credit Suisse. Maria, I think you said that you raised your estimate for one-time
payments related to the split-up of the company, you raised it about $20 million. I don't think I heard you say why. And
is that $20 million pretty much consistent with the extra cash that you said is related to the – I think it was currency? Or
is it different? Thanks.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. Two parts to that question. On the legacy items, I took it up by $20 million and that is
because not all of the items got paid out in fiscal 2012 that I expected to be paid out in fiscal 2012. So some of them
spill over into fiscal 2013 and so that affects those things, the higher legacy cash obligations that we start out with but
also that is part of the higher cash balance that we're starting out with.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. And a follow-up. As you look at fiscal 2014, you said that your dividend payout ratio is
starting out at a low level because of the legacy payments. If fiscal 2013 pretty much gets delivered the way you think
it's going to be delivered, does that still open up the door for fiscal 2014 for a payout hike? And to what extent does
commodities and working capital requirements play into that decision?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, it's clearly an option, as we've talked before. We have no desire to build a cash war
chest on this business. We've got several good options that we believe can drive shareholder return, including
increasing the dividend over time. And as soon as we've got some clarity in terms of which of those choices we've
aligned with the board on, we will be back and we will share it with our investors.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Just, Sean, wanted to get a perspective on what you're assuming for the competitive
environment or just the market over the next year and maybe even into 2014. And I guess if there's a potential that
there's going to be some near-term commodity protein cost disinflation and then potentially reinflation let's say a year
out, is there a chance that the market gets price competitive in the near term to try to take advantage of some of those
lower input costs? And if so, how is your plan – does your plan at all anticipate that that's a potential scenario for this
year? And I guess tied to that, just given the prospect for more inflation in the future, do you think that'll moderate
some of the competitive behavior in the near term?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: We are trying to build a culture here that increasingly has what I would describe as a
productive paranoia, which means we're always trying to anticipate what our competition is going to do. Unfortunately,
they don't tell us what they're going to do so we never bat a thousand on that one, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if we
see certain competitors in certain categories taking a more aggressive stance than other competitors in other categories.
We've got to prepared for that. The way I think about, and it's come up a couple times on the call, the range of the
guidance we've given is that the higher end of the range of the guidance we've given puts us at a profitability that is
very close to where we were last year.
We want to preserve some flexibility to respond to competition, we want to preserve flexibility to continue to make the
MAP investments we need to make, and we want to preserve some flexibility to make the innovation investment we
need to make because the ultimate return on those investments, measured in the fullness of time, will be significantly
greater than not taking those actions and trying to force, shoehorn ourselves into the top end of the range should certain
curve balls come our way. That's the simplest way I can describe how I think about the range, and I think it speaks back
to your question around trying to anticipate competitive actions.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: That's very helpful. And do you feel like today you've got the organization in a position to be
more on your front foot if the competitive environment does change versus maybe what's occurred historically?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: I absolutely do. I feel extremely good about the caliber of my team overall, the way we put
together this team with some of the best people in the industry and the level of managers below them. I feel excellent
about the caliber of the talent, and in particular, I talked at Investor Day about a new revenue management team we put
in place, and that team really has two responsibilities. One is to help us manage this very large trade spend budget more
efficiently, and we're well on our way there. The other piece of it is to – we always have a clear visibility to
commodities, but where we had some trouble in the past is being flat footed in pricing against those commodities and
not fully taking into account the category, pack size, channel, price points, thresholds, price gaps, all of that stuff. It's a
highly analytical process. And the key is you've got to act quickly, and you've got to be ahead of it. You can't be
sluggish and then overreact, because that's not good for our business. So the new revenue management team and this
fellow we've brought in, Curt Balara, who will be joining us shortly, will be on that. The balance of this team that he's
inheriting is now in place, and I feel very good about what that team is going to do for us.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Ken Goldman. And there are no further questions at this time.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Hi. I'm interested in your comments about based on your contracts having to pass on some of
your cost deflation. That's not just to Foodservice but also to Retail. That surprised me a bit, because I was under the
impression, I still am, that you're much more of a branded food manufacturer than a protein company. But passing on
cost deflation is something that protein companies do, right, not packaged food companies. So can you help me maybe
understand a little bit better what percent of your Retail business is more of this price-through model, which is
somewhat less attractive? And maybe what percent will have more sustainable pricing no matter what the underlying
commodities do? Thanks.

<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, as we broke out for you at Investor Day, there are really three buckets that you can
break our portfolio into. Out of the $4 billion revenue base, there's about $600 million that's more or less unbranded,
more commoditized. There's a big bucket that we call branded meal components that is somewhere in about the
30%-ish gross margin range, that's about $2.7 billion. We've got about another $7 billion worth of business that are
what we call branded ready meals, that's into the mid-30%s there. What we're talking about here, Ken, is that you never
can anticipate what competition's going to do. We have lots of branded competitors. On occasion, they too, like to seize
the moment and try to pursue volume, so they can get the operating leverage out of their plants. We've got to be in a
position to defend our business. We also get tremendous operating leverage out of our plants. And by the way, it varies
by category. So it's not, within the Retail business there'll be a difference between some categories than others. I won't
specifically talk to specific competitors or specific categories, but we've got to be fleet of foot. Overall, we
unmistakably have a branded portfolio, and we will continue to drive the migration to the higher margin, more branded
end of the spectrum as we innovate.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Thank you very much.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: All right. I think that's it. Melissa, do you want to wrap it up?
