And finally, unless we say otherwise references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the
second quarter of fiscal year 2013 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.
And with that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar
Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today.
This morning we reported second quarter revenue for $4.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91,
both representing growth of 3%.
Our Q2 revenue growth was in line with our outlook for the year and we are performing at or better than the market in
almost every one of our business lines. Q2 also represents another quarter where our overall organization delivered
balanced growth with strong performances in some areas offsetting challenges in other parts of our business.
Looking ahead we are confident that our three primary strategies: therapy innovation, globalization, and economic
value will position us well to thrive in the transforming healthcare environment. This quarter we made significant
progress in a number of new therapy growth drivers that we intend to launch over the coming quarters. These,
combined with our continued focus on globalization and economic value will not only help us improve our competitive
position and overall growth profile but will also further strengthen and geographically diversify our business allowing
us to reliably deliver consistent growth.
As you will recall, in Q1 I discussed three specific challenges that negatively affected our growth and that we believed
would improve going forward: U.S. Diabetes, U.S. Pain-Stim and U.S. ICDs. I am pleased to report that they have
made significant progress in all three businesses.
First in U.S. Diabetes we received FDA approval in late September for our MiniMed 530G system, several months
earlier than we estimated in August. Our diabetes team executed well, ramping up manufacturing in a short period of
time to start shipping in mid-October. While we are still somewhat supply constrained as we transition our full
manufacturing to Puerto Rico early signs are that the 530G system is going to be a big success in the market and we
expect our U.S. Diabetes business to grow in the mid-teens and contribute approximately 100 basis points to overall
Medtronic growth in the back half of the fiscal year.
Second, in U.S. Pain-Stim you will recall that we received FDA approval for our innovative MRI SureScan spinal cord
stimulator much earlier than expected. While this resulted in supply constraints last quarter and for the first two months
of Q2 our Neuro team diligently worked through these issues and is now executing the full product launch. The early
response from the market is impressive. U.S. Pain-Stim grew in the mid-teens in the final month of the quarter and we
expect this level of growth to continue, contributing roughly 40 basis points to overall Medtronic growth in the second
half of the year.
Third, in U.S. ICDs you will recall that our Q1 results were affected by lower levels of bulk sales because of the
phase-in timing of our new high-power products, which as we anticipated, resolved itself in Q2. Customers continued
to adopt our latest generation devices, Viva and Evera, helping us by our estimation to gain share sequentially. Equally
important, our ICD pricing, which has been down in the low to mid-single-digits for several quarters, was actually flat
in Q2 based on the strength of our latest generation devices.
In addition to these improved performances, Surgical Technology delivered another outstanding quarter growing 11%.
All three of the businesses, ENT, Neurosurgery and Advanced Energy continue to execute and deliver solid growth. In
particular I'd like to recognize Advanced Energy, which grew over 20% again this quarter. This is becoming a very
important business for us with cross-selling opportunities in Spine, Ortho in CRDM.

Advanced Energy was formed from the first two acquisitions at the beginning of my tenure as CEO and the business
has been delivering strong double-digit growth in the five consecutive quarters since the first anniversary of these
acquisitions. These results illustrate that when we combine diligent strategic rationale, strong integration plans and
solid execution we can generate significant returns on investment.
In Q2 our organization delivered on the bottom line despite multiple pressures. The most significant departure from
expectations was in our gross margin. It is important to note, though, that pricing was in line with expectations and did
not affect our Q2 gross margin performance. Instead we can point to three distinct issues.
First, FX pressure negatively affected the gross margin by 50 basis points. Second, the manufacturing ramp of a
number of new products caused higher levels of scrap and obsolescence, which had a negative impact of 20 basis
points. And third, as we mentioned last quarter, we aggressively continue to reallocate engineering resources to
promptly and comprehensively address the specific quality issues outlined in our Neuromodulation and Diabetes
warning letters. This resulted in a shift to spending from R&D to cost of goods sold thereby negatively affecting our Q2
gross margin by 40 basis points. While diverting these resources is costly, ensuring the highest level of quality and
regulatory compliance has and always will be a personal priority for me and a central focus of everything that we do at
Medtronic.
In the first half of our fiscal year we generated over $1.8 billion of free cash flow and over the next five years we
expect to generate over $25 billion of free cash flow. Our organization remains focused on improving our already
robust levels of free cash flow generation.
For example, we continue to make progress on our working capital improvement program with the goal of increasing
our inventory turns by 50% by FY 2017. We're committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases, a commitment level we believe is appropriate given our current mix of U.S.
and international free cash flow.
As you know, this mix continues to be constrained by U.S. tax policy, which creates a negative incentive for us to
repatriate cash to the U.S. The remaining 50% gives us the flexibility to make the necessary investments for sustainable
growth.
We continue to be very disciplined in how we deploy our capital with a strong focus on returns. Our potential M&A
transactions must not only be strategically aligned, but they must also stand up to the high standards of growth
surpassing our mid-teens, risk-adjusted hurdle rate, as well as minimizing the dilutive impact to shareholder EPS
growth expectations. As we look ahead we not only have a number of near and mid-term growth opportunities, but we
also have some challenges to overcome.
First, in Japan our team has done an incredible job driving growth over the past four quarters on the strength of several
product launches in our Cardiac and Vascular group. However, we will now be facing a period of difficult
year-over-year comparisons from these product launches, as well as the biennial R-Zone pricing adjustments that are
anticipated to go into effect in April. As a result, Japan, which contributed significantly to our total company growth in
the first half of the fiscal year, is now expected to have closer to flat growth in the second half.
Next, our BMP business continues to be challenged. In Q2 this business declined 17%, which was worse than we were
expecting. We continue to stand behind this product based on its safety and efficacy profile in approved indications.
However, the product remains under pressure as some surgeons continue to reduce their usage through both patient
selection and the use of smaller kits. We continue to analyze the key drivers behind the customer purchasing decisions
[indiscernible] (09:48), and we are urgently examining initiatives to optimize the strength of BMP in both the U.S. and
international markets. However, given that BMP has yet to show signs of stabilization, if current revenue trends
continue for the remainder of the fiscal year, BMP revenue would decline in the mid-teens for FY 2014, similar to the
decline we experienced in FY 2013.
Finally, our emerging market growth in Q2 was 13%. While this performance is respectable and these markets continue
to contribute a large portion of our overall company growth, our overall results this quarter were well short of our
targeted levels. Across our emerging market regions there have been a number of region specific challenges, including

product registration issues and distributor conversions, which have held back our growth. We experienced overall
slower growth this quarter with the largest sequential slowing occurring in greater China and Central and Eastern
Europe.
In greater China our results were affected by the phasing of new CRDM products, the discontinuation of a distributor
relationship in CVG and slower overall markets in CRDM and orthopedics. In Central and Eastern Europe, which has
been tracking above 20% in eight of the past nine quarters, growth was in the mid-teens in Q2, primarily due to Russia
where slowing GDP growth along with some major fiscal funding constraints are negatively affecting health care
budgets.
Looking at emerging markets in total, I realize that over the past few quarters our growth rates have modestly slowed.
However, the fundamental demand in the end markets remains strong, and there are several initiatives in place to
capitalize on these opportunities. We remain confident that growth rates will improve and that emerging markets
represent a significant long-term opportunity.
As we look into the future, we're convinced that our three strategic priorities: therapy innovation, globalization and
economic value, will position us well to thrive in the transforming health care environment. I'd like to update you on
each of these strategies.
Starting with therapy innovation, it is important to note that Medtronic's ability to create innovative therapies in new
markets is fundamental to our overall growth strategy and is a strategy that is deeply rooted in our culture, one that
we're extremely proud of, and an area where we have a proven track record of executing. As we look ahead, we're on
the verge of bringing a number of new therapies to market over the coming quarters. In addition to our recently
launched Viva CRT-D, Evera ICD and Advisa MRI pacemaker products, the CRDM business intends to launch the
Reveal LINQ in Q4. This is our next-generation implantable loop recorder, which will further expand our footprint
upstream in cardiac diagnostics.
In Spine, we continue to work with the FDA to bring our next-generation cervical disc, Prestige LP, to the U.S. market,
and we expect to follow that launch with a series of cervical plate launches in FY 2015.
In Neuromodulation, the Pain-Stim business will build upon the U.S. launch of RestoreSensor MRI, by continuing its
global rollout with a Q3 launch in Japan. In Surgical Technologies, we're developing a full pipeline of new power
imaging and navigation equipment that improves the economic value proposition for hospitals.
In Diabetes, in addition to the ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G system with the Enlite sensor, our
next-generation insulin pump system, the MiniMed 640G, remains on track for launch by the end of the fiscal year.
And finally, we're making excellent progress on three fundamentally new therapy areas that meaningfully impact our
outlook for FY 2015 and beyond: our CoreValve transcatheter aortic valve, our Symplicity Flex renal denervation
system for treatment-resistant hypertension and our IN.PACT Admiral drug-eluting balloon. All three of these products
are market leaders in Europe and we are planning to launch all of them in the U.S. over the coming quarters.
CoreValve for extreme risk patients is now expected to launch late this fiscal year; CoreValve for high risk patients in
mid FY 2015; Symplicity Flex in late FY 2015 and IN.PACT Admiral in early FY 2015. Suffice it to say, we have set
ourselves up to deliver what is arguably one of the strongest launch cadences of innovative therapies in our industry
and while innovative therapies are central to our success and have fueled growth for our industry for decades, they are
no longer enough.
In order to unlock the full potential of Med Tech in the transforming healthcare environment, we are taking meaningful
action in the areas of globalization and economic value. We believe successful execution in both of these areas will
position us to win in the changing healthcare marketplace and will be instrumental in establishing durability in our
long-term performance while creating potential upside to our baseline expectations.
With globalization the key to sustainable growth in emerging markets will be addressing the barriers of access to
life-saving medical technology. We've had teams in place for several quarters focused on identifying local
opportunities in all of our geographies to remove the barriers to awareness and training.

In CVG [Cardiac and Vascular Group], programs like Healthy Heart for All are generating results. In RTG [Restorative
Therapies Group] we have four spine product development offices set up and running in Europe, China, Japan and
India, focused on adapting spine products for the local market. Additionally in China we developed [indiscernible]
(15:34) a cranial plating system that in 18 months went from design in Shanghai to manufacturing in Changzhuo and is
now being launched by our Surgical Technologies sales force under the Kanghui brand. While this is a small product
line, it is symbolic of the type of local innovation we want to do across all of our businesses.
Likewise, our organization is focused on incorporating economic value into all functions, businesses and geographies.
We are collaborating with a broader set of stakeholders in developing new business models that deliver economic value
to these stakeholders. Essentially, we are moving from being accountable for a product to being accountable for an
outcome. The industry is still early in this process but we are leading this effort and have targeted two important areas
where we can immediately offer solutions for healthcare systems around the world; disease management and hospital
efficiency.
In disease management the integration activities of our Cardiocom acquisition are progressing well. With Cardiocom,
we intend to pair our existing market leading therapies with a set of complementary services and technology solutions
to more effectively treat broader patient populations across the care continuum. These services and solutions offer
benefits that are particularly compelling to the broader set of healthcare decision-makers including governments, payers
and hospital systems.
One such solution that Cardiocom is developing is called Re-30, a cost-effective 30-day readmission reduction program
that is focused on minimizing heart failure readmission penalties which hospitals in the U.S. are increasingly focused
on trying to address.
Another area where we're exploring solutions for healthcare systems is hospital efficiency and this has led to the
formation of our new hospital solutions business in Europe. Hospital solutions has a unique service offering whereby
we enter into long-term contracts with hospitals to upgrade and more effectively manage their cath lab and hybrid
operating groups. This is expected to result in wins for all stakeholders: the hospital sees an improvement in cath lab
efficiency and profitability; physicians get access to the latest technology that can lead to better patient outcomes and
Medtronic benefits not only through the increased use of our technology but also through incremental service revenue,
reduced pricing pressure, better inventory management, and more efficient use of our service personnel.
While it is still early, we already have five accounts under long-term contracts for cath lab managed services
representing approximately $300 million in revenue over a seven-year time horizon. We are particularly encouraged by
the positive reaction in the market to our offering and that there is a solid pipeline of potential deals.
Ultimately medical technology has the potential to transform healthcare from being a cost burden for most societies
today to an economic driver. Nations can achieve a long-term economic advantage by utilizing medical technology to
more effectively and efficiently restore health to the sick and manage chronic disease to keep their populations healthy,
allowing more people to be contributing members to society.
While we realize this opportunity will certainly be a big challenge, it is one where Medtronic has the capabilities and
the intention to lead. Our market-leading products, in-hospital footprint, healthcare economics expertise, Lean Sigma
resources and financial strength give us unprecedented breadth, global reach and scale allowing us to offer broad
valuable solutions. We're determined to transform Medtronic from being primarily a device provider today into the
premier global medical technology solutions partner of tomorrow.
Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results before we take your questions.
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar. Second quarter revenue of $4.194 billion increased 2.4% as reported or 3.3% on a constant currency

Q2 revenue results by region were as follows: growth in Middle East and Africa was 21%; Central and Eastern Europe
grew 14%; growth in Greater China was 11%; Latin America grew 10%; growth in Japan was 8%; South Asia grew 6%
and the growth in Other Asia-Pacific was 4%. The U.S. grew 2% and growth in Western Europe and Canada was 1%.
Emerging markets grew a combined 13% in Q2 and represented 12% of our total sales mix.
Q2 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.91, an increase of 3.4%. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per
share were $0.89, an increase of 41%. This quarter's non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments included a $24 million certain
litigation charge related to two previously disclosed government investigations in our CRDM and Diabetes business as
well as patent litigation in our Coronary business.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group revenue of $2.199 billion grew 4% with all businesses contributing to growth.
CRDM revenue of $1.273 billion grew 5%, which included $11 million from our recent acquisition of Cardiocom that
is recognized in our AF and other revenue line.
Worldwide ICD revenue of $713 million grew 4%. We estimate that both the global and U.S. ICD markets grew 3%. If
you look at the first half of our fiscal year we estimate both the global and U.S. ICD markets grew 1%, which is
encouraging and reflects continued stability. In addition, we estimate we gained a point of ICD share in international
markets and we held share in the U.S. in this time period.
Our top technology tiers are now significantly differentiated in the marketplace. Both Viva and Evera feature enhanced
shock reduction algorithms including our proprietary Lead Integrity Alert, which the FDA recently approved for
monitoring competitors' defibrillation leads when connected to our devices. Our Viva CRT-D also has proprietary
adaptive CRT algorithm, which has been clinically proven to improve CRT response rates resulting in a reduction in
heart failure hospitalizations.
In addition, in a late breaking clinical trial at the Heart Failure Society of America meeting in September, adaptive CRT
technology was shown to reduce the risk of AF in heart failure patients by nearly 50%. Both Viva and Evera also have
battery and capacitor design improvements to extend our industry-leading device longevity.
Pacing revenue of $477 million grew 2%, outperforming the global market by nearly 200 basis points. In the U.S.
Pacing declined 1% year-over-year as we continue to see the trend of stabilization in this business. The Advisa MRI
pacemaker continues to drive share gains in the U.S. on both a sequential year-over-year basis.
In a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Heart Association meeting yesterday results from the MINERVA trial
were presented which showed in a large trial of over 1,000 patients with sinus node dysfunction and a history of atrial
tachycardias that our proprietary pacemaker features, MVP [Managed Ventricular Pacing] and reactive ATP
[antitachycardia pacing], significantly slowed the progression to permanent atrial fibrillation by 61% compared to
patients with standard pacemakers. Looking ahead, assuming stabilization continues in the back half of our fiscal year,
U.S. Pacing would add approximately 30 to 40 basis points to overall Medtronic growth in FY 2014 compared to FY
2013.
AF Solutions grew in the mid-teens as we continued to gain share in the AF market driven by our Arctic Front Advance
Cryoballoon System, which grew over 20%. Customers continue to adopt this second generation system due to its more
efficient, safe, and effective treatment for paroxysmal AF. Looking ahead we intend to launch our next-gen phased RF
product, PVAC Gold, in Europe before the end of the fiscal year.
Coronary revenue of $427 million grew 1%. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $274 million including $103
million in the U.S. and $25 million in Japan. While DES pricing remains under pressure we continue to gain DES share
on a sequential and year-over-year basis both globally and in the U.S. Our Resolute Integrity deliverability, positive
data regarding early duel anti-platelet therapy interruption and unique FDA labeling for diabetes and long-term clinical
performance is receiving strong customer acceptance globally despite competitive product launches of next-generation
products.
In renal denervation while revenue continues to be modest we are investing in developing referral networks,
reimbursement, technology development and clinical and economic evidence to further strengthen our leadership

position for this large, long-term opportunity in hypertension. We're anticipating the full launch of our next-generation
Symplicity Spyral multi-electrode catheter before the end of the fiscal year.
On the clinical front we enrolled our first patient earlier this month in our Symplicity HTN-4 trial, which is focused on
expanding the indication to include uncontrolled hypertension patients with a systolic pressure between 140 and 160
millimeters of mercury. We expect the result of the HTN-3 U.S. pivotal study to be presented this coming spring.
In Structural Heart, revenue of $281 million increased 4% driven by strong growth in our transcatheter valve franchise.
We had an outstanding showing at TCT, where data for our CoreValve U.S. pivotal trial for extreme risk patients were
presented. The trial met its primary and secondary endpoints and the results were exceptionally positive with a low rate
of major stroke, low rate of aortic regurgitation that improved over time, and no association of mild or moderate
residual paravalvular leaks on late mortality.
The FDA decided it will conduct separate reviews for the extreme and high-risk studies and it also determined that no
panel review is necessary for extreme risk approval. Given these developments we now expect U.S. approval of
CoreValve for extreme risk patients by the end of this fiscal year.
For high-risk patients, we continue to expect FDA approval in mid FY 2015. We've also started our CoreValve Evolut
R study of our next-generation recapturable TAVI system that features the EnVeo InLine Sheath, a 14 French
equivalent delivery system.
On the CoreValve legal front, while our Q2 results were affected by the injunction of CoreValve in Germany, we were
pleased that the higher German court ordered the discontinuation of the injunction last week. Our German customers
were elated to learn that they will once again have access to our differentiated transfemoral technology with our unique
valve sizes, catheter sizes, and indications for use options.
In Endovascular, revenue of $218 million grew 5% with solid growth in both our aortic and peripheral businesses. In
our Aortic business we grew our AAA share sequentially, both in the U.S. and globally on the strength of our
market-leading Endurant II stent graft. Our thoracic product line posted double-digit growth as our Valiant Captivia
stent graft is gaining broad adoption.
In our Peripheral business, we received FDA approval for an expanded indication for our Complete SE vascular stent,
which is now approved for the use in SFA and PPA in the upper leg.
It is also worth noting that we divested our Pioneer Plus re-entry catheter product line, which represented $11 million
of sales over the past year.
Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group, revenue of $1.602 billion grew 2%. Results were driven by growth in
Surgical Technologies and Neuromodulation, partially offset by declines in Spine.
Spine revenue of $746 million declined 3%. Core Spine revenue of $636 million, which includes BKP, declined 1%.
The U.S. Core Spine market continues to decline in low single digits, with flat procedural volumes and positive mix
partially offsetting price declines. Excluding BKP, our Core Spine business was flat globally and declined 1% in the
U.S., relatively in line with the overall market. However, our Core Spine results were below our expectations as certain
under-performing product lines offset the positive momentum that has been building from our new products and
procedural innovations.
Our thoracolumbar, cervical and other biologic product lines all grew this quarter both globally and in the U.S. driven
by our procedural innovation and new technologies. Cervical in particular had a solid quarter with product line
extensions to our VERTEX platform, as well as our new Bryan artificial cervical disc contributing to growth.
Our Spine business is also increasingly differentiating itself from the competition through enabling technologies that
we leverage from our Surgical Technologies business, including O-ARM imaging, StealthStation Navigation and
POWEREASE powered surgical instruments. Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for spine surgery as they
see clear value from improved surgical precision and more efficient procedures, and this is resulting in increased
revenue for our spinal implants, as well as solid growth of capital equipment sales in our Surgical Technologies

business. In fact, we are seeing Core Spine growth in the upper single digits in accounts that have adopted our O-ARM
technology.
Outside the U.S. we continue to work on integrating our Kanghui acquisition in China, which is offsetting the lost
revenue from our former Weigao joint venture.
While there are certainly bright spots in our Spine business, we continue to face challenges in other parts of the
business, including BMP and BKP, as well as some recent challenges in interbody. We intend to bolster our interbody
product line with the launch of new products, including next-generation expandable cages. In BKP, while we did see a
sequential improvement, current trends of increased competition continue, and we are working on new products to
address this.
Turning to Surgical Technologies, revenue of $377 million grew 11% with broad based growth across all three
businesses: ENT, Neurosurgery and Advanced Energy. ENT grew double digits with its core capital platforms of
Fusion image-guided surgery, as well as NIM ENT nerve monitoring driving growth.
In Neurosurgery, capital upgrades for the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system contributed to another solid
quarter.
Advanced Energy grew over 20% again this quarter, as we continue to see strong adoption of our proprietary
Aquamantys Transcollation and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies in the orthopedics, spine, breast and CRDM
replacements markets.
Turning to Neuromodulation, revenue of $479 million increased 6% on solid global growth in DBS [Deep Brain
Stimulation], as well as a strong finish to the quarter in U.S. Pain-Stim. Our market leading DBS business delivered
another solid quarter driven by strong implant growth in both the U.S. and Western Europe. The results of our early
stim trial, which showed DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson's
disease, is generating significant interest in international markets.
In Pain-Stim, while we were supply constrained in the first part of the quarter due to the new product launch, the
business did grow double digits in October based on a strong implant growth following the full launch of the
RestoreSensor SureScan MRI Spinal Cord Stimulation system in the U.S.
In Gastro/Uro, while the business continues to grow, it has slowed from its previous double-digit run rate due to new
therapies entering the market. However, we are confident that Interstim is the most compelling therapy available, and
while we may continue to see some near-term pressure, we expect it to continue as a long-term growth driver as its
value prevails in the marketplace.
Now turning to our Diabetes group, of revenue $393 million grew 3%. We received approval for the MiniMed 530G
with the Enlite CGM sensor and started shipping to customers late in the quarter. This is the first system in the U.S. that
automatically stops insulin delivery if sensor glucose levels fall below a predetermined threshold, an important step
toward our goal of developing a fully-automated artificial pancreas.
Multiple peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated the value of our Threshold Suspend feature including the ASPIRE
study in the New England Journal of Medicine as well as the study out of Western Australia that was published in
JAMA in September. Every MiniMed 530G pump ships with our new Enlite sensor which is smaller, more comfortable
and more accurate. Regarding accuracy our FDA labeling indicates that Enlite with its 13.6% overall MARD [Mean
Absolute Relative Difference] is comparable to competitors' sensors.
When you combine these improvements with the Threshold Suspend automation feature of the MiniMed 530G system
we believe we have the best system in the market and will be focused on taking share over the coming quarters.
In addition, we began shipping to customers that had enrolled in our technology guarantee program which is the trigger
for recognizing some of the revenue that we deferred in the prior quarters. As of the end of Q2, we have $27 million of
deferred revenue that we expect to recognize over the next two quarters.

Looking ahead our next-generation pump platform, the MiniMed 640G, remains on track for launch in the international
markets by the end of the fiscal year. This platform will have a number of innovative features including a new look and
feel, a simplified user interface and the next step toward a fully automated artificial pancreas, predictive low glucose
suspend.
Now turning to the rest of the income statement, the Q2 gross margin was 74%. As Omar mentioned, there were a
number of issues that negatively affected our gross margin this quarter by a combined 110 basis points and, compared
to last quarter, we recognized an additional $12 million in manufacturing variances which had a sequential 30 basis
point negative impact. However, our standard gross margin was flat year over year as we continued to successfully
offset pricing pressure through our 5-year, $1.2 billion cost of goods sold reduction program.
Given our ongoing spend to address quality issues, we expect our Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 74.5% to 75%
on an operational basis and for a negative FX impact of 30 to 40 basis points. For Q4 we expect the gross margin to be
in the range of 75% to 75.5% on an operational basis.
Second quarter R&D spending of $372 million was 8.9% of revenue. We continued to invest in new technologies and
evidence creation to drive future growth. We would expect R&D expense for the remainder of the fiscal year to be in
the range of 8.5% to 9% due to the shifting of R&D resources to enhance our quality systems which gets recognized in
the cost of goods sold as well as trade-offs we are making to partially offset the U.S. medical device tax.
Second quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.438 billion represented 34.3% of sales. After adjusting for the 10 basis point
negative impact from foreign exchange, Q2 SG&A was 34.2%. We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage
our expenses, although it's worth noting that in Q3 SG&A spending is expected to be modestly higher given the
accelerated ramp of our U.S. CoreValve sales force ahead of expected U.S. approval. In FY 2014 we would expect to
drive 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement, which would result in SG&A in the range of 33.8% to 34% on
an operational basis and it is worth mentioning that we typically see most of our leverage in the fourth quarter.
Amortization expense for the quarter was $88 million. For FY 2014, we would expect amortization expense to be
approximately $85 million to $90 million per quarter. Net other expense for the quarter was $33 million including net
gain from our hedging program of $15 million.
As you know, we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our
earnings from foreign exchange. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY 2014 net other expense to be in the
range of $190 million to $210 million which includes an expected $120 million impact from the U.S. medical device
tax. In Q3 we expect net other expense to be in the range $50 million to $60 million based on current exchange rates.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $33 million. At the end of Q2, we had approximately $12.6 billion in cash and
cash equivalents and $12.3 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect FY 2014 net interest expense to be
in the range of $125 million to $135 million.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 19.2%. Excluding the impact of one-time items, our non-GAAP
nominal tax rate in Q2 was 19.4%. For FY 2014, we expect a non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%.
Our forecast does not assume the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expires on December 31, will be extended. Currently, the
R&D tax credit provides a benefit of approximately $8 million per quarter.
In the first half of FY 2014 we generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow. We are committed to returning 50% of our free
cash flow to shareholders. In Q2, we paid out $279 million in dividends and repurchased $713 million of our common
stock. As of the end of Q2, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 68 million shares. Second
quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.009 billion shares. For the full FY 2014, we would expect
diluted weighted shares outstanding to be approximately 1.012 billion shares including 1.010 billion shares in Q3.
Our fully diluted share count for the remainder of the year is expected to be higher due to the higher current share price.
However, it is important to note that the cash we receive from stock option redemptions, which was $249 million in
Q2, will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These
share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.

Let me conclude by commenting on our FY 2014 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Based on the
performance through the first half of our fiscal year, we continue to believe that full-year constant currency revenue
growth of 3% to 4% remains reasonable for FY 2014. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to
give you a sense of FX impact, if the exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal
year, then our FY 2014 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $140 million to $180 million, including
a negative $30 million to $50 million impact in Q3.
Turning to the guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect FY 2014 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in
the range of $3.80 to $3.85, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 68% on an operational basis after
adjusting for certain tax benefits that we received in FY 2013 as well as the headwinds from the medical device tax and
incremental interest expense in FY 2014. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges
or gains that might occur during the fiscal year.
I will now turn it back over to Omar who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar?
Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by noting that over time we are striving to
reliably deliver on our baseline expectations which are: consistent single-digit revenue growth, consistent EPS growth
200 to 400 basis points faster than the revenue and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.
As I mentioned earlier, over the coming quarters we are on the verge of bringing a number of new therapies to market
and we've set ourselves up to deliver what is arguably one of the strongest launch cadences of innovative therapies in
our industry. We believe that crisp execution of both our baseline and long-term growth strategies combined with
strong and disciplined capital allocation will enable us to create long-term dependable value in healthcare.
With that, we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. And in addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle,
President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; and Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group, to
join us again for the Q&A session.
We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions so we respectfully request that you limit yourself to only one question
and if necessary one follow-up so we can get to as many people as possible. If you have additional questions please
contact our Investor Relations team after the call.
Operator, first question, please?
Q&A

Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thank you. A couple questions. So if we look at the ICD market growing 3% this
quarter, I don't think any of us really think the ICD market is going to sustain that type of pace. So help us back out, if
you would, the stocking impact, which for you guys that was a negative last quarter, that was a positive this quarter and
maybe help us get to what the underlying market is doing?
And then second, just on the build-out of the field specialists ahead of the U.S. CoreValve launch, are you assuming in
the fourth quarter that you'll have CoreValve revenues to start to leverage that. It seems like you were suggesting that
you would get some leverage in the fourth quarter and does that just imply that there will be some revenues there?
Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I'll let Mike take both of those. Mike Coyle, I'll let Mike Coyle take over.

<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So let me start with the ICD market. As you remember, last quarter we talked about the
challenge being the new product launches that we had and trying to get those on contract when we're looking for an
ASP increase and so that lead to some destocking of hospital inventories as we worked through the process in hospitals
that have obviously put up some larger barriers to agreement to ASP increases. That worked itself out during the course
of the second quarter and I think you can reasonably assume that basically they're back to having stocked to where they
are comfortable stocking. So that now makes it a pretty reasonable picture to just look at the first full half of the year
and say what does the overall growth profile look like? And that's where we get to this roughly 1% global market
growth, so that, I think, should give you a picture of what we think is happening with the overall market.
On the second question regarding CoreValve we're not counting on any revenues coming in – any meaningful revenues
coming in the fiscal year from CoreValve and we are going to be obviously ramping our field representation in advance
of the launch, so that's in our current set of assumptions. Obviously what FDA decides to do in terms of approval is up
to them.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Mike, this is Gary. Just to add to what Mike said, the leverage we're talking about in Q4 is not
necessarily coming from CoreValve. It's just our natural leverage. If you go back over history, historically in our fourth
quarter, because we have more selling days and it's our strongest quarter there's more leverage in that fourth quarter and
that's what we were referring to.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Understood. All right. And then just one follow-up, Omar, do you want to just maybe
spend a minute on China and more broadly some of this slowdown in emerging markets this quarter and just the
confidence in a reacceleration and even if it's not next quarter over the next several quarters? Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah, I think this quarter we just happen to have a bunch of different regions slowdown just
by coincidence everything happened together. We expect this to start rapidly start to reaccelerate because everywhere I
go the fundamental growth drivers are clearly there. There's patients everywhere who need attention from existing
therapies. In addition, we've got several very concrete plans in place that will start to deliver real revenue growth over
the next few quarters and we'll share that with you as they mature.
In terms of China itself, I mentioned a few very specific items in terms of distributor conversions and some new
product things. On the overall environment there there's some noise out there because of different regulatory type
concerns but in general we don't have the hard data to support anything. Our teams are still calling for growth going
into the back half of the year.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds from Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Good morning. A question either for, I guess, for Omar or Chris. For Spine, the Core Spine
looks like it declined again. The comps weren't that tough. Your next biggest competitor is having integration issues.
You put a lot of money into it, especially focusing on MIS. What parts of the business are under-performing and why is
the big picture thesis you had not coming together quicker?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah, let me make one brief comment and then I'll let Chris talk to that. The way that we look
at all our businesses we look at overall period of time and if you recall, last quarter we actually had a pretty strong
Spine performance. This quarter there were some dynamics, which Chris will talk to, but we've got every confidence,
like I mentioned in the commentary, that the cadence of product launches we have in Spine actually will deliver over
the next few quarters so, but I think Chris can answer the question a little more specifically.
<A - Christopher J. O'Connell>: Yeah, Matt. Thanks for the question. I think the Spine market, as we've talked about
in the past, is really bouncing around flat and our performance has been flat to slightly up in the Core Spine business
and really separating out Core Spine from the BKP and BMP business I think a lot of the same fundamentals are in

place. Maybe the biggest difference this quarter is we had a little less benefit from mix, from positive mix given that
we're in the later stage of our launch cycle on some of the big platforms like SOLERA, but overall procedural growth
rate is quite flat and our pricing has been stable down in the low to mid-single-digits and so this quarter was a little bit
softer, particularly in the U.S. and in a couple of countries outside the U.S. namely Germany, Japan and Latin America
but the fundamental drivers are still very much there.
It is about the product refresh, first of all. Second of all, it's about the procedural innovation, we're getting good uplift
from our MAST MIDLF program and our OLIF, our new OLIF procedure and then, as Gary pointed out, the tailwind
from our enabling technologies like surgical navigation, we continue to perform much better in accounts that have
O-ARM and continue to see uptake in technologies like POWEREASE and the nerve monitoring.
So there are a couple of holes in the product line, particularly in the interbody space and there are a couple of small
categories like PEAK rods and IPDs that remain under pressure, but overall I think our perspective is that it's a
relatively stable situation and we expect that Core Spine business to be stable into the back half of the year.
As pointed out the BMP and the BKP businesses are both hurting us right now, although the kyphoplasty business does
seem to be showing signs of stabilization in the U.S. and we watch the BMP part closely.
So that's the way I'd characterize it, Matt.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: And then just a quick one for Gary, I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but when you
look at the back half of the year, the gross margin in the third quarter is a little lower than the consensus. You've got a
tough tax comp in the third quarter. Should we be thinking more about back end loading the second half to the fourth
quarter versus the third quarter since the guidance is unchanged?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Matt, obviously as you said, we're not going to give necessarily quarterly guidance, but I think
you've highlighted a couple issues I think the market should take into consideration. Our Q3 last year did include some
significant tax benefits, et cetera. When you back those out you're probably more like an earnings per share of $0.88,
which was kind of similar to what we were last year in Q2 and our Q2 and Q3 tend to be somewhat similar, I mean
they're pretty close and where the consensus is right now on Q3, based on the gross margin issues we highlighted we
think we'll improve in Q3 and as we go into Q4 but it will be a little bit more in Q3 here with these quality costs that we
talked about and the launch of the CoreValve product lines. I wouldn't be surprised to see people moving a penny or
two from the Q3 to our Q4. We're not changing our full-year guidance and we wouldn't expect the overall consensus to
change but seeing some shift occur from Q3 to Q4 would not be unexpected.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Thanks, Gary. Thank, Chris. Thanks, Omar.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one Gary just kind of following up on the
gross margin, you did, it sounds like, moderate the full-year gross margin expectations. Can you just walk through what
the changes for that is? Is it just the higher product obsolescence costs or is there just maybe some of the warning letter
charges perhaps coming in a little bit higher?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: I think it's a little bit of all of those factors. I mean first of all, clearly the FX impact on cost of
sales has been greater than we probably expected even a quarter ago and that will obviously vary, we just don't know
exactly how that'll play out but it clearly has been a little bit more negative but the big surprise is really we're in a
situation that as we've ramped up all these new product lines, which, the is good news is we're getting additional
revenue from that, the bad news is there's additional costs in ramping up. You don't get the initial yields you expect
right away and especially when you're having to ramp up very, very quickly, the scrap and obsolescence also becomes
higher just due to the fact that, for example, on some of the new products the older products are no longer as much in

demand, and so we have a higher obsolescence. That's the good news of having some of these products doing so well in
the marketplace. The bad news, it affects gross margin.
So those we actually think are a little bit more one-time and will start to work themselves off after Q2 here with the
launches of a lot of these new products, but the quality issues, as you highlighted, we do expect will continue for at
least the next quarter or two as we make significant investments in shifting resources from really the R&D efforts up
into addressing our quality and compliance issues both in Neuro and Diabetes. So that's why we pulled things back a
little bit.
The good news is pricing is actually, if anything, kind of in line with what we expected maybe even slightly better as
we are offsetting that with the cost reductions we have across our various product lines but these one-time other
product-type costs clearly impacted us more than we expected in Q2 and we're assuming that, that'll play a little bit into
Q3 and that's why for the full year, we're down. As we go forward we would expect those obviously would not be as
significant as we go into next year.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then, Omar, just for you, you had commented in your prepared remarks just
around the medium term outlook of getting back into the mid-single digits, and you talked about, obviously the number
of new products coming. Just what is your confidence that kind of, I know you're not giving guidance for FY 2015 but
as we're kind of exiting out of 2014 you're well-positioned to kind of get back to that mid-single-digit growth rate in
2015? Or do you think that maybe some acquisitions might be needed to kind of help get you there?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, first the main comment here is that, like I pointed out in the commentary, the number of
new products coming out is really unprecedented, at least since I've been here and for several years probably before
that, and not only Medtronic but if you look across the industry that number of products coming out with that regularity
across the breadth of our businesses, whether you talk about the different businesses in CVG or some of the stuff that
we're doing in Spine that we think will accelerate growth there or you talk about Diabetes.
If you look across the entirety of our businesses, this is quite a change, and it's going to have some impact. And right
now, we're close to mid-single digits. I mean if you recall last year we were there, and we've had a few quarters here
where we've had some pressures which we have to offset, but we're borderline. And so I would expect that these
launches will help that. They have to.
In addition to that, we've got a series of other activities that we're doing, particularly around globalization, which we
expect will also help us. Having said that, Kristen, we live in a place where surprises are not uncommon, and markets
have still got volatility across the world. Healthcare is a big issue in terms of government focus and spending. And we
always have to be a little cautious about where surprises can come from, but in balance we, I think, our position at this
stage is about as good as it's been since I've been here in terms of future outlook.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Just a few follow ups here. Gary, I know we've had a lot of commentary on gross margins, but
if you go from the second quarter here to the fourth quarter at the upper end of the range is about 150 basis point
improvement. What, just specifically on FX and quality, how much of a contribution are just those two factors in that
100 to 150 basis point improvement heading into the fourth quarter?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Well, into the fourth quarter, the reality is your FX going into the fourth quarter is much less
than right now based on the rate staying where they're at, and that's what it's all based on. The FX impact in the fourth
quarter would be relatively minor, and so you pick up almost 40 basis points right there just due to FX. The other piece
would be the quality items that we're talking about where also there will still be some costs occurring in the fourth
quarter as we continue to focus on getting, addressing the warning letters. But you're also having that cost on a much

higher revenue number, and for us that also drives your gross margins in the fourth quarter. If you look back
historically our gross margins in the fourth quarter also tend to be at a higher level than, as I mentioned, even with the
SG&A, because you have a fixed cost that's on a much higher revenue number.
And so in general, part of it is just your historical trends. On the gross margin, probably several, 40, 50 basis points
higher in the fourth quarter. Part of it is related to FX, and part of it is related to the quality costs should start to
become, start to minimize as we go through in the fourth quarter itself.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Very helpful. And, Mike, maybe just two coronary questions or broader cardio questions
for you. The first is just the outlook for your Coronary business considering next-generation stent systems in the
market. Is that a concern for us on volume or price or neither?
And just another question on CoreValve, should we assume next quarter we see normalized market growth given the
inventories? And if there are any pricing concessions given in Germany, should we assume you can get back to your
prior pricing? Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: We would expect normalization in the German market to take place over the next two
quarters just because of the big volatility that took place over the last two quarters. So I wouldn't say it will all be back
to normal here next quarter, but certainly by the end, we get to the fourth quarter I would expect normalization to have
occurred.
On the DES side, what I'd point out is we're now six, seven quarters into the U.S. launch of Resolute Integrity. We've
lapped its launch in every major market around the world, and we continue to show share capture and I think what
that's about is a couple of things.
One is just the performance of the product, I mean the handling of the product, the diabetes labeling, the recent data on
DAPT. I mean it's a great product and I think the more use it gets, the more physicians are coming to appreciate that.
But it also fits very nicely into our broader CVG strategy in that we have moved increasingly toward having Resolute
Integrity involved in multi-product line bundles across our businesses which include services and programs in those
bundles and that product line has been the biggest beneficiary of it.
So if you look historically it seemed to be a – it used to be when you brought out a new stent product, your share would
move in the first two or three quarters and then that would be it. What we're seeing is just continued growth in our
share position in DES and we think it's because it's a great product and it's fitting into a great broader strategy for CVG.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Thanks. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes. We can. Go ahead, Bob.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Great. Good morning. So first just a couple of quick questions on the pipeline and the
visibility of the pipeline, I just wanted to confirm that the American College of Cardiology meeting will be the place
that we'll probably see the data from your renal denervation trial, the U.S. trial, as well as the next edition of the
CoreValve data? And then I also wanted to confirm just that the drug coated balloon data is still on track for showing it
in early April at Charing Cross? Just wanted to confirm those dates.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Those continue to be our operating expectations.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Okay, great. And then I was wondering if you could talk just a little bit more about the ICD
market and why it's improving and understanding there is some stocking issues and you made some comments earlier
but I was just wondering is this uptick in the market purely a function of a lot of new products in the market for the first

time in a while and maybe seeing better pricing? Or do you actually think that there's been a unit uptick in the ICD
market?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So we've certainly seen stabilization in initial implants for ICDs which is a good sign,
obviously, something we've been looking for and have now seen. On the pricing side, basically it's flat overall pricing
and that we are seeing price increases tied to the new product launches in our high tier but we continue to see pricing
pressure in the mid-tier technologies. You net it all out it's relatively flat ASPs, which, of course, is a nice improvement
over the 4% or 5% ASP declines we were seeing at this time a year ago. So generally speaking, it's market stabilization
that we're seeing.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks, gentlemen. Omar, I just wanted to ask you quickly about the
Cardiocom business, your venture into the disease management space, how important is that for – how should we'd be
looking at that in terms of it as a growth driver? Is this a service that Medtronic is going to be providing to try and
ensure deeper partnerships with hospitals and hospital systems? And how much investment do you need to develop or
acquire new technology platforms to really optimize the offering?
And then specifically for the important avenue of heart failure re-hospitalization prevention, there is a potential
pulmonary pressure monitoring device going to be approved by the FDA. Can you speak to Medtronic's views on
pulmonary pressure or intracardiac pressure monitoring, the role it will play in the important market opportunity and
how Medtronic can tap into this and any internal plans to leverage the Cardiocom platform? Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. Let me give you some perspective. You know, first of all, Cardiocom is an operating
business with strong results and strong growth prospects with what it has. It has some unique capabilities and we're
excited about what they're doing and they have strong momentum and growth by themselves.
Now when we take Cardiocom and latch that on to our distribution team, which is far bigger than what Cardiocom had
on their own, we obviously open up a lot more opportunities for that business to go and increase their sales of existing
products. But in addition to that, the combination of our devices now going after a more selected patient pool, together
with Cardiocom's support services offer up a future opportunity that is unprecedented in that no other device company
and a cardiac monitoring company has ever really got together in this way and we expect real improvement in growth
going forward as a result of that.
Now with respect to other things that we have to do, look, as you know, studies have shown that to move the needle in
things like heart failure requires a broad set of services, a broad set of solutions that have to be executed through
multiple stakeholders. We're in the process of creating that holistic solutions business and leading that effort and we
think Cardiocom is a big asset in that journey. Other things will certainly be required, but on its own, Cardiocom is an
extremely good platform for us to base this journey on. It's really a long-term effort.
I'm going to say as well that in terms of the heart failure re-hospitalization, we've got evidence already that using the
Cardiocom capabilities we can have an impact, a measurable impact, on reduction of heart failure in specific hospitals.
And we think that's a very cost-effective method through which you can achieve that goal. Sensors will be developed
over time that'll enhance that capability but in our experience just doing one thing in an area of that type is usually not
enough, but a broad solution is required.
I'll let Mike comment on specifically the product and technology and his views on that and maybe our plans.

<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Yeah. I think it's important to look at heart failure as both a short-term issue and a long-term
issue. The short term issue is the 30-day re-hospitalization challenge, which all hospitals in the U.S. agree is something
that is a big challenge for them to manage and that's where the Cardiocom solution, which is basically a very fixed
window of time in which the impact has proven to be very effective.
The alternatives that are being looked at are permanent implants that are very expensive solutions, which really are not
the right answer for the short-term challenge. But the question would be are they the right solution for the long-term
challenge of heart failure management? And in that case, clearly as Omar just mentioned, there are a lot of variables
involved here. It's not just the availability of the measurement from the device but also the tracking of that data, the
specificity and sensitivity of those data and the cost of managing that information. And we think that's a very expensive
solution that's being looked at for the long-term.
We are really focused on trying to focus in that near-term window not only with Cardiocom but also with some of the
predictive diagnostics that are coming out of our CRDM organization. So you know about Reveal, we talked about the
Reveal LINQ, which is the next generation loop recorder that we have. And there are other predictive diagnostics
you're going to see us talk about over the course of the next six months that we think can be very helpful in managing
heart failure patients in that window where there's a very clear economic need. So that's how I would characterize our
approach to the strategy.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Thanks, Josh. Operator, I see we've run past the top of the hour. But let's just take a couple more
questions before wrapping up.
Operator
Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, several questions for you. Firstly,
common wisdom is that the PARTNER I indication in the U.S. is kind of flattening out. As you enter that market, do
you see much opportunity for growth prior to indication expansion?
Secondly, I know you guys have had a little sluggishness in enrolling SURTAVI and there's been talk about extending
it to STS 2. Any progress on that front?
And thirdly, given the joint FDA/CMS approval track for renal denervation, how should we be thinking of that uptake
in the States now that you have definitive evidence relative to what we've seen in Europe? Thanks so much.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Let me take the first two, first. On the question – I'm sorry the second one, let me just ask
Jeff. Do want to comment...
<A - Jeff Warren>: Yeah, so, Bruce, on SURTAVI we're talking to the FDA but there's really no update on looking at
lowering the enrollment criteria.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: And the first question was?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: PARTNER.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: PARTNER. So first, I think it's important to point out that they – what we are seeking
approval for in terms of the range of sizes and alternative access routes for CoreValve should significantly expand the
number of patients who are going to be candidates for TAVI because currently the current approved devices from
competitive devices are fairly limited in terms of their size and also the invasiveness of the transapical approach.
So we think that there is still plenty of opportunity to both take share in the existing segment as well as to expand the
number of patients who are getting treated within the extreme risk. So we are confident that what we've guided you to
in terms of our overall expectation for market size continues to be what we would expect to see, and the third question
was?

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Renal denervation, FDA approval.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So obviously this is one of the first that's on the joint track of both CMS approval as well as
FDA approval, our goal would be to have essentially a three month window between those two, the FDA approval and
the follow-on reimbursement but again, this is fairly uncharted territory so we're going to have to see where that leads
but that's certainly what we are managing our strategy to.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Bruce, we would expect that obviously with having that data, we've always said that with having
the data, the proven information in the U.S. we think will actually help accelerate the marketplace and having
reimbursement at the same time obviously, or close to it, would obviously help. So we expect the uptake in the U.S.
will be much faster than obviously what we've seen outside the United States.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Jeff Warren>: One last question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Hello, there. Thank you for taking the question. On CoreValve again can you give us a little more
perspective? Mike do think you've lost share in Germany as a result of the injunction given what seemed to be some
sort of heavy selling into the market in advance of this and can we assume that you're shipping normally now? Just
remind me, I think you said you had a strong growth in TAVI in Europe. Can you quantify that more specifically with a
more specific number? Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Mike?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure. On Germany, obviously, if you just look at total revenues that we just reported in the
quarter, we lost share on a reported basis because we had no product that we were able to sell other than for the
compassionate use side, but as you may recall from the first quarter when customers learned that they were going to
lose access to this product there was a lot of demand that basically accelerated purchases.
So in terms of overall share of implants, it's hard to say but I don't think there probably was a lot of share loss in the
quarter and obviously now that we will be able to go back into the market with the full offering, I don't expect there
will be going forward but it's going to take a couple quarters here for that to normalize overall.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: And on the Diabetes side just as a follow up, is there any way to size the opportunity for the
530G? And any sense, the patients that are getting the devices, are these patients already on Medtronic pump and
upgrading? MDI patients converting, or competitor pumps? Any perspective there would be welcome. Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, it's a little early to get too much data on this because we just started shipping it but I'll
tell you that, first of all, the responses has been outstanding both from patients who receive the device and just in
anticipation of what the product can do. So we're really confident about the outlook and the general acceptance that this
product has received.
I think in general, most of them Medtronic patients who are upgrading at this stage but we expect some conversions as
well. I doubt if there's going to be too many MDI patients going to this technology first, but again, it's very early, we
just started shipping this product in the last – just about a month or so. So let's wait and see, but like I said, the
anticipation from our patients is very high and a lot of excitement around it.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Thank you.
