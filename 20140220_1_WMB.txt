MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams, Williams Partners' Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Porter
Thank you, Dana. Good morning and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams
Partners.
Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites,
williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the
accompanying analyst packages, the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you
momentarily and an update to our data books which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our

business.
In addition to Alan, we also have the four leaders of our operating areas with us: Jim Scheel leads our Northeastern
G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western area; Rory Miller leads the Atlantic Gulf area and John
Dearborn is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel, is available
to respond to any questions.
In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking
statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in
our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.
So, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thank you, John, and good morning. Let me welcome all of you who are joining us today for our fourth quarter
results. We'll talk – also talk about our major developments and our outlook today. We do have a lot to cover today
concerning items like Geismar, Gulfstar, Bluegrass, our Northeast volume growth, and now our big exciting project,
Atlantic Sunrise. But before I turn to our fourth quarter results and our full year, let me provide a brief update on where
we are with Corvex and Soroban.
As you know, in December, Corvex and Soroban disclosed their interest in each having representation on the Williams
Board. Since that time, we've been engaged in discussions with both Corvex and Soroban related to the company's
strategic plan to drive continued value creation. And of course, we look forward to continuing those discussions with
those parties.
We do have a long track record here at Williams, and in fact, in recent years have been a leader in taking advantage of
transformational and structural opportunities that create value for our shareholders. And we continue to welcome input
towards our goal of enhancing shareholder value for this great company.
And so, with that, let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Before we get into the details of the fourth quarter performance
for WPZ, I'd like to remind you of our strategic focus to grow our exposure to fee-based revenues. We are
accomplishing this by continuing to develop large-scale infrastructure that will be critical to connecting the
fastest-growing supplies to the fastest-growing markets for natural gas and natural gas derivatives. And in fact, this
train is just gaining steam as we saw an 8% increase year-over-year in fee-based revenues at WPZ, and we expect even
faster growth into 2014 and 2015.
In the fourth quarter, WPZ enjoyed this growth trend despite harsh winter weather conditions in the Rockies, and in
fact, we hit another record for DCF growth in the fourth quarter of $509 million, up 26% over the previous fourth
quarter. This strong performance exceeded our internal expectations in spite of about $43 million lower in NGL
margins. One of the drivers for the better performance was lower cost and maintenance capital expenses.
About a year ago, we reorganized the company to enable a flatter management structure and better cost efficiencies by
deploying our very best knowledge of things like asset integrity and procurement across our entire operations. And as
you can see by analyzing our numbers, we've been able to drive the combination of our O&M and G&A expenses
lower despite managing tremendous growth in our business. I want to be very clear that our lower maintenance cost in
our maintenance CapEx area has been driven by better efficiencies and fewer required repairs, not lower standards of
care across our facilities.
Moving on to WMB, we also enjoyed an 8% increase year-over-year in segment profit plus DD&A for the quarter,
with Williams Partners carrying much of that increase. One disappointment for the fourth quarter was the financial
performance for our WMB NGL & Petchem Services segment, primarily driven by Canada, where third-party outages
dramatically impacted supplies available for our Fort McMurray facility.

But that project is up and running very well now and is now exceeding our expectations for both recoveries and
volumes as we really have that business up and running very smoothly now with the ethane recovery portion that we
added to that business in the third and fourth quarter of last year. So, we look forward to that project becoming the
driver for WPZ's results with the dropdown, and we expect that to be completed very soon here, actually at the end of
this month. So, of course, we appreciate the great work the team at ACMP is doing to grow their business in a steady
and predictable manner, and of course, this also helped us outperform here for the fourth quarter.
Moving on to the DCF growth and our expectations for growth looking into 2014 and 2015. We do continue to expect
strong DCF growth, in fact, greater than 50%, or sorry, 50% from 2013 to 2015. This extraordinary growth rate is on
the backs of large capital investments that we've been making over the last couple of years, most of which – a lot of
which – has been financed by equity, and our organization is very focused right now on executing this large capital
program that is essential to this growth.
We updated our commodity prices and our latest assumptions on all of our key projects for 2014. With the degree of
volatility we've seen recently in commodity prices, there are a lot of different impacts on our guidance, but in summary,
our guidance range is unchanged from the third quarter. We have great visibility around the projects that we expect will
drive this growth. We continue to hit key execution milestones that serve to substantially derisk these major projects,
and I'll talk a little bit about that in some more detail in a few of our projects.
Where we did update our guidance is for growth CapEx, where we have added some noteworthy changes, and we'll see
that here on the next slide. And so, you can see for the WPZ increasing CapEx, we've got initial spending on some new
projects. So, projects like Atlantic Sunrise and Dalton, and this higher spending reaffirms our belief in growth potential
to our business, both within and well beyond our guidance period.
Two of the new projects we've listed here, Atlantic Sunrise and Dalton, are on our Transco system where we continue
to see strong demand for our services and, really, I think in a very positive way here, not just coming from the supply
side but from the market and the demand side as well.
I expect you saw our news release this morning with some additional detail on Atlantic Sunrise, and we'll hit that topic
here in a few minutes. Gunflint, which is mentioned here, is a deepwater tieback to our new Gulfstar One facility, and
our team on Gulfstar, have done a terrific job of making some modifications on the topside there at Gulfstar to be able
to accommodate the easy tieback of Gunflint. So, really excited about the way our team continue to execute on Gulfstar
One.
And WPZ will be adding CapEx for the new Redwater projects. So, these are expansions at Redwater that will
accommodate things like the CNRL Horizon volumes that will be coming in. And so, we've added capital in there for
that as well. We are also incorporating $175 million higher capital spend for the Geismar expansion on higher costs that
result in part from the delay in the restart.
For WMB, specifically, you'll see that we have lowered our growth CapEx to reflect a shift in timing to mid to late
2016 on the joint venture Bluegrass pipeline project to better match the need of the market. We remain very excited
about the Bluegrass pipeline project, and I continue to believe that it's the best solution available in the market.
And what I can tell you in terms of where we are, is that the activity that we continue to see and the input and
discussions that we're having, there are a number of parties out there who share our view of the market and the
attractiveness of the solution. And we are working to reach definitive agreements with all interested parties as we push
that project forward.
Moving on to next slide here on Atlantic Sunrise, just a little bit of update and just some brief information. We did
issue a news release earlier today on the milestone that Transco executed firm contracts with nine shippers for 100% of
the 1.7 million dekatherms per day of firm transportation capacity. And so we're very excited to announce that. Very
important project for Transco in that it not only serves as a great investment, but it really opens up a lot of supply
availability for expanding markets as well.

The project includes 15-year shipper commitments, and the shippers are both producers, local distribution companies
and power generators. The project represents vital energy infrastructure designed to connect surging new supplies of
natural gas in the Marcellus producing region and really coming mostly from the Northeastern Pennsylvania area with
growing demand centers along the Atlantic Seaboard. We expected to bring the Atlantic Sunrise into service in the
second half of 2017. And of course, this assumes all necessary regulatory approvals are received in a timely manner.
Moving on to our milestones and key accomplishments and developments here on slide 9. We did have a number of
recent milestones in the fourth quarter and even into this year. We brought the Canadian ethane recovery project online,
as I mentioned earlier. The volumes in the fourth quarter for that were disappointing for a number of reasons, but
primarily impacted by some third-party outages, both upstream and some difficulties delivering the product
downstream. Those have all been worked out now. And we're enjoying, as I mentioned earlier, great volume growth
now.
We're reaching important milestones on our Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar projects. We also are rapidly growing our
Northeast business. We saw a 63% increase in our gathering volumes from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the fourth
quarter of 2012, and that compares very favorably if you really look at the whole Marcellus volumes which grew about
40% last year. So, really we're growing – that says we're growing at a 50% higher rate than the broader Marcellus base
is growing, so we're very excited about that. We did see our volumes reach an average of about 1.9 Bcf per day for the
full year, and of course, our actual volumes are well above that now.
We touched on the impressive financial growth that we expect to see between 2013 and 2014. I would certainly say
that's not without risk, and we've highlighted the largest of the growth drivers here for 2014 as we continue to push
forward on these projects. Looking at 2015 and beyond, we're really starting to see the development of our growth as
some of our projects experience a full year of earnings, and we bring these new projects on line. So, 2015 is both a
combination of a lot of the full-year benefit of projects like Gulfstar and Keathley Canyon, which come on in the last
half of the year going into 2015, as well as some exciting new growth projects for 2015 as well.
Beyond the guidance period, we really begin to see the effect of these major projects. They provide visibility to our
continued WPZ DCF growth and support for Williams' continued strong dividend growth. Because we do have to
leverage so many projects that leverage off of our competitive advantages, we can be selective in pursuing only the best
risk-adjusted return projects. So, we're in a very envious position to be allocating capital to really the very best projects.
And moving on to slide 10 here, it's a picture of the different services we're providing for the Northeast. And here's our
large-scale strategy. It really comes together and plays out in this key growth area where we have operations,
investments and opportunities across our various lines of our business. We're strategically positioned in one of the
fastest-growing production areas. The biggest challenges in the Marcellus and the Utica are exactly the kinds of
problems that our large-scale infrastructure strategy is designed to solve. This is a great resource basin that needs great
market access.
And what stands in our way? Well, as we've been pushing through these major projects, certainly one of the key issues
is the customers' ability to make major commitments up against very complex regulatory structures and the risks in
their business. And certainly, the regulatory complexity that it's taking to get this large-scale infrastructure installed as
well, are barriers to growth. That's both an impediment, but it's also a great opportunity for a company like Williams
that's very skilled at taking on these very large complex projects.
Atlantic Sunrise and Bluegrass are really big infrastructure solutions that we've been working on. In the case of Atlantic
Sunrise, it took some chronic, very visible infrastructure constraints in the market to bring adequate shipper support and
firm transportation contracts with long 15-year terms to the project. Consider that in this example with Atlantic Sunrise,
it takes more than $400 million in annual revenue each and every year over those 15 years, along with very strong
credit support behind those, to underwrite a project of this size. That's a very big commitment to make in the face of
these regulatory mazes.
But as we mentioned earlier, the market has really recognized that it's going to have to invest and support these kind of
projects. And so, Atlantic Sunrise is one of the first major investments that's coming – that connects increasing markets

with these increasing supplies in the Marcellus area. Of course, it's on the backs of three smaller projects that we've
been doing out of the area, but this is really a very large-scale project that we're bringing forward.
We certainly believe that the Bluegrass pipeline project will be the next chapter in how this story plays out. But in the
NGL segment of the market, as the constraint and the supply sources become more evident and people look harder for
really the right solution out of the basin, and in our discussions with our customers, certainly indicate that's where we're
headed.
We expect to bring the Geismar plant back into service. I'm sorry. I'm moving to slide 11 here. We expect the Geismar
plant be back in service in June this year. The delay in returning the plant to service and completing the expansion
resulted from a variety of factors including the extended loss of utilities. So, that's primarily things like steam, our
electrical system, those were all damaged severely in the incident. And as a result, getting the project back up and
running without those systems has proved to be very difficult and very complex.
Based on current commodity price assumptions, we continue to expect that we are mostly covered on the financial
effect of the incident with the exception of the 60-day period before the business interruption insurance kicked in
during 2013 and the $13 million in cash deductibles that were primarily associated with the property damage.
Moving on to slide 12 here. Talking about some exciting milestones here in our deepwater projects, and of course,
that's included in our Atlantic Gulf segment. On Gulfstar One, we've now achieved an important milestone with the
mooring process. So, Gulfstar has now reached storm-safe status, and the contingencies to cover risks related to
weather and powerful eddy currents can be dramatically reduced.
So, one of the key issues is getting a spar like this set. When we set Devils Tower originally, we were faced with some
pretty bad eddy currents in this area, and getting that facility moored is a major milestone for our team, and things have
been going very smooth of late in accelerating the schedule on Gulfstar, so very excited about the team's performance
out there on Gulfstar.
And so, we do expect our facilities to be in place for an on-time start-up of production. Keep in mind that a portion of
our cash flows will be dependent on the start-up of the production. And of course, we will be doing everything we can
to help to produce or bring production on as soon as possible.
I'll remind you that on Gulfstar, that Hess and Chevron's Tubular Bell (sic) [Tubular Bells] (18:49) prospect initially.
And then as I mentioned earlier, later, outside the guidance period, Gulfstar – sorry, Gunflint will be tied back. We do
expect production to commence in the third quarter of this year. On the Keathley Canyon project, the customers are
Anadarko and Exxon. And we expect this work to be done well ahead of the production commencing in the fourth
quarter of this year. And in fact, our deepwater line is now more than 80% laid.
Moving to the summary slide here on 13, we'll just tell you we are very committed to this strategy with an intense focus
for the long term on the natural gas super cycle. We are convinced more than ever that we're really in the sweet spot.
We've positioned ourselves very well to create value in this environment. We are now getting some tailwinds from a
lift in both NGL prices and gas prices, and these are exactly the kinds of signals that the producing community needs to
see right now to continue to develop the resources that are out in front of us.
We're rapidly converting our business to a volume fee-based business that is enduring, and we're putting in the kind of
infrastructure that is difficult to replicate in the long term. We are very focused on this critical infrastructure and very
well-contracted business that's going to be here for the long haul due to its competitive advantages in the market. That's
hard work. It's a lot of risk, and it's a lot of grip on the part of our team to push through all of that. But that's exactly
what we're going to stay focused on. And it's the stuff that, in the long term, the market is going to have to have for a
sustainable growth in natural gas and natural gas derivatives markets here in the U.S. I truly believe that there is no
other company in this sector that enjoys the degree of visibility to growth that we enjoy both now and over the long
period.
So, with that, I thank you very much for joining us. And we'll turn it over to questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Brad Olsen with Tudor Pickering.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: First, a quick question about weather. Obviously, the price impact of this winter has been very
good for gas and NGL markets. What impact, if any, do you expect to see as we move into Q1 in terms of freeze-offs
or other operational issues as a result of weather, either in the West or in the Northeast? And have we seen some of the
build-out in the Northeast or some of the drilling activity slow as a result of some of the cold weather?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Great. Brad, thanks for the question. First of all, I'd like to commend our Western
team and our Northeast team for some great operations despite some pretty difficult environments out West in the
fourth quarter. Moving into the first quarter where your question was targeted, I would say the West continues to do
pretty well up against our normal – we normally do have quite a bit of freeze-off. But we could tell you they continue
to perform very well up against the norms for the Rockies in the Western area. The San Juan Basin has actually had one
of the better periods during this than we normally see – we normally see quite a bit of a reduction in production there.
In the Northeast, I'm very thankful for the work our team's done up there to keep the reliability up on our system. I will
tell you there's certainly been some freeze-offs upstream on some of the producers' equipment and some of the volumes
upstream of our facilities. But our facilities have remained very reliable, and really excited to see our team having
pushed through some very challenging times of getting these facilities up to reliable standards. And so, we have had
some freeze-offs out there in the wet Marcellus area, but again, it's not been on our systems. It's been upstream, and
producers have been working quickly to overcome them.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Great. And another question about a little bit more of the long-term outlook in the Northeast on
your OVM system, specifically, there have been some really impressive dry gas well results just across the river in
Ohio, and it appears that there's some potential prospectivity in Marshall county and Wetzel county for those very
productive dry gas horizons. Are those – is that kind of emerging play something that you've discussed with your OVM
customers?
Would that dry gas production – if it does emerge, would that drier gas maybe alleviate some of the operational issues
that you've seen with some of the especially super-rich gas that you've had on the OVM system, just by diluting some
of the liquids content and providing you with maybe more of a dry gas blend stock for some of the ethane-rich gas you
produce?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes. Well, first of all, I will tell you there are several of our key producers that do have
plans this year to test into both the Utica Dry and the Upper Devonian. And while the Upper Devonian doesn't provide
any relief, I hate – as a processing company, I hate to think about, again, moving to dry gas as a relief. But to your
point, some of the big volumes that we've been seeing from Utica tests in the dry area would certainly help provide
some sweeping volumes and a more reasonable gas-to-liquid phase in our pipeline. So, we're excited about that, and we
certainly are working with the producers. I will tell you, included in our capital is some expansions of our systems to be
able to accommodate some of those higher volumes on the dry gas side.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Great. And just one last one on Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise. Constitution kind of spit out
as the only Northeast pipe project to involve a significant laying of newbuild pipe. And the Atlantic Sunrise, at least
from the map you've provided, it appears as though that project would also involve some significant new pipe from
kind of the Leidy Line down towards Station 190. And I guess is there anything from the Constitution process that's
maybe something that could be applied to the Atlantic Sunrise process, or is it something where as long as you're laying
significant newbuild pipe, there will be some regulatory risk of delays and what have you?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Great question. I will tell you that on Constitution, the real issue we're facing right now
from a regulatory issue really relates to the New York DEC, not to the FERC. And so, the nice thing about Sunrise is it

does not go through the New York area, so we're not faced with that same regulatory issue.
On the FERC side, I would just tell you they are continuing to push through. You saw the Constitution draft EIS. So,
we're very thankful for the FERC continuing to try to exude their part to accelerate these projects, and we continue to
work well with them. And we certainly have some – a lot of discussions, communications we need to do in New York
to find the right answers and right solutions there as well.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Great. Thanks a lot, Alan.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks.
Operator
We'll go next to Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Hey. Good morning, Alan and team. A couple of quick questions on Geismar. So, you say
you expect to be out of service until June. How firm is that date, and then how much extra out-of-pocket costs are there
for each month you miss that? It seems like there, you only had, and if I'm reading this right, $10 million of additional
uninsured losses from delaying this two to three months from April to June? Is that right?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, it's for two months. That's correct. Just a little over two months of delay, that's
correct. And so, to answer your question, right now, the mechanical completion is expected in the first part of May.
And I would tell you there's obviously a lot of things to go right, but I'm very proud of the work that our team has done
to really dig in in some great detail to understand what the drivers of that are in the productivity of labor. And I think
we've got a very studied perspective on that issue.
Having said that, I would tell you the window is probably from the last week in May through the end of June as the
expected window right now for that start-up. And in terms of that cost, of course, if we were delayed beyond that, it's
very dependent on ethane to ethylene spreads, but, in a range, that's probably around $1.5 million to maybe up to $2
million a day of expected revenues we'd lose on that.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then one more. The $175 million or more CapEx on a higher
cost for Geismar, is there – is that just relating to repairs, or are you getting a return on that increased capital spend?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, unfortunately, this isn't one that we'd get any return on. And I would just tell you it's
been driven by a lot of the complexities associated with the damage to the plant. So, as I mentioned earlier, we've had
to go in and wait on utilities being ready, the complexity of working in both the damage repair area as well as the
getting the expansion – has just put a very crowded and complex stage there. So, I would tell you that that is one of the
major drivers for it, but there certainly isn't unfortunately any incremental return to come to us from that investment.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Understood. And then moving to Bluegrass, Alan, you pushed it out, but you're still
talking quite favorably on the project. And is your sense that producers are eventually going to be willing to sign up,
but this is just a timing issue, and I guess what is causing them to hold off on signing right now and still giving you
confidence that they will in the future?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Steve, great question and thanks. I would just tell you if you look at what it costs for
a producer, the kind of commitment if somebody's got 30,000 to 70,000 barrels a day of commitment and you look at
what that looks like on a roughly $0.30 a gallon by the time you pay for transport, frac and go through an export
facility. That $0.30 a gallon, you put that times 30,000 to 50,000 barrels a day and pile it up for 15 years, that's a very,
very large commitment for many of the producers we're dealing with. And it's just taking time for them to get all their

commitment if you do the math on that.
And so, I really think that's the practical issue we're dealing with. We have some very engaged customers. I think as I

infrastructure. And I think some folks would just like to see somebody else get it built, and hopefully be on the coattails
of that. But frankly, we're going to have to see an adequate amount of financial support before we push through with
additional investment.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. And I appreciate – moving away from Bluegrass – your comment about discussions
with Soroban and Corvex. I want to know if you could talk about any discussions you've had with respect to the
Access, 50% GP interest held by GIP. Is it something that you would ultimately like to own at WMB, and is it
something you're working towards, ultimately?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I would just tell you, we think the ACMP business is a great business. We think it
would be a great complement to Williams. And in a lot of ways, both from a management team standpoint as well as
the business structure and the contracts, and the focus on natural gas, so it's very much in line with our strategy. But of
course – so I think fundamentally, the answer to your question is, yes, we would like to look towards bringing in the
synergies of combining those businesses.
But there's another party involved, and that means there's a value trade to be had and we have to make sure that that
value trade really makes sense for our shareholders. And because we do have so many great investment opportunities in
front of us right now, we have to keep that in balance as well. And so, answer to your question, yes, we'd love to do it,
but at the right price and at the right timing as well, because the bigger hurry we get in, the more expensive that likely
becomes.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: One quick follow-up. Are there active – would you describe as active discussions in that –
for this, or not right now?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, I wouldn't describe there as being any active discussions. I would say that we continue
to study the opportunity from our own perspective. But I wouldn't suggest that there's any active discussions with GIP
on that.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Thanks. Final, very quick one from me, do you expect to have IDR waivers in
2014? I saw that you didn't have them in the fourth quarter?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, we do not intend to have IDR waivers in 2014.

We'll take our next question from Abhi Rajendran with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Hi. Good morning, guys. How are you?
<A - John Porter>: Morning, Abhi.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning, Abhi.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: A couple of quick questions. You increased a lot of your assumptions on your commodity
deck, but your outlook was largely unchanged. I guess is this just a function of most of the commodity movements
largely netting themselves out, or there are some volume offsets? If you could provide some color on some of the puts
and takes, that would be helpful.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. Yeah, really, it is very much an offset, so you'll see, of course, some higher NGL
prices just to reflect the current market. And you'll see the slightly lower ethylene prices. And of course, all of that is up
against a higher natural gas price. And so, as I mentioned in my comments, really those – all of those work to offset

each other primarily. So, really fairly little movement in the overall business on that.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay. Got it. And on the topic of ethylene, ethane prices, I mean, could you talk a little
bit about your thoughts on margins for Geismar over the long run obviously after it's up and running? Ethane has
spiked recently, but there's still plenty of supply coming on line, and on the pricing side, ethylene is largely driven by
crude, international crude. So, just some of the puts and takes there and your thoughts on how margins will shape up
over time.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Abhi, I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take that question for us.
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Sure. And thanks very much for the question. Starting with the – let's start with the
short-term look at ethylene. As we look back over our shoulder coming out of last year in anticipation of the second
quarter turnarounds that are in front of us, I think there are three crackers that are about to turn around in the second
quarter.
The industry, if you look at the inventory data, built inventory, and our estimate is that built somewhere between 700
million and 800 million pounds through the end of the year, that's roughly how much ethylene will be needed in the
second quarter. I think on the back of that, we saw the weakening prices in the first quarter. It's our expectation they'll
warm up again into the second quarter, and then back to what we would consider normal for the year in the latter part
of the year.
And so, I think that's the way we see this year playing out. If we look at ethane, I think in the short term, ethane is
facing some operational difficulties in the Gulf Coast, mainly related to brine as all the new fractionators are built there
in the Gulf Coast, I think folks just challenged in moving the inventories around as necessary because of some brine
difficulties. We think that's going to clear out over the short period of time. And as a result, coupled with – as a result, I
think we're going to see the ethane prices drop back to what would be a more normal level than the $0.30 per gallon
range I think's what we've got in our guidance.
So, I think that takes care of this year's view. So, now, as we look forward, the next significant tranches of ethylene
come in in the 2017-2018 timeframe. So, our expectation is, on the back of oil staying high and naphtha being
relatively related to oil, that our ethylene margins through that period and still we see new significant supplies of
ethylene come on in the latter part of this decade, I think our ethylene margins are expected to remain pretty strong.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then one last quick one, if I may, could you maybe talk
a little bit about recontracting on the Northwest and Transco pipelines in terms of what's up for renewal? How we
should think about changes in transportation rates? Obviously, Transco was running pretty close to full. Northwest is
not quite there, but any color there would be very helpful.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Okay. Great. I'll ask – we're in very good shape on that as well as Gulfstream. I'll ask Rory
Miller to take Transco, and then Allison Bridges can give you a response on Northwest. So, Rory, if you'll take that
Transco question.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Sure. Hi, Abhi. And yeah, that's a good question. Just thinking about Transco a little bit, we've
got what I would call some pretty fresh market signals around pricing with our new Atlantic Sunrise project. And
although we're not really disclosing all the information on it right now, the rates are significantly above where our
system rate is, I think we've got an average of six years or so on contract length there.
But we believe that with the change of the systems, supply coming in both ends and the kind of growth that we have
from the market size, it's truly a supply push, market pull kind of scenario. We believe, as those contracts roll off, that
re-upping those contracts is going to be very attractive for our end users. We don't think anybody in the marketplace
will be able to touch the opportunity that the LDCs have to just re-up those contracts. And in fact, that's what we've
seen as contracts roll off. We've not seen any pressure at all in terms of getting those recontracted. So, it's kind of a –
it's very healthy situation, and I think do in large part is due to the quality of the service and the positioning of the asset.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Great. Thank you. And, Allison, if you'll take the North question on Northwest?

<A - Allison G. Bridges>: Yes. On Northwest, we are fully subscribed even though we don't run at 100% load factor
day in and day out. We do – our contracts are fully subscribed, and I believe on average, we have a remaining term of
over nine years. And we continue to be able to extend terms with customers. Additionally, we're really starting to see, I
think, some exciting new market growth opportunities come to the Northwest through potential new fertilizer plants,
potential new methanol plants for export. So, I think that not only will that continue to bode well for our existing
capacity, I think longer term, it will also result in some expansion opportunity.

We'll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Hi, everyone. In the Northeast, your processing volume looked a bit stronger than I would have
expected. How much, if any of that, was due to benefiting from a third-party outage?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: There was some in the month – mostly in the month of December. There, Christine, that
came from the Natrium plant being down. And I think it was around – varied – but up to about 50 million a day during
the month of December.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then if I look at your NGL production, it looked like you guys may have hit your
fractionation capacity maybe at the end of 4Q or sometime this quarter. Is that the case, and is your new fracking online
today?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, we are up against the limits on the base frac and the second frac. We'll be
commissioning here towards the end of the first quarter.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. So, was there a buildup in NGL volumes that couldn't get fracked or not?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Going to Bluegrass, was there may be more acreage dedications than you would've liked
and not enough minimum volume and/or shipper pay commitments? Is the delay in the pipeline more about reducing
your volume risk, and that's only going to happen when producers feel more pain in netbacks? Also, have the smaller
projects that have been announced since your original announcement of the project played a part in pushing back your
timing?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, first of all, on the acreage dedication versus not enough volume, we certainly
appreciate both of those as contributions. But clearly, we want to have a base load of revenues that we can count on
initially. And so, that certainly is a major part of the issue.
Secondly, as to the smaller projects, I think those are great projects. I think they're needed, but they don't provide the
kind of long-term underground storage opportunities that you get with the Gulf Coast, nor the diversity of the markets
for both the growing Petchem business and as well as the export opportunities that are very large-scale in nature and in
well-protected ports. So, I would just tell you that I think – we're excited those other projects exist because we think the
growth in volumes certainly is dictating those kind of solutions, but we really haven't seen that as a big deterrent for
producers committing to Bluegrass.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then, last one for me, can you provide an update on the PDH facilities? Last we
heard, you narrowed it down to two international players, or two players, I guess, who were interested in building a
derivative plant alongside your facilities. But we'd like to know if there's been any progress there.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take that as well.
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Yup. Christine, thanks for the question. Yes, we've made some good progress there. We
actually narrowed it down to one person, and we're entering into definitive agreements on that. Give us a couple of

We'll go next to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: I was hoping just to possibly drill down a little bit more on the Northeast G&P. Would it be
possible to quantify how much weather impacted the quarter dollarwise?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would tell you it wasn't very large, actually. I'd say some of the more significant issues
were line breaks and a number of one-time operational expenses and some write-downs and so forth, but not too big of
a volume impact from weather. One impact, though, that we did suffer was the ethane limitations going into the
TETCO system, and so without the ethane systems being up and running yet, there were constraints that TETCO
imposed on points like the Fort Beeler connection that required curtailments there, and so that did have some impact on
our volumes in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. Thank you. And then as we look forward into 2014, I was just wondering if you could
provide any color on how you see this segment ramping up over the year. Do you expect first quarter to be similar to
fourth quarter or a steady ramp across the year or any step change in any given quarter?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, some of the big projects that we have coming on, of course, is the Gulfstar project
which would come on in the third quarter and the Keathley Canyon project, which comes on at the beginning of the
fourth quarter, and then the Rockaway Lateral project. Additionally, though, the projects in the Northeast, many of
which will come on either at the very end of the first quarter or the second quarter, really are some big drivers, not
necessarily just to volume, but to the rate that we achieve for those services.
And so, even though you – people have become accustomed to looking at volume there, a lot of that will just be an
increase in rate. So, those are really some of the big projects, I would say, on the Caiman system – sorry, on the system
in Susquehanna supply hub area with Cabot, those volumes continue to grow throughout the year and we're really
excited about the continued growth up there, and we're working very hard to keep the infrastructure out in front of that
growth up there. But that's pretty well steady. That growth will be pretty well steady throughout the year.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Okay. So, specific to the Northeast G&P, sounds like going into the second quarter, there
could be a bit of a step-change there?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Correct.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.

you mentioned at the start of the call?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Hi, Harry. This is Don Chappel. Good morning. Certainly our, I'll call it, policy and desires
have been to maintain investment grade ratings at Williams. We think that it provides a lot of flexibility and ability to
be opportunistic, particularly during very challenging times where the high-yield market is locked up. But having said
that, we're certainly open-minded to other paths that create more value, but it would have to be something compelling
that would cause us to deviate from the path that we're on. So, again, we continue to be open-minded, but we think it
would take a compelling value creation situation in order for us to deviate from our current path.
<Q - Harry Mateer>: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on Transco and Northwest earlier, I appreciate the
commentary on rolling contracts, but you said there's been no issue in getting contracts renewed and extended. But I'm
just wondering has pricing been stable as well, or do you feel like you're giving up some pricing to get tenor?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Rory, you want to take that, please?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Sure. Harry, we really haven't seen price pressure on those re-upped contracts. If you look at
where our system rights are, they're probably the lowest cost opportunity that people have in the marketplace. And so,
the other thing is so many of our – the LDCs that we serve, it's not like we're just dropping off large volumes of gas at
one point. And some of our bigger customers, we've got over 40 delivery points. And so, when you think about the way
that we're distributing that gas into a 60- or 70-year-old distribution system, and the low rates that we have that they
can re-up at, it's just really hard – virtually impossible to replace those with gas from a new competitor.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: And to be clear on that, we haven't discounted any of that firm. It's 100% contracted, and
the rates are getting set by those rate cases. But to those long-haul 100% firms, there's not any discount. There may be
discount in the production area for IT and so forth, but not on the long-haul firms.
<Q - Harry Mateer>: Great. Very helpful. Thank you.

We'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks. I guess first question for me. At the WMB level, you've obviously reduced the CapEx
here with Bluegrass getting pushed out. I'm wondering if you can just talk about capital allocation – [ph] also on
(50:58) the dividend. I don't know if share buyback, keeping dry powder for acquisitions. What do you do with the
extra cash now that you all have here for a little while?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Don, can you take that?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Ted, this is Don. I would say that the extra cash flow now is still going into some of our
growth projects like CNRL. And we'll see where Bluegrass goes. But for the near term, that extra cash is being
reinvested in that Canadian business. Longer term, I think we have a lot of options, and we'll have to see how things
play out here in terms of investment, as well as all the other options that we continue evaluating. I think as Alan
mentioned early on, that we continue to evaluate kind of all the options, and we're very open to possibilities that will
create additional value.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, great. And then we've sort of talked around it a little bit, but can you just give us a sense
on Atlantic Sunrise, the returns that we ought to be modeling in there? It sounds like it's higher than your current
system rates. I think there was some mention of $400 million of revenue. Just give a sense of what kind of returns on
the $2.1 billion of capital we should expect?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That looks like about a – without providing specific returns there, it does look like about a
seven multiple on that project. Of course, that's a little better than you normally would see on a pipeline project, and
some of that is driven by the fact that we did have the competitive advantage of having a lot of that service being
provided by the existing system. And so, that allows for some higher returns than normal.

<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: That's great. And then last one from me is you sound now a little more bullish on the Gulf. Any
thoughts on potentially a second Gulfstar here as you're getting close to completion of the first one? What's the
opportunity set look like right now?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, first of all, I tell you, one thing we are very excited about is the tiebacks that we're
seeing to both Gulfstar One and to the original Devils Tower spar, and I'll remind you those two facilities are fairly
close together, and so there's a pretty nice area there that we can serve from those two spars. And we are seeing some
nice tiebacks, and certainly the Gunflint tieback is a big boost to our expected economics for Gulfstar and came on
much earlier in our assumptions. In our projects like that, we assume some tiebacks for the future, but this one came on
much earlier than we had expected originally for that project. So, that's very positive. And of course, we've got a couple
of tiebacks to Devils Tower as well.
On the new spar front there, we have many projects that we're out there working. As you look out into the further
reaches, I will tell you, we're pretty excited about some of the opportunities that we see to serve Pemex, with some of
their big deepwater finds which I'll remind you are just south of our Perdido fold belt and our pipelines that go out to
serve Shell's projects at Perdido North.
So, anyway, we're very excited. We've seen a lot of interest in the product. But we don't have any capital in guidance
right now. We don't have enough confidence in those projects at this point to have any capital embedded in our
guidance right now.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Understood. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just maybe a few questions, if I could. Alan, maybe going
back to Bluegrass, if we get FERC abandonment in March, do you see that playing any type of a catalyst – did anyone
have any concerns over that as they may have with other alternative projects? And two, could you help us with any
color maybe you saw from the international Petchem community as far as going through Moss Lake and perhaps
getting capacity on Bluegrass from that end?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Well, those are both really astute questions. First of all, on the abandonment issue on
Texas Gas, certainly Boardwalk's in control of that issue, and I would defer that question to them. It certainly, at some
point, the timing of that abandonment would certainly play into the decisions on Bluegrass and a catalyst for a decision.
I would just say we're not certain of the timing on that, and I think we certainly work closely with Boardwalk. But
they've been working to manage that issue, but at some point, that would likely become an issue as abandonment order
would come out and a decision would have to be made in terms of which direction to take there.
On the question around the international players, lots of interest, a lot of big interest, I would tell you, from a lot of
international players. And I think there's some great strategic match-up there in terms of what we're trying to
accomplish in the markets that we're trying to present for our producers in the Northeast. But I also would tell you the
challenge to that is, it is a very slow process in terms of working through all the approvals – not regulatory, or anything
like that, but within the governance within those very large multinational corporations.
And so, we're excited about it in strategy, but it's a long arduous process to gain approval on that. And so, we're not
waiting around, I would just put it that way. We're not waiting around for those approvals. We're moving on, but we do
have a lot of exciting talks there. And we remain very excited about that strategically. But we've got to execute in the
nearer term sometimes than those parties can move to.

<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay. No, I appreciate the color. Two last questions, if I could, in understanding, with the
Canadian PDH we haven't seen the first one yet. So, I don't necessarily want to put the cart in front of the horse, but to
the extent that – my understanding was at the end of last year, we were looking at perhaps willing two different
companies, and that led into the potential, if even assessing a twin of the project. Is that something that is still
progressing, or is it more at this point let's get the first one locked up under construction, and then we'll perhaps assess
a twinning at that point?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Great question, Carl. I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take that.
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Yeah, I appreciate the question as well. Yeah, the second PDH is certainly still a bright spot
in our future that we want to keep our eye on. But I think you've got it exactly right that we need to have success with
the first one before we're ready to really take a big step into the second. The marketplace, though, is continuing to
express great interest. In fact, the partner that we're talking with is interested in the second one as well. So, just that
person is interested, and then we've got an arm's length long list of folks that have come and approached us about
number two. So, I guess I'll just say, stay tuned. It's more future growth opportunity for us up in the Canadian franchise.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Excellent. And then final question if I could, maybe one for Don and understanding that this is
sort of one of the risks that were outlined – the insurance recoveries for Geismar. And at the risk of perhaps
oversimplification, is there any additional color to share that, say, for instance, of the $125 million second payment that
should be coming this quarter, can you express that in any terms, excuse me, of bid versus ask of what you had
requested from the insurance companies versus what they were comfortable at this point paying out?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Carl, the insurers paid 100% of our claim to-date. So, I think, to-date, they've paid the
claim as filed, and I think we're pretty well paid up through the end of the year now, in fact. Obviously, the business
interruption loss mounts every month. So, we'll continue to update the claims process and make requests for additional
payments. And we'll see where that takes us. But the actual claim is based on actual losses. So, we can't expect to get
paid for February until sometime after February ends or March until after March ends, and we know what the real price
is. We're in the market and, therefore, the basis of our claim. So, those will kind of tick off periodically.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Excellent. Appreciate all the color, guys.

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Hi, Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: A couple of questions here. Alan and Don, on this call, you both commented a couple times
about being open-minded to transformational opportunities. But Don kind of emphasized the bar was set high for
giving up that investment-grade credit rating and also noted that WMB level free cash flow is already spoken for a bit
in the near term. My first question is, do you kind of see these ongoing internal discussions and discussions with
investors being an ongoing long-term issue to keep in mind, or something that's more of a 2014 catalyst?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I would just say – it's a great question, Craig, and thank you. But we've always have
got our eyes open to any arbitrage that's available in the market and any additional value we can add to our
shareholders through either transformational or structural changes. And as I mentioned earlier, I don't think anybody
can accuse us of not having been aggressive, and in fact, we've certainly been a leader in many of the structural changes
over the last several years.
And so, we'll continue to look for those, and I think the drivers will be what the market is valuing and how our
businesses are being best valued in the market. And we'll continue to look for those opportunities as time goes by. So I

don't – unless there became a roadblock between a really good idea and what we were willing to do, that would be a
catalyst that might limit at 2014. I just don't see that. I think we're very well-aligned with both Corvex and Soroban in
terms of looking for the great value.
I think their perspective is that we're well undervalued relative to marking to our peers, and that we've got the best
growth story in the business and we ought to be getting valued better than our peers, not just at par with our peers. And
so, I think they see a huge value gap there and I have to say, I share their perspective. And I'm very well-aligned and
we'll continue to work with them, or anybody else that has good ideas on how we could achieve that value.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. I appreciate that. And a couple more with Gulfstar One pending completion, do you see
this completion successful, on-time completion, being a catalyst for other significant deepwater projects?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would just tell you I think our producers, I think Hess and Chevron, and particularly Hess,
just because there's more visibility to them are going to wind up looking really smart on this project both in terms of the
time that they brought their production to market and the capital that they have tied up or the lack of capital they have
tied up. So, I think it's going to look like a really good project for them.
It's going to look like a good project for us because we're bringing in third-party volumes and we're marketing the
project for that. So, I think when people sit back and analyze that, they're going to look pretty smart and I think Hess
would want to do more business. Chevron would want to do more business like that, and I think their peers will get
pressured to do that kind of business as well. So, I think this is a smart solution out there, and certainly it gives – we'll
continue to gain confidence in our ability to execute on these kind of projects as well as the producing community.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And last two small ones, can you provide some more color around that $20 million
Petchem Services pipeline project write-off? And as a follow-up to Abhi's question about long-term commodity price
outlook, and I know this is going out a bit. But if we were thinking maybe nat gas and even ethane pricing especially
could be a headwind towards the end of the decade, would you consider leading up to that, balancing out your short
positions by expanding midstream processing, POP exposures through development or acquisition of new processing?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: First question on the write-off in the Petchem Services. That was related to an NGL
extension up in the Northeast, a line extension that through some potential partnering arrangements, we don't think we
need any longer. And so, we found a better solution than the investment that we'd made in the right of way and so forth
developing that project. So, that's the first one.
And then secondly, on the commodity price outlook – certainly the natural gas pricing is one that is kind of bittersweet
for us. In the short term, it would put pressure on our NGL margins, and therefore, ultimately on the ethylene spread as
well as ethane prices rise, as you mentioned. But the good news is, and I think this is very positive news, is that just as
we've stated, we're really trying to move towards being a volume-driven company, and with this shot in the arm from
the producers, the gas and the NGL prices that we think are going to spur additional drilling and additional volumes
into our system. And so, frankly, I think it's very – long term, very healthy for our business.
In terms of contract restructuring, I think you'll see that we continue to restructure into – away from the business, and if
you look at how rapidly our fee-based business is growing over the period, it's tending to push out the importance of
those NGL margins. And so, we're always looking to try to reduce the risk in exposure, but it has to be done with an
eye towards really the expected net present value versus the commodity risk. And so – but we're always looking to do
that. And we see great value in more predictable cash flows, and so we're always working towards them.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: I guess my question there was a little more focused on an appetite, even if the individual
investment is not as high-return in balancing out your commodity exposures longer term, so you have a little less
volatility. So in other words, would you be willing to go into fresh midstream commodity-exposed operations that
would balance out your existing risks?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I would say that I don't see adding POP contracts as reducing risk all that much,
frankly. And so I would say you'd see us investing in more fee-based investments. I think POP's a different kind of risk,
but I really don't see it balancing out all that much risk. We do have some contracts that do reduce risk, like our Laurel

Mountain contract with Chevron, that's a percent of gas. And that does, but that's not just limited to the processing
business; that's on the gathering business as well. And so, we certainly will look to those kind of opportunities that
reduce our exposure to natural gas, but not necessarily adding length and exposure to NGLs.

We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups. For the Atlantic Sunrise project, do you anticipate
that seven times multiple at the start, or is there a stairstep in the commitments to get to the full capacity?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, that is both initial and end-of-term revenue. So, that's fully contracted from day one.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay, great. And then also for the planned Canadian dropdown, any change in the target multiple?
I think you previously mentioned around seven times.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, we said less than seven times, and I think we're still on that same zip code.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay, great. And I guess given the recent news on Boardwalk, do you anticipate that this could
have an impact or bearing on shippers' decisions to commit to Bluegrass, or maybe on the way you would like to
structure the JV as the project goes forward?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, just to remind you, and I'm certainly going to be careful to not speak for Boardwalk
here, but I will tell you that Boardwalk's been very clear with us from the inception and have certainly recently
reiterated that that Lowes really stands behind the bulk of their capital commitment. And so, we deem not worry the
recent reduction in their distribution and the impact that's had on their company. So, we're very excited to have them as
a partner. They've been a great partner to work with. And we really don't see any issues there because they've got such
strong backing from Lowes on the project.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Timm Schneider with ISI Group.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Hey, good morning, guys. It's just I was wondering if you guys can maybe discuss what
you're seeing in terms of operating cost creep. Some of you are different service areas. So, if you look at Northeast, for
example, volumes and revenues were up pretty nicely. I think 18% sequentially, but that didn't really push through to
the bottom line. Was this kind of just one-time issue, or is there something else going on?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: It really – Timm, thanks for the question. It really is – has been a lot of one-time issues. We
also have allocated quite a bit of cost the way we allocate kind of our support services across the company. Those get
allocated on both the capital and a revenue basis. And so, the costs have been coming up directly with those allocations
as well. But for the most part, the real issue was a bunch of one-time matters in terms of writedowns and so forth that –
on various assets. And frankly, we're kind of cleaning up what's been a pretty fast-paced period up there. And I would
tell you, as we move forward, Jim Scheel and his team are going to be very focused on operational excellence and
really fine-tuning our cost structure up there.

So, I'm very confident in our team's ability to do that. If you look at our overall cost structure across the entire
company, you'll actually see that that actually, between our O&M and G&A actually reduced a little bit from 2012 to
2013 which is pretty impressive considering the amount of growth that we've been managing.
So, I'm very confident in our team's ability to get after costs and get those in line. But we've certainly been trying to
make sure we've got something. The reliability problem is behind us. And for the benefit of our customers and because
we saw that as kind of job one, and I think we've done that, and the reliability has been very, very impressive over the
last six to seven months. But it's come at some expense to get it there, and I think that's a lot of what you're seeing right
now.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Sure. And as a follow-up, can you guys discuss maybe your preliminary funding plans,
forward lending access? Are you kind of happy, I guess, the $2.1 billion, I guess, CapEx outlay at this point, or would
you consider selling some of that balance to another party?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, I don't think we would be planning on selling that down. It's part of the Transco
system. And as a result of that, it's not an individual project, the way like a Constitution project is. So, Constitution is
not part of the Transco system, and it allows for that. But being part of Transco makes that a little more difficult.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah, we like the risk-return profile there, and again, most of that capital is in 2017. The
amount of capital part in 2017 is pretty modest. So, it puts it out in the period where we'll have a lot of capacity and be
looking to make big investments.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Got it. Lastly from me. On Constitution, I guess what are some of the big moving parts
around the in-service date, whether it's going to be kind of end of 2015 or earlier 2016, and how are some of the
conversations going with producers in that part of the woods?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, the Constitution system is fully contracted, as you know, and so the discussions are
really more around what we all can do jointly to accelerate the permitting process. And really the permitting is the
issue. As I mentioned earlier, the FERC has certainly been constructive and they are pushing things along, but there are
some permitting requirements in the State of New York that for various reasons can be a bit of a barrier.
And frankly, I think we just got to work towards the right solutions that meets everybody's needs on that and I still
remain confident that we can do that. I think it's very clear, politically, that the infrastructure is desperately needed to
serve the New England market and I think that bringing that to light clearly and firmly will help bring some reason to
getting past some of the permit issues that we're facing right now.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: So, was that more at the state level, or was it actually land owners challenging rights of
ways?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, it's state permitting issues.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: All right. Got it. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Hi. Good morning. It's Faisel from Citi. I hate to beat a dead horse, but if I could just go back
to sort of the response that you guys have to the activism in the market in your stock, is there going to be like a formal
response from you guys – from all you guys to the activist shareholder's demands, or is there going to be any change in
the board over the next several months? I know that there were some requests by the activists to take board seats, too.
So, just wondering is there a time line when you have to respond to them or put out a formal sort of response and
discuss sort of whether the strategic options – at least adopt any strategic options that they're recommending?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Well, really, the only thing they'd really asked for at this point is the board seats, and
so, that's where the discussions have centered, frankly. And as you noted, we – I'm sure we put out an 8-K announcing
that we had expanded or extended the window for nomination post this call and our 10-K release, and that really was to
eliminate any disclosure kind of risk and really allow the parties to have a more thorough discussion post that
information being out there. So, I think you should see that as very accommodating on the company's part and very
interesting in continuing those discussions.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Is there a time line when these discussions end, and you guys all present your findings to the
market, or is it just going to be ongoing?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would say it's ongoing and certainly wouldn't try to speak for Corvex and Soroban, but I
think from a Williams' standpoint, we certainly are interested to reengage in the discussions. And again, just given the
timing that we were up against with the window closing ahead of the 10-K and our earnings release, we just wanted to
make sure that we didn't – that the compliance issues were first and foremost in the attendance of the various issues we
need to deal with there.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Fair enough. And just going back to the funding on Atlantic Sunrise, so do you guys
envision issuing PIK units in the future to fund the equity in this project, or do you think that the cost of equity will be
low enough at WPZ to move forward with a common equity offering?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Faisel, one is that the significant funding is a long way out. As I mentioned, the bulk of it
is in 2017. So – and we would expect the WPZ cost of capital to improve significantly, particularly as we – you know
as Alan cited here, we've got a lot of projects that are expected to go in service here in 2014 and 2015, which will really
boost WPZ cash flow and coverage. And as we do that and the coverage comes back to a – I'll call it a more attractive
level, we would expect WPZ will trade in line with fundamentals. So, I'd say we're optimistic that PZ will come back in
line here over the next year or so.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the time.

And we'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Thanks so much for the added color. I'll try to be quick. Appreciate you taking the
call this long. I guess first, Don, if you could talk about maintenance CapEx, I realized in the prepared remarks, you
talked about some synergies that were realized in 4Q that led to the improved spend versus what you had guided in the
third quarter, but just wondering a bit more about that, given that we didn't see any change in 2014 or 2015 guidance. Is
that more of just a one-time synergy, and if so, what sort of additional color around it?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: [ph] Louie (1:18:55), let me take that if I could, please. This is Alan. I think first of all, a
couple of drivers to that, we had a lot of maintenance capital items that had been driving a lot of the cost in 2011 and
2012, so they were Clean Air Act issues. There was a lot of required inspections on the pipeline to be done by a certain
period, smart pig inspections. And so we got a lot of that out of the way.
And we also, if you think about reducing risk on your systems and your asset integrity issues, you always want to hit
the systems that have the most risk on them first. And I would just tell you that our costs have been based, just
assuming that we would continue to find the same number of anomalies on our systems as we completed those smart
pigging and some of the hydro testing. And in fact, as we've gotten further down the profile on the lower-risk assets,
we've had less and less dig-outs, we've had less and less repairs required. And so that has driven some of that out.

In terms of – so if you're the team that's responsible for that asset integrity work when you do your forecasting for that,
you go in assuming you're going to have a certain amount of digs and a certain amount of anomalies to clear. And if
you don't find them, then those costs don't show up. Certainly the big cost is in the repairs of that. So that's one item.
And certainly, because we had such rough winter, out West in particular, towards – into the November and December
timeframe, it did slow down some of the work that we would have done in that period and would have expected to get
done in the fourth quarter.
And so, a little bit of that'll get pushed into 2014, but it's not like you miraculously have a bunch of new capacity to get
the work completed, so that tends to get pushed out into 2015 as well. And so, I would just tell you that we haven't
backed off at all in terms of maintaining the integrity of our systems and spending the right money; we've just been
very fortunate that a lot of the early work that we did was on some of our pipelines that needed the most reconditioning.
And as we move into the less – or the newer parts of our system, and the areas that we've had the less issues, our costs
are coming down as we do that pipeline inspection and asset integrity work.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Great, Alan. That's very helpful. As you think about the 2014 and 2015 program
then, just as a quick follow-up and what you have planned for asset integrity, might there be upside opportunities like
what you mentioned where you find less there than what you think given where you're moving to, or is it kind of an
entirely different aspect of the system?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, I think we're having a hard time really believing we're going to get that fortunate on a
repeated basis. And so, I would just tell you our assumptions haven't baked that in at this point. But certainly that
possibility exists, but we just haven't baked that in at this point. Secondly, I would tell you an area that may be an
impact on that would be around well-connect capital. Again this isn't built in, because we've seen gas prices and NGL
prices move up so nicely. We may see more drilling coming on which might increase our well-connect capital towards
the last half of the year. Of course that's – we love spending that money to the degree that it's producing revenues for
the future. But nevertheless, given the way we account for maintenance capital, we would include that well-connect
capital as maintenance capital.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay. Great. And I think that that actually dovetails rather nicely out to questions I
have on the West segment, Alan. We saw the ethane equity volumes come down again in a big way in 4Q. Obviously,
recognize rejection's been something we've grappled with all year, but I was curious. Two questions out there. One, if
there was something in particular that drove the change in 4Q that can be sort of isolated and highlighted.
And then two, as we think about 2014 and 2015, with the commodity construct we're seeing today, if you've had any
sort of revised views around what the volume could be out there. I did see WPX had numbers out last week calling
some increased numbers out of their Piceance program, for example. Sort of how that might translate into what you
guys are expecting out West.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, great question. I'm going to ask Allison Bridges to take that for us.
<A - Allison G. Bridges>: Yes. We did have some – a little bit of anomalies, I think, in the fourth quarter in that we
were – third parties were actually continuing to recover, and so we were actually giving them some of our equity
ethane, which was a positive thing from a financial standpoint. And additionally, we did have a contract that terminated
at the end of the third quarter. So, those two things caused a rather large drop in the fourth quarter.
We have been seeing some decline in volumes, as you said, we are starting to see some good times with increased gas
prices, as well as WPX announcing that they were adding rigs. So we do believe that a little bit out in the guidance
period, we're going to start to see a resting of some of those declines.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Great. Very helpful. One final follow-up for me, just to dovetail off of what Timm
had asked earlier about cost. Alan, we did see a very strong, be it relative to your guidance, in Atlantic Gulf. Obviously,
some cost creep continue in the Northeast. You had mentioned as you have in earlier quarters about sort of this
recalibration or reallocation of costs more towards the Northeast given the activity. Was any of that present in the
fourth quarter, or is that sort of – have we reached run rates we should expect from here?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, and just so you know, I mean I think if you're just focused on the Northeast segment,
you'll see movement. If you're looking at the total cost structure, you won't see that much movement as it relates to that
allocation. But it's basically just pulling cost out of area where there's less activity and less growth, and it's being
applied again. That's done on a modified mass basis, which basically takes in as the primary allocation is the capital
invested and the revenues.
And so as both the capital invested and the revenues grow there, it'll shift more cost to there. That doesn't necessarily
mean that the cost of that business directly is going up, but it just is the way the method that we allocate costs across
the business. And of course, we need to do that because we have regulated assets in our business as well. And so we
need to make sure that we keep proper tallies on how we allocate those costs, and we keep a constant method going on
how we do that.
So, the answer to your question is you'll probably continue to see some allocated costs even though, I would tell you, in
terms of the lack of operating profit performance in the Northeast for the fourth quarter, very little of that was driven
because we were already expecting that cost allocation, a lot of the drivers, really a bunch of one-time issues that we
had in the fourth quarter as I mentioned earlier.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay, great. I really appreciate all the added color. Thanks again.

And we'll go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Morning, guys. On Atlantic Sunrise, are these – is this 1.7 Bcf a day capacity incremental to
the current throughput on that system that's really running from south to north?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes.
<Q - Becca Followill>: So, it doesn't...
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: You mean...
<Q - Becca Followill>: It doesn't reverse-flow on any of the system to cannibalize the existing system, or is it all
incremental?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I think if you just looked at our initial flows back then, and you look at our initial
flows after the project is done, those two numbers are additive.
<Q - Becca Followill>: So, it won't displace any of the existing roughly 60% of contracts that you have rolling off by
2016?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, where the projects are going and deliveries for it will be incremental. And so, I think
you could – really if you think about it, it's the amount of gas going off the system that you would see. And so, while
you may see the benefit of physical displacement, allow us to increase our capacity. So, in other words, we don't have
to build as much capital as you normally would think to get incremental volumes because you got gas coming from
both directions, the volumes leaving the system will increase by that amount.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And then on Bluegrass, when should we expect a go or no-go
decision?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: As we mentioned earlier, we're still in those discussions, and I don't really think we should
pin that down, but – because frankly, it took some really big commitments, and we think it's the right project, and it's
taking some time to get people to make those huge, long-term commitments. But I really am not willing to put a
specific time line on that at this point, Becca.

closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thank you, Dana. Well thanks, everybody for joining us. We remain very excited about the tremendous growth
that we've got ahead of us. And a lot of big capital investments, as I mentioned, really on the backs of a lot of equity are
really to starting to come into 2014. We're pleased with the performance we saw for the fourth quarter and particularly
pleased with some of the operational reliability improvements that we've seen across the systems.
And so, we look forward to talking to you in the future and continuing to talk about the great growth story that we have
here at Williams. Thanks.
