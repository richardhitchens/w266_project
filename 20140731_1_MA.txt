Ajaypal Singh Banga
Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everybody.
So for the second quarter we're pleased to report a net revenue growth of 13%, both as-reported and adjusted for
currency. That increase was driven by healthy volume and transaction growth, which resulted in net income growth of
10% as-reported or 9% adjusted for currency and an EPS growth of 14%. And these results include the impact of all the
acquisitions that we have completed so far this year.
So let's start with looking at the underlying global economic trends with the United States where the economy seems to
be improving but not without some challenges. Our second quarter SpendingPulse data showed U.S. retail sales ex-auto
growing at 3.8%, and that's a noticeable improvement over the first quarter number of growth of 2.3%. However, over
that quarter, the monthly trend decelerated, partially as a result of lower gasoline spending, which consumers did not
appear to roll over into additional discretionary spend.
Having said that, overall we think the current U.S. economic recovery is very much a work in progress. We see some
favorable indicators: the continued improvement in unemployment figures, consumer confidence levels and so on, but
in fact, early indications for July retail sales, again ex-auto, are showing further improvement over the second quarter.
But there are some factors that could weigh on that economic recovery like the slowing recovering in housing and the
improvement in unemployment coming in part from an upswing in part-time workers rather than just full-time
positions. So despite those mixed signals, our U.S. business saw an improvement in the quarter, primarily driven by
stronger growth in our consumer credit volume and continued good growth in commercial credit.
Europe. Europe continues on a slow recovery path. PCE growth protection remains unchanged for the year at 3.5%.
Consumer confidence, economic sentiment, unemployment rates all continue to improve across the region and if you
add to this, in the case of the U.K. in particular, our SpendingPulse data showed retail sales ex-auto growing by 4.8% in
that quarter, one of the strongest rates for the last four years, with growth spread evenly across the sectors. So
MasterCard's total European volume growth for the second quarter was in the low teens, processed transaction growth
was in the high teens, both a bit lower than the first quarter. The region's growth was driven by a number of countries,
including Russia, Turkey, Sweden, and Italy.
In Latin America, full-year GDP growth expectations for the region have been revised down from 2.5% to 2.3%
because of slower than expected performance in some of the key countries including Brazil and Mexico. And our
second quarter SpendingPulse data from Brazil shows the retail sales grew 4.1%, down from the 5.9% growth in the
first quarter. And this by the way is the weakest growth rate since August of last year. On the other hand, the Mexican
economy showed some improvement in the second quarter, and we believe that will continue as the U.S. economy
improves. Our business in the region remains healthy, but it has slowed somewhat over the first quarter with second
quarter GDV growth in the low teens and processed transaction growth remaining in the high teens.
Across the Asia-Pacific region, business sentiment and consumer confidence were up with improvements in many
countries tied to changes in their political environments. And our business and Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa
continues to do well with processed transaction growth remaining about 30% and GDV growth in the high teens for the
second quarter.
So before we go to some of our business highlights, let me say a few words about a couple of legal and regulatory
matters. And first with regard to the proposed European interchange legislation, not much has changed since last

quarter. We are actively engaged with all parties while the Council of Ministers continues its review. We still believe
that the proposed legislation is most likely to be adopted sometime in the first half of 2015.
Second, let's talk about Russia. As you know, the Russians are implementing changes to their domestic payments
market in the form of a new payments law which will impact MasterCard. We are pursuing multiple options to comply
with the new law while fulfilling our U.S. obligations. And according to that law, ownership of domestic Russian
switching has to be majority controlled by a Russian entity and should use Russian technology in order to relieve a
foreign payments network from the collateral requirement that has now been delayed, by the way, till October 31. The
law provides some flexibility. You are all aware of our RFP process to find a local switching partner as one path that
we are pursuing.
In addition, the processing center we currently have in Russia, we believe, gives us the basis to build our own on-soil
switching capabilities, and we are exploring options to leverage that as well. Overall, we expect only minimal impact
from the current Russian situation on our 2014 results. But that situation is still fluid, as you all know. It's difficult to
put any future annualized impact into precise dollars. But if you look for a number, press for a number, our estimate
today would be that our revenue could be impacted by something less than $50 million in a full calendar year of this
effort. The exact amount along with any investment required for our on-soil switching capability will obviously depend
on the final form of our operating construct in Russia.
So let's move on to some of our recent business activity. First, talking about Russia. I will tell you that as we continue
to work through the challenges there, our business continues to move forward. For example, we just renewed our
business agreement at Alfa-Bank, Russia's largest private bank and that should help us expand our existing partnership
in issuing affluent cards and accelerating the growth of contactless technology in the Russian market.
So let's go beyond that to talk about how we deepen our relationships with merchants and leverage these into
partnerships to grow our business, and we will highlight some recent initial activity in that space, but not only with
merchants but also with mobile operators and with governments. We've been investing in our merchant relationships
over the past few years. We are now 40% of our customer facing salespeople in the United States are dedicated to that
space.
Last quarter, I mentioned the Walmart, Sam's Club and Target wins, and this quarter we've got a few more to talk
about. Beginning in spring of 2015, BJ's Wholesale Club will be converting their entire credit business to chip-enabled
MasterCard credit cards, and we are pleased to be chosen as BJ's partner to help them deliver a more secure solution for
their cardholders. We've also had a couple of important renewals in our merchant co-brand business with Sears and
Expedia continuing our long-standing expanding relationship with both of them.
Outside the U.S., MasterCard was selected as the co-brand partner for the Landmark Shukran credit card in the UAE.
Landmark Group is one of the largest retail organizations in the Middle East, 1800 stores. They also have the region's
largest retail loyalty program in seven countries with almost 6 million members.
For us, our business with merchants is not just about co-brands. We're also working with merchants in a number of
activities that leverage our other assets, Advisors, MasterCard Labs and so on. So using our Advisors data analytics, we
are working with Expedia to help them improve the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns by identifying the best
people to target, and with Shell and Williams-Sonoma to enhance their loyalty propositions.
Another example, we working with a major cruise line to identify opportunity for them to reduce their costs by moving
their B2B payments from Checkwire and ACH to purchasing cards and virtual card numbers using our inControl
capability.
And finally with MasterCard Labs, we're bringing our partners together to help solve some of their business challenges.
And one example earlier this summer, MasterCard worked on the first-ever In-Flight Wearable Technology Hackathon
with American Airlines where we gave our technology and our mentorship and we used technology tools like Simplify
Commerce and MasterPass to develop wearable solutions for travel.

Moving onto mobile, last quarter we talked about mobile as being just one of the many ways that consumers are
shifting from physical to digital payments and how it represents one of the most significant changes in our space. In
this quarter, we continue to develop and expand our partnerships with both handset manufacturers and network
operators.
So a couple of examples: we worked with Samsung in Australia last year, if you remember. We continue to deepen that
relationship by launching Russia's first contactless mobile payment service with Russian Standard Bank. Using
Samsung phones, Russian Standard's mobile banking application and MasterCard's mobile NFC technology, our
pre-paid products and enhanced processing services, this partnership brings our products and services together to
deliver innovation in yet another market with Samsung.
In Canada, Rogers Wireless, which is that country's largest wireless service provider, they've got 9 million subscribers
or so, recently launched their suretap wallet, and that's got a MasterCard prepaid card embedded inside. That new
application allows Rogers' subscribers to use their NFC-enabled smartphones to make contactless payment which are
already accepted, for example, in Canada in 18 of the 20 largest merchants.
Then onto MasterPass, we're continuing with our global expansion of MasterPass. MasterPass, as you know, is our
digital acceptance platform connecting consumers and merchants. And this quarter, MasterPass launched in Singapore,
in Poland and South Africa. We're now up to 10 markets. We expect to do four more by the year end.
It's more than a wallet, by the way, it's a platform that provides a safe and secure foundation to support multichannel
shopping and the ability to create innovative tools that you can use to enhance the consumer buying experience before,
during, and after the actual purchase. Over the next few years, we think we will be in all the markets that represent
about 75% of our total volume. MasterPass has been designed from the start with tools that make it very easy for
merchants and issuers to integrate with it.
Last quarter, we launched our in-app payment capability. Now we've got a number of merchants, one example is
Starbucks in Australia, committed to including MasterPass in their apps.
So finally, partnerships with governments and our efforts at financial inclusion. To drive this expansion, you've got to
connect the right technologies and platforms whether it's prepaid and mobile payments with a network and then adapt
them to the local marketplace. And the only way that happens is if you have the right partnership between the public
and private sector.
We're actually seeing the results of some of that work happening today. In the last two years, we've launched over 100
new programs designed to bring access, convenience and security to over 350 million people around the world who
didn't have access to financial products before these programs were launched.
You already know a few in South Africa and Nigeria. I'm going to give you some more color with a few more
examples this quarter. So in Pakistan we are partnering with the Bank of Punjab to issue millions of prepaid cards with
biometric recognition to the nearly 90% of the Pakistani population who are unbanked and receive funds from
government disbursement programs. This program will help the government of Pakistan improve their service, reduce
inefficiencies, reduce leakage in the process.
And in June, we announced the launch of the first Arabic mobile money implementation with the National Bank of
Egypt and the mobile network Etisalat. The service called the "Flous" Wallet, I hope I got that right, will allow Etisalat
subscribers to transfer money, pay their bills, top off their mobile phones, and make purchases either online or
face-to-face.
Also, in June, Tabung Haji, the first and largest Islamic non-bank financial institution in the world, launched their first
Sharia-compliant debit MasterCard. So cardholders can use their card anywhere MasterCard is accepted, including on
their pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. This event marks the beginning of a broader collaboration with Tabung Haji in
the Islamic payment space, and together we are supporting Malaysia's economic transformation program to drive
financial inclusion and to accelerate that that country's migration to electronic payments.

So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics.
Martina?
Martina Hund-Mejean
Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.
Let me begin on page three of our slide deck where you see the as-reported as well as FX adjusted growth rates. All of
my comments pertain to the FX adjusted figures, which are almost the same as the as-reported numbers.
So we're very pleased with our strong performance this quarter. Net revenue growth was 13%. This, combined with
operating expense growth of 14%, resulted in a 9% increase in net income. While acquisitions had minimal impact on
net revenue and net income in the quarter, they did contribute 3 ppt to operating expense growth.
EPS growth was 14%, and share repurchases contributed $0.04 per share. During the second quarter, we repurchased
almost 16 million shares at a cost of approximately $1.2 billion. Through July 24, we've purchased an additional 1.4
million shares at a cost of approximately $106 million, and we now have $728 million remaining under the current
authorization. We will continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.
Cash flow from operations was $729 million, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and other liquid
investment of about $5.7 billion.
So let me turn to page four, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross
dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis, down slightly from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV
grew 9%, which was essentially the same as last quarter. On the credit side we had strong volume growth of 10%. This
was an increase from last quarter, driven by improvements in consumer credit with growth in high single digits and
continued strong growth in commercial credit which was in the mid-teens. Similar to last quarter, our U.S. debit growth
was 9%.
Outside of the U.S. volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis. This continued to be driven by APMEA with
high-teens growth. Cross-border volume grew 16% on a local currency basis, just slightly lower than the 17% we saw
in the first quarter. Growth in both APMEA and Europe was in the high-teens. Key contributors to this growth included
the U.K., Italy, and Sweden. The deceleration of cross-border volume growth in Canada and Brazil continued into the
second quarter, and in addition we saw a deceleration in Australia, Russia, and China, with Australia likely due to
currency.
Turning to page five, processed transactions grew 12% globally to more than 10.6 billion. We continue to see
double-digit growth in most regions. And globally, the number of cards grew 8% with over 2 billion MasterCard and
Maestro branded cards.
Now let's turn to page six, and here, we're going to go through some highlights on a few of our revenue line items.
Domestic assessments grew 10% while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 3 ppt gap is primarily due to higher volume
growth in markets with lower than average revenue yields.
This lower yield continues to be impacted by two factors. The first is lower fees in some markets as a result of either
local market structure or the existing domestic schemes that we compete against. And the second is a higher proportion
of cash volume particularly in emerging markets. Now this second factor actually does provide us with a good
opportunity for future growth as we work to influence consumer behavior to use electronic forms of payment directly at
the point-of-sale instead of cash.
Cross-border volume fees grew 13% while cross-border volume grew 16%. After excluding the 4 ppt contribution from
pricing, the resulting gap between revenue and volume growth continues to be due, for the most part, to the higher mix
of intra-European activity.

Transaction processing fees grew 14%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in processed transactions. Overall our net
revenue growth was 13% both as-reported and FX adjusted, as the impact of the euro and the real essentially offset
each other. Beyond those two currencies, we still experienced some headwinds, although a little less than last quarter,
from the weakening of the other local currencies, such as the Russian Ruble, the Turkish Lira, the Argentine Peso, and
the Canadian Dollar and that was reflected mainly in the domestic assessment category.
Let me move to page 7, and here you can see total operating expenses were up 14% in the quarter, in line with our
expectations. As I said before, 3 ppt was due to expenses related to acquisitions which were mainly in the G&A line. So
when looking specifically at the 19% growth in G&A, our acquisitions primarily, C-SAM and Provus along with the
consolidation of our majority owned HomeSend investment, contributed 3 ppt. The balance of the growth is primarily
due to the continued organic investments we are making in strategic initiatives. The decrease in advertising and
marketing was mostly due to lower media spending relative to last year.
And finally, the $20 million increase in D&A is the result of our growing level of capital expenditures mainly
associated with additional investments in technology to support initiatives like MasterPass and Priceless Cities. It also
includes the impact of the amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions we made.
Turning to slide eight, let's discuss what we've seen in July through the 28th. Each of our business drivers is slightly
down compared to the second quarter, but most are still in double digits. All of this has been factored into our full-year
outlook. So the numbers through July 28 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 11%,
down slightly from the second quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 8%, down 2 ppt from what we saw last
quarter. As expected, we are now seeing more of an impact from the Chase migration. Processed volume growth
outside of the U.S. grew 14%, about 1 ppt lower than the second quarter, primarily due to some continued deceleration
in Brazil, Russia, and Canada. Globally, processed transaction growth was 10%, also about 2 ppt lower than what we
saw in the second quarter, including the Chase migration.
And now with respect to cross-border, our volume grew at a healthy 14% globally, about 2 ppt lower than the second
quarter. For the most part, this deceleration can be explained by three factors. The first is the timing of Ramadan, the
impact of which we expect will reverse in August. Second, the impact of foreign exchange on consumer purchasing
power in certain travel corridors, such as Canada into the U.S., and lastly, the impact of some government imposed
taxes on foreign purchases, particularly from Brazil.
Looking forward, let's begin with our long-term performance objectives for the 2013 to 2015 period. We continue to
believe that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR and at least 20% EPS CAGR. This includes
our views on the developments related to Chase, Russia, and the European regulation that we talked about. We also
remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember, these objectives are on a constant
currency basis and exclude new M&A activities.
As we discussed at last year's Investor Day, we are looking to add capabilities in strategic spaces such as loyalty,
processing, mobile, information services, and safety and security, both organically and inorganically. Over the past four
to five years, we've looked at a large number of opportunities but only a few have met our strategic and financial
criteria. Although it can often take many months to evaluate and close a deal, it just so happens that several have come
to the finish line within a relatively short period this year. Our past acquisitions like DataCash and Access Prepaid
along with the five we've done so far the year, so that's Provus, C-SAM, ECS, Pinpoint and our majority investment in
HomeSend, all of these deals are on point from a strategic perspective and help us grow our business. You should
expect us to continue to evaluate more such investments.
So moving on, let me offer some commentary about 2014. So while M&A activities are not included in our
performance objectives, we continue to get a lot of questions about how they will impact our as-reported financials. So
let me take this opportunity to provide a little more color on that. As I discussed on last quarter's earnings call, EPS
dilution is expected to be $0.06 to $0.08 for the full year 2014. Specifically, most of the impact will show up in the
G&A line, and we expect G&A to increase by about $80 million in each of the two remaining quarters before
considering any organic growth in G&A over last year. Including the impact of these acquisitions, the expected growth
rate in G&A for the second half of the year will be in the high-teens.

Now here are some additional thoughts about 2014 which are essentially unchanged since our last call. Our expectation
for full-year net revenue growth remains at the low end of our three-year range. The strong underlying growth trends
we are seeing in volume and transaction is allowing us to absorb the minimal impact expected from the Russian
situation as well as a good portion of the attrition that we anticipate from Chase this year. The pace of the Chase
attrition during the second quarter was essentially in line with our internal projections, and we continue to believe most
of it will occur in the latter half of this year with the remaining flowing over into 2015. In addition, we also continue to
expect a one PPT contribution to our 2014 as-reported net revenue growth from our M&A transactions.
Overall, we haven't changed our view about total operating expense growth from what we said in May, that we expect
the as-reported growth rate for full year 2014 to be in the low-teens after including the impact from M&A activities.
Along with the growth in G&A that I just talked about, we continue to expect D&A growth in the 25% range for
full-year 2014, due to our higher level of capital expenditures as well as the impact of amortizing intangible assets
related to acquisitions.
As a reminder, you should be reflecting roughly $10 million per quarter to account for the interest expense associated
with the debt offering we launched in late March. When we look at the sell-side models out there, it appears that many
of you still have not accounted for this in your other income and expense line. For now, you should also continue to
assume a full year tax rate of about 32% but recognize that we're still working on a number of initiatives better align
our tax structure with our business footprint which will likely result in a lower tax rate over time.
Finally, with respect to foreign exchange in 2014, if those rates remain similar to where they are today, so that's the
Euro trading at the 1.34 level and the Brazilian real at the 2.23 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the Euro
and the Real would be a slight tailwind for the full year. Further, beyond the functional currency impact of the Euro and
the Real, we have already seen an almost 2 ppt headwind to net revenue growth year to date from other currencies
depreciating against the U.S. dollar and the euro. As I said before, we carefully manage those exposures but we have
also assumed some impact for the rest of the year.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?
Barbara L. Gasper
Thanks, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. Don't forget my earlier comments that if
you dialed into the queue when you first joined the call, you will need to register again to ask a question. And in order
to get as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for
additional questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Great, thanks. Thanks for all the details. Just wanted ask on the cross-border yield, which was
stronger than we expected, I heard there was some pricing that helped there. But can you also just comment on how
sensitive your revenues can be from FX volatility? I know that Visa put that in our minds quite a big, so I'm curious
how much settlement trading has an impact on your business and also if this new pricing that you put in is sustainable?
Thanks.

<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: First of all, we said that we had in the quarter 4 ppt impact from pricing in the
cross-border fees. Quite the majority of that is actually going to roll off next quarter. Okay?
Secondly with respect to foreign exchange volatility, our cross-border volumes are really only impacted from a foreign
exchange volatility in terms of what the exchange rates are in terms of where people are actually transacting. What we
do from a settlement trading revenue point of view when we actually affect that exchange, that is not reflected in the
cross-border fees, it's actually reflecting in the transaction processing fee. And when we look at the foreign exchange
volatility, it did go down over the last year or so, but in terms of an impact on our settlement trading fees, it was
relatively small. We're talking about $10 million or so. So it was not a big factor for us at all.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Your next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Yea. Hi, guys. I just wanted to follow up then on cross-border. Just trying to understand when
we look at the competitors and your volume, your volume seems to be so much higher. Just trying to figure out how
much of that is share gain or is that just business mix? Obviously, Europe plays a part in this, so if you can just help us
understand kind of volumes versus the industry. Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes, Bryan, so when we look at our cross-border, as I said, it was 16% this quarter, the
prior quarter was 17% and when we pull out Europe in the prior quarter, we basically said was the same number, 17%
growth. When you look at it this quarter and in the second quarter and you pull out Europe, actually for the rest of the
world, we grew 14%. So it all depends on mix in terms of where people are traveling to and what the overall mix
comes out.
Operator
Thank you.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: I was going to ask if there's any share gains there before, is share gains explaining a lot of this
besides mix? I mean, are you gaining share and taking away from competitors?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Look, I think it's a number of factors. One is obviously what are you doing with the
existing portfolio that you have of banks and in terms of are you are pointing the portfolios to be able for people to
really use those cards across borders and transact in other countries. Two, obviously there are some share gains in it,
but I think you're going to have to look at this very comprehensively that there are a number of drivers.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, helpful. Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes, I just want to correct one thing. When I said I pulled out Europe, it's not all of our
European region. It's really Western Europe, which is synonymous to where Visa Europe is operating.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Thanks so much.

<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Yes, hi, thanks. I wonder if you could just provide some more color on the consistent
increase in growth in U.S. credit purchase volumes we've seen over the last two quarters. Is most of that Citi
reinvigorating the American Airlines co-brand or are there other things that are big contributors?

<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: It's Ajay. It's a bunch of things. We've been winning some co-brands over time, Citi
American is clearly one of them, but there are others too. And going against it is the roll off of the Chase book. That's
been relatively slow in the first half but it's picking up as we expected in the second half, so it's kind of an in and out
over there that's going on in the consumer part of the book. And our commercial credit book continues to do well. It's in
a higher growth rate in the low to mid-teens kind of number compared to the number for the consumer book. But it's a
mix of the two things that's going on.

Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: Thank you. I was hoping to just get a little bit more cadence on the rebate line
given the Chase conversion is now underway. Could you just talk about how we should think about how that progresses
through the rest of the year? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: I don't think that you should be expecting any major surprises on that. So when you
look at this year versus last year on a quarter-by-quarter basis, the only thing that you saw last year is that we had a
little bit less of rebates in the second quarter and a little bit more in the fourth quarter. So I think for this year, we
should just expect a little bit more of an even distribution of that, i.e., you are not going to see the fourth quarter going
up in such a significant way.
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: And then maybe just for the year, it's kind of comparable, then?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Very comparable.
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: All right, great. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. I wanted to kind of turn back to the acquisitions, because I guess the
guidance you gave us on revenue is 1% for the full year, so that's roughly $140 million. I mean it sounds like the costs
are still higher than that kind of on a run rate. So could you talk a little bit about how you see that progressing into 2015
and ultimately, I mean, I understand that some of the acquisitions don't have a ton of revenue coming with them, so
could you just talk a little bit about how you think about them in terms of the returns that they're going to generate for
the company?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes, look, we are separating acquisitions really into two buckets. One bucket is
capability set and the things that we really need to do in order to effect some of our strategies. I would put for instance
a company like C-SAM in that. To be honest, C-SAM did not come with a lot of revenues but they came with a huge
amount of capabilities, over 200 engineers in India that are really very well trained on mobile platforms and helping
significant on our execution in the MasterPass arena.
The other part of the acquisitions are finding fully fledged businesses like the business that we just closed, which is
Pinpoint and that came in literally at the end of the quarter, so you're not seeing a lot of revenues there. That's a
fully-fledged business: it comes with revenues, it comes with expenses and you will be seeing that coming in over the
next couple of quarters and more still given the other acquisitions on the expense line and on the revenue line, but you
should be expecting that over a number of years will be really helping – that these businesses really will be helping,
aiding our growth.

From a dilution point of view, I already talked about the $0.06 to $0.08 in 2014. I think you should still expect some
dilution in 2015, probably to the tune of half of that number.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Remember that these acquisitions are lapped during the year. Different ones are done at
different times of the year. The impact of their dilution will depend on that portion of the impact in the calendar, and
that portion will run over into the next year as well. That's what Martina is referring to.
By and large, most of the deals we do, even if we get revenue, there may be a dilution in the first year, because we're
ending up either putting an investment into their capability to either raise their safety and security capabilities or their
accounting and compliance capabilities to what we would feel comfortable with, just given how that interfaces with the
rest of our company.
And so a lot of money goes into that effort, into upgrading their accounting, into updating their compliance, into
upgrading their firewalls, into upgrading their safety systems, their capabilities in cyber security, hiring of a few new
people, that's what goes into the first part. That tends to create some dilution.
Companies like C-SAM the other hand are all about rolling out MasterPass and all that we want to do in the mobile
space, as I said we're in 10 countries already. That's way more than anybody else is in. And by the way, we're adding
four more by the end of the year, and in two years we're going be in 75% of our GDV. I doubt we could have done that
without the acquisition of C-SAM and its innate capability of that very talented workforce that they have.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Just as a follow-up, any comment on the current pipeline of future deals?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: You will listen to us when we have a deal to tell you about.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Thanks so much.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Obviously, we have been here these five years now, almost. I think Martina and I have
probably looked at 100-plus deals, right? And we have done two before this year, three, maybe, including Truaxis
which is capability small, and now we have added these five here. Some of the five we've done just now like ECS, we
bought a share in ECS two years ago, and we've worked with them for two years before entering into this transaction.
We've been working with C-SAM for well over two years as well.
So a lot of these deals, they're in the hopper for a while, and there are others in the hopper. I just don't have the ability
to predict for you when exactly they may come to fruition or frankly we'll just get away from them because they don't
work either in a return sense, or a management capability sense, or a geography sense, or a product set sense. It's got to
a fit one of the strategic needs, and that's kind of how it's constructed.

Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim E. Schneider>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just comment
on the domestic assessment yields that you mentioned the lower yield trend you saw in Q2. How should we think about
that trend continuing or reversing over the next few quarters, please?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Look, I think you should be thinking about that trend continuing. This is not a new
trend. We've been seeing that for a number of years, actually. And you will continue to see it as we are really growing
in a major way in markets outside of the United States in many emerging markets where there are certain structures and
in some markets you have domestic schemes where you have to compete against, and so you're going to have to align
your pricing structure in that way.
In addition to that, look at all of the things that we're doing in the financial inclusion space. Ajay was talking a little bit
about it. When people get an electronic payment means in their hand first, typically they're accessing ATMs first and

pulling cash out of the ATM, and then they walk across the street to be buying something in a store. That is typically a
lower yielding transaction for us.
As we are actually working with those countries and with those consumers to be migrating them to be not going to the
ATM but directly to the store, that is where you're going to see some movement from us in terms of being able to get a
higher yield. But I think you should continue to see that trend for quite some time to come.

Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Is it possible to quantify the impact from the Chase conversion that's
in terms of what's embedded in your guidance for the year and any sort of color on the potential margin or yield impact
from that? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes, so, Moshe, actually all of that is comprehended in what my thoughts said about
2014 revenues. It's also comprehended in the 2013 to 2015 performance targets that we laid out. We saw only a little bit
in the second quarter, right? You saw a little bit of an impact when you look in particular at our U.S. credit numbers,
even though they're very strong at the 8% range. And you are going to see more in the third and the fourth quarter. We
think that a fairly large portion of the portfolio will be rolling off, but we also believe that some remaining portion of
the portfolio will be rolling off in the first and the second quarter.
As we told you before, we do not have a schedule from Chase, so we don't really know. This is all our own internal
projections. And as we are having these earnings calls, we'll update you.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Anything on yield or margin impact?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: On the yield, I think you should see some relatively same yield over – like you saw
over the last couple of years. I think you should see very similar yield development going forward. There's not going to
be too much of a difference.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Remember, our yield is comprised of many different things. It's not just one client, even
if they're a decent sized one. It has all to do with geography, it has to do with mix of products, it has to do with mix of
clients, it has to do with so many factors that trying to isolate that one client's yield impact on MasterCard's total, that's
a rat hole you're going into.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks, guys. You know trends even beyond cross-border on the top line look pretty strong,
at least versus our estimates. Notably the transaction processing line in particular also, I mean it grew and it grew
materially faster than the actual transaction process growth itself. Again, just if you could give us a little more color on
sort of what drives that difference. And then secondly, on the other revenue line, anything that is notable there from the
sequential revenue increase?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes, okay. So first of all, from a transaction processing fee point of view, you have a
little bit of pricing in there which is, by the way, coming off in the third quarter and you have a little bit of the
acquisition revenues in there, okay? So while that is not a real driver on the total top line, as some acquisition revenues
is in the transaction processing fees. And by the way, some of that, some little acquisition revenues is also in the other

growth line.
But the other revenue growth line is really driven by a couple of factors. One, our Advisor consulting businesses doing
extremely well. This is the business that is really helping many, many banks as well as merchants around the world to
be executing on the projects that they have to execute on.
Secondly, you're seeing our Information Services business, that is where we are actually doing the data utilization and
really helping people to be analyzing some of the things that they would like to do. That is really coming to fruition.
And lastly, we are also seeing some very nice growth with Access Prepaid. So for instance, we talked to you last
quarter, the quarter before about Qantas. Some of these deals that Access Prepaid are doing are actually going into that
line item.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: All right. That's helpful. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted ask sort of a larger broader strategic question on
pricing. It seems like you had a little bit of a tailwind this quarter that is lapping and sort of going away next quarter, it
sounds like. So not much pricing for the rest of this year, but as you look out, I know you're always opportunistic but it
seems like one of your largest competitors has been more drawing a line in the sand on pricing. And I was just
wondering if that in any way impacts your thinking and how you view pricing going forward relative to how you've
used pricing over the last four or five years? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Look, we don't look at pricing in isolation. Pricing has to be part of the business and
we have to be sure in terms of the value that our products develop that we put the right kind of pricing in the market in
order to make sure that people are using our product. And from there on, that is our pricing thoughts, and that has really
not changed over the last few years, I would say. So you see for some years where we have fairly small pricing, for
some years we have a little larger pricing, and I don't think from a strategic point of view we have seen changes in the
market that would lead us to believe that we are changing our thinking on that.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: My view, just to be clear, the impact of pricing in the second quarter of this year, yes
there is some impact left over in the cross-border area, but if you look at our total revenue growth for the quarter, there
was very little impact from pricing, just to be clear. It was there in the first quarter. It was not there in the second
quarter.
The second part of this is that if you look at our strategy on pricing, our strategy on pricing is that we have effectively
looked at it, there's so many lines of pricing in so many countries that people are always looking, like Martina said, for
the opportunity of the right place where the value equation makes sense.
I very consciously took pricing off the table as part of our guidance when I came, because I don't believe that's the
strategy for the company. The strategy for the company is to grow our franchise and grow to our revenue and to keep
taking some pricing benefits as they come. And that's what we're doing. When you talk about how our numbers are
doing this quarter or last quarter vis-à-vis any other competitor, I don't even look at it as a traditional competitor, I look
at our growth in the space and how much opportunity there is in our industry. And I think 30% (sic) [13%] revenue
growth is a good place to be.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: I agree. Thank you.

<Q - James E. Friedman>: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask about the commercial product, Ajay, you had alluded to the
progress there in some of your prepared remarks. Two questions there. Do you believe you're taking market share in
commercial? And secondly, is it biased more domestically versus internationally? Thank you.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So first of all, I am very glad you used the carefully word – the word prepared. Barbara
thinks I don't follow my prepared remarks. And she was making jokes about it before we started the call about my
ad-libbing. Anyway, I will remind her of that and I will ask her to talk to you in great detail.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: [Laughter]
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Now the actual commercial product thing, yes we are gaining share. We've been gaining
share for a few years now, two to three years. I actually think there's more opportunities up ahead if we can keep
executing on the hard work that our product teams have done to put together a value prop that makes sense, and there's
more to be done in that space.
We're really our journey on this whole commercial space. I don't believe MasterCard had adequately worked in this
area five, seven years ago. So I think we're really getting to our right place there. Yes, we are growing share.
Is it biased to the U.S.? Not really. Actually, let me make sure that I answer that question correctly. We are growing in
commercial around the world. The U.S. was the one that first jumped onto executing against the improved product
quality and using all our tools like Smart Data and virtual cards and purchasing cards and all those pieces. And they
worked on it. And now it's moved overseas as well to other regions, but it started in the U.S. The commercial card
tends to be used not just domestically but also cross-border just by nature of the kind of book it aims at. So it's kind of
mix of everything inside there.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn E. Greene>: Thank you. Good morning. I want to go back to maybe Martina for the pricing, just to clarify
the impact in the quarter and going forward, and I realize I guess there was the four-point benefit in the cross-border,
which I guess was a little bit more than I would've thought. But I think, more importantly, just to sort of make sure
we're all on the same page for the back half, are we fully anniversaried on the cross-border going into 3Q? And should
the delta on volume and revenue growth be something like maybe five points lower on revenue growth than volume
growth going into the back half? Is that the right way to think about it?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So first of all, we have, yes, the pricing was pretty much in cross-border. I called out
the 4 ppt. That was much lower than what you saw in the first quarter, and the first quarter in that line item was actually
10 ppt. And yes, that is anniversarying in the third quarter, so you are not going to see that going forward. And then
there was a little bit, as I said, from a transaction processing fee point of view. But with you look at the overall net
revenues and you extrapolate those line items to overall net revenue, overall pricing in the quarter actually was a
relatively small, very small contributor. And how you should be thinking about that is all of these thoughts that we have
about pricing roll into what we are saying about 2014, what we see from a net revenue point of view, as well as roll into
our long-term performance targets. That's where we're wrapping it into.
<Q - Glenn E. Greene>: Yeah. I was thinking more about, you've had a delta on the volume and revenue growth
negatively because of the strong intra-European volumes?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes, and you're going to continue to see that, likely, just because when you see the
growth of the intra-versus the inter-regional volume developing. So Europeans – and, in fact, it was a little bit even a
change when you look versus the year-ago volumes. Europeans are staying closer to home both it looks like from a
pleasure point-of-view, as well as from a business point-of-view. And as long as they stay closer to home, our

European cross-border transactions are priced lower than the inter-regional transactions. So that's where the mix is
coming in, and the relative growth of inter-regional versus intra-European numbers impacting this mix, I don't see that
changing for at least a number of quarters to come.
<Q - Glenn E. Greene>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Let me add something. It's just really interesting, if you go beyond this a little bit and to
understand what's going on with the European's, for example, or others one of the – if you look at all of our data on
which are the hottest travel places around the world you've got London, you've got Bangkok, you've got Paris and cities
like that. If you look at that data, tourism into Southeast Asia has been impacted over the last six, eight months because
you've had some unrest in Thailand, you've got problems in Vietnam with the Chinese situation. You've got people
canceling trips into that part of the world. It's similar – into a place like Russia for all of the obvious reasons that we've
been talking about.
So what's happening also, I think, in this last quarter or two is that people are staying closer to where they're
comfortable. And the Europeans, in particular, are relatively intrepid travelers outside. They have been – and they
travel frequently. They take a few holidays a year, in case you sort of look at how many holidays the Europeans do get
in the course of the year, they have cut back as – Martina's laughing at me. She's half German, half French, so they take
the most holidays in the world.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: [Laughter]
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: But the fact is that if you sort of look at what's going on there, there is a genuine
difference right now in the way people are traveling. There just is. And that's in addition to what's going on with China,
where you can see the impact of a change in policies and growth on the ground to what's happening to cross-border
volume and trade outside of China. So this is something we've seen.
Having said that, I think we have a pretty strong transaction growth rate in our cross-border and we do a lot of work to
make that happen, both from share but also the kind of work we do with issuers and merchants to make that work the
right way.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Christine, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator
Okay. Our last question then is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you. Good morning. Martina, did I hear you suggest a tax inversion?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: [Laughter]
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: But my real question was on...
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Not really. But we'd like to align our tax footprint to our business structure, given that
most of our revenues and profits are still rolling up into the U.S. and into Belgium, which are high tax countries, but
60% of our business is really in many other jurisdictions.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Right. Okay. But my real question was...
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: No tax inversions. No tax inversions.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: With the changes in technology and with EMV a higher focus on security, do you think that –
has MasterCard benefited? Do you think you're gaining some market share head-to-head when it comes down to a
bigger focus on technology?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: I don't know. I do know that we've put a lot of effort in the space on both innovation and
technology. Look at MasterPass. I consider MasterPass to be – the wallet part of it and there's more to come. As I said,

it's a full platform. The fact that we're live in more countries and we've actually got tens of thousands of merchants
signed up; that we've got some momentum on the ground in terms of MasterPass being both an online, an in-app and a
physical space player; and the fact that it was designed in a way that allows banks and merchants to integrate very
easily, much easier than many competing wallets; all of that's helping us when we go to sell. The focus on security is
helping us when we go to sell.
But I don't know that I could pick one of those and tell you that a client, a merchant or a bank or a government is
turning business to me just because of that. I actually don't think that anybody thinks so – in such a single patterned
way. It's always a very complicated discussion. It always has pricing built into it, as you know, but it also always has
all these other aspects. And I think all I'm trying to do in the company what we're doing is to assemble a portfolio of
assets, be it the security part, the EMV part, the innovation part, the loyalty and rewards, the processing, that's why
you're seeing us invest in those areas. That's where our organic and inorganic money is going. It's going into those very
specific areas because we think they help us build a portfolio to go talk with and that's what we're trying to do.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you.

All set? Last question done? Back to me. Okay. Closing remarks, I guess.
We delivered strong results for the first half of 2014 in spite of this mixed economic environment, and we are focused
on delivering yet another good year. We will work through the regulatory challenges in Russia and Europe. We've got a
track record of managing through these situations in other markets. Every situation is different, but we manage our
way. We feel confident we will be able to navigate our way through these most recent ones as well. And on the other
side of this, we see many opportunities around world, and that kind of provide some balances to these challenges we
talk about.
We're investing in new technology, as I was just telling Bob, and other services, both organically and through
acquisitions including our recent transactions in the loyalty, processing, person-to-person and mobile spaces. As
Martina mentioned, that pace of M&A activity has accelerated recently. There's no shortage of growth opportunities in
our business, frankly, and while our investments are having an impact around OpEx right now, we believe that we are
investing in a thoughtful way that ensures continued top line growth and good long-term return for all of you who
invest in our stock.
I'm hoping many of you will be able to join us at one of our investor days in September, either in St. Louis or in Dublin
where' you'll have a chance to hear more about our strategic focus areas and get to touch and feel some of our
innovative products and services. Thank you for your continued support to the company, and thank you for being on
our call today.
